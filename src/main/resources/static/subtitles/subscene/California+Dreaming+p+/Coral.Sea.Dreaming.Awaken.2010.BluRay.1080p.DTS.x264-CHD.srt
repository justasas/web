1
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,565
It is November.

2
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,567
A full moon rises.

3
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:32,115
Almost 400,000 kilometers away,
Planet Earth falls under its spell.

4
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,581
Our oceans stir.

5
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,377
An ancient undersea ritual
is underway.

6
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,734
The outcome of this event

7
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,821
will not only affect marine life
in the surrounding waters,

8
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,781
but will also give us a clue

9
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,159
about the health
of the entire ocean system.

10
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,457
The creature responsible is coral.

11
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,044
And this is coral's story.

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,550
The story begins here,

13
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,554
with the incredible phenomenon
that is mass coral spawning.

14
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,642
It's an annual event,
cued by the sun and the moon.

15
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,354
It involves
over 140 different species,

16
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,816
and has been occurring
for thousands of years.

17
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,779
Although corals
have no brain and no eyes,

18
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,158
somehow individual species
spawn together,

19
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,994
sometimes down to the minute.

20
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,209
Like tiny love-letters,

21
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,796
the genetic material
is cast into the ocean currents,

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,467
connecting reefs
over hundreds of kilometers.

23
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,896
Like us, corals take up to
nine months to prepare for birth.

24
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:31,777
But many are hermaphrodites,
so they gestate both egg and sperm.

25
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,029
On spawning night,

26
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:38,742
these are grouped into bundles and
delivered through the coral's mouth.

27
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,163
For most, it's a gentle birth.

28
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,394
Over a short time-span,
the bundles break apart

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,399
and the egg and sperm must find their
counterparts from another colony.

30
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,904
Billions set forth, but few survive.

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,453
Many other creatures
choose the same conditions to spawn

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,539
and the reef waters are transformed

33
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:30,585
into a vast liquid womb,
clouded with eggs and sperm.

34
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,096
Mass spawning
overwhelms potential predators,

35
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:46,893
so the coral eggs have more chance to
be fertilized and begin a new colony.

36
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:53,817
By daybreak, vast slicks
on the surface mark their passage.

37
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,785
Coral is an architect
not only of the undersea world,

38
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,787
but above the surface too.

39
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,789
Dead coral breaks down into sand

40
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:12,043
that eventually builds up
to create coral cays.

41
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,013
These shores and shallows
provide sanctuary -

42
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,851
and important breeding grounds -
for a variety of other creatures.

43
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:50,165
All told, reef-building corals
have colonized every tropical ocean,

44
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,002
shaped and protected
thousands of kilometers of coastline

45
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,799
and influenced marine evolution
for millions of years.

46
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,726
Birds like these noddy terns

47
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:14,815
rely on coral reefs for food
and coral cays for shelter.

48
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,030
Birds help vegetate cays
by depositing seeds.

49
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,700
These seeds grow
into trees and forests

50
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,830
which in turn provide the birds
with nesting sites.

51
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,518
These sandy outposts are frequented
by many tropical seabirds,

52
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:57,023
with some pairs returning to the same
nesting sites year after year.

53
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:11,580
Primitive corals date back
over 450 million years.

54
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:17,210
Modern reef-building corals first
emerged around 250 million years ago

55
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,672
and their reefs
have provided homes and sustenance

56
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,508
for innumerable species ever since.

57
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,058
Over coral's long history, five
mass extinctions have come and gone.

58
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,938
During each,
up to 90% of all life-forms perished.

59
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,859
Two of these extinctions

60
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,362
occurred during the rise
of modern reef-building corals.

61
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:49,492
Rather than falter,
they somehow survived,

62
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,411
rebuilt their reefs

63
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,664
and transformed the oceans anew.

64
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,797
Today, coral reef ecosystems
are important nursery grounds

65
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,427
for many iconic marine animals,
such as the sea turtle.

66
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,930
There are seven species
of sea turtle

67
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,475
and all are long-lived
and slow-growing.

68
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:19,397
They take between l 0 to 30 years
to sexually mature and mate at sea.

69
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,567
These marine reptiles are nomadic

70
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,862
and swim thousands of kilometers
during their lives.

71
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:30,241
But strong instinct and
mysterious natural forces guide them,

72
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,161
so that when a female
needs to lay her eggs,

73
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:38,708
she returns to the very beach
where she was born to do so.

74
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:46,007
Here, she digs a nest
and coral sand becomes the womb.

75
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,055
Hundreds hatch, but only one or two
will make it to adulthood.

76
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,642
They can then live
for up to a century.

77
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,610
When a turtle hatched 100 years ago,

78
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:10,115
it would have seen the world's
coral reefs in all their glory.

79
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,660
Pre-industrial seas
were clean and clear

80
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,248
and corals had enjoyed good
conditions for millions of years.

81
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,584
Throughout the Indian
and Pacific oceans,

82
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,087
and into the Caribbean
and west Atlantic,

83
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,172
reefs were thriving.

84
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,306
The turtle spent its youth
exploring these reefs

85
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,060
and witnessed the engineering marvel
that is coral.

86
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,315
By harnessing the power of the sun
and perfecting recycling,

87
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:49,696
coral built energy-efficient cities
that put many of ours to shame.

88
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,783
Collectively,
these cities created vast empires,

89
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,619
some visible from outer space.

90
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,588
Here, the turtle found itself
in great company,

91
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:12,469
for these undersea empires were home
to vast numbers of marine species

92
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,056
of every imaginable shape and size

93
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,142
and were crowded, colorful places.

94
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:30,111
Today, reefs have one of the
highest levels of biodiversity

95
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,113
of any ecosystem

96
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,743
and are some of the most biologically
important places on Earth.

97
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,628
Together, turtles and corals
have witnessed many changes

98
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,880
to their watery world.

99
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,049
They are some of the only beings

100
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,385
to have survived
the last mass extinction event

101
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,222
65 million years ago.

102
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,226
Scientists predict
that in the coming century,

103
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,228
they will face ocean conditions

104
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,981
as catastrophic
as during that last extinction.

105
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:12,028
Wise old turtles have seen
the warning signs for a while.

106
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,786
70% of the world's reefs
have already been destroyed

107
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,038
or are seriously threatened.

108
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,711
And all but one
of the seven sea turtle species

109
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,549
are classified 'endangered'
or 'critically endangered'.

110
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,803
For the first time
in millions of years,

111
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,099
the future of both turtle and coral
is uncertain.

112
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,656
Many things affect
the health of coral reefs,

113
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:02,078
in particular, sea temperature,
sea level and water chemistry.

114
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,376
Reefs may look mighty,
but corals themselves are fragile

115
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:13,006
and can be fatally harmed by just
subtle changes in their environment.

116
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,971
When sea levels rise too rapidly,
corals can't grow fast enough

117
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,307
and reefs drown.

118
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,602
As atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels increase,

119
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:30,815
ocean acidification intensifies
and reefs will dissolve.

120
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:42,619
And a sustained increase of only
1-2 degrees in ocean temperature

121
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,663
can cause corals to bleach and die.

122
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,210
By the end of this century,
it's predicted that the global climate

123
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,963
could be 5 degrees Celsius hotter
or more.

124
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,052
At this rate, bleaching
will become an annual occurrence,

125
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:03,306
and this colorful landscape
will literally fade away.

126
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,420
A healthy coral reef
is easy to spot.

127
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:41,386
A complex structure awash
with color, variety and activity.

128
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:01,990
This is a tangled, tropical garden
to rival anything on land.

129
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,370
Most amazing about this garden

130
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,791
is that many of the 'plants'
are actually animals.

131
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,587
Like grasping hands,

132
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,341
coral mouths hungrily sift
the passing currents for food

133
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,010
day and night.

134
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,149
The creature we call 'coral'
is a primitive sac-like polyp,

135
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,484
part animal, part plant.

136
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,279
The animal part feeds on plankton.

137
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,699
The plant part
consists of microscopic algae -

138
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:49,495
called zooxanthellaethat
photosynthesize using sunlight.

139
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,041
Each polyp is connected
to its neighbor

140
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,544
passing along energy and nutrients.

141
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,006
These polyps multiply
to create colonies,

142
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,967
which combine to form reefs.

143
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:10,767
In this way, energy is produced,
shared and recycled

144
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,561
throughout the entire ecosystem.

145
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,035
With the energy they produce,
corals not only thrive

146
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,163
but also manufacture
calcium carbonate,

147
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,625
the special 'concrete'
that builds reefs.

148
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:40,213
This is one secret
behind corals' great empire building.

149
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,216
The other is budding.

150
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,968
Budding is a process
where coral polyps produce

151
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,013
genetically identical copies
of themselves

152
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,392
and extend their colonies
without spawning.

153
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:05,196
The calcium carbonate foundation
secreted by hard corals

154
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,282
can be one kilometer thick in p laces

155
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,868
and hundreds of thousands
of years old.

156
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:16,332
The living reef we see today
is just a thin veneer on top,

157
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,168
made up of many different species,

158
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,587
including soft corals...

159
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,053
...fan corals...

160
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,772
...and sponges,
gorgonians and crinoids.

161
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,488
All told, coral has evolved into
more than 1,000 hard coral species

162
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,074
and over 700 soft coral s,

163
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,412
each perfectly specialized
to fill its own niche.

164
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,131
Understanding how corals build reefs

165
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,800
highlights the seriousness
of climate change

166
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,095
and how it threatens
this complex ecosystem.

167
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,852
Our oceans have always absorbed
atmospheric CO2 like a giant sponge.

168
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:23,107
But now those levels are so high that
the water chemistry is changing -

169
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:27,195
a process referred to
as 'ocean acidification'.

170
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,906
Alkalinity is falling

171
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,452
and naturally-occurring
carbonate ions are being affected.

172
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:39,040
Many marine creatures need these ions
to produce calcium carbonate

173
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,918
for their shells and skeletons.

174
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,881
Hard corals need them to build reefs.

175
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:53,846
Ocean acidification seriously
threatens all these processes.

176
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:03,356
But in every natural catastrophe,
there are winners and losers.

177
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,151
Jellyfish
are distant relatives of coral,

178
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,820
but unlike coral,
they are more adaptable

179
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,574
to changes in water temperature
and chemistry.

180
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,203
Their numbers
are already on the rise.

181
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,957
And they are making our seas sting.

182
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,716
Coral's other ancient cousin
is the sea anemone.

183
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,176
Like coral,

184
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:36,055
the anemone is a simple being
that has been highly successful.

185
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,977
In fact, the anemone
is like a huge coral polyp.

186
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,104
At its center is a mouth

187
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,774
surrounded by a vast mantle
of stinging tentacles.

188
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:51,404
Within the mouth is a big stomach
filled with acidic enzymes.

189
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:56,284
Because the anemone does not have
a solid physical structure or skeleton,

190
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,995
it does not rely
on calcium carbonate,

191
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,040
so it's not as vulnerable as coral
to ocean acidification.

192
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:08,087
But, like coral some species
possess zooxanthellae algae

193
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:12,383
and warming seas
will also cause them to bleach.

194
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,018
There are over 800 species
of sea anemone.

195
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,146
10 are suitable homes
for anemone fish

196
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,400
and this is one of the reef's
most marvelous partnerships.

197
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,989
The anemone's tentacles
normally sting invaders.

198
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,492
But these fish are coated
with a protective mucus

199
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,621
and can dance in and out unharmed.

200
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,833
The fish rarely wander
more than a meter away.

201
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,294
Everything they need is right here -

202
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,048
scraps of food,
protection and community.

203
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,724
Not surprisingly,

204
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,353
the fish lay their eggs near
the protective folds of the anemone,

205
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,106
aerating and defending them
until they hatch.

206
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:32,213
And being stuck in one place
hasn't harmed their sex life.

207
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,840
In fact, it's enhanced it.

208
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,723
To keep everyone satisfied,
they've mastered sex change.

209
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,480
If a dominant female is required,
a male can change sex.

210
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,482
If a dominant male is needed,

211
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,403
a subordinate male
accelerates into sexual maturity.

212
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:08,040
As ocean conditions change, anemone
fish seem more protected than most,

213
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,793
safe within those stinging arms.

214
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,093
But even they are not immune
from danger.

215
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,514
All fish have internal structures
and organs

216
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,809
which may be weakened
by ocean acidification.

217
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,149
Even now, scientists are finding

218
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,068
that the ear bones of fish
are being affected,

219
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,071
which is impacting
the way they communicate.

220
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,745
If ocean acidification
goes unchecked,

221
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:51,333
it may affect key metabolic processes
for all marine animals.

222
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,135
Whenever conditions
get more challenging,

223
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:05,765
the natural process of selection
just gets more ruthless.

224
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,019
Those that cannot cope
will be quickly cast aside.

225
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,315
Every citizen must earn its keep.

226
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,742
These shrimp gather in locations
referred to as 'cleaning stations'.

227
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,663
This particular station also happens
to be the home of a moray eel.

228
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,167
But the shrimp aren't running away.

229
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,629
If anything,
they're competing to get closer.

230
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,508
And although the eel
finds the shrimp irritating,

231
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,052
he just grins and bears it.

232
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,559
The reason why
these entirely different species

233
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,019
tolerate one another

234
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,105
is because they have
an unspoken agreement.

235
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,027
The shrimp has the important job
of removing parasites

236
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,571
as well as dying or dead flesh.

237
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,783
These can be fatal to the moray,

238
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,411
but provide a delicious banquet
for the shrimp.

239
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:19,129
Animals are engaged in complex
relationships right across the reef.

240
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,133
Going solo is risky business.

241
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,096
And if you're going to attempt it,
you'd better be very clever.

242
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,892
One clever survival tactic
is camouflage.

243
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:37,439
Decorator crabs attach tiny sponges,
corals and anemones to their shells

244
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,860
and look more like walking flowerbeds
than animals.

245
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:47,825
Others attempt to go incognito by
placing toxic sponges on their heads,

246
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,412
like these aptly-named
hat-carrying crabs.

247
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,043
Sponges are living creatures,
but the crab doesn't care,

248
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,255
cutting the sponge up
into whatever size fits.

249
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,135
Other crabs collect forest leaves

250
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:10,598
and use them for disguise
and as hang-gliders.

251
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,566
Boxer crabs
are always ready for a fight,

252
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,069
with tiny poisonous anemones
as boxing gloves.

253
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,701
Hermit crabs reinforce their own body
armor by wearing second-hand shells.

254
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:32,995
Bigger shells must be found

255
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,622
as the crab grows

256
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:39,001
and this gives the crab lots of time
to develop its own unique look.

257
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,425
More sophisticated hermit crabs
collect stinging anemones

258
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,470
and will remove these anemones
and reattach them

259
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,181
whenever they change shells.

260
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:08,656
Crabs date back to Jurassic times
200 million years ago

261
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,117
and over 10,000 species exist.

262
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:17,373
They're hardy souls - even missing
half their legs won't slow them down.

263
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,793
And they're great opportunists -

264
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,129
some feasting inside
a sea cucumber's mouth.

265
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:31,011
Sea cucumbers have some remarkable
physical adaptations themselves.

266
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,180
They breathe through their rear end,

267
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,183
move on hydraulically-powered
tube feet,

268
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,019
and have a special collagen
in their body wall

269
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,231
that enables them
to radically change shape.

270
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,860
They also spawn from their forehead.

271
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,456
Sea cucumbers
have few natural predators.

272
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:04,169
So it's no wonder they're a popular
taxi ride for crabs and shrimp.

273
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,173
Because the sea cucumber
stirs up food with its front end,

274
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,218
there's even a free meal
as part of the ticket.

275
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,642
Nudibranchs
are also great to hitchhike.

276
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,936
These highly poisonous sea slugs

277
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:25,482
offer guaranteed safe passage
through dangerous open territory,

278
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,152
with the shrimps
scavenging on the run.

279
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,321
But for first-class travel,

280
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,950
nothing compares
to a jet-propelled jellyfish.

281
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,426
Magic carpets also glide above
the reef, in the form of flatworms.

282
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,433
Flatworms and nudibranchs
don't have shells,

283
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,728
so draw on chemical warfare
as defense.

284
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,606
Some eat toxic hydroids and anemones

285
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,317
and sequester poison in their skin,

286
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:12,404
which in turn makes them poisonous
to any potential predator.

287
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:18,160
They advertise their toxicity with
bright, bold colors and patterns,

288
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:22,372
which have conspired to make them
incredibly beautiful.

289
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,688
They are as wild in character
as they are in appearance.

290
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,484
They have gills on their backs,
sex organs on their sides

291
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,445
and all of them are hermaphrodites.

292
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,909
And some are fierce cannibals.

293
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:06,083
Trying to eat your lover during sex
is not quite acceptable,

294
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,294
but snacking on a cousin is fine.

295
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:26,228
Joining the sea slugs on
the ocean's floor are the sea stars.

296
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,863
Sea stars are often referred to
as starfish,

297
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,116
but they're not fish at all,
they're echinoderms.

298
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,830
Echinoderms date back
over 500 million years,

299
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,791
so predate the evolution of coral.

300
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,128
They have evolved
into a wide range of life forms

301
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,756
and what many have in common
is the spine.

302
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,012
Urchins are some of
the most heavily spined of all,

303
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,100
but for some color-coordinated crabs
and shrimp, this isn't a deterrent.

304
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,353
They've adapted
to live amongst the spines

305
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,814
and remain there all their lives.

306
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:18,614
It's a classic case of symbiosis
on a reef and worlds within worlds.

307
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:33,295
Tropical oceans are like vast blue
deserts and largely nutrient poor.

308
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,590
On coral reefs,
nothing goes to waste.

309
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,551
Various specialist filter feeders
have evolved

310
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,887
to sift the passing currents -

311
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:47,392
capturing, digesting and recycling
every available bit of food.

312
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:58,737
Worms are among the most numerous
and diverse of all filter feeders.

313
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,823
20,000 marine species exist

314
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,328
and, unlike the earth worms,
they're an exotic bunch.

315
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,998
Befitting their name,

316
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,294
Christmas-tree worms unfurl
festive, feathery mouth parts,

317
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,047
which they use like tiny nets.

318
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:21,301
Their bodies, meanwhile, are buried
in the coral and rarely seen.

319
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,274
Equally shy are ribbon eels.

320
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,527
They spend most of their time
concealed in deep burrows,

321
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,904
with just their heads peeking out.

322
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,240
They're relatives of moray eels

323
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,034
and their gaping mouths
make them look aggressive.

324
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,577
But they're simply breathing,

325
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,206
with their exaggerated nostrils
sniffing for food.

326
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,174
Adopting the same lifestyle
are garden eels.

327
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:12,102
These delicate sea serpents rise
from the sand in vast communities,

328
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,981
performing their hypnotic
Indian snake dance.

329
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,823
Ever watchful for predators,

330
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,410
they nervously pluck plankton
from passing currents,

331
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,163
their tails anchoring them down.

332
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,715
Because of corals/ longevity
on our planet

333
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,676
they're considered
our living fossils.

334
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:50,432
Another living fossil
still with us today is the nautilus.

335
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,312
It's an ancient mollusk, whose
line eventually dropped its shell...

336
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:02,277
...and gave rise
to the age of the cephalopods.

337
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,325
Cephalopods
are synonymous with the reef

338
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:12,037
and one of the most intriguing
is the mimic octopus.

339
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,584
As its name implies,

340
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:21,546
the octopus mimics
the physical likeness and movements

341
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,424
of more than 15 different species,

342
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:30,931
including sea snakes, lionfish,
flounder and ghost crabs.

343
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,477
It's one of nature's
great contortionists.

344
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:39,564
If it doesn't want to be seen,
it certainly won't be.

345
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,540
Many species of octopus
live in the vicinity of reefs

346
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,626
and a true reef specialist is this -

347
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,878
the day octopus.

348
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:10,512
These octopus are great hunters
and fish hurry to defend their eggs.

349
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,764
And being so tasty themselves,

350
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,144
octopus have had to develop
excellent martial arts skills.

351
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,364
They have the most complex brain
of any invertebrate

352
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,660
and can process information
from all eight arms at once.

353
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,126
They have short
as well as long-term memory

354
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:45,630
and possess a special way
to communicate with their skin.

355
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,896
They're also highly interactive
and tactile.

356
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,648
Courtship rituals can last for hours,

357
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:08,945
with couples intertwining all 16 arms
in a sticky embrace.

358
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,709
Once they mate,
their bodies are programmed to die.

359
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:27,047
For some species, this means
a lifespan of just 6 months.

360
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,050
For others, up to 5 years.

361
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,642
Cousin of the octopus is the squid,

362
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:43,021
seen here delicately laying eggs
in forest fronds.

363
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,400
We know squid more commonly
as calamari,

364
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,779
but despite being a favored delicacy
around the world,

365
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,865
many species
are increasing in number.

366
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,659
Like other cephalopods,

367
00:33:55,825 --> 00:34:00,205
they're making the most of oceans
depleted of natural predators

368
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:04,167
and seem more resilient than others
to changing water conditions.

369
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,800
Another charismatic member
of the family is the cuttlefish.

370
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,970
These creatures
have magical attributes.

371
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:19,349
On the outside,
large eyes as expressive as our own.

372
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,353
On the inside,
three hearts that pump blue blood.

373
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,858
During their breeding season,
they gather in small groups,

374
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,445
zooming amongst one another
like miniature spaceships.

375
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,614
Masters of jet propulsion,

376
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,785
they can move backwards, forwards
or sideways with equal ease.

377
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,331
Every year they return
to favorite nesting sites,

378
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,084
like this colony
of venomous fire coral.

379
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,426
Males use dramatic body displays
and postures

380
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,720
to compete for mating rights.

381
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,640
So although competition is intense,
it's rarely physical.

382
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,563
Clutching her brood of eggs
in her mouth,

383
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,942
a female surrenders her young
to the care of coral.

384
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,508
The flamboyant cuttlefish
is one of the tiniest cephalopods,

385
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,053
yet lives up to its name.

386
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,849
Its cuttlebone is too small to float,
so it walks more than swims.

387
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:47,646
And it has a highly poisonous flesh,
advertised by its pulsing skin.

388
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,525
It's also a deadly predator.

389
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,780
Two specialized tentacles are
contained within a muscular sleeve,

390
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,907
which is launched like a spear.

391
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:14,005
With this kind of hunting prowess,
it's no wonder

392
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,342
the cephalopods have been
such a success story on the reef

393
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:22,263
and will no doubt
rule the seabed for eons to come.

394
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,412
Reefs are not only important
to their permanent residents,

395
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,581
but also to many oceanic visitors.

396
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:53,294
Strong currents and rich upwellings
of food often occur around reefs

397
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,673
and attract nomads such as rays.

398
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:10,979
In fact, the total number of marine
creatures dependent on coral reefs

399
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,106
is immeasurable.

400
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:20,363
Perhaps as many as
seven million species coexist here.

401
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:45,263
Over 4,000 species of tropical fish
are associated with coral reefs,

402
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:50,310
of which 75% depend on the reef
for their survival.

403
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,533
They may look
like just colorful confetti,

404
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,870
but each fish is its own individual.

405
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:14,959
Fish can smell, hear, see and touch.

406
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,713
They feel pain
and have complex relationships.

407
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,761
The vast majority of reef fish
have defined home ranges.

408
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:32,101
The reef sustains them, houses them
and conceals them from predators.

409
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,780
Like tiny kites on invisible strings,

410
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,991
the fish hover above
their beloved reefs,

411
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,286
venturing only far enough
to snatch a meal,

412
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,164
but otherwise inseparable.

413
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,945
The connection between fish and coral

414
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,949
is one of nature's
most enduring love stories.

415
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:35,290
Humans too benefit from
a healthy relationship with coral

416
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,458
and the seas at large.

417
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,424
Reefs create barriers to the sea
and protect shorelines.

418
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:52,515
Various life-saving medicines
are extracted from reefs.

419
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:56,978
Ocean-derived chemicals
are used to treat many illnesses,

420
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,938
including cancer.

421
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:07,864
Microscopic marine algae
processes our atmospheric CO2

422
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:12,327
and produces 70%
of the oxygen we breathe.

423
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:20,001
So, like these fish,
we need healthy oceans to survive

424
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,254
and reefs to secure our homes.

425
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,543
In both our terrestrial world
and the undersea,

426
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,131
there have been constant cycles
of creation and destruction.

427
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,468
The rule of nature is chaos.

428
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,679
Although a reef looks harmonious,

429
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,015
it's as chaotic
as any other ecosystem.

430
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,726
And one of the ways
to survive chaos,

431
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,312
whether you're above
or below the surface,

432
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,398
is to cooperate.

433
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,402
This cooperation
is called symbiosis,

434
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,904
a mutually beneficial relationship

435
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,949
between two
entirely different species.

436
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:40,915
These little blue and black striped
wrasse would be perfect fish food

437
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,835
if they hadn't made themselves
so useful.

438
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,756
They're cleaner wrasse
and earn their keep by cleaning.

439
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,134
So vital is this service

440
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,304
that none of their grateful hosts
would ever dare to eat them.

441
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,397
Both parties benefit
and a form of balance is achieved.

442
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,779
There is constant tension on the reef

443
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,449
as different species
work out this balance

444
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,745
and try to maximize
their moment in history.

445
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,959
For some of the bigger fish,

446
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,838
that moment
used to stretch into decades.

447
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,674
Some even lived
for a century or more.

448
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,846
But old age is a rarity now

449
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:41,100
and iconic reef species
are vanishing even as we watch.

450
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,200
Angelfish live
for l 0 to 15 years in the wild

451
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,412
and are some of the reef's
most recognizable species.

452
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,539
They are highly prized by collectors

453
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:08,753
and, tragically, many live out
their long lives in aquaria.

454
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,715
A fish in a tank
is like a bird in a cage -

455
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:17,095
we're able to observe them
but we get little idea of their wildness.

456
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,722
It's only here, on the reef,

457
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:25,061
that we can truly appreciate just
how complex a fish's life can be.

458
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,905
Some angelfish are promiscuous,

459
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,824
some bond for life,

460
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,660
others have male-driven harems.

461
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:45,414
And many fish, including these
delicate leafed scorpionfish,

462
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,501
engage in long courtship rituals.

463
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,048
New species of fish
are discovered every week,

464
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:58,386
and with each discovery
comes a wealth of new information.

465
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,056
Some spawn daily,

466
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:06,644
others do not begin breeding
until they are 20 or 30 years old.

467
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,899
Many start life as a male
but die a female.

468
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,736
Most are highly social

469
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,073
and have intelligence
beyond our comprehension.

470
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,877
Like wildebeest and zebra
on the African plains,

471
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,881
tangs and parrotfish
often graze together.

472
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,757
Both fish are herbivores

473
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,303
and dine on algae
and even live coral.

474
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,432
Other species converge
on the reef crest.

475
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,895
This area is exposed to wave action
and lots of sunlight

476
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,147
and is rich in nutrients.

477
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,357
Fish like this rock-mover wrasse

478
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,278
literally move rocks in the search
of worms and mollusks.

479
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,864
Dining this way is hard work,

480
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,700
and they're not always willing
to share their patch.

481
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:10,791
Others excavate the substrate
and swallow large mouthfuls of sand.

482
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,837
Their bodies are specially designed
to filter the sand for algae,

483
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,757
dispelling waste through their gills.

484
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,473
Access to the reef crest is limited.

485
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,893
It's only at certain tides
and during calm seas

486
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,354
that it's possible to feed here.

487
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,192
When all the conditions are right,

488
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:41,447
fish arrive from miles around to take
advantage of this rare opportunity.

489
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:46,035
Some are in couples,
others dine alone,

490
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:50,039
and completely different species
feed side by side.

491
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,001
It's biodiversity at its best.

492
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,525
Eccentric earth-movers,
like triggerfish,

493
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,443
also join the dinner party.

494
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,781
They use their powerful beaks
to cast aside whole chunks of coral,

495
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,616
as they search for clams,

496
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,868
shrimp and crabs.

497
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,082
They're much too busy to worry
about their table manners.

498
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,597
Like a human city,

499
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,392
a reef boasts
an eclectic jumble of characters

500
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,687
conducting themselves
in a variety of ways.

501
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:01,319
There are loners and drifters.

502
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,952
There are clandestine meetings

503
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,455
and underground movements.

504
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,834
There are the watchful and the wary.

505
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,548
And different forms
of self-expression.

506
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:46,322
As in all of our cities,
strange alliances occur...

507
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,872
...and odd fashion is tolerated.

508
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:03,005
Every beauty and beast
has its place.

509
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:23,401
Just like the terrestrial world,
a reef has a 24-hour cycle.

510
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,239
As the afternoon light
begins to fade,

511
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,659
fish, like these anthias,
spawn with abandon,

512
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,869
knowing that night
will soon follow

513
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,996
and conceal their eggs.

514
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,709
Meanwhile, tiny fish
shudder their bodies,

515
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,045
indicating their readiness to mate.

516
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,760
And countless other daytime fish
are inspired by the waning light

517
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,971
to court or breed.

518
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:06,861
Here, a pair of flutemouths
engage in a seductive sword dance.

519
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,113
It's their form of foreplay,

520
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,490
and they've been at it for hours.

521
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,458
Over the millennia,
the battle between predator and prey

522
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,295
has fueled an evolutionary arms race
under the sea.

523
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,507
Mother Nature is always
updating her designs

524
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,801
and making old ones redundant.

525
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,679
Animals have had to constantly refine

526
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:37,266
their offensive
and defensive capabilities.

527
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:41,020
The result
can be pure science fiction.

528
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:54,074
Angler and scorpion fish
are as bizarre as they come.

529
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,535
They're expert mimics of sponges,

530
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,288
but have one of the fastest strikes
on Earth.

531
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,171
But they're certainly
not out to win a beauty prize.

532
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:11,634
When it comes to some of these
creations, love is certainly blind.

533
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:29,485
This myriad life has enthralled us
since the beginning of human history.

534
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,279
We did originally evolve
from the sea.

535
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,324
And ever since early humans
first emerged,

536
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:38,702
we've been drawn back to its shores.

537
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,247
Seafood has been a favored diet.

538
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,333
Shells have been our money
and jewelry.

539
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,673
Coral limestone paves our roads.

540
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,925
Sand cements our houses.

541
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,011
Our myths and legends,
books and films

542
00:50:56,178 --> 00:51:00,099
are all full of characters
derived from the sea.

543
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:09,900
And as light fades,
these characters begin to change

544
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:14,613
and the story of coral moves
into a very different narrative.

545
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:24,999
Big predatory fish cruise the reef's
edge, searching for a final kill.

546
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,634
Daytime fish hurry into hiding.

547
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,805
This is a dangerous time
of transition.

548
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:43,767
All across the reef,
there is a changing of the guard.

549
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,781
The night shift has begun.

550
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,962
Little is known about our oceans.

551
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,798
The surface of Mars is better mapped.

552
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:25,601
Most living coral reefs
descend to only 50 meters or so,

553
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,270
due to the reliance on sunlight.

554
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:35,110
But the seafloor
falls to 11 kilometers in places.

555
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,405
This is what we call the abyss.

556
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,119
Night-time on the reef
gives us a sense

557
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,705
of what this abyss might be like.

558
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:54,838
The inky black is very much alive
and full of aliens.

559
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:05,182
In special places
where reefs drop to great depth,

560
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,726
deep sea plankton rise to the surface

561
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,896
to hunt shallow water phytoplankton.

562
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,233
They travel hundreds of meters.

563
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,402
They number in their billions

564
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,697
and they repeat the journey
every night.

565
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,742
It's one of the biggest migrations
in the animal kingdom.

566
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:33,043
The chase of plankton-hunter
and plankton-prey

567
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,965
triggers a larger chain reaction
right across the night-time reef.

568
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,012
Baitfish snatch mouthfuls,

569
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,974
while basking stars
emerge from their lairs

570
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,810
and extend web-like arms.

571
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,444
The water flashes with color

572
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,989
as the plankton frantically
communicate with one another.

573
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,204
Coral is not an idle bystander.

574
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,583
The reef has become a wall of mouths.

575
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,837
The true animal nature
of coral is revealed.

576
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,762
Equipped with poisonous harpoons
and acid,

577
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:30,350
each polyp becomes a deadly trap
from which escape is impossible.

578
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,317
Meanwhile, catfish eat on the run.

579
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:42,863
Parrotfish sleep
with eyes wide open

580
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,533
or conceal themselves
in mucus cocoons.

581
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,041
Without torches,
humans are blind at night.

582
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,503
Underwater,
we'd barely know up from down.

583
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,799
But the undersea hunters
are not at all disadvantaged.

584
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:07,513
Instead of sight, they use vibration,
electrical impulses

585
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,974
and chemical traces
to find what they're after.

586
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:29,159
Stone walls are, in fact,
living stonefish waiting in ambush...

587
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:37,084
...while the sharp teeth
of stargazers lurk beneath the muck.

588
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:50,973
It's easy to swim towards danger
without realizing it.

589
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,309
This anemone has become
a serial killer.

590
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:02,526
A lucky squid escapes, releasing ink
to cover its tracks.

591
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,444
A pipefish looks on,

592
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,990
as fish scatter and more fall victim.

593
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,041
Down on the seabed,

594
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,586
scavengers collect the scraps...

595
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:29,011
...while lionfish use their long spines
to herd unsuspecting prey.

596
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,357
There is activity in all directions,

597
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:46,737
as night hunters of every description
eat their fill.

598
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:56,288
The anglerfish is back
and now completely in its element.

599
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,123
It may not move with grace,

600
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,251
but that doesn't affect
its chances for a kill.

601
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:06,840
All it needs to do is wait for a meal
to come to its mouth.

602
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,803
When it comes to nocturnal hunting,

603
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,848
moray eels are known
for their viciousness.

604
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,851
But other killers
are not so easy to spot.

605
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:22,314
Mantis shrimp are sophisticated
and savage.

606
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,441
They're armed with supreme eyesight

607
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,693
and actively hunt live prey

608
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,446
while other crustaceans,
like lobsters,

609
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,324
scour the sea floor for leftovers.

610
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,167
With a busy time ahead,

611
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,504
day fish try to sleep
despite all the activity.

612
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,635
Some drifting
like ghosts in the dark.

613
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:05,273
The anemone fish are also trying to
sleep, but aren't finding it easy.

614
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:13,615
Their flat-mates, the dotted crabs,
are enjoying a midnight snack.

615
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,916
Some of the most active
night prowlers are shells.

616
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:28,130
Many of us only know them from
shell shops or dead on the beach.

617
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,800
But shells alive
are much more precious -

618
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:37,764
gypsy caravans, varnished by the
oceans, constantly on the move.

619
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,939
Darkness also suits
courting mandarin fish.

620
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,860
They have an unusually high
sex drive

621
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,238
and can spawn every night
if the urge takes them.

622
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,745
Although our underwater lights
give us a glimpse,

623
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:03,915
we still know very little about
what happens on a reef at night.

624
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:08,253
And our unwarranted fears
have made it harder to learn.

625
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,467
Our attitude to the sea
has been full of contradiction.

626
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,011
On the one hand we've revered it,

627
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:19,181
on the other
we've seen it as an enemy -

628
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:24,102
dark and unfathomable,
full of dragons and monsters.

629
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:29,024
These monsters of the deep

630
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:33,528
have long been proven figments
of our collective imagination.

631
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:38,575
But some believe they still exist
in the form of sharks.

632
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,660
How wrong they are.

633
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,415
These magnificent creatures
predate dinosaurs.

634
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:49,377
Like coral, they've survived
several mass extinctions

635
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:54,257
and have played an equally vital role
in shaping ocean evolution.

636
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:05,852
Sharks have been roaming our seas
for over 400 million years.

637
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:10,899
Fossil records show that thousands
of species have come and gone,

638
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:15,529
of which 370 are with us today.

639
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,823
They can be found worldwide,

640
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:23,036
with many dependent on coral reef
ecosystems for protection and food.

641
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:38,844
As top predators,

642
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,264
sharks have influenced adaptation
and evolution

643
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,891
all the way down the food chain.

644
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,813
But contrary to popular myth,

645
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,817
sharks are not just instinctive
eating machines.

646
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:59,656
Many species exhibit
powerful problem-solving skills

647
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:03,910
and their brain-to-body-mass ratio
is similar to many mammals

648
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,079
and other higher order vertebrates.

649
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,209
So they are as intelligent,
curious and social

650
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:14,379
as some of our more favored animals.

651
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:19,926
They not only possess
the 5 senses we do -

652
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,929
sight, hearing,
touch, smell and taste -

653
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,099
but can also perceive
electrical currents

654
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,226
and magnetic fields.

655
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,234
If we're in the water with them,

656
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:40,113
they can detect our presence
from miles away.

657
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,491
They can monitor
the beating of our heart...

658
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,328
...and read our mood.

659
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:11,311
When it comes to humans,
they are normally cautious creatures.

660
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,939
Whenever possible, they avoid us.

661
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,607
With good reason.

662
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,529
Every year,
over 100 million sharks are killed,

663
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,033
the majority just for their fins.

664
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,828
Their fins are a traditional
ingredient in Asian soup

665
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,539
and their value rivals caviar.

666
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,260
The sharks are often finned alive

667
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,471
and thrown back into the water
to drown.

668
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:59,276
One third of all open-ocean shark
species are now facing extinction,

669
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,362
primarily due to over-fishing.

670
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:10,662
So if there is a killing machine
in our seas, it's not them,

671
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,539
it's us.

672
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,261
No shark is safe,

673
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:29,139
not even the biggest of them all,
the whale shark.

674
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:36,271
Up to 15 meters long and 12 tons in
weight, they're an impressive sight.

675
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:40,775
But they're strictly filter feeders
and dine mostly on plankton.

676
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:48,033
Unbelievably, they are also victims
of illegal fishing.

677
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,001
Whale sharks are not actually whales
but sharks.

678
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:03,673
True whales that visit the reefs
include these, the minke.

679
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:15,060
Incredibly, these graceful animals
are still being harpooned.

680
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:20,357
What trust they show us, regardless.

681
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:36,790
Before we began to plunder the seas,
this is what they were like.

682
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,338
Linking the abyss with the surface,

683
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:47,384
layer upon layer
of shimmering silver.

684
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:17,539
A big school of fish
is a defining image of a healthy sea.

685
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,545
It's a show of strength and
incredible physiological adaptation.

686
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,258
Running head to tail in most fish

687
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,594
is a row of scales
known as the lateral line.

688
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,013
Connected to nerves in the brain,

689
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,766
this line consists
of specialized cells

690
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,687
that are sensitive
to water displacement and movement.

691
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,650
Meanwhile, fishes' eyes are located
on the sides of their heads

692
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:49,904
to make it easy to see where they are
in relation to one another.

693
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:56,494
So, vision helps maintain angle
and distance between fish,

694
01:05:56,661 --> 01:06:02,125
while the lateral line dictates speed
and direction of the entire school.

695
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,090
In this way,
many fish can move as one

696
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:13,470
and choreograph
their own aquatic ballet.

697
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,580
Many fish school as juveniles

698
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:43,958
and around half of all fish species
form aggregations

699
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,669
at some point in their lifecycle.

700
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:52,050
Even fish that prefer their solitude
join a school from time to time.

701
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:59,140
Barracuda hunt on their own at night

702
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:03,394
but hang out in packs during the day
for protection and company.

703
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,821
With their pointed heads
and streamlined bodies -

704
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,532
up to 2 meters long

705
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:19,953
they fly in unison through
the blue like polished arrows.

706
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:30,046
Schooling makes it hard for
a predator to focus on one target

707
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,091
and is a great defense mechanism.

708
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:38,638
It's also a force to be reckoned with
when it comes to feeding.

709
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:00,743
Few plankton in the area will escape
this sweep of open mouths,

710
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,665
as these rare filter-feeding mackerel
make their coordinated attack.

711
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:17,594
Over the eons, the art of schooling
has helped fish in many ways.

712
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:22,015
But now, ironically,
it contributes to their downfall.

713
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,854
Just one net can collect
a ton of fish at once.

714
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:32,734
And over 100 million tons of fish
are hauled from the oceans each year.

715
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,072
For the few big schools left,

716
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:44,078
it must feel quite eerie moving
through so much empty liquid blue.

717
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,051
These days, one of the only
safe places for schooling fish

718
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,178
is a marine sanctuary.

719
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,355
Whenever sanctuaries
have been established and policed,

720
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,857
fish stocks have slowly increased,

721
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:16,027
helping to restore biodiversity.

722
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:24,327
A successful sanctuary
becomes a precious time capsule...

723
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,790
...a reminder of how rich
the seas once were.

724
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,958
And could be again.

725
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:39,258
Unlike a zoo,
a marine sanctuary has no walls.

726
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:43,137
So it has the capacity to not only
replenish the immediate area,

727
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,682
but the oceans around it.

728
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,865
Because we have individual names
for our oceans

729
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,742
and have territorial borders,

730
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:08,037
we forget that
there's only one system.

731
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,249
There is only one sea.

732
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:20,341
Water, covering 70% of our planet's
surface, connects us all.

733
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:28,641
What occurs even in our polar regions
will eventually affect coral.

734
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:34,313
And, conversely, each new marine
sanctuary is another powerful step

735
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,400
towards saving our seas.

736
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,406
And when you consider

737
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:48,953
that the global ocean makes up 99%
of the living biosphere of the planet,

738
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,998
every step counts.

739
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,049
Because reefs
are such important breeding grounds

740
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,343
for so many marine creatures,

741
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,263
this is where a new future might lie.

742
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:10,850
Renewal here is a daily affair

743
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:14,604
and brings with it
magical transformation.

744
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:21,444
Here, a coral cod blushes a different
color when wooed by its mate.

745
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:31,621
A thriving reef
is an aquatic rainbow.

746
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:34,165
And like the skin of the coral cod,

747
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:37,502
these colors have meaning
and function.

748
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,797
Silver scales reflect light

749
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:44,383
and allow fish to blend
into their watery backgrounds.

750
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:56,270
Bold, strong colors allow fish
to recognize their own species

751
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,939
in a crowd.

752
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:03,653
Color also indicates whether a fish
is a juvenile or adult,

753
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,490
and some fish change color
quite radically as they mature.

754
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,118
Once fish are paired up,

755
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:13,788
they can then use body posturing
and color displays

756
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:16,290
to communicate their intentions.

757
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:24,382
A male parrotfish erects his dorsal fin
to intimidate other males

758
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:29,095
and impress a nearby female who
happens to look completely different.

759
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:37,854
And all across the reef, fish are
on the lookout for a chance to mate

760
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,107
and pass on their precious genes.

761
01:12:56,747 --> 01:13:01,544
Most sea creatures have short
intense lives compared to ours.

762
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:05,673
For some fish, a few years
constitutes an entire lifetime.

763
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:10,219
So every good day on a reef
is truly great.

764
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,722
A good decade is even greater,

765
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,683
the chance
for countless marine creatures

766
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,269
to live their lives to the fullest

767
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:21,731
and give rise to new generations.

768
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,742
In the quest to survive
in these tropical seas,

769
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,077
animals have had to be
highly inventive

770
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,581
and sometimes nature's own rules
are broken.

771
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,918
Consider the seahorse.

772
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,590
These mystical creatures
come in all sizes.

773
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:52,053
Some bigger than your palm,
others as small as your fingernail.

774
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:57,224
The daintiest of them all
is the pygmy seahorse,

775
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:01,103
whose life is completely bound
to gorgonian coral.

776
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:13,074
The extended seahorse family
consists of 320 species,

777
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:18,079
and includes pipefishes,
pipehorses and sea dragons.

778
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,420
In most species of pipefish
and seahorse,

779
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:29,674
it's the male
that broods the young.

780
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:34,470
It's not just this unusual parenting
that sets them apart.

781
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,598
They have equine heads,

782
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:39,475
prehensile tails...

783
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,562
...and bony body plates
instead of scales.

784
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:48,734
Despite their dragon appearance,
many fish like to eat them.

785
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:53,614
So not being noticed
has become their speciality.

786
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:00,287
Ghost pipefish are expert mimics
of other animals and plants,

787
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,748
including crinoids and coral.

788
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,751
Their predators
find it hard to see them

789
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,712
and so does their prey.

790
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,382
They spend most of their lives
upside down,

791
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,843
focused intently
on the sandy bottom,

792
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,303
searching for the tiny crustaceans

793
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,597
that are their principal food.

794
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,058
So specific is their camouftage

795
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:25,187
that pipefish rarely wander far
from a particular habitat

796
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:29,608
and perfect their mimicry
down to the finest detail.

797
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,030
Other species
conceal their true identity

798
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:37,241
by moving like eddies and currents.

799
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,956
While some pretend
to be sand-encrusted sticks

800
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:45,750
or fallen leaves...

801
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,053
...or pieces of algae.

802
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:14,361
If you know how to look, the masters
of disguise are everywhere.

803
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,755
In this underwater Garden of Eden,

804
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:37,968
even the snake
turns out to be a fish.

805
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,897
Down on the seabed,
deception is commonplace.

806
01:16:56,028 --> 01:17:00,241
Individual reefs are often connected
by areas of sand and rubble,

807
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:04,787
and this is where the so-called
'bottom dwellers' dwell.

808
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:16,590
The most numerous of these
are the gobies.

809
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,596
There are over 2,000 species of goby,

810
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,599
making them
one of the largest fish families.

811
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,477
Few of them
grow bigger than your finger,

812
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,565
which makes them a favored food
for many large predatory fish.

813
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:37,236
So they're always on the lookout
and never far from the seabed.

814
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,826
They spend most of their days
feeding,

815
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:48,372
filtering sand through their gills
to extract tiny food particles.

816
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,186
Sand is everything to the goby.

817
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,730
Sand puts food in their belly

818
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:15,733
and also a roof above their heads.

819
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,696
Many gobies build burrows.

820
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:23,449
Its tiring excavation work,

821
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:27,828
and partners sometimes don't agree
on whose turn it is.

822
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,338
If the domestic argument
can't be worked out,

823
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,758
then this species,
camouflaged as big eyes,

824
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:44,428
can always go for a stroll
to smooth things over.

825
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:51,977
Some clever gobies have enlisted
the services of a slave.

826
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,272
In a most extraordinary partnership,

827
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:01,028
gobies and blind shrimp
live together, bonded by mutual need.

828
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:05,699
The shrimps excavate a burrow
in which the gobies can hide,

829
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,410
and they eat the goby's scraps.

830
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:13,707
The gobies act as sentinels, warning
the shrimps of approaching danger.

831
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:23,926
The fish and crustacea have
such a close working relationship

832
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,178
that they're always connected,

833
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:29,598
by tail or fin or feeler.

834
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,368
For fish close to the bottom
of the food chain,

835
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:52,162
a safe home base is essential.

836
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:56,292
Space is limited
and good real estate hard to come by.

837
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,637
Trespassing isn't tolerated.

838
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:25,279
Territorial disputes
are normally quick to work out.

839
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,490
But not always.

840
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,915
There's definitely no point
picking a fight

841
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,001
with this mighty armored beast.

842
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,964
It's the crown-of-thorns starfish,
corals' mortal enemy.

843
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:49,053
By disgorging their stomachs
and drenching polyps with acid,

844
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:53,515
they eat living coral
and suck the life out of a reef.

845
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,810
The starfish play an important role,

846
01:20:56,977 --> 01:21:00,022
clearing space
and fostering biodiversity.

847
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,524
And few have stood in their way.

848
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:10,199
The starfish have always been
a natural part of the cycle.

849
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:13,410
But now the cycle is unnatural.

850
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:17,331
Agricultural pollution
has increased nutrients in the water,

851
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:20,334
which in turn causes algal blooms.

852
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:23,670
Starfish juveniles
are feasting on this algae

853
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,799
and many more
are surviving into adulthood.

854
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:32,012
Plagues of crown-of-thorns starfish
are now regularly experienced

855
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:34,264
on reefs worldwide.

856
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,319
But not all infestations
are bad news.

857
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,738
A perfect example
is the unlikely alliance

858
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,117
between the eared sponge
and the pink sea cucumber.

859
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,455
This sponge is highly toxic to most.

860
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:02,167
But the sea cucumber has adapted
to live here in huge numbers,

861
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:05,003
rising off the edges to spawn.

862
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:10,926
This is an inhospitable habitat
where creatures are thriving.

863
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,888
Perhaps it offers hope
for life in our changing seas.

864
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,434
It's certainly proof
that anything is possible.

865
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:30,612
The oceanic world is ever changing.

866
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:34,366
Nothing stays the same here
for more than a moment.

867
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:44,376
Over the ages,
corals have come and gone.

868
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,713
Today, they are disappearing again.

869
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:54,011
But what sets this cycle apart
from any other in geological history

870
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:56,805
is the presence of us.

871
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:01,643
For the first time
in corals' existence,

872
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,898
humans are having a direct impact
on the ocean's chemistry

873
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,692
and corals' destiny.

874
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,273
Many scientists believe

875
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,860
we are heading towards
our next mass extinction

876
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,946
and that humans are the cause.

877
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:59,117
Reef-building corals
are now seriously endangered.

878
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,746
And as reefs disappear,

879
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:08,001
hundreds of thousands of dependent
creatures disappear with them.

880
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:24,643
Furthermore, the demise
of coral reefs is a clear indicator

881
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,937
that our ocean is dying,

882
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:31,400
and our ocean is our planet's
life-support system.

883
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,072
The only way to save our ocean

884
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:40,158
is to radically curb
our CO2 emissions

885
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,078
within the next one or two decades.

886
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,499
We have all the tools to do it.

887
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:51,878
And if we succeed,
we will not only save our reefs,

888
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:55,090
we will ultimately save ourselves.

889
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:57,861
The future of coral,
and how this story ends,

890
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:59,863
is up to us.
