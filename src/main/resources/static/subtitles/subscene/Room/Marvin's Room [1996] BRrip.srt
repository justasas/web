1
00:03:09,975 --> 00:03:13,455
Uh, Janine? I wonder if you could
tell me, how long I might have to wait.

2
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:16,167
Because I left Aunt Ruth at home
in charge of Dad and I'm just...

3
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,698
You'll have to see Dr. Wally.
Dr. Surabh is on vacation.

4
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:22,605
See Doctor who?

5
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,422
I'll be right back.

6
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:39,209
I suppose I should tell you
needles bother me a little.

7
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:42,672
All right, Augustina,
could I have your arm, please?

8
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,640
Do you mind
if I call you Augustina?

9
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:48,751
Well, my name is Bessie.
Bessie! Of course. I'm sorry.

10
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:51,704
It's been a bit hectic
around here.

11
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,054
Now, where'd I... where did i put
the what chama call it?

12
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,782
The tourniquet?
Yeah, that's it.

13
00:03:57,996 --> 00:03:58,857
Uh...

14
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:03,661
Oh, I'm sitting on it.

15
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:06,553
Usually Dr Surabh
handles the patients.

16
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,365
Uh, okay. But I'm
a very good pathologist.

17
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:13,827
I bring my father Marvin and my aunt
Ruth in quite a bit to see Dr. Surabh.

18
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:17,497
Yes, I think I've seen your father
in the front. He's a very frail man?

19
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:21,167
Dad's a bone You could snap him like
a twig. I hope they're all right.

20
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:24,439
Oh, well, they're fine.
Good.

21
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:27,405
Yeah, except Dad's dying.
He's been dying for about 20years.

22
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:30,664
He's don't real slow
so i don't miss a thing, and...

23
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:34,731
Well, Dr. Surabh, he's really
worked a miracle with Aunt Ruth.

24
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:37,820
You know, she's had constant pain from
her back since the time she was born.

25
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,257
But, but he had her get this, um,
electronic anesthetizer, you know?

26
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,554
Where you put the wires
right to your brain,

27
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,237
and any time she has a bad pain...

28
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,276
she just turns the dial.
That's wonderful.

29
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:54,987
Of course any time she uses it,
our automatic garage door goes up.

30
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,804
But that's a small price to pay.
Oh, I agree

31
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,659
Are those all for me?

32
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,751
Dr. Surabh gave me
very specific instructions.

33
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:08,590
Okay.
That seems like a lot of blood.

34
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,266
If it seems like a lot of blood
that's because it is a lot of blood,

35
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,269
so what you're feeling
is perfectly normal.

36
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,002
Why don't we get this
over with?

37
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:19,493
This is sealed so it's sterile.

38
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,983
Oh...

39
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,001
I think I'm gonna come back later.

40
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,265
It's just a vitamin deficiency,
right? So, I'm just...

41
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:33,565
I said it might be
a vitamin deficiency.

42
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,228
Come on!

43
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,281
Good evening. Bruno's
Hold please.

44
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,430
Lee!
What?

45
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:48,074
Telephone.
Mmm, okay...

46
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:52,375
It feels so hard.

47
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:55,768
Don't touch it.

48
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:59,260
There's no reason to be putting your hands in
your hair unless you're a very nervous person.

49
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:01,477
There's no reason to be nervous,
ever,

50
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,526
so long as you have a good,
positive mental attitude.

51
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:13,021
Switch.

52
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,274
Quietly.

53
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,110
Yeah.

54
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:21,167
Yeah?

55
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:31,292
Excuse me. Where do you...
Where do you take, uh...

56
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:33,876
Hey, where's your brother?

57
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:36,049
He started it!

58
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:46,364
Hey!

59
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:04,500
When we heard what happened,
it just broke our hearts!

60
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,498
You can... make it your own
until you get on your feet.

61
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,801
Do you have any relatives?

62
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,584
No. Well, my boys.

63
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:29,444
No relatives. That can be a blessing.

64
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:33,436
No, no! Please, Lance, don't! Don't!

65
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,733
No, Lance, don't!

66
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:41,396
Stop! I'm warning you! Don't! No...

67
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:45,476
You disgust me.

68
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,382
We didn't make love.

69
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:51,301
We had sex... like animals.

70
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:53,670
Like pets!

71
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,014
Hi, honey...

72
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:03,854
Lance just raped Coral.
I am so surprised,

73
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:08,004
because Coral just performed
the surgery on him...

74
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:09,950
that got his sight back.
Coral's the doctor?

75
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,247
Has been for weeks now.
And does that ever make Amber jealous.

76
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:17,067
Did you give Dad his 2:00?

77
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:20,674
I was going to.
Ruth.

78
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:24,731
I asked you to do one little thing!

79
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:29,398
Oh... Dad!

80
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:32,026
All right, all right. Open.

81
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:34,609
Open up. Open up.

82
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,814
Oh, you sucked all the ink
off the Yhatzee dice.

83
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,471
How are we gonna play?
Huh, Dad?

84
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:45,002
All right, all right, come on.
Are you okay, huh?

85
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,660
Ah, is this his 1:00? Hmm?

86
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:52,105
Stupid me!

87
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:54,371
I'm so useless!

88
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:57,765
No, you're not! All right, now come on.
Let's quit hogging the bed.

89
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,977
Come on!
It's my cure.

90
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:03,988
You used to blame your pain for
everything, and now you blame your cure.

91
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,514
Come on, open.
That's right, good.

92
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:10,287
Come on, open.
Bessie, what happened to your arm?

93
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,769
Oh, the doctor took a little blood.
It looks so tender.

94
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:18,247
Shouldn't you see a doctor? I just came
from the doctor. I have a vitamin deficiency.

95
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:22,325
You don't make stinky often enough.
I do so!

96
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:25,667
Stinky is poison.
You have to get rid of it.

97
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:29,865
That's why when you're constipated,
you have a headache.

98
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:33,657
Ruth, he has to have his pills
at the same time every day!

99
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,954
You usually give Marvin
his pills.

100
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,939
But today I asked you to!

101
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,867
I wish you wouldn't
leave me home alone.

102
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:44,055
What if he tries to kill himself
with his Par cheesi men?

103
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,200
Dr. Surabh explained this to you.

104
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:49,329
He puts things in his mouth
because he likes the way they feel.

105
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:53,940
What if he dies
while you're out of the house?

106
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:58,353
Then you'll call me,
and I'll come home.

107
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,429
Oh.
All right?

108
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,863
Do you want me to make
the tomato soup?

109
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:07,145
No, you' re just going
to make a mess of it

110
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,669
I'll get you one of my vitamin pills
for your deficiency.

111
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,345
I'll get some real ones later.

112
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:17,355
Mine are real.
Do you want Pebbles or BammBamm?

113
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:19,223
Mmm.

114
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:24,162
Oh, no! Oh. Dad!

115
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:28,269
Oh. Oh! Oh!

116
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:34,771
Wait a second. Okay, okay, I know.

117
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:39,140
Let me do this for you, all right?

118
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:43,220
Look what I got, Dad.
Look at that.

119
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,908
Look at that, Dad.
See? Isn't that nice?

120
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,008
Is it nice, Dad?

121
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,132
What?
What do you see there?

122
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:05,409
Is that the Northern Lights there?
Uh-huh, over there?

123
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,221
Okay, Dad.

124
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:14,269
Now,

125
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:20,038
I got you some carrots
and some butternut squash.

126
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:24,784
Well, all right.
Then, how bout some tomato soup?

127
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,952
And some juice?

128
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:30,441
And what does that face mean,

129
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:34,774
Mr. Innocent, huh?

130
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,184
You mind if I smoke?

131
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:46,591
Yes.
Thank you for asking.

132
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:50,217
How bout if i blow it
out this way?

133
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:53,057
I'm afraid there's no smoking
anywhere on this floor.

134
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,629
Okay, okay, I'll be real quiet.

135
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,658
It's good to see you here, Lee.

136
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:05,785
May I call you Lee?
Sure.

137
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:08,357
We've missed you on other days.
So has Hank.

138
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,149
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

139
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:14,745
The... I wish I could
visit more often, but...

140
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,089
Mm... hmm...
You know.

141
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:25,890
You're not a nurse are you?
I'm a psychiatrist.

142
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:29,210
So you're the one that Hank talks to.
I'm in charge of his therapy.

143
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:32,637
Well, you know he lies.

144
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:34,740
Mm... hmm...

145
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,519
He told his guidance counselor
at school that I beat him.

146
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:40,895
Mm... hmm...

147
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,295
So, see what I mean?

148
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:45,056
Mm... hmm...

149
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,384
Oh!

150
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:52,503
So. See, now you're thinking,
I wounder if she does beat him.

151
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:56,352
Is that what you think I think?
Don't you?

152
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:59,446
Do you want me to think that?
What do you mean?

153
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:03,478
What do you think I mean? What do
you mean. What do I think you mean?

154
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:06,535
What do you think I mean
by What do you think I mean?

155
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:10,722
We'd like for you to become
more involved in Hank's therapy.

156
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:13,764
We'd like for you to come
more often for visits.

157
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:17,380
Doctor, can I be honest
with you?

158
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:21,693
I have forced my way through
school, and I'm about to get my degree.

159
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:25,836
And I'm very picky now
about the kind of guy I'll do with.

160
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,163
And I ke... I used to keep
a really clean house.

161
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:34,835
Hank makes fun of
my degree in cosmetology.

162
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:37,357
He terrorizes any guy
I go out with.

163
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:40,768
This last one, Lawrence,
Hank made fun of his being on parole.

164
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:44,154
He made fun of how he holds his liquor.
He made fun of his Pinto.

165
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:48,973
The point is, Hank cost me
a potentially good relationship.

166
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:51,409
And as for my house...

167
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,291
Hank is not something
I can control.

168
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,686
So what's the point
of my visiting?

169
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:04,959
He says he misses you

170
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:11,301
Well, I'm here.
So let me see him.

171
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:18,140
You want one?
No, thank you.

172
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:38,200
Hi, Hank. It's Mom.

173
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:40,850
Can you hear me?

174
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,284
Okay, well, um...

175
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,653
You be good. I... I'll leave you
some of these here...

176
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,232
so when you wake up
you can have them waiting.

177
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,370
You sure you...
No, no, thanks.

178
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:01,449
Okay, well, uh, I'll see ya.

179
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:08,141
Does this count as a visit?

180
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,847
Do you think this counts
as a visit?

181
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:30,249
Uh. Excuse me. Oh, uh, don't be
surprised if Dr. Wally is late.

182
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:33,235
He was an 11-month baby.
Can you imagine that?

183
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,809
I, on the other hand,
I... I was premature.

184
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:38,064
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I got stuck at the hospital.

185
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:41,456
Oh, you must be very busy.
I wanted to check on your tests.

186
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:45,177
I was telling her that I weighed one
pound when I was born. No, you didn't Bob.

187
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:47,474
I, I was this big.
Oh.

188
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:51,054
Follow me.
Fo... Not you, Bob.

189
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:53,349
Follow me.

190
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:59,057
So, how are we today?

191
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:01,908
You tell me.

192
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:12,520
Dr. Wally speaking.

193
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,468
Yes, Bob, I know there's
someone waiting in my office.

194
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,493
I'm in my office.

195
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:19,680
That's all right.

196
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:21,663
Yes. Yes.

197
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:26,815
Is there a problem?
No, no, he's just neq here.

198
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:28,510
He'll get the hang of it.
No, no, no, no.

199
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,855
I meant with my blood test.
Did it get lost or something?

200
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:35,364
Because... I really
was getting myself all worked up.

201
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:38,627
I was thinking all kinds of horrible
thoughts. No, it didn't get lost.

202
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,837
But what I would like to do is...

203
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,422
run some other tests simply to
rule out certain possibilities.

204
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,327
What are the possibilities?

205
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:48,089
There are a number
I would like to rule out.

206
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,853
Are we still thinking I have a vitamin
deficiency? We may have ruled out that.

207
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:55,309
Do you think we should? Should we have
ruled that out? No reason to be nervous.

208
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:57,115
I'm not nervous.
Good!

209
00:18:57,218 --> 00:19:00,120
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
give you a local anesthetic...

210
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:03,105
and I'm going to remove a little
bone marrow from your hip.

211
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:04,787
What?

212
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:08,828
I don't mean to be noisy,
but what is the test for?

213
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:11,551
Why don't you let me
do the worrying for now?

214
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,727
I'm probably thinking it's something
much worse than it actually is.

215
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:20,248
Is it something serious,
like a brain tumor?

216
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:22,419
Oh, no.

217
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,880
M. S?
No!

218
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,023
Cancer?

219
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:33,362
Well, one of the possibilities
I was hoping to rule out is leukemia.

220
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:36,967
My mother had...

221
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:42,059
I know.
I saw that in your file.

222
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,481
Hold all my calls, please.

223
00:19:55,884 --> 00:19:57,858
Bessie, I just...

224
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,030
Dr. Wally speaking.

225
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:08,423
Yes, that was me just then.
Didn't you recognize my voice, Bob?

226
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:11,253
That's all right.

227
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:15,752
That's what I get
for hiring my own brother.

228
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:19,471
I haven't been feeling as badly lately,
haven't been nearly as tired.

229
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:22,709
Why don't you lie on your side
and face the wall,

230
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:25,403
and we'll get this over
as soon as we can?

231
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,351
What does it mean
if it is leukemia?

232
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:39,135
There are a variety
of leukemias...

233
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:41,406
and a variety of treatments.

234
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:45,760
If you have, for example,
chronic myelogenous leukemia,

235
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:48,974
a bone marrow transplant
is a very real option.

236
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:52,180
We would then test members
of your family for possible donors.

237
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:55,229
You do have family.
Dad and Ruth.

238
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:59,858
I thought your file mentioned a sister.
Oh, yes, I do. I...

239
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,710
I have a sister Lee. Yes...

240
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:04,234
Good.

241
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:08,186
Oh!

242
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:35,380
I just had it done last week
and it's driving me crazy!

243
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:38,217
Do you think God's
punishing me for vanity,

244
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:40,157
or is it always that way?

245
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:43,118
Oh, my God! If you have
a permanent done right,

246
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:45,162
it shouldn't itch you at all!

247
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:49,276
Convent.

248
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:52,198
Sister...
Lee Lacker, please.

249
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:56,432
Sister Lee Lacker, telephone!

250
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:10,926
Hello?

251
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:13,790
Hello!
Lee?

252
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:16,560
Hello?
Hi, it's me... Bessie.

253
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:18,950
Bessie?

254
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,414
What's wrong?

255
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,594
Mm... hmm.

256
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,246
Uh... huh.

257
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,437
They had reservations
about letting Hank go at all.

258
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:40,710
A week was all
we could get approval for.

259
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:43,110
Yeah, but if one of us
is a match, then we gotta...

260
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,283
We'll deal with that then.

261
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,017
Hey

262
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:53,175
Look at you. You look like a pig.
I'm working on an engine.

263
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,274
So they don't let you shower?

264
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:58,007
Look, they told me you were here
so I came, all right?

265
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,450
You behaving yourself?

266
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:06,466
They're not strapping
me down anymore.

267
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:10,116
Well, don't abuse that privilege.

268
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,248
So. How come
you're visiting me?

269
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,416
What do you mean?
I don't need a reason to visit.

270
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:17,392
How come you never visited before?
I did. You were unconscious.

271
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:20,516
How can that be a visit if I didn't even know
you were here? I can't take responsibility...

272
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:23,336
for when you're conscious or unconscious,
all can do is make the effort.

273
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:26,008
Your mother has something to tell you
It's not good news.

274
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:35,091
But Doctor says it's okay to tell you
because, partially, I have no choice.

275
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:38,795
What?

276
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:42,452
Your Aunt Bessie down in Florida
has leukemia. She's not doing so well.

277
00:23:42,677 --> 00:23:44,586
There's a possibility
she might die.

278
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:48,706
I didn't know I had an Aunt Bessie!
She's been to the house.

279
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:51,664
When?
Right after your dad and I got married.

280
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,673
Mom, I wasn't born yet.

281
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:57,464
Look, I know I mentioned her to you. She's
my sister! I didn't know you had a sister.

282
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,407
You know how every goddamn
Christmas I say to you,

283
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:03,725
Looks like Bessie didn't send
a card again this year either?

284
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:07,706
Oh, yeah.
That's your Aunt Bessie. My sister.

285
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:10,172
And because we're her nearest relatives,
they want us to get tested...

286
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,885
cause maybe they could save her life
and do a bone marrow transplant or...

287
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:16,157
It's only for a week.
Doctor says it's okay to go.

288
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,134
Why would want to go?

289
00:24:21,185 --> 00:24:23,324
Because one of us
might save her life.

290
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,365
Go, go, go, get cleaned up. I'm not
gonna take you like that in the car.

291
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:34,766
Hank, isn't there something you anna
say to your mother before you leave?

292
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:37,555
But is this gonna take long?
Because we should go.

293
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:39,713
Mom?

294
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:43,806
I'm really sorry
I burnt the house down.

295
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:53,265
Is that it? Because I'm really
anxious now to get on the road.

296
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:19,292
Oop, no matches.
Mom, I gotta light the thing. Come on.

297
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,486
Charlie, here,
light this for him please.

298
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:49,720
Being confined to your bed
is nothing to be afraid of.

299
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:54,393
I'm not confined to my bed.
I'm just... I'm a little tired today.

300
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:59,296
I was confined to my bed most
of my life. You find things to do.

301
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:02,533
Like what?
Oh!

302
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,941
Well, uh, you can sleep.

303
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:08,624
Or you can lay there awake.

304
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:11,531
Uh... huh.
Ah, do you want any of this?

305
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:16,347
Oh, no, no, no. You must eat
all of that to make yourself strong.

306
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,972
How's Dad?

307
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,127
Oh, he's fine.

308
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,008
Do you want your orange?
No, no, you can have it.

309
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:27,844
Well, no,
not if you're going...

310
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:29,556
Thank you.

311
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,251
Does he miss me?

312
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:37,355
Well, I haven't actually
told him you're gone.

313
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,582
What? Doesn't he wonder where I am?
Well, I tell him...

314
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:43,423
you're just in the other room
busy with something.

315
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:48,217
And then he falls asleep and when he
wakes up I say, he just missed you.

316
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:50,867
Who does he think
that nurse is living with you?

317
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:53,353
I pretend not to notice her.
What do you mean?

318
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,110
If she walks in the room
while I'm there,

319
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,557
I pretend she's not real,
that she doesn't exist.

320
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:02,546
Then what does Dad think?

321
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,957
I think he thinks
he's hallucinating.

322
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:09,476
Ruth, you have to tell him.

323
00:27:09,643 --> 00:27:12,098
The only time it seems
to bother him...

324
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,410
is when she carries him
to the bath and then I say,

325
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:20,802
Oh, Marvin, look, you're flying!
Bessie'll wanna see this!

326
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,808
And I run into
the other room to get you.

327
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:25,880
He must think
he's losing his mind!

328
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,910
What am I supposed
to tell him?

329
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:31,287
That... that
his little girl is...

330
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:34,249
Oh, I'm...

331
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:37,437
Then he'd really think
he was losing his mind.

332
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:40,937
He'd be so upset.
It would be so upsetting to him.

333
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:43,863
He's your father
All right, Ruth, all right.

334
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:46,438
I wouldn't know
what to say.

335
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,873
Here. Here, here.

336
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:58,980
Just tell him
I'm gonna be fine, Ruth.

337
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:01,077
I know I am.

338
00:28:01,836 --> 00:28:03,746
See?

339
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,896
That's okay. Sure.

340
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:08,983
Okay?

341
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:12,839
What's Grandpa like?

342
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:16,366
I don't know,
Charlie. It's been a while.

343
00:28:16,587 --> 00:28:18,954
Why haven't we seen him before?
He's been sick. We were in Ohio.

344
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:23,381
It's hard to travel with little kids.
I don't know.

345
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,415
What's Bessie like?

346
00:28:30,101 --> 00:28:32,239
I don't know.

347
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:35,719
This is the first time
I even heard from her in 20 years.

348
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:38,243
Why haven't you
heard from her in 20 years.

349
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:42,469
I couldn't help her when
Dad got sick. I guess she got mad at me.

350
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:44,754
Why?
Jesus, Charlie!

351
00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:47,193
Shut up! Read your book.

352
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:06,341
Have you ever heard of Larry Lacker?
Who?

353
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:10,503
My dad. He's like the greatest
race car driver ever.

354
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:13,976
No, I never, uh...
I never heard of Larry Lacker.

355
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:15,841
No?

356
00:29:19,922 --> 00:29:21,711
Those guys know Dad.

357
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,449
Hi

358
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,464
Bessie!

359
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,864
Come on, let's go.
Hey, I was listening to that.

360
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:58,627
Let's go.

361
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,958
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

362
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:17,979
Hello?

363
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:25,970
Bessie?

364
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:31,083
Lee?

365
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,025
Oh!

366
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:47,885
Oh... God.

367
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:51,224
What are you staring at?

368
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:55,125
Well, oh, my, my goodness,
oh. My goodness! Oh, look at you.

369
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:57,603
What?
Oh, just look at you!

370
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,356
Oh. God, are you that old?

371
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,316
Cause how old does that make me then?
Why, I look old?

372
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,073
Well...

373
00:31:06,213 --> 00:31:09,857
Oh, you're a lot... Well, you're
a lot older, but... Yeah, well.

374
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:13,879
Well, you look
really good though, Bessie.

375
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:16,161
You do! I like your hair.

376
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:20,417
This is a wig.
It's, uh, It's from my chemo.

377
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:24,885
Oh!
Yeah, it... well...

378
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:28,232
I know it's a wig.
I don't know why I pretended not to.

379
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,373
Not that it looks like a wig.
No, I mean...

380
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:33,397
Thanks.

381
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:36,577
Hey, I'm wearing a fall, Look. See?
Mm... hmm...

382
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:39,399
I always loved this length,
but I never had the patience for it.

383
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:42,717
I just... wear it when I want to
look really great.

384
00:31:43,822 --> 00:31:46,211
You look good though.

385
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:48,985
Thank you.

386
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,824
Why don't you sit down?

387
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:56,512
I gotta put these to soak.
Dad had himself a little accident.

388
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:58,844
Oh! How is he?

389
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:01,725
Oh, he's still with us.

390
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,430
Let me help.
Oh, no... no, no... no, no.

391
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:07,647
You sure?
No, I've been doing it this long.

392
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:34,863
Daddy, it's me. Lee.

393
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:38,018
All the way down from Ohio.

394
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,004
Lee, I don't know if you
should smoke in the house.

395
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,119
Oh...
Dad's oxygen tanks.

396
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:29,097
But you could smoke in the yard.
I don't have to smoke.

397
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:33,176
Ooh, look who it is!

398
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:38,267
Aunt Ruth, you're up and about.
Oh, it's my cure. I'm part machine.

399
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:43,104
Give me a hug!
Oh!

400
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:46,969
Oh, give me a real hug!
I won't break.

401
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:51,766
Oh, oh, Jesus, sweet Jesus!

402
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,118
Oh! Oh, that's much better.

403
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,253
Oh.
Yes, uh...

404
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:07,871
I brought cookies!
Oh, thanks, Lee.

405
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:11,915
Oh, Dad and Ruth aren't allowed sugar
and I'm trying to stay away from it too.

406
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:15,320
But this is just
a lovely canister.

407
00:34:15,528 --> 00:34:18,562
Oh, I'm missing my program.

408
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,620
Oh!

409
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,801
Yeah, you go watch
your program.

410
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:26,478
Where are your boys?

411
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:29,390
Couldn't you get Hank out
of the mental institution?

412
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:33,026
Bessie, we don't like to call it the mental
institution. Oh, what do you call it then?

413
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:37,592
We call it the nuthouse or loony bin to
show we have a sense of humor about it.

414
00:34:37,854 --> 00:34:39,741
Well, where is he?
Where's Charlie?

415
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,345
I got myself two grown nephews
I've never even seen.

416
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:46,269
Now, I did invite you up to Ohio for
both of their christenings. Remember?

417
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:49,398
They're sitting in the car.

418
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,966
The car?

419
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:58,985
Bessie, Hank will do things
like this just to get attention.

420
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:02,506
They say I should just ignore it,
or give him an ultimatum.

421
00:35:02,749 --> 00:35:05,270
He hasn't agreed to be tested
for the transplant yet...

422
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:07,722
because he knows it'll make him
the center of attention.

423
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:10,887
He hasn't?
No, Don't worry. He will.

424
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:13,264
I'll make him...
if I have to.

425
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,720
How are you gonna make him?
You can't make him come in from the car.

426
00:35:25,972 --> 00:35:29,288
Hey, you two! Charlie!
Hank, what the hell are you doing?

427
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,707
I wanna hear number one. They're doin a top
100 countdown and I wanna hear number one.

428
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,314
Well, what number are they on now?
Eighty-six!

429
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:42,146
You get out here right now.

430
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:44,593
I'm warning you!
You get outta the car right now!

431
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,610
Do you hear me?

432
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,873
Hi, I'm your Aunt Bessie,
who you never laid eyes on,

433
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:01,839
and I don't care how grown-up you are,
I expect a big, fat hug.

434
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:08,507
Oh!

435
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:11,672
Oh!

436
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:16,228
Oh, no, you must be Charlie!
Huh? Well, hi.

437
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,398
Look who's here.
Look who's here!

438
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:22,766
Hank, Charlie, this is your aunt Ruth.
Come on, say hello.

439
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:28,188
All right, now which of you handsome
boys is in the mental institution?

440
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,715
Oh.

441
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:33,303
Give me a hug!

442
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,002
Well, would you all like to see Dad?

443
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,710
I know he's so excited about
meeting everybody. Yeah, sure.

444
00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:45,405
Let me get him ready. I know
he wants to make a good impression.

445
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,028
Marvin, company's coming.
Company's coming.

446
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:54,466
Come, come. Oh, Marvin!

447
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,883
Well...

448
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:15,685
Dad? Dad?

449
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,419
This is Lee, your daughter.

450
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,571
And there's Charlie,
right there.

451
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,694
You see him? Yeah!

452
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,143
And, and...

453
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:28,069
Hank!

454
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:30,735
Your grandsons!

455
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:44,971
Hi.

456
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,112
It's okay, Dad.
Hank didn't mean anything.

457
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:50,881
I didn't mean to do...
He's just not used to a lot of people.

458
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:53,822
What did you do?
I didn't do anything. I said hello.

459
00:37:53,976 --> 00:37:56,015
Maybe we should just
clear out of here.

460
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,788
Just give him a second!
Lee?

461
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:28,736
Hey, did your Aunt Bessie
offer you a chip yet?

462
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:32,108
Well, that's what they're there for.
Yeah, but he has to wait to be asked.

463
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:33,976
Put the chip back, Hank.

464
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,329
Put it back.

465
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:50,644
Put back the chip!

466
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:52,976
Lee, I put them out there
for the kids.

467
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:56,207
You have to understand.
He has to wait to be asked.

468
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,688
Hank, would you like a chip?

469
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:03,957
No, thank you, Aunt Bessie,
not right now.

470
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:08,049
Your aunt offered you a chip. Now the
polite thing to do would be to take one.

471
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:11,204
I don't want a chip right now.
Eat or no Disney World!

472
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,362
I could give a fuck about Disney World!
That's it, get out! Out, out!

473
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:18,013
I don't care where.
Just so I can't see you.

474
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:25,673
Charlie,
would you like a chip?

475
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:32,423
Go ahead, honey, if you want one.
Oh, take a bunch.

476
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:35,271
Not too many.
You don't want to ruin your supper.

477
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:43,126
And don't get any crumbs on
your aunt's nice, clean floor.

478
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:08,564
No, no, no! No, Lance.

479
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:10,288
No!

480
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:16,093
Not Amber, No!
No, Lance, that's Amber! No!

481
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:19,753
No, no, no, no.
Shh, shh.

482
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:23,238
No, Lance, that's Amber.

483
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:25,202
No. No.

484
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,210
No, no, no.

485
00:41:57,854 --> 00:42:00,407
I'm not used to finding
somebody else out here.

486
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:04,039
Sorry. You want me to go back inside?
No! No. Unless...

487
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:07,461
Are you not supposed to be out
here? Will your mother care? Nah.

488
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,753
She's asleep.
I don't see any harm in it.

489
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:15,740
We're all really glad
you're here.

490
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:19,482
Yeah. We should do it again
in, like, another 17 years.

491
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:23,507
Well, your mom and I
haven't always gotten along.

492
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,390
That's... why I haven't
been in touch so much.

493
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:28,406
Uh... huh.

494
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:32,362
I wish you could have really
known your grandfather.

495
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,526
He would have loved
havin a boy around.

496
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:38,445
Do you ever wish
he'd just die?

497
00:42:38,632 --> 00:42:41,632
Hank, don't ask that!
Why not?

498
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:44,169
Cause... it's rude.

499
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,974
You know, I haven't made up my mind
about gettin tested yet.

500
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:54,455
Okay.

501
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,333
What are you doing
with those tools?

502
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,462
Oh, I was just lookin' at'em.
I'll put'em back.

503
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:03,335
I didn't think you were gonna steal'em,
Hank. You can have'em if you want.

504
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,900
Really?

505
00:43:07,063 --> 00:43:10,325
Well, sure!
You're just gonna give'em to me?

506
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,804
Sure. Why not?

507
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:15,074
Wow. These are
really cool tools.

508
00:43:16,174 --> 00:43:18,345
Yeah. They were
your granddad's.

509
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,550
I think he'd like you
to have them.

510
00:43:22,215 --> 00:43:25,191
The hospital probably
won't let me keep them anyway.

511
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:27,557
Well, you're not going
to be in there forever.

512
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:32,136
When i go back, they're going to
move me into a place for adults.

513
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:36,101
Why?
I turn 18in, like, three weeks.

514
00:43:36,332 --> 00:43:38,437
Oh! Happy birthday.

515
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:42,884
If the fire hadn't spread up the street,
it wouldn't be such a big deal.

516
00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:45,888
But now they want to make sure
I'm not some sort of a threat.

517
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:48,182
Oh, you're not a threat,
and I'm sure they see that.

518
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,800
You're probably the best one...
There's this one dude on my floor.

519
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:53,404
Held a razor blade under his tongue
for, like, five hours.

520
00:43:53,585 --> 00:43:55,854
He talked to the orderlies,
he ate, and everything.

521
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,158
Why on earth
would he do that?

522
00:43:58,356 --> 00:44:00,909
He was trying to break
my record.

523
00:44:02,428 --> 00:44:06,203
Hank... what do you want to be
when you grow up?

524
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:08,571
I am grown-up!

525
00:44:55,452 --> 00:44:57,361
So Marvin liked to fix stuff?

526
00:44:57,521 --> 00:45:00,870
Mmh. God, he used to make
your mother so mad.

527
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,779
He'd leave that radio lying
around the house in pieces, and,

528
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:08,532
and she used to love to turn it up
and dance wild around the house.

529
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:12,609
Mom liked to dance?
Oh, you bet!

530
00:45:12,872 --> 00:45:16,450
So, who's this right here?
What? Let me...

531
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:19,045
Let me see.

532
00:45:19,212 --> 00:45:22,311
Oh, that's your grandmother.
She looks like Mom.

533
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:25,584
Mmm, Yeah,
she takes after her.

534
00:45:25,788 --> 00:45:27,927
Do you want this too?

535
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,662
No, I don't care.
No? I'm gonna keep it then.

536
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,120
I don't think I'm gonna get the test.
What do you think about that?

537
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,269
Can I ask why?
No reason.

538
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:46,025
Maybe your mom wouldn't
want you up this late.

539
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,526
All right.
All right.

540
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:55,247
You know somethin'?

541
00:45:55,354 --> 00:45:57,721
Nobody ever does anything
to be nice.

542
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:00,096
They always want to get somethin'
out of it. And you believe that?

543
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:04,517
I mean, the first time I hear from you
is when you need somethin from me.

544
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:08,181
Well, I Why do you think I spent
the last 20 years of my life down here?

545
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:10,825
Because I got something out of it?
Yeah, or you wouldn't have done it.

546
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:12,349
Oh, Hank!

547
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:14,537
Or maybe you just wanted
to hide out for a while.

548
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,701
Or you thought you could
never find a husband.

549
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:19,660
When you're not around, a nursing home
can do this job for the cash.

550
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,314
Your mother would never
put them in a home. Why not?

551
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:24,843
She doesn't give a shit
about anybody.

552
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:41,800
Um, I'm putting this
with your other things.

553
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:44,212
Why?

554
00:46:44,342 --> 00:46:47,309
Because they're yours.

555
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,129
Okay.
Hank,

556
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,238
you're my nephew and I love you...

557
00:46:55,422 --> 00:46:58,356
no matter what you've decided.

558
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:02,879
Okay.
Okay.

559
00:47:03,062 --> 00:47:04,949
Good night.

560
00:47:16,178 --> 00:47:19,212
Don't waste your time
trying to make friends with him.

561
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:21,870
We're only gonna be here
a few days.

562
00:47:35,034 --> 00:47:38,165
Now, we are starting with
a procedure to look for a match.

563
00:47:38,403 --> 00:47:41,599
Please, Bob, I'll take this.

564
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,769
Now we are starting with a procedure
to look for a match. Any questions?

565
00:47:46,012 --> 00:47:48,150
How big is the needle?

566
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:52,348
It's not so important that you
understand the procedure, Bob.

567
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:55,270
Follow me, please.

568
00:47:58,093 --> 00:48:01,257
Hank, are you fixing
the door for Ruth?

569
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:03,985
It's so boring around here,
there's northen' else to do.

570
00:48:04,168 --> 00:48:06,502
Well, do you want
to keep me company?

571
00:48:06,704 --> 00:48:08,395
Yeah, sure.

572
00:48:12,077 --> 00:48:14,565
It's a Ford, huh?
Yeah.

573
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:17,812
What year?
Oh! Would you like to drive, Hank?

574
00:48:18,017 --> 00:48:19,708
Are you sure?
Yes.

575
00:48:19,851 --> 00:48:23,115
You sure you want me to drive? I'm
warning' you. Okay, you can drive.

576
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:26,038
'Cause I'm kinda fast I'm warnin' you
Be careful, all right?

577
00:48:26,827 --> 00:48:28,714
Don't drive too fast.
All right.

578
00:48:42,844 --> 00:48:44,917
You're a natural-born driver.

579
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:51,064
Oh, I have an idea.
I know where we can go. Um, turn here.

580
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:03,400
Did you know my dad?
I met him once.

581
00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:06,737
Doesn't your mom talk
about him?

582
00:49:06,873 --> 00:49:11,030
Nah. I know he had a race car, but...
Really?

583
00:49:11,278 --> 00:49:13,995
Well, I know your mom
was nuts about him.

584
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:19,039
Did you go to the wedding?
No, uh... uh.

585
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,536
No, I know I was gonna be down here with
Dad and Ruth for longer than I thought,

586
00:49:22,758 --> 00:49:26,752
so... I went back home
to sell off the rest of my stuff.

587
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:30,544
They have you over for
dinner or somethin'? No.

588
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:35,109
No, it wasn't much of a visit.
I just sort of stopped by.

589
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,428
Your Dad was asleep on the couch
and Lee didn't want to wake him.

590
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:42,205
So... we stood in the hallway
and we talked for a while.

591
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,546
Your dad was still asleep
when I left.

592
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,936
How'd he seem?

593
00:49:53,525 --> 00:49:55,762
Yeah, he seemed nice enough.

594
00:50:18,243 --> 00:50:19,650
What?

595
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:27,092
Hank!

596
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,662
Stop it, Hank! No!

597
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:32,545
No! Stop! Stop!

598
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,302
No, stop, wait!
I mean it, Hank! No, no, no!

599
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:50,830
Whoo... hoo!

600
00:50:51,745 --> 00:50:54,428
Oh, Hank!

601
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,055
Whoo... hoo... hoo... hoo!

602
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:24,404
Oh, Lee,

603
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:26,552
we were just down by the water.

604
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,756
Oh, I'm...

605
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:33,042
I'm sorry. I...
Dr. Wally called.

606
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:34,666
Oh.

607
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:38,554
He would like to test
the boys next.

608
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,687
What's wrong, Dad?
Dad, what's wrong?

609
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:04,044
No, no, no. No, Dad, it's just us.
It's just, it's just us.

610
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,193
It's just us! Oh, Dad!

611
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,632
Oh, no, Dad, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

612
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,843
Hey, Hank.

613
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:21,468
You awake?
Mmm.

614
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,612
Y. You know, I know you might be a little
bit afraid about having this procedure,

615
00:52:24,815 --> 00:52:28,207
but I hear the transplant is just
like having a tooth pulled or something.

616
00:52:28,386 --> 00:52:31,931
I'm not afraid.
I just haven't decided yet.

617
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,784
You're gonna have that test.

618
00:52:34,925 --> 00:52:37,227
This is my sister
we're talking about.

619
00:52:37,394 --> 00:52:40,558
We're not gonna let her die just
so you can have one of your moods.

620
00:52:40,765 --> 00:52:42,904
Dad, okay.

621
00:52:45,004 --> 00:52:47,906
No, no, no, no, No, Dad.

622
00:52:52,145 --> 00:52:55,047
Correct me if I'm wrong.
But leukemia,

623
00:52:55,248 --> 00:52:57,649
that's one of the diseases they
pretty much have worked out, right?

624
00:52:57,786 --> 00:53:00,753
Like diabetes.
I will correct you. That is wrong.

625
00:53:00,956 --> 00:53:03,225
What is gonna happen
to my sister now?

626
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:06,239
On the off chance
you can't find a donor?

627
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:11,873
Why don't you sit down?

628
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:18,424
You see, without
a bone marrow transplant,

629
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:21,509
we have to rely on chemical therapies,
what you would call chemotherapy,

630
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:25,421
as a way of sustaining the patient
over a number of years.

631
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:30,440
What kind of a number?
Ten?

632
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,924
Uh, a lower number.

633
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,356
Nine?

634
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:38,108
A much lower number.

635
00:53:39,328 --> 00:53:43,801
As the immune system suffers under
the chemotherapy, she'll grow weaker.

636
00:53:44,032 --> 00:53:47,742
And, and, there could be
respiratory problems.

637
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:51,354
Sometimes patients become bedridden,
totally dependent.

638
00:53:51,574 --> 00:53:54,127
Hopelessly depressed.

639
00:53:55,078 --> 00:53:58,045
Eventually you'll just have to find a
full-time nurse to help you take care of...

640
00:53:58,249 --> 00:54:00,900
Help me? What?
You can't take it all on yourself.

641
00:54:01,118 --> 00:54:04,249
Your sister, your father,
and then there's your aunt.

642
00:54:05,657 --> 00:54:08,024
I'm not taking anything...

643
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:10,711
Why would you think that?
Well, I assumed...

644
00:54:10,929 --> 00:54:15,239
No, no, no. I live in Ohio.
I just got a degree in cosmetology.

645
00:54:15,534 --> 00:54:17,476
She's gonna be fine!

646
00:54:20,806 --> 00:54:22,661
Okay...
Okay...

647
00:54:22,808 --> 00:54:25,230
Yes.
Yes.

648
00:54:28,115 --> 00:54:31,123
How could one sister be so good...

649
00:54:31,286 --> 00:54:35,246
and the other so bad?

650
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:41,023
So you're saying that Coral
is good and Amber's bad?

651
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:44,082
Coral used to be bad.

652
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:48,545
But she's been a saint
ever since her car accident.

653
00:54:48,806 --> 00:54:52,035
That Volvo was a blessing.

654
00:54:53,477 --> 00:54:56,445
Come on, come on.
See? Whoop!

655
00:55:09,395 --> 00:55:12,264
I but they have
really good care here, you know?

656
00:55:12,498 --> 00:55:14,440
Dad never put Mom in a place
like this.

657
00:55:15,068 --> 00:55:17,370
Do you remember how
he cared for her?

658
00:55:17,602 --> 00:55:21,181
I was little.
I wasn't allowed in the room.

659
00:55:25,646 --> 00:55:27,653
Excuse me.
I get my degree next quarter.

660
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,987
Well, you should be proud of that.
Oh, yeah.

661
00:55:30,185 --> 00:55:32,073
I already did one
freelance job.

662
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,798
I did hair for a TV commercial. It's just
local, but guess how much they paid me?

663
00:55:36,024 --> 00:55:38,741
I don't feel like guessing.
Guess!

664
00:55:38,928 --> 00:55:41,863
Guess! Three hundred dollars?

665
00:55:45,803 --> 00:55:48,039
That's right.
Why'd you guess that?

666
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:49,613
It just popped into my head.

667
00:55:49,774 --> 00:55:52,262
Most people would've
guessed lower.

668
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,512
Three hundred dollars
is a lot of money.

669
00:55:54,677 --> 00:55:57,939
I feel like my life
is finally starting.

670
00:55:59,048 --> 00:56:01,187
Ladies?

671
00:56:03,687 --> 00:56:08,194
What a beautiful... room.
Wouldn't Ruth love this, Bessie?

672
00:56:08,459 --> 00:56:11,492
This place gives me the creeps.
Marry me, Coral.

673
00:56:11,694 --> 00:56:14,312
Yes, Lance, yes. I want to be your wife.

674
00:56:14,965 --> 00:56:17,038
Oh, Coral, do you mean it?
I'll drop the charges.

675
00:56:17,234 --> 00:56:20,104
What are Coral
and Lance up to today?

676
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:24,297
I'm going to show you something over
here that we're particularly proud of.

677
00:56:24,543 --> 00:56:28,253
Uh, this is our state-of-the-art
physical therapy room.

678
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,909
Right over here.

679
00:56:30,616 --> 00:56:32,372
Oh!

680
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:35,389
I wouldn't mind living here.
This is great.

681
00:56:36,823 --> 00:56:38,645
Yeah, isn't that?
Hello, Doctor.

682
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:46,061
Also we have a full range
of activities for our residents.

683
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:51,220
Uh, computer games,
a video library, sing-alongs,

684
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:54,671
nerf basketball, date nights.
Who's Dad gonna date?

685
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:58,771
You'd be surprised, Miss Wakefield.
Women outnumber men here five to one.

686
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,864
I don't think we can afford
such a nice place though.

687
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:05,849
Well, if you dropped into a lower income
bracket you could qualify for financial aid.

688
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:09,701
Lower? Seventy percent of our residents
have qualified for assistance...

689
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:12,132
by spending their savings
and their home equity.

690
00:57:12,297 --> 00:57:15,364
On something that has no resale value
and cannot be considered an asset.

691
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,673
Lower?
What do they buy?

692
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:20,293
Most buy very elaborate
tombstones.

693
00:57:21,774 --> 00:57:23,400
I'm gonna wait in the car.

694
00:57:25,846 --> 00:57:29,075
Do you have something
that I can take with me?

695
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:30,711
Of course.

696
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:47,400
Bet the boys are hungry.
Want me to make lunch?

697
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:49,709
Why can't you take Dad and Ruth?
I don't think so.

698
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,940
You could move down here.
You could have the house!

699
00:57:52,107 --> 00:57:55,206
No. I got Hank to think about.
He's very unhappy there.

700
00:57:55,444 --> 00:57:58,128
Of course he's unhappy.
If he were happy, he wouldn't be there.

701
00:57:58,314 --> 00:58:01,576
You could have him transferred. You
could find a very nice place for him here.

702
00:58:01,784 --> 00:58:04,337
You could have the whole house!
You could have the sunshine.

703
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,823
You could find work down here, Lee.
No.

704
00:58:06,992 --> 00:58:09,381
Why not?
Just... no.

705
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,666
Give me one good reason. 'Cause I don't
want to! I made this decision once already.

706
00:58:11,998 --> 00:58:16,886
Hen Daddy had his first stroke, I made this decision the
I was not gonna waste my life.

707
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,519
You think I've wasted my life?
God, of course not.

708
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,325
I can't imagine a better way
to have spent my life.

709
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,681
Then we both made the right decision.
What decision?

710
00:58:25,879 --> 00:58:28,695
Dad got sick and I came down to help out
for a little while. You didn't.

711
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,312
I had plans, I had a husband.
I couldn't come down.

712
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:32,981
You didn't come down!

713
00:58:33,154 --> 00:58:35,543
What makes you think for a second
I didn't have plans?

714
00:58:35,722 --> 00:58:37,697
You know, you're just the most...

715
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,746
Come on, say it.
Say it, say it!

716
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:41,836
You've been saying it a million
different ways since I came down here.

717
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:44,963
Leave her alone!
What are you yelling at her for?

718
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:47,241
She wants to tell you
what a terrible person I am.

719
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:49,791
I have bent over backwards to be nice to
you from the moment you walked in that door.

720
00:58:49,972 --> 00:58:52,175
That's right. You are nice to me
when you want something.

721
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,762
What are you talking about? Come on, Hank.
You think Aunt Bessie's being nice to you...

722
00:58:54,944 --> 00:58:57,944
all of a sudden because she...
what, felt an urge?

723
00:58:58,148 --> 00:58:59,745
What? Shut up.
Come on, come on.

724
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:02,020
Listen, did you ever get a birthday
present from your Aunt Bessie?

725
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:05,000
I thought about my nephews.
I thought about you all the time.

726
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:06,879
It's just...
How 'bout a card?

727
00:59:07,058 --> 00:59:10,091
Did you ever get a card from your Aunt
Bessie? We were not close. We were...

728
00:59:10,294 --> 00:59:11,985
You didn't speak to me
for 20 years!

729
00:59:12,129 --> 00:59:15,609
You're supposed to take care of your
family. I took care of my family!

730
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:18,866
I raised two kids all by myself.
Never even heard from you people.

731
00:59:19,073 --> 00:59:22,269
I am finally getting my life together.
Nobody's gonna take it away from me.

732
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:25,686
I can't wait to get out of here!

733
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,679
Thanks a lot
for helping me out, Charlie.

734
00:59:37,826 --> 00:59:40,575
It's a lot to ask of someone
to donate their bone marrow.

735
00:59:40,762 --> 00:59:43,063
I think it sounds neat.

736
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,751
Could I have your
medical history card, please?

737
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:48,488
Bob. Bob!

738
00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:50,842
Could I have your
medical history card, please?

739
00:59:53,442 --> 00:59:56,312
What grade are you in now, Hank?
Oh, I'm Charlie.

740
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:58,422
I'm Dr. Wally.

741
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:04,524
Um, you have
to fill out one too.

742
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:07,406
Oh, no, he's not here to get the test.
Okay.

743
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:26,515
Hank, am I reading
your medical card correctly?

744
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,710
Uh, are you currently on lithium?
Yeah.

745
01:00:29,914 --> 01:00:31,801
It's a great drug,
isn't it?

746
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:35,402
Uh...
Can I ask you something?

747
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,887
Did you find you put on
a lot of weight since?

748
01:00:38,056 --> 01:00:39,878
No.

749
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,253
No.

750
01:00:43,962 --> 01:00:45,937
Hmm.

751
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,822
Nervous?
No.

752
01:00:57,012 --> 01:00:59,183
Uh, thank you.
Thank you.

753
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:03,246
You know, these offices
used to be infested with bugs.

754
01:01:04,885 --> 01:01:07,057
Well, bugs don't bother me.

755
01:01:07,223 --> 01:01:09,078
No?
Well, you know.

756
01:01:09,192 --> 01:01:11,614
They crawl out of the drain
in the boys shower.

757
01:01:11,795 --> 01:01:16,049
Sometimes they, like, hide
in the junk pile in the auto shop.

758
01:01:16,266 --> 01:01:17,793
They, like, float around in the soap
basin in the sink. You get used to 'em.

759
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:20,268
I wouldn't.
There's this one dude in my room...

760
01:01:20,403 --> 01:01:22,825
There's 12 of us in this one room,
right? This one dude,

761
01:01:23,005 --> 01:01:25,111
he catches bugs and he puts them
on, like, this little leash.

762
01:01:25,274 --> 01:01:26,998
A leash?
Yeah, it's a hair leash.

763
01:01:27,144 --> 01:01:29,315
He takes out a strand of his hair,
he ties it around the bug.

764
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:32,196
The other end he tacks down
under his bunk. One time...

765
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:35,994
he had this whole zoo of bugs walkin'
around in circles all over the place. Hank.

766
01:01:36,222 --> 01:01:39,768
My friend, he grabbed the back of his
cafeteria tray, and he smashed them all!

767
01:01:41,994 --> 01:01:44,132
That was funny.

768
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:48,323
Why are you making up these stories?
What do you mean?

769
01:01:48,602 --> 01:01:52,017
These stories:
Razors under the tongue, hair leashes.

770
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,437
I'm not makin' anything up. Why did
you pretend you weren't going to tested?

771
01:01:55,644 --> 01:01:58,361
Oh, you, you think
I'm lyin' about that too?

772
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:00,783
Okay, fine, you win!
I'm lying!

773
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:13,376
Hank, I...
I haven't told you shit, all right?

774
01:02:13,531 --> 01:02:15,768
You don't know anything about shere they've
got me now. Then, tell me if you want.

775
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:18,137
No, you don't know. Okay?
Tell me, Hank.

776
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:20,636
You don't know!
Tell me!

777
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:24,832
I was in the hospital
I hated it. I was scared.

778
01:02:29,081 --> 01:02:31,023
You know, there's this one dude...

779
01:02:31,183 --> 01:02:33,867
If this is another tall tale,
I'm not interested in this.

780
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:40,105
I'm going inside.
I'm gonna see if Charlie's done.

781
01:03:03,682 --> 01:03:06,748
I played in a pool tournament
in my ward.

782
01:03:06,953 --> 01:03:08,579
Mom tell you that?
No.

783
01:03:10,857 --> 01:03:13,824
I came in fourth.

784
01:03:14,026 --> 01:03:16,098
It's true.

785
01:03:16,263 --> 01:03:18,598
She doesn't think it's
such a big deal, though.

786
01:03:18,765 --> 01:03:20,870
Well, that's... great.

787
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:25,451
Got my toe broken in there.
How?

788
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,357
This guy threw this garbage can.
It landed right on my foot.

789
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,169
Why'd he do that?

790
01:03:30,846 --> 01:03:33,115
No reason I know of.

791
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:39,567
There's a lot of drugs
that float around in there.

792
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:41,545
Do you take them?

793
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:46,196
Most of the time I just keep to myself.
Mm-hmm.

794
01:03:47,965 --> 01:03:51,991
I think, like, what it would
be like to be... someone else.

795
01:03:54,008 --> 01:03:57,357
Like, I could have this house
with all this land around it.

796
01:03:57,577 --> 01:04:01,669
Have a bunch of dogs runnin' around wild
and build, like, a go-cart track.

797
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:05,625
Man, those places make so much money.
We'd be rakin' that stuff in.

798
01:04:09,189 --> 01:04:12,156
And nobody would know where I was.
Yeah.

799
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:14,268
Just be gone.

800
01:04:16,997 --> 01:04:20,707
Most of the time I just think about...
bein' someplace else.

801
01:04:20,936 --> 01:04:23,554
Then why aren't you?
Hmm?

802
01:04:23,738 --> 01:04:26,193
Why aren't you someplace else?
What do you mean?

803
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:28,798
You're the one that told me
people only do what they want.

804
01:04:28,978 --> 01:04:30,505
Yeah?
So?

805
01:04:30,646 --> 01:04:33,557
You must want to be there.
No, no way!

806
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:36,628
Then show them you don't need to be
there, Hank. It's not easy like that.

807
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,667
I don't want you wasting your life
in there, Hank. Well, neither do I.

808
01:04:39,857 --> 01:04:41,897
Then why are you still there?
Because they put me there!

809
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,332
Why did they put you there?
'Cause I burned down the house.

810
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:47,747
Why did you
burn down the house?

811
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,422
Hank, you wanna come inside?

812
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,331
We can get you started...

813
01:04:52,438 --> 01:04:55,340
while we're getting some orange juice
for little Charlie.

814
01:05:01,878 --> 01:05:04,245
Would you come back there
with me?

815
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,938
Sure, I would.

816
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:35,554
If-forgot my coffee.

817
01:05:35,684 --> 01:05:38,367
Why are you drinking coffee
so late?

818
01:05:38,552 --> 01:05:40,113
I don't know. I... like it.

819
01:05:43,926 --> 01:05:47,504
You have a way with Hank.
Oh! I don't.

820
01:05:47,729 --> 01:05:49,769
Yeah, you do.

821
01:05:51,267 --> 01:05:52,828
He's a good boy.

822
01:05:55,805 --> 01:05:58,008
Is he?
Sure, he is.

823
01:05:58,174 --> 01:05:59,962
I wish I knew your secret.

824
01:06:00,109 --> 01:06:03,622
I don't know.
I just talk to him.

825
01:06:03,846 --> 01:06:05,734
You saying I don't?

826
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:12,532
I'm tired, and we've got
Disney World tomorrow.

827
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:27,877
I can fix that wig
for you, you know.

828
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:30,693
Does it look bad?
No.

829
01:06:30,878 --> 01:06:34,807
But if you have a wig, you should
try, uh, to have fun with it.

830
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,017
You should try different looks.
Uh... huh.

831
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:41,396
You know,
maybe something sporty.

832
01:06:41,557 --> 01:06:43,891
Maybe out-on-the-town,
evening kind of... thing.

833
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:45,945
Well, I just brush it now and then.
Uh... huh.

834
01:06:46,062 --> 01:06:50,088
I also have my whole makeup kit
down here. You wanna see?

835
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:54,346
Now this is a really great
night cream, Bessie. This is...

836
01:06:54,504 --> 01:06:57,286
Oh. Well, I don't know. I never
bother much with... makeup.

837
01:06:57,574 --> 01:06:59,232
Hmm. You should.

838
01:07:00,077 --> 01:07:02,695
Because it's fun.

839
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:05,945
And you never know
when you might meet somebody.

840
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,834
Oh, my goodness.
I haven't thought about a man in years!

841
01:07:09,054 --> 01:07:11,989
Oh... you're lying!

842
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:16,987
Lee?

843
01:07:18,664 --> 01:07:20,871
I'm sorry if we haven't
been seeing eye to eye.

844
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:23,270
I don't want us to fight.
I don't think we have been.

845
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:26,848
I want us to get along.
We do get along.

846
01:07:27,008 --> 01:07:30,456
No, but I mean I don't...
I don't want us to just get along.

847
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,549
I don't want us to be polite.
Well, okay.

848
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,604
I don't have
any problem with that.

849
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:38,207
I... I want...

850
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,701
I...

851
01:07:44,128 --> 01:07:46,583
Nothing much seems important
to me right now.

852
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,783
I...
We're sisters.

853
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,706
Oh.
Shouldn't we...

854
01:07:58,943 --> 01:08:03,133
No, he just startles himself sometimes,
and then he goes right back to sleep.

855
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,211
Mmm.

856
01:08:12,725 --> 01:08:15,627
Are you seeing anybody now?
Usually.

857
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:18,229
I hope you have
someone real in your life.

858
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:21,911
I don't have any trouble with that.
Well, I...

859
01:08:22,136 --> 01:08:24,046
I'm not talking about that.
Well, you should be.

860
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,824
Hey, there's no reason why
you haven't had love in your life.

861
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:30,587
I had a true love.
You did?

862
01:08:30,813 --> 01:08:33,082
Yes.
Did he know?

863
01:08:33,249 --> 01:08:34,459
Yes.

864
01:08:35,619 --> 01:08:37,375
How could I not have known this?

865
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:39,692
Oh, he wasn't somebody
that you would know.

866
01:08:40,523 --> 01:08:44,778
Come on. It's not like
I'm gonna tell anybody.

867
01:08:45,896 --> 01:08:48,035
Clarence James.

868
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:53,650
Who? Well, he was only
around during the summers.

869
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,299
Oh, my... God!

870
01:08:56,474 --> 01:08:58,613
You went with a carny worker.
Well, he was a very nice person.

871
01:08:58,776 --> 01:09:00,816
I, I didn't say anything.

872
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:04,307
This is why I kept it a secret.
Wow! Which one was he?

873
01:09:06,619 --> 01:09:08,823
He mostly ran
the Ferris wheel.

874
01:09:12,492 --> 01:09:15,459
Oh, yeah, I remember him.
He was cute.

875
01:09:17,296 --> 01:09:18,638
Oh, yes.
And he had the funniest laugh.

876
01:09:18,764 --> 01:09:22,725
He'd open his mouth real wide
and... no sound would come out.

877
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:25,042
Oh, God!

878
01:09:30,545 --> 01:09:33,960
No sound would come out.

879
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:38,103
Wow.

880
01:09:38,285 --> 01:09:41,481
So, uh, what happened?

881
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:44,885
Well, you know how they
used to have that last picnic...

882
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,948
down by the river?
Yeah.

883
01:09:47,094 --> 01:09:49,166
Well, Clarence goes swimming...
Yeah.

884
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:52,330
And he knows everybody's
watching him and everybody's there.

885
01:09:52,534 --> 01:09:56,276
His family, his friends and...

886
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:58,512
You.
And me.

887
01:09:58,675 --> 01:10:02,352
And... An... And he's,
uh, laughing.

888
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:05,447
You know, he's making
that monkey face, that...

889
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:12,520
And this gets all of us laughing.
Then he dunks under the water...

890
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:14,763
Yeah.
And he pops up again, and he's...

891
01:10:14,925 --> 01:10:18,373
He's laughing even harder. Then he dives
under again, and he doesn't come up.

892
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,086
And he doesn't come up.
Yeah.

893
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:23,470
And he doesn't come up.

894
01:10:27,774 --> 01:10:29,530
What?

895
01:10:29,675 --> 01:10:32,228
Yeah.

896
01:10:32,411 --> 01:10:35,258
Laughing and choking
looked the same on Clarence.

897
01:10:37,216 --> 01:10:39,355
He drowned. And...

898
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:43,671
We...

899
01:10:43,858 --> 01:10:47,633
Oh, God, we were just...
standing there watching him.

900
01:10:49,063 --> 01:10:52,675
Oh, my... God!

901
01:10:54,537 --> 01:10:56,609
I can't believe
you never told me this.

902
01:10:56,772 --> 01:11:00,701
If I couldn't tell people I had a
carny boyfriend I couldn't tell them...

903
01:11:00,944 --> 01:11:03,726
my carny boyfriend drowned.
Yeah, but you should've told me.

904
01:11:03,914 --> 01:11:06,980
We were never that close.

905
01:11:08,687 --> 01:11:10,377
We weren't?

906
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,817
No.

907
01:11:24,636 --> 01:11:26,709
Want me to do somethin'
with that wig?

908
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:30,483
What?
I don't know. Let me see it.

909
01:11:30,711 --> 01:11:34,060
Well, here.
No. Y... You gotta take it off.

910
01:11:36,016 --> 01:11:37,325
Oh?

911
01:11:37,484 --> 01:11:39,491
I'm not gonna hurt it.

912
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:42,556
Oh.
Here.

913
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:45,060
Lee...
It's a good wig, Bessie.

914
01:11:45,293 --> 01:11:48,709
It's nicely wentilated. We can do
something with this. You want me to?

915
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:51,973
Uh, sure.

916
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,929
Yeah, it's a good weave.

917
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,973
I'm glad that we made this trip.
I wish we could stay longer.

918
01:12:08,152 --> 01:12:10,159
Here.
I'll go get my brush.

919
01:12:29,774 --> 01:12:30,951
I found it.

920
01:13:30,642 --> 01:13:31,624
Okay.

921
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,669
Whoa!
Well, hello!

922
01:13:40,854 --> 01:13:42,447
Bessie!

923
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:45,622
Wait a minute. Do you like it?
Oui.

924
01:13:45,825 --> 01:13:48,640
Gettin' real hot in this room, huh?

925
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,556
Huh?

926
01:14:05,249 --> 01:14:08,282
Is that too much wind
for you, Hank?

927
01:14:08,419 --> 01:14:11,234
What?
Is that too much wind?

928
01:14:11,419 --> 01:14:13,274
No, it's okay.

929
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:16,716
Stick your hand
out the window, Charlie.

930
01:14:16,925 --> 01:14:19,445
It's like an airplane.

931
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:22,520
Whee!

932
01:14:36,113 --> 01:14:38,349
Here we go!
Whee!

933
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,688
Whee... ee!
Excuse me.

934
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:59,257
Here we go!

935
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:02,308
Faster!
Ooh, Charlie, faster!

936
01:15:02,509 --> 01:15:04,232
Faster! Ooh!

937
01:15:04,409 --> 01:15:06,548
Beep, beep! Comin' through!

938
01:15:07,513 --> 01:15:09,935
Hold on, Aunt Ruth.

939
01:15:10,116 --> 01:15:12,986
Faster! Faster!
Faster!

940
01:15:13,186 --> 01:15:15,903
Hey, Charlie, slow down.
Slow down.

941
01:15:16,089 --> 01:15:19,798
Okay, we'll meet you
by Pirates of the Caribbean in an hour.

942
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:21,852
An hour?
Yeah. Right where the line starts.

943
01:15:21,997 --> 01:15:24,233
All right. Bye.
Bye.

944
01:15:39,584 --> 01:15:41,045
Oh, God!

945
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,309
This Swiss Family thing
tree house is huge.

946
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:03,140
I'm really proud of you, Hank.

947
01:16:03,343 --> 01:16:05,830
For gettin' tested
for Bessie.

948
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:13,193
You're disgusting.

949
01:16:17,992 --> 01:16:20,545
Charlie, do you want me
to push Aunt Ruth for a while?

950
01:16:20,729 --> 01:16:21,939
I like pushing.

951
01:16:22,098 --> 01:16:24,367
Okay.
He's a good driver.

952
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:27,731
Well, I'll catch up with you.
I'm just gonna sit in the sun, okay?

953
01:16:27,937 --> 01:16:29,792
All right. Bye, bye.
Bye, bye.

954
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:31,947
Hold on. Here we go.

955
01:16:38,116 --> 01:16:41,083
So why don't you pick out
something nice for your Aunt Bessie?

956
01:16:41,286 --> 01:16:43,653
How about my bone marrow?
You think she'd like that?

957
01:16:44,656 --> 01:16:47,183
Hey, look!

958
01:16:47,326 --> 01:16:49,691
Love Bug. Remember?

959
01:16:49,829 --> 01:16:51,968
We saw that on TV.
We watched it together.

960
01:16:52,132 --> 01:16:56,125
No. I remember Dad took me
to see Indiana Jones, though.

961
01:16:56,935 --> 01:16:59,553
You know, I think you're
doin' really well on this trip.

962
01:16:59,672 --> 01:17:01,079
Sort of. Stop it.

963
01:17:02,343 --> 01:17:06,020
Tomorrow, when we go back, everybody's
gonna hear about how well you did.

964
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:07,653
I said, stop it.

965
01:17:07,814 --> 01:17:10,564
I'm not going back.
I'm staying with Aunt Bessie.

966
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:20,714
Peter pan. Careful.

967
01:17:20,862 --> 01:17:23,646
That was a cute movie.
Yeah, I remember I saw it with Dad.

968
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,871
Yeah. No, you didn't.
Yeah, we went to a drive-in.

969
01:17:26,035 --> 01:17:28,140
No.
I saw it in his old Thunderbird.

970
01:17:28,304 --> 01:17:30,192
No, no, no, no!

971
01:17:30,339 --> 01:17:33,655
Not with your dad. You wanna know somethin'
about your dad? I'll tell you somethin'.

972
01:17:33,876 --> 01:17:37,193
On Saturdays I...
I worked.

973
01:17:37,415 --> 01:17:41,409
Your dad took care of you. And sometimes
on Saturdays you would get hurt.

974
01:17:41,654 --> 01:17:43,890
He said that you roughhoused
too much.

975
01:17:44,055 --> 01:17:45,550
Yeah, so?
So...

976
01:17:45,725 --> 01:17:49,271
I would yell at you and tell you
to stop roughhousing so much.

977
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:53,205
But you would still get hurt...
every time I left you with him.

978
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:57,393
So I would yell at you and yell at you, and
I would beg you to stop making him hurt you...

979
01:17:57,637 --> 01:18:00,637
because... he was my husband
and I loved him.

980
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,695
And what was I supposed to do?

981
01:18:03,677 --> 01:18:05,204
Then Charlie was born.

982
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:08,774
So I packed you kids up and I...

983
01:18:08,915 --> 01:18:10,955
Dad never hit me.

984
01:18:11,117 --> 01:18:13,768
Oh, yeah, he did.
No, I would remember that.

985
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:15,679
You were four years old.

986
01:18:15,823 --> 01:18:18,027
You're the one that fought
with him and not me, okay?

987
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:20,297
Yeah, but he hit you.

988
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,503
My feelings for you, Hank,
are like a big bowl of...

989
01:18:30,775 --> 01:18:34,189
fish hooks.

990
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,799
I can't just pick one up
at a time.

991
01:18:37,014 --> 01:18:40,810
I pick one up and they all come,
so I just had to leave'em alone.

992
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:45,807
You're a liar.

993
01:19:00,971 --> 01:19:02,149
Ohh,

994
01:20:01,572 --> 01:20:03,743
Oh, my God!

995
01:20:03,909 --> 01:20:06,113
Don't touch her.

996
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:09,400
Somebody should get some help.

997
01:20:14,121 --> 01:20:16,161
What happened?
I fainted.

998
01:20:16,323 --> 01:20:18,657
Yeah.
There was blood in my mouth.

999
01:20:18,825 --> 01:20:21,062
Is your mouth still bleeding?
Uh... uh.

1000
01:20:21,229 --> 01:20:24,262
No. Did a doctor look at me?

1001
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:28,460
No. He... He just thought you fainted,
so he carried you in here...

1002
01:20:28,703 --> 01:20:30,677
Who's he?
To lie down.

1003
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,728
Uh, Goofy.

1004
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:35,013
Goofy?
Yeah.

1005
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:38,144
Goofy carried me to Mickey's house?
Yeah.

1006
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:40,618
Yeah.

1007
01:20:43,086 --> 01:20:45,191
He just probably...
he didn't know you were bleeding,

1008
01:20:45,388 --> 01:20:49,480
so maybe you... felt faint
because you baven't been eating.

1009
01:20:49,727 --> 01:20:53,753
Maybe that's all it is
I fainted 'cause I was scared.

1010
01:20:53,998 --> 01:20:57,356
I can't sleep anymore, Lee.
I never sleep.

1011
01:20:57,536 --> 01:21:00,219
I'm afraid to close my eyes because...
Oh, Bess.

1012
01:21:00,405 --> 01:21:02,893
Oh, if I close my eyes,
Don't, don't.

1013
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:05,210
I'm not gonna wake up.
No, no, no, no.

1014
01:21:05,373 --> 01:21:07,861
And so I just jerk myself awake.

1015
01:21:08,044 --> 01:21:11,427
I yank myself awake
all night long, and then...

1016
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:13,021
Yeah.

1017
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,038
And then I pour myself
a cup of coffee, but...

1018
01:21:16,286 --> 01:21:19,831
I. I'm trying to be brave, but I'm so...
Oh, darlin', I know, I know.

1019
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:22,359
I'm scared.
I know. It's all right.

1020
01:21:22,526 --> 01:21:25,625
But you're gonna be okay, you know?
You're gonna be okay. You are.

1021
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:28,482
What do you have to be scared about?
Come on. You have...

1022
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:32,147
There's still Hank and Charlie to think
about. You're forgetting about them. Huh?

1023
01:21:32,403 --> 01:21:35,665
You're gonna be... You're gonna be okay.
Yeah, you are.

1024
01:21:35,874 --> 01:21:39,703
Where are they?
They're sittin' outside.

1025
01:21:41,213 --> 01:21:43,995
You're so lucky
to have those boys.

1026
01:21:46,253 --> 01:21:48,708
I know I am.
They're good boys,

1027
01:21:48,889 --> 01:21:51,093
both of 'em.

1028
01:21:51,258 --> 01:21:53,679
We're fooling ourselves, Lee.

1029
01:21:53,895 --> 01:21:56,131
Hank and Charlie
aren't gonna match.

1030
01:21:56,297 --> 01:22:00,226
I won't pretend any longer. I have too
many decisions to make before you leave.

1031
01:22:00,469 --> 01:22:04,560
No, we don't have to make any now. We're
gonna hear about the boy's tests tomorrow.

1032
01:22:23,595 --> 01:22:24,544
Hank?

1033
01:22:59,668 --> 01:23:02,767
I haven't had reason
to pretty myself up...

1034
01:23:02,972 --> 01:23:06,682
since, oh, I can't think when.

1035
01:23:06,944 --> 01:23:08,024
Well,

1036
01:23:08,145 --> 01:23:09,967
today is the day.

1037
01:23:10,147 --> 01:23:12,995
They almost got married
once before.

1038
01:23:13,184 --> 01:23:16,533
But Amber
set the church on fire.

1039
01:23:16,756 --> 01:23:20,912
Ha. So, is Coral
the same character...

1040
01:23:21,156 --> 01:23:23,971
who shot Lance's dad in the head?
Uh... huh.

1041
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,494
And now they're getting married?

1042
01:23:26,664 --> 01:23:30,919
Well, he lived.
And she felt awful about it.

1043
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:32,923
Huh.

1044
01:23:40,243 --> 01:23:42,415
Oh!

1045
01:23:42,581 --> 01:23:45,002
Oh, Charlie.

1046
01:23:45,183 --> 01:23:48,118
What a good job!

1047
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,741
Ruth, you look beautiful!

1048
01:23:51,692 --> 01:23:55,554
Oh. Don't make fun of me.
I'm not.

1049
01:23:55,828 --> 01:23:59,985
I'm just a silly old woman getting
all dressed up for a TV show.

1050
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:01,696
No, you're not.

1051
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,936
Charlie, where's your brother?
I don't know.

1052
01:24:06,607 --> 01:24:08,429
Hank?

1053
01:24:41,046 --> 01:24:43,020
Hey!
Hey.

1054
01:24:43,181 --> 01:24:46,148
What are you doin' up?
Oh, I'm gonna get Dad's 1:00.

1055
01:24:46,352 --> 01:24:49,581
Oh, I was gonna do that.
I can do it.

1056
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:52,473
You're supposed to be resting.
I am.

1057
01:24:52,659 --> 01:24:56,074
You want some snacks?
I'm making some nachos here.

1058
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:58,087
Better just cut me up
some fruit.

1059
01:25:04,738 --> 01:25:06,648
Hello?

1060
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,077
Oh, yeah. She's here.

1061
01:25:09,243 --> 01:25:12,090
What is it? It's Dr. Wally.
He wants to talk to you.

1062
01:25:12,278 --> 01:25:14,351
Ohh.

1063
01:25:14,582 --> 01:25:17,103
Uh, hello.

1064
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:20,514
Oh, you did? Good!

1065
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:24,713
Um...

1066
01:25:27,063 --> 01:25:29,932
Well, what is...

1067
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:33,341
I see.

1068
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:37,432
Then, I should keep taking
what I'm taking now.

1069
01:25:41,214 --> 01:25:43,581
No. No, no.

1070
01:25:43,717 --> 01:25:45,627
No. I understand.

1071
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:48,502
N... I'm not. Okay.

1072
01:25:50,825 --> 01:25:54,174
Thank you.
Good-bye, Doctor.

1073
01:25:56,163 --> 01:25:58,434
Well, um...

1074
01:25:58,566 --> 01:26:02,843
They got the boys' test results back,
and it looks like it didn't work out.

1075
01:26:04,638 --> 01:26:07,540
Oh. Well, I mean, it's, it's
pretty much what we expected.

1076
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:09,979
We knew that the...
What?

1077
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:16,152
Maybe they should do the test again.
Maybe they made a mistake.

1078
01:26:16,351 --> 01:26:18,173
Maybe. Now...

1079
01:26:19,689 --> 01:26:22,656
I'm gonna continue taking
the therapies I'm taking now.

1080
01:26:22,826 --> 01:26:25,673
That's good. That's real...
That's good, because...

1081
01:26:25,862 --> 01:26:29,474
those are good things to be doing.
Okay.

1082
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:33,726
Um, we should tell
the boys.

1083
01:26:35,139 --> 01:26:38,041
Well, I was in the middle
of doing something. I...

1084
01:26:39,878 --> 01:26:41,634
What was I do...
Lee? Oh, Dad!

1085
01:26:45,286 --> 01:26:47,707
Oh.

1086
01:26:47,889 --> 01:26:50,278
You wanna go lie down now?

1087
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:52,665
No, no, no, no.
I'm...

1088
01:26:52,794 --> 01:26:55,412
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just, uh...

1089
01:26:55,598 --> 01:26:57,605
Here, I can do this.
I just, uh...

1090
01:26:57,766 --> 01:27:00,351
No, no, no, Lee.
It's okay.

1091
01:27:13,584 --> 01:27:15,307
Oh, Lee.

1092
01:27:16,787 --> 01:27:18,543
I've been so lucky.

1093
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:21,052
Oh, Bessie.

1094
01:27:21,225 --> 01:27:25,153
I've been so lucky
to have Dad and Ruth.

1095
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,797
I've had such love
in my life.

1096
01:27:28,567 --> 01:27:30,672
You know, I look back...

1097
01:27:30,837 --> 01:27:35,115
and I've had such...
such love.

1098
01:27:36,442 --> 01:27:38,547
They love you very much.

1099
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:41,166
No, that's not what I mean.
No, no.

1100
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:47,084
I mean that I love them.

1101
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:51,477
I've been so lucky to have
been able to love someone so much.

1102
01:27:53,692 --> 01:27:55,514
Yeah, you are.
Yeah.

1103
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,220
Lee,

1104
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:02,781
we should tell Hank, huh?

1105
01:28:05,705 --> 01:28:08,324
About the tests.
Yeah.

1106
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:10,615
We will.

1107
01:28:16,017 --> 01:28:18,700
I better...
I better...

1108
01:29:33,037 --> 01:29:34,346
Where'er you going'?

1109
01:29:40,814 --> 01:29:41,991
Uh, uh, I'm going'...

1110
01:30:04,605 --> 01:30:06,394
Goin' into the kitchen.

1111
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:08,875
Nobody's had any lunch yet,
have they?

1112
01:30:11,609 --> 01:30:13,617
Hey.
What?

1113
01:30:16,683 --> 01:30:17,860
Oh, nothing.

1114
01:30:17,983 --> 01:30:21,440
But just... If you decide to take
a ride or something, just...

1115
01:30:21,622 --> 01:30:24,491
You oughta let me know.

1116
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:32,953
I worry about you.

1117
01:30:38,806 --> 01:30:40,116
Okay.

1118
01:30:42,777 --> 01:30:44,370
Okay.

1119
01:31:06,071 --> 01:31:07,533
Dad? Look.

1120
01:31:07,672 --> 01:31:09,079
Ooh.

1121
01:31:16,682 --> 01:31:18,243
Hi.

1122
01:32:52,821 --> 01:32:55,093
Ooh.
Around and around.

1123
01:32:55,226 --> 01:32:56,599
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1124
01:33:03,934 --> 01:33:06,269
Yes.

1125
01:33:29,828 --> 01:33:30,755
Ooh, Ooh.

1126
01:34:06,537 --> 01:34:08,293
Dad.

1127
01:34:08,438 --> 01:34:11,340
Oh, see?

1128
01:34:12,209 --> 01:34:13,998
See?

1129
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:17,402
Just us.

1130
01:34:18,515 --> 01:34:21,581
Look. Dad, look.
Lee's here too.

1131
01:34:23,521 --> 01:34:25,496
You know Lee, don't you?

1132
01:34:32,532 --> 01:34:34,954
Bessie! Oh, Bessie!

1133
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:39,641
You missed it!
Coral finally married Lance.

1134
01:34:39,906 --> 01:34:42,077
But now,
wasn't Lance married to Coral's mother?

1135
01:34:42,276 --> 01:34:45,342
No. Coral was married
to Lance's father.

1136
01:34:45,546 --> 01:34:47,913
He's really a nice boy.
