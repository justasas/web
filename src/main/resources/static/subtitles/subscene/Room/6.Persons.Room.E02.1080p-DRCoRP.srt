00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,200
Excuse me.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,450
﻿Can we talk without pinching?

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,330
﻿Do you want

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,830
﻿Me to give you a kiss?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,620
﻿No, it's alright.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,990
﻿Don't be modest!

7
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,370
﻿Book Title - The Interpretation of Dreams

8
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,790
﻿Yes!

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,330
﻿Yes.

10
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,580
﻿Yes.

11
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,740
﻿Elder brother.

12
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,580
﻿Why are you not playing the game seriously? What are you thinking about?

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,370
﻿Even the dog shit is coming out!

14
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,290
﻿Aigoo- Is it my turn?

15
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,120
﻿You are a bit weird today.

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,990
﻿Why do you keep looking in Jiwon-unnie's direction?

17
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,950
﻿What are you talking about?

18
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,620
﻿When was I looking over there?

19
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,580
﻿Seriously...

20
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,830
﻿Could it be...

21
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,620
﻿You are interested in Jiwon-unnie?

22
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,740
﻿What...

23
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,540
﻿What...what the heck are you saying.

24
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,790
﻿Hey! Why would I have any liking for her?

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,740
﻿I...

26
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,790
﻿like...

27
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,160
﻿the pure and innocent style.

28
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,080
﻿Compared to the sexy style

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,240
﻿I prefer girls who are pure and innocent.

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,450
﻿That's the type of style I like.

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,830
﻿Darling, are you saying that you like the innocent type like me?

32
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,910
﻿Jerk.

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,080
Ajura handing it out

34
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,370
﻿Let me win!

35
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,240
﻿Let me and the Hwatu cards

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,200
﻿Become one.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,080
﻿Let me catch a good card.

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,580
﻿Seriously...

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,910
﻿Mother, why did you hit me!?

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,660
﻿This is very frail.

41
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,660
﻿Thankfully, this is a hospital

42
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,910
﻿I can lie down here immediately.

43
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,740
﻿What should I eat?

44
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,990
﻿Crazy bit...

45
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,160
﻿It's a bit weird.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,370
﻿She's...Ms. Jiwon, right?

47
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,240
﻿Yes, Crazy bitch.

48
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,490
﻿Yes, Lee Jiwon.

49
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,410
﻿But, why?

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,240
﻿From what I see, she’s...

51
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,870
﻿A bit stiff and introverted.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,160
﻿But I don't think she's a bad person.

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,450
﻿Why do you call her...

54
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,370
﻿Crazy bitch?

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,790
﻿I don't really know how to say...

56
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,080
﻿Dong is Dong.

57
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,290
﻿Crazy bitch is Crazy bitch.

58
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,990
﻿Why do you need any explanation?

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,620
﻿Mr. Minsoo?

60
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,580
﻿You are asking us why we call her by that nickname?

61
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,740
﻿About 3 weeks back

62
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,830
﻿Began the legend of the Crazy bitch.

63
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,040
[3 weeks ago]

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,410
﻿Are you looking for someone?

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,490
﻿Is this ward 313?

66
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,660
﻿Yes, that's right.

67
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,370
﻿This is such a mess.

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,990
﻿Patient...

69
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,450
﻿I took a while to find you.

70
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,660
﻿This is your bag.

71
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,700
﻿Currently, this is the only available bed.

72
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,700
﻿I didn’t intend to have a single-person room.

73
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,830
﻿But find me one that is a 2 or 3 persons room.

74
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,410
﻿For a patient like you that has light injuries, we can't do that...

75
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:29,870
﻿What!?
﻿For a patient like you that hasUight injuries, we can’t do that...

76
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,620
﻿For a patient like you that has light injuries, we can t do that...

77
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,740
﻿A patient needs to stay in a hospital.

78
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,160
﻿What do you mean by light injuries?

79
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,740
﻿Are you a doctor?

80
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,580
﻿No.

81
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,620
﻿I'm sorry.

82
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,740
Excuse me, Patient.

83
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,080
﻿Patients have to change into the patient outfit.

84
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
﻿Oh by the way, Unnie.

85
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,740
﻿I'm not going to wear the hospital's clothes.

86
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,540
﻿Wearing what others,have worn before is the most irritating.

87
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,290
﻿Also

88
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,700
﻿I will not eat the food the hospital provides.

89
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,580
﻿Don't leave any for me.

90
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,040
﻿But, patient...

91
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,000
﻿It's not that, but the hospital has clear rules...

92
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,330
Why is this person so inflexible?

93
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,160
﻿I said it's not necessary.

94
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,450
﻿This isn't something for me to decide.

95
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,870
﻿How many times must I tell you?

96
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,410
﻿Emotional labor is so tiring...

97
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,580
﻿If that's the case...

98
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,080
﻿If you don't get abused, it would be weird.

99
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,580
﻿Why did a crazy bitch come here?

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,990
﻿Unnìes

101
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,290
﻿Shouldn't we put a stop to the crazy bitch?

102
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,290
﻿This isn't some penitentiary center.

103
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,580
﻿If there's a problem

104
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,160
﻿Just give it to the Ahjummas here.

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,080
﻿What!?

106
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,540
﻿- Ahjumma!? 
- Ahjumma!?

107
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,410
﻿On the second day

108
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,580
﻿Something happened.

109
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,660
﻿Are the patients alright?

110
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,370
﻿Yes sir.

111
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,740
﻿You didn't put on make up today?

112
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,620
﻿How s your injury?

113
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,040
﻿Yes...

114
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,540
﻿Thanks to you, I'm much better.

115
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,830
﻿For someone of your age

116
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,120
﻿It's not suitable to dance such vigorous dances.

117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,410
﻿What treatment do you think this patient should get?

118
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,580
﻿From the current state

119
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,620
﻿The skin hasn't deteriorated.

120
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,120
﻿With another month of continuous treatment

121
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,580
﻿And with the patient s agreement on doing cosmetic surgery

122
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,120
﻿The scars can all be removed.

123
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,040
﻿Did she explain it clearly?

124
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,700
﻿Yes.

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,200
﻿Good.

126
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,410
﻿Thank you doctor.

127
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,950
﻿For such a patient

128
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,740
﻿Due to improper posture

129
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,580
﻿Which results in turtle neck

130
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,700
﻿Lumbar disc protrusion

131
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,620
﻿And carpal tunnel syndrome.

132
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,290
﻿You can say this is a common illness of the modern person.

133
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,490
﻿You.

134
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,200
﻿Yes?

135
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,330
﻿Do you know the treatment for turtle nec <.

136
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,410
﻿Yes. It s...

137
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,700
﻿First, you need plenty of rest.

138
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,410
﻿And you need to fix your posture.

139
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,910
﻿So in short...

140
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,240
﻿For neck protrusion resulting in scoliosis

141
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,740
﻿The basic treatment is correction treatment or physiotherapy.

142
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,370
﻿For this missus, to improve without surgery is a rare occurence.

143
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,910
﻿In such a situation, we can have cervical spine surgery

144
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,450
﻿That is to sak that in the event her nerves are not being compressed

145
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,540
﻿There is no need for surgery.

146
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,790
﻿And compared to having too much rest, having suitable amounts of exercise

147
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,620
﻿Will be very helpful for treatment.

148
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,620
﻿That is all.

149
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,240
﻿Applause.

150
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,410
﻿So you know that your posture is important, right?

151
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,990
﻿You need to frequently maintain a straight back.

152
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,830
﻿And do more yoga stretching exercises.

153
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,080
﻿The region around the bone fracture when the accident happened

154
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,740
﻿Is in the midst of recovery after supportive physiotherapy.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,740
﻿If it's early stage bone fracture

156
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,790
﻿Through repeated compression support

157
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,910
﻿It will usually be diagnosed as fully recovered.

158
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,870
﻿So clever.

159
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,790
﻿I don't have anything to say.

160
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,290
﻿But as a doctor

161
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,450
﻿I need to say something.

162
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,910
﻿So, Patient Kim Yoomi

163
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
﻿Eat well

164
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,120
﻿Sleep well and do well.

165
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,580
﻿So cute.

166
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,040
﻿Patient.

167
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,490
﻿We are doing our rounds.

168
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,700
﻿I'm opening the curtain.

169
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,830
﻿So sorry.

170
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,540
﻿Because of the change in place where I sleep

171
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,080
﻿I can't sleep well.

172
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,200
﻿This patient was involved in a minor traffic accident.

173
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,160
﻿According to CT and X-ray scans

174
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,450
﻿There's nothing serious.

175
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,620
﻿Then shouldn't she be in a normal ward?

176
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,950
﻿Oh, doctor.
﻿Yes.

177
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,910
﻿My heart seems to beat very fast.

178
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,660
﻿I'm not sure if it's a consequence of the accident.

179
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,910
﻿Even if it's a tiny sound

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,200
﻿I will be really shocked.

181
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,910
﻿My body is also feverish.

182
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,450
﻿If I do not strip to sleep at night

183
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,160
﻿I can't sleep at all.

184
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,540
