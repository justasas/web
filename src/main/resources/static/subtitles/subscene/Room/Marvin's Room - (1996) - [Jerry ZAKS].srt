1
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,300
Janine?

2
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,000
I Wonder how Iing I'II have
to wait

3
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,800
because I Ieft Aunt Ruth
with Dad.

4
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
You'II see Dr. WaIIy.

5
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,900
Dr. Surabh is on vacation.

6
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,800
See Dr. who?

7
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,500
I'II be right back.

8
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,700
I'II teII you,
needIes bother me aIone

9
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,500
Augustina couId I have your arm?

10
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,900
May I caII you Augustina?

11
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
My name's Bessie.

12
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
Bessie! I'm sorry.

13
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,600
It's been a bit hectic here.

14
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,100
Where's the what 'cha-ma-caII-it?

15
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,100
The tourniquet?

16
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,500
That's it.

17
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm sitting on it.

18
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,400
UsuaIIy Dr. Surabh
sees the patients.

19
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm a pathoIogist.

20
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,100
I bring Dad and Aunt Ruth in
to Dr. Sarabh.

21
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,600
I've seen your father.
He's a very fraiI man?

22
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,400
Dad's a bone.

23
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,100
I hope they're aII right for now.

24
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,000
They're fine.

25
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,000
Good.

26
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,300
Except Dad's dying.

27
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,000
He's been dying for 20 years,

28
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,500
doing it reaI sIow
so I don't miss a thing.

29
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,100
Dr. Surabh has worked a miracIe
with Aunt Ruth.

30
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,200
She's had back pain since
she was born.

31
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,200
But he had her get this
eIectronic anesthetizer.

32
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,100
You put the wires right
to your brain.

33
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,900
Anytime she has pain
she just turns the diaI.

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
That's wonderfuI.

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,400
Any time she uses it our
automatic garage door goes up,

36
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,800
but that's a smaII price to pay.

37
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,600
I agree.

38
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,300
Are those aII for me?

39
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,900
Yes, Dr. Surabh gave me
specific instructions.

40
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,200
That seems Iike a Iot of bIood.

41
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,300
It is Iot of bIood,
so what you're feeIing is normaI.

42
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,500
Why don't we get this over with?

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
This is seaIed so it's steriIe.

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
I think I'II come back Iater.

45
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,400
It's just a vitamin deficiency,
right?

46
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,600
I said it might be a vitamin
deficiency.

47
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,200
Good evening, Bruno's.

48
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,100
HoId, pIease.

49
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,500
Lee!

50
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,500
What?

51
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,400
TeIephone!

52
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,800
It feeIs so hard!

53
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,800
Don't touch it.

54
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,000
why put your hands in your hair
unIess you're nervous?

55
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,200
There's no reason to be nervous,
ever,

56
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,600
if you have a positive
mentaI attitude.

57
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,700
Switch!

58
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
QuietIy!

59
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,900
Yeah.

60
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Yeah?

61
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Excuse me , where do you --?

62
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Where do you take the --?

63
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Where's your brother?

64
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,900
He started it.

65
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,900
When we heard it broke our hearts

66
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,100
You can make it your own untiI

67
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,300
you get on your feet.

68
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,100
Do you have any reIatives?

69
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,600
No. WeII, my boys.

70
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,400
No reIatives.
That can be a bIessing.

71
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,200
No! PIease, Lance! Don't!

72
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,800
No, Lance, don't!

73
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,400
Stop! I'm warning you!

74
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,500
You disgust me.

75
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,600
We didn't make Iove we had sex.

76
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,300
Like animaIs.

77
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Like pets.

78
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,700
Hi, honey.

79
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Lance just raped CoraI.

80
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,900
I am surprised,

81
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
because CoraI performed the
surgery on him

82
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
that got his sight back.

83
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,100
CoraI's a doctor?

84
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,300
Has been for weeks now and does
that ever make Amber jeaIous!

85
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,000
Did you give Dad his 2 o'cIock?

86
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,500
I was going to.

87
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,700
Ruth!

88
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
I asked you to do one
IittIe thing!

89
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,900
AII right , aII right. Open.

90
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Open up.

91
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,300
You've sucked aII the ink
off the Yahtzee dice.

92
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,100
How are we going to pIay?

93
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,400
Huh, Dad ?AII right.

94
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,600
Are you okay?

95
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Is this his 1 o'cIock?

96
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,000
Stupid me

97
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm so useIess.

98
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
No, you're not.

99
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Come on, quit hogging the bed.

100
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,800
It's my cure.

101
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,500
You used to bIame the pain
and now you bIame the cure.

102
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,900
Open.

103
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,900
That's right. Good.

104
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,500
What happened?

105
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,400
The doctor took bIood.

106
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
It Iooks tender.
ShouIdn't you see a doctor?

107
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,600
I did . I have a vitamin deficiency.

108
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,000
You don't make stinky enough.

109
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,400
I do so !

110
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,100
Stinky is poison!

111
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,700
You have to get rid of it .

112
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,600
When you're constipated
you get a headache.

113
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,700
He needs his piIIs
at the same time.

114
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,100
You usuaIIy give Marvin his piIIs

115
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,800
But today I asked you to!

116
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,800
You shouIdn't Ieave me aIone.

117
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,900
What if he tries to kiII himseIf
with Parcheesi men?

118
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,600
he puts thing in his mouth

119
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,600
because he Iikes the way
they feeI.

120
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,100
What if he dies
whiIe you're gone?

121
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,500
Then you'II caII me,
and I'II come home

122
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,100
ShaII I make tomato soup?

123
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,900
No, you're just going
to make a mess of it.

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,700
I'II get you one of my vitamin
piIIs for your deficiency.

125
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,900
I'II get some reaI ones Iater.

126
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,500
Mine are reaI.

127
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,800
Do you want PebbIes or Bam-Bam?

128
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Dad!

129
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,100
Wait a second.

130
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,200
I know.

131
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,100
Let me do this for you.

132
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,800
Look what I got , Dad.

133
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,500
Look at that!

134
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,600
See?

135
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,500
Isn't that nice?

136
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,300
Is it nice, Dad?

137
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,900
What?

138
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
What do you see there?

139
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,300
is that the Northern Lights?

140
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
You want it over there?

141
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,300
Now I got you some carrots
and some butternut squash.

142
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,300
AII right , then,
how about some tomato soup?

143
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,400
And some juice.

144
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,900
And what does that face mean
Mr. Innocent?

145
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
You mind if I smoke?

146
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,300
Yes.

147
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,300
Thank you for asking.

148
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,000
How about if I bIow it out
this way?

149
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
There's no smoking on this fIoor.

150
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,700
Okay, I'II be reaI quiet.

151
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,800
It's good to see you here, Lee.

152
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
May I caII you Lee?

153
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,100
Sure.

154
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,300
We've missed you other days.
So has Hank.

155
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm sorry .

156
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,300
I with I couId visit more often,
but you know.

157
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,700
you're not a nurse, are you?

158
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I'm a psychiatrist.

159
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,400
You're the one Hank taIks to.

160
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm in charge of his therapy.

161
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,800
You know he Iies.

162
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,200
He toId his schooI counseIor
that I beat him.

163
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,200
So, see what I mean?

164
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
You're thinking,
''I wonder if she does beat him?''

165
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
You think I think that?

166
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,700
Don't you?

167
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,900
Do you want me to think that?

168
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
What do you mean?

169
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,900
What do you think I mean?

170
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,500
What do you mean,
''What do I think you mean?''

171
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,100
What do you think I mean by,
' What do you think I mean?''

172
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,500
We want you invoIved in Hank's
therapy to visit more often.

173
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,800
Doctor, can I be honest with you?

174
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,800
I have forced my way
through schooI,

175
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
and I'm about to get my degree.

176
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,700
And I'm picky now about the kind
of guy I'II go with.

177
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,000
And I keep... used to keep...
a reaIIy cIean house.

178
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,600
Hank makes fun of my degree

179
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,400
in cosmetoIogy he terrorizes
any guy I go out with.

180
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,000
This Iast one,

181
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,100
Hank made fun of his being
on paroIe

182
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,600
he made fun of how he hoIds
his Iiquor, of his Pinto!

183
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,800
Hank cost me a potentiaIIy
good reIationship.

184
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,100
And as for my house..

185
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,900
Hank is not something
I can controI.

186
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,700
What's the point of visiting?

187
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He says he misses you.

188
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm here . So Iet me see him.

189
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,200
You want one?

190
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hi, Hank. It's Mom.

191
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Can you hear me?

192
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,000
You be good.
I'II Ieave some of these.

193
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,200
So when you wake you can
have them.

194
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay, weII, I'II see you.

195
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,400
Does this count as a visit?

196
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,500
Do you think this counts
as a visit?

197
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,700
Excuse me.

198
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,200
Dr . WaIIy may be Iate.

199
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,400
He was an 1 1-month baby.

200
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
I was premature.

201
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Sorry to have kept you waiting .

202
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,200
I got stuck at the hospitaI.

203
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,100
You must be busy.

204
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,400
I wanted to check on your test.

205
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,900
I weighed one pound at birth.

206
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
No, you didn't , Bob.

207
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,900
I was this big.

208
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,900
FoIIow me.

209
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,200
Not you ,Bob.

210
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,300
FoIIow me.

211
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,400
So...how are we today?

212
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,000
You teII me.

213
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Dr. WaIIy speaking.

214
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,300
I know there's someone
in my office.

215
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,900
I am in my office.

216
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,100
That's aII right.

217
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,100
Yes.

218
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,000
Is there a probIem?

219
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,500
He's just new.

220
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,900
he'II get the hang of it.

221
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,300
With my bIood test.
Did it get Iost?

222
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,700
Because I was getting aII
worked up

223
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,500
thinking horribIe thoughts.

224
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,500
It's not Iost.

225
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,100
I wouId Iike to run other tests,
to ruIe out some possibiIities.

226
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,000
What possibiIities?

227
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Some I wouId Iike to ruIe out.

228
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,100
Do I have a vitamin deficiency?

229
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
We've ruIed that out.

230
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
ShouId we ruIe that out?

231
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,300
Don't be nervous.

232
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,200
I'm not nervous.

233
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,200
Good.

234
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm going to give a IocaI
anesthetic

235
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,300
and remove bone marrow
from your hip.

236
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,200
What?!

237
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,600
Not to be nosy, but what's
the test for?

238
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,600
Iet me do the worrying.

239
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,300
I'm thinking it's worse
than it is.

240
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
Is it serious,
Iike a brain tumor?

241
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,900
Oh, no.

242
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,100
M.S.?

243
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,500
No.

244
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,000
Cancer?

245
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,000
One of the possibiIities

246
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,700
I was hoping to ruIe out
is Ieukemia.

247
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,800
My mother had--

248
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,300
I know.

249
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,200
I saw that in your fiIe.

250
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,000
HoId aII my caIIs, pIease.

251
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,200
Bessie, I just--

252
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,500
Dr. WaIIy speaking.

253
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,200
Yes that was me.

254
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,700
Didn't you recognize my voice,
Bob?

255
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,600
That's aII right.

256
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,900
That's what I get for hiring
my brother.

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
I haven't feIt as bad IateIy,
not nearIy as tired.

258
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Lie on your side , face the waII
and we'II get this over with soon

259
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,100
What does it mean
if it's Ieukemia?

260
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,200
There are a variety of Ieukemias
and a variety of treatments.

261
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,100
If you have,

262
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,100
for exampIe chronic myeIogenous
Ieukemia a bone marrow transpIant

263
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,100
is a reaI option.

264
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400
We wouId test famiIy members
for possibIe donors.

265
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,400
You do have famiIy.

266
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,300
dad and Ruth.

267
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,700
Your fiIe mentioned a sister.

268
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,700
Yes, I do...I...

269
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,300
I have a sister, Lee.

270
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,400
Good.

271
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,800
I just had it done Iast week
and it's driving me crazy.

272
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,400
Is God punishing me for vanity,
or is it aIways that way?

273
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,700
If you have a permanent
done right

274
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,200
it shouIdn't itch you at aII.

275
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,800
Convent.

276
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Convent?

277
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,900
Sister Lee Lacker, pIease.

278
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,800
Sister Lee Lacker teIephone.

279
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,800
HeIIo?

280
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,900
Lee?

281
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,100
Hi, it's me, Bessie.

282
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,600
Bessie?

283
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,400
What's wrong?

284
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,100
They had reservations about
Ietting Hank go.

285
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,400
A week is aII we couId get.

286
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,300
But if one of us is a match--

287
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,500
We'II deaI with that then.

288
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,700
Hey.

289
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,200
Look at you.

290
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
You Iook Iike a pig.

291
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,900
I'm working on an engine.

292
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,100
They don't Iet you shower?

293
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,900
They toId me you were here,
so I came.

294
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,500
You behaving , yourseIf?

295
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,000
They're not strapping me
down anymore.

296
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,100
Don't abuse that priviIege.

297
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,100
How come you're visiting me?

298
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
I don't need a reason to visit .

299
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,800
You never visited before.

300
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,000
I did . you were unconscious.

301
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,400
it doesn't count. I didn't know.

302
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,900
Conscious or not,
I made the effort.

303
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,400
Your mother has news.

304
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,200
It's not good news.

305
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,600
But...

306
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,400
Doctor says it's okay to teII you

307
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,800
because partiaIIy I have
no choice.

308
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,000
what?

309
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,200
Your Aunt Bessie has Ieukemia.
She's not doing weII.

310
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,000
She might die.

311
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,400
I didn't know I had an
Aunt Bessie.

312
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,500
She 's been to the house.

313
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,500
When?

314
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Right after your dad
and I married.

315
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,100
Mom, I wasn't born yet.

316
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,200
I know I mentioned my sister.

317
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,700
I didn't know about her.

318
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Every goddamn Christmas I say ,

319
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,500
''Bessie didn't send a card again
either.''

320
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,500
Oh, Yeah.

321
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,700
That's your Aunt Bessie.

322
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,700
My sister.

323
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,200
As her reIatives,
they want to test us

324
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,100
maybe save her Iife with a bone
marrow transpIant--

325
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,300
It's onIy a week.

326
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Doctor says it's okay to go .

327
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Why wouId I want to go ?

328
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,200
Because one of us might
save her Iife.

329
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,700
Go cIean up.

330
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm not going to take you
Iike that.

331
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,900
Isn't there something you want
to say?

332
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,200
WiII this take Iong? We shouId go

333
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,900
Mom I'm sorry I burned
the house down.

334
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,100
Is that it? Because I'm reaIIy
anxious to get on the road.

335
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,100
No matches.

336
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,300
I've got to Iight the thing.

337
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,100
CharIie Iight this for him ,
pIease.

338
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,400
Being confined to your bed
is nothing to be afraid of.

339
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm not confined to my bed,
I'm just

340
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,800
I'm tired today.

341
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,000
I was confined to bed most
of my Iife.

342
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,800
You find things to do.

343
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Like what?

344
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,500
You can sIeep...
or you can Iay there awake.

345
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
you want this?

346
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,100
You must eat aII of that to make
yourseIf strong.

347
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,000
How's Dad?

348
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,600
He's fine.

349
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,200
Do you want your orange?

350
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
You can have it.

351
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,800
Not if you're going--

352
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,300
Thank you.

353
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,300
Does he miss me?

354
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,200
I haven't actuaIIy toId him
you're gone.

355
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,500
Doesn't he wonder where I am?

356
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I teII him you're just in the
other room busy with something

357
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,900
then he faIIs asIeep.

358
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and when he wakes I say he just
missed you.

359
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,700
Who does he think that nurse is?

360
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
I pretend not to notice her.

361
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
What do you mean?

362
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,600
If she waIks in the room
when I'm there...

363
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,600
I pretend that she doesn't exist.

364
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,700
What does Dad think ?

365
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,500
I think he thinks
he's haIIucinating.

366
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,300
You have to teII him.

367
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,800
The onIy time it bothers him is
when she carries him to the bath

368
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,600
and I say, ''OH, Marvin, Iook,
you're fIying!

369
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Bessie'II want to see this,
''and I run to get you.

370
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,900
He must think he's going mad.

371
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,700
What am I supposed to teII him?

372
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
That his IittIe girI is.

373
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,500
Then he'd reaIIy think he was
Iosing his mind.

374
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,900
It wouId be so upsetting to him.

375
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,600
He's your father.

376
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,600
AII right , Ruth.

377
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,600
I wouIdn't know what to say.

378
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,400
Here.

379
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,900
TeII him I'm going to be fine.

380
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,400
I know I am.

381
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,400
See?

382
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
That's okay. Sure.

383
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,900
What is Grandpa Iike?

384
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,100
I don't know , CharIie.
It's been a whiIe.

385
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,200
Why haven't we seen him before?

386
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,600
He's been sick. We were in Ohio.

387
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
It's hard to traveI
with IittIe kids.

388
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,200
What's Bessie Iike?

389
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,900
I don't know.

390
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,300
This is the first I've heard
from her in 20 years.

391
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,100
Why haven't you heard from her?

392
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,800
I couIdn't heIp her when Dad got
sick and she got mad at me.

393
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,600
Why?

394
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,900
Jesus! Shut up! Read your book.

395
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,300
You ever heard of Larry Lacker?

396
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:05,800
Who?

397
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,800
My dad. He's the greatest race
car driver ever.

398
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,900
No, I never heard of Larry Lacker

399
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,100
Those guys know Dad.

400
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,500
hi.

401
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Bessie.

402
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,100
Come on. Iet's go.

403
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
I was Iistening to that!

404
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,600
heIIo?

405
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,800
God. What are you staring at?

406
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,600
My goodness! Look at you !

407
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,700
What ?

408
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,000
Just Iook at you!

409
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,600
Oh, God, are you that oId?

410
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,400
How oId does that make me?

411
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,800
Why , I Iook oId?

412
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You're a Iot oIder...but--

413
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,900
You Iook reaIIy good, though,
Bessie.

414
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,400
I Iike your hair.

415
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,600
This is a wig. It's from my chemo

416
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,500
I know it's a wig.

417
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,200
I don't know why I pretended
not to.

418
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,000
Not that is Iooks Iike a wig.

419
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,500
I'm wearing a faII. Look.

420
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,000
See?

421
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,200
I Iove the Iength,

422
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,800
but I don't have the patience
for it,

423
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,900
I just wear it when I want to
Iook great.

424
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
You Iook good. though.

425
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,600
Thank you.

426
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,400
Sit down.

427
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,500
I've got to soak these.
Dad had an accident.

428
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,300
How is he?

429
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,000
He's stiII with us.

430
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,300
Let me heIp.

431
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,900
Oh , no.

432
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,600
You sure?

433
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,000
I've been doing it this Iong.

434
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,900
Daddy?

435
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,400
It's me.

436
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,200
Lee

437
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,900
AII the way down from Ohio.

438
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,100
You shouIdn't smoke in the house.

439
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,200
Dad's oxygen tanks.

440
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,000
You can smoke in the yard.

441
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,800
I don't have to smoke.

442
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Oh, Iook who it is!

443
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,900
Aunt Ruth!

444
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,700
You're up and about!

445
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
It's my cure. I'm part machine.

446
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,500
Are you going to give me a hug?

447
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,100
Give me a reaI hug.
I won't break!

448
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,400
Oh, sweet Jesus!

449
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
That's much better.

450
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,100
I brought cookies.

451
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,800
Thanks, Lee.

452
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,500
Dad and Ruth can't have sugar,

453
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,200
and I stay away from it too thins
is just a IoveIy canister.

454
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh, I'm missing my program.

455
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,500
You go watch your program.

456
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,500
Where are your boys?

457
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,300
Did Hank get out of the mentaI
institution?

458
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,600
We don't Iike to caII it that .

459
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,800
What do you caII it?

460
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,700
The nut house or Ioony bin,
to show we have a sense of humor

461
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,200
where is he ? Where's CharIey?

462
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,500
I've got two nephews
I've never seen!

463
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,100
I did invite you to Ohio for both
their christenings.

464
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,000
They're in the car.

465
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,400
The car?

466
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,700
Hank wiII do things Iike this
just to get attention.

467
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,400
They say to ignore it ,
or give him an uItimatum.

468
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,500
He hasn't agreed to be tested

469
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,700
because it makes him the center
of attention.

470
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,400
He hasn't ?

471
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,600
No.

472
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,500
Don't worry. He wiII.

473
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,500
I'II make him, if I have to.

474
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,100
How You can't make him come
in from the car.

475
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,600
Hey, you two! What the heII
are you doing?

476
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,400
I want to hear # 1 of the top
1 00 countdown.

477
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,000
What are they on?

478
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,400
86!

479
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm warning you! Get out of
the car now!

480
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,100

482
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,700
I expect a hug.

483
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,900
And you must be CharIie?

484
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,300

This is your Aunt Ruth. Come on,

486
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,500
He's excited about meeting you.

487
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,100
Let me get him ready.

488
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,600
He wants to make a good
impression.

489
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Marvin, company's coming!

490
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,900
Wake up!

491
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,600
This is Lee... your daughter.

492
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,800
And ...there's CharIie.

493
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Right there , see him?

494
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,700
And Hank.

495
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,500
Your grandsons.

496
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,700
It's okay.

497
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,500
He's not used to a Iot of peopIe.

498
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,400
What'd you do?

499
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,000
Nothing. I said heIIo.

500
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,000
Maybe we shouId cIear out.

501
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
Give him a second. Lee?

502
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,000
Were you offered chip?

503
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,600
They're to eat.

504
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,500
He must wait to be asked.

505
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,100
Put the chip back, Hank.

506
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,600
Put it back.

507
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,000
Put back the chip.

508
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,400
I put them there for the kids.

509
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,100
You must understand,
he has to wait to be asked.

510
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,900
No thanks, not right now.

511
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,800
The poIite thing to do wouId be
to take one.

512
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,400
I don't want one.

513
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,300
Then no DisneyworId.

514
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,100
I couId give a fuck!

515
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,400
That's it! Get out!

516
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,800
I don't care where.
Just so I can't see you.

517
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,000
WouId you Iike a chip?

518
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,200
Go ahead, if you want one.

519
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,300
Take a bunch.

520
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,700
Not too many.
You'II ruin your supper.

521
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,700
Don't get any crumb on
your aunt's fIoor.

522
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:15,300
Not Amber, no! No, Lance,
that's Amber! No!

523
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,500
I'm not used to somebody eIse
out here.

524
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,100
You want me inside?

525
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,500
No! UnIess, are you not supposed
to be here?

526
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,100
WiII your mother care?

527
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,000
No.

528
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,900
She's asIeep.

529
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,000
I don't see any harm in it.

530
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,100
We're aII gIad you're here.

531
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,000
We shouId do it every 1 7 years.

532
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,800
Your mom and I haven't aIways
gotten aIong.

533
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,300
So I wasn't in touch much.

534
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,200
I wish you couId have reaIIy
known your granddad.

535
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,400
He wouId've Ioved having
a boy around.

536
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,700
Do you ever wish he'd just die?

537
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,200
Don't ask that.

538
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,600
Why not?

539
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Because...it's rude.

540
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,500
I haven't decided about getting
tested.

541
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
What're you doing with the tooIs?

542
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,200
Looking. I'II put them back.

543
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,100
I didn't think you'd steaI them.
Take them.

544
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,500
ReaIIy?

545
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,900
Sure.

546
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,700
You'II give them to me?

547
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,400
Sure, why not?

548
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,000
They're cooI tooIs.

549
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,100
They were your granddad.

550
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,900
He'd Iike you to have them.

551
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,100
HospitaI won't Iet me keep them.

552
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,200
You won't be there forever.

553
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,400
They're going to move me into
a pIace for aduIts.

554
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,000
Why?

555
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,100
I turn 18 in three weeks.

556
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,500
Happy birthday.

557
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,100
If the fire hadn't spread it
wouIdn't be a big deaI.

558
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,000
They're making sure I'm no threat

559
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,300
You're probabIy the best.

560
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,600
A dude on my fIoor heId a razor
bIade under his tongue 5 hours.

561
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,200
He taIked, ate and everything.

562
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,600
Why wouId he do that?

563
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,100
He was trying to break my record.

564
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,700
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

565
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,700
I am grown up.

566
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,900
Marvin Iiked to fix stuff?

567
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,600
He used to make your mom mad.

568
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,500
He'd Ieave that radio in pieces

569
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,800
and she used to Iove
to turn it up

570
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,500
and dance wiId around the house.

571
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,900
Mom Iiked to dance?

572
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,200
You bet.

573
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,100
Who's this right here?

574
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,300
Let me see.

575
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,700
That's your grandmother.

576
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,400
She Iooks Iike Mom.

577
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,800
Yeah, she takes after her.

578
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,200
Do you want this too?

579
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,600
No, I don't care.

580
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,200
I'm going to keep it then.

581
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,200
I don't think I'II get the test.

582
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,500
Can I ask why?

583
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,200
No reason.

584
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,100
Maybe your mom wouIdn't want
you up so Iate.

585
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,500
AII right.

586
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,800
You know nobody does anything
to be nice.

587
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,500
They aIways want something.

588
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,300
You beIieve that?

589
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,800
Yeah, you needed something.

590
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,700
Why do you think I spent my Iife
down here to get something?

591
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,800
Or you wouIdn't have.

592
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,800
Or maybe you wanted to hide out.

593
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,100
Or thought you'd never
get married.

594
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,800
When you're gone, a nursing home
can do this job.

595
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,100
Your mother wouIdn't put them
in a home.

596
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,000
Why not? She doesn't give a shit
about anybody.

597
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,500
I'm putting this with your things

598
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,300
Why?

599
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,900
Because they're yours.

600
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,700
You're my nephew and I Iove you.

601
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,600
No matter what you've decided.

602
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,000
Good night.

603
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,900
Don't waste time making friends
with him.

604
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,400
We're onIy here a few days.

605
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,500
We're starting a procedure to
Iook for a match.

606
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,100
PIease, Bob. I'II take this.

607
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
We're starting a procedure to
Iook for a match.

608
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,000
Questions?

609
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,700
How big is the needIe?

610
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,000
It's not important that you
understand.

611
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,500
Bob.

612
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,500
FoIIow me, pIease.

613
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,200
Are you fixing the door for Ruth?

614
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,700
It's so boring.
There's nothing eIse to do.

615
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,600
Want to keep me company?

616
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,900
Sure.

617
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,100
It's a Ford, huh?

618
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,400
WouId you Iike to drive?

619
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:17,900
Are you sure?

620
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,600
Yes

621
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,300
You want me to drive?

622
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,500
It's okay, you can drive.

623
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,600
I'm fast, I'm warning you.

624
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,200
Be carefuI. Don't go too fast.

625
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,300
You're a naturaI born driver.

626
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,500
I have an idea where we can go!

627
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,000
Turn here.

628
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,500
Do you know my dad?

629
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,000
I met him once.

630
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,700
Doesn't your mom taIk about him?

631
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,400
No.

632
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,300
I know your mom war nuts
about him.

633
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,400
Did you go to the wedding?

634
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,400
No.

635
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,200
I knew I war going to be down
here with Dad and Ruth

636
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,200
so I went back home to seII
the rest of my stuff.

637
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,800
Did they have you over for dinner

638
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,700
No, it wasn't much of a visit.
I just stopped by.

639
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Your dad was asIeep,
and Lee didn't want to wake him

640
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,100
so we stood in the haIIway
and taIked a whiIe.

641
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,700
Your dad was stiII asIeep
when I Ieft.

642
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,000
How'd he seem?

643
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,200
He seemed nice enough.

644
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,100
What?

645
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,200
We ware just down by the water.

646
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,300
I'm sorry.

647
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,700
Dr. WaIIy caIIed.

648
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,500
He'd Iike to test the boys next.

649
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,700
Dad, what's Wrong?

650
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,400
No, Dad, it's just us.

651
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,900
You awake?

652
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,300
You might be afraid about this
procedure

653
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,400
but I hear it's Iike having
a tooth puIIed.

654
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,300
I'm not afraid,
I just haven't decided yet.

655
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,100
You'II have the test!

656
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:41,100
My sister is not going to die
so you can have one of your moods

657
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,000
Correct me if I'm wrong,

658
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:59,900
but Ieukemia that's a disease
they've worked out, right?

659
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,600
That is wrong.

660
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,400
What'II happen to my sister?

661
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
On the chance you can't
find a donor?

662
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,500
Why don't you sit down?

663
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,500
Without a bone marrow transpIant,

664
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,700
we reIy on chemicaI therapies,
chemotherapy,

665
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:25,900
as a way of sustaining the
patient over a number of years.

666
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,300
What kind of a number...1 0?

667
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,400
A Iower number.

668
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,300
Nice?

669
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,600
A much Iower number.

670
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,500
As the immune system suffers
under chemotherapy

671
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:49,900
she'II grow weaker and couId
have respiratory probIems.

672
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,600
She may be bedridden, totaIIy
dependent hopeIessIy depressed.

673
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,500
You'II need a nurse to heIp you.

674
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,200
HeIp me, what?

675
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,400
Your sister your father
and your aunt.

676
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,500
I'm not doing any.

677
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,500
Why'd you think that?

678
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,500
I assumed.

679
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,200
No. I Iive in Ohio.

680
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,000
I just got a degree
in cosmetoIogy.

681
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,000
She's going to be fine.

682
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,000
Yes.

683
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:34,600
How can one sister be so good
and the other so bad?

684
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,800
So, you're saying CoraI is good
and Amber's bad?

685
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,000
CoraI Used to be bad.

686
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,700
But she's been a saint ever since
her car accident.

687
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,100
That VoIvo was a bIessing.

688
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,300
I bet they have good care here.

689
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,900
Dad never put Mom in a home.

690
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,700
Remember how he cared for her?

691
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,900
I was IittIe.
I wasn't aIIowed in the room.

692
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,800
I get my degree next quarter.

693
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,800
You shouId be proud of that.

694
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,900
I aIready did a freeIance job.

695
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,500
I did hair for a IocaI
TV commerciaI.

696
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,000
Guess what it paid?

697
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,400
I don't feeI Iike guessing.
Guess.

698
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,700
300 doIIars?

699
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,400
Right. Why'd you guess that?

700
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,000
It popped in my head.

701
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,700
Most peopIe wouId guess Iower.

702
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,900
$300 is a Iot of money.

703
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,600
I feII Iike my Iife is finaIIy
starting.

704
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,100
Ladies.

705
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,700
What a beautifuI room.

706
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,000
WouIdn't Ruth Iove this?

707
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,700
This pIace gives me the creeps.

708
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,100
Marry me, CoraI.

709
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,400
I want to be your wife.

710
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,400
Do you mean it?

711
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,800
I'II drop the charges.

712
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,500
What's CoraI up to today?

713
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,600
I'm going to show you something
that we're proud of.

714
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:27,300
Out state-of-the-art physicaI
therapy room.

715
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,000
Right over here.

716
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,700
I wouIdn't mind Iiving here.
Great!

717
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,200
Isn't it? HeIIo, Doctor.

718
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:47,700
We have a fuII range of
activities computer games,

719
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,400
video Iibrary, sing-aIongs Nerf
basketbaII, date nights.

720
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,300
Who's Dad going to date?

721
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,300
You'd be surprised.
Women outnumber men here 5 to 1.

722
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,900
I don't think we can afford
such a nice pIace.

723
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,100
If you drop to a Iower income
bracket you get financiaI aid.

724
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,200
Lower?

725
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,600
70% of our residents quaIified

726
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:13,000
for assistance by spending
their savings on something

727
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,000
hat has no resaIe vaIue.

728
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,700
Lower?

729
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,100
What do they buy?

730
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,800
Most buy eIaborate tombstones.

731
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,500
I'm going to wait in the car.

732
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,300
Do you have something
I can take with me?

733
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,400
Of course.

734
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,700
Can't you take Dad and Ruth?

735
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,400
I don't think so.

736
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
You couId move here.

737
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
I got Hank to think about.

738
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,700
He's unhappy there!

739
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,600
If he were happy
he wouIdn't be there.

740
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,100
Transfer him!

741
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,800
You find a pIace for him here!
You couId have the house!

742
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,500
You couId find work down here!

743
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,600
No.

744
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,200
Why not?

745
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,400
Just...no.

746
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,700
Give me one good reason!

747
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,000
I don't want to!

748
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,400
I decided this before.

749
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,400
When Dad had his stoke,
I chose not to waste my Iife.

750
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,000
You think I've wasted my Iife?

751
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,500
Of course not.

752
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,900
I can't imagine a better way
to have spent it.

753
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,300
Then we made the right decision.

754
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,700
What decision?

755
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,200
Dad got sick, I came to heIp.
You didn't.

756
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,300
I had pIans, a husband.
I couIdn't!

757
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,600
You didn't!

758
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,500
You think I didn't have pIans?!
You're the most.

759
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,200
Say it!

760
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,000
You've said it a miIIion ways
since I came.

761
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,100
Leave her aIone! Why are you
yeIIing at her?

762
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,800
She wants to teII you
I'm terribIe.

763
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,400
I've tried to be nice
since you came.

764
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,500
You're think she's being nice
suddenIy

765
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,600
because she feIt an urge?

766
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,700
Shut up!

767
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,900
Did you ever get a gift from her?

768
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,100
I thought about you aII the time.

769
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,400
How about a card?!

770
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,100
Ever get a card form Bessie?!

771
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,800
We were not cIose!

772
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,500
You didn't speak to me
for 20 years!

773
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,900
You've got to care of your famiIy

774
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,500
I took care of my famiIy!

775
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,400
I raised two kids,
never heard from you!

776
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,900
I am finaIIy getting my Iife
together,

777
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
nobody's going to take it away!

778
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,600
I can't wait to get out of here.

779
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,500
Thanks for heIping me.

780
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,300
It's a Iot to ask of you
to donate bone marrow.

781
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,800
I think it sound neat.

782
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,100
Your medicaI history care,
pIease?

783
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,200
Your medicaI history card,
pIease.

784
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,100
Now, Hank.

785
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,400
I'm CharIie.

786
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,600
I'm Doctor WaIIy.

787
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,700
You have to fiII out one too.

788
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,700
He's not here to get the test.

789
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:06,900
Okay.

790
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,300
Am I reading your card correctIy

791
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Are you currentIy on Iithium?

792
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,700
Yeah.

793
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,900
Isn't it a great drug?

794
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,900
Can I ask you something did you
gain weight since?

795
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,000
No.

796
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,700
Nervous?

797
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,300
No.

798
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,400
Thank you.

799
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,400
These offices used to be
infested with bugs.

800
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,300
Bugs don't bother me.

801
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,300
No?

802
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,800
They crawI out the boys' shower
drain hide

803
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,400
in the auto shop junk piIe
and fIoat in the basins.

804
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,300
You get used to it.

805
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,000
I wouIdn't.

806
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:24,700
This one dude he catches bugs
and puts them on a Ieash.

807
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,900
A Ieash?

808
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,600
A hair Ieash.

809
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,100
He ties a hair to the bug and
tacks it down under his bunk.

810
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:35,400
He had a zoo of bugs waIking in
circIes aII over the pIace.

811
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:40,000
My friend grabbed his cafeteria
tray and smashed them aII!

812
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,400
That was funny.

813
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,100
Why make up these stories?

814
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,000
What do you mean?

815
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,500
Razors under the tongue,
hair Ieashes.

816
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,200
It's not made up.

817
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,800
Pretending you weren't
getting tested?

818
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,500
Think I'm Iying about that?

819
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,400
Fine, you win! I'm Iying!

820
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,900
I haven't toId you shit!

821
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,700
You don't know about it!

822
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,400
TeII me!

823
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,300
You don't know!

824
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,800
I was in the hospitaI.

825
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,800
I hated it! I was scared!

826
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,600
There's this dude.

827
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,200
If this is another taIe
I'm not interested.

828
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,900
I'm going inside to see
if CharIie's done.

829
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,300
I pIayed in a pooI tournament
in my ward.

830
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,300
Mom teII you that?

831
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,600
No.

832
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,500
I came in fourth.

833
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,600
It's true.

834
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,700
She doesn't think it's a big deaI

835
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,200
That's great.

836
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,800
Got my toe broken in there.

837
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,400
How?

838
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,900
This guy threw a garbage
can on my foot.

839
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,900
Why'd he do that?

840
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,400
No reason I know of.

841
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,300
There's a Iot of drugs that fIoat
around there.

842
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,100
Do you take them?

843
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,600
Most of the time
I just keep to myseIf.

844
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,600
I think of what it wouId be Iike
to be someone eIse.

845
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,800
Like I couId have a house with
Iand around it

846
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,600
and have dogs around and buiId
a go cart track.

847
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,700
Those pIaces make so much money.
Be raking that stuff in.

848
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,200
And nobody wouId know where I was

849
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,700
Just be gone.

850
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,800
MostIy I just think about
being somepIace eIse.

851
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
Then why aren't you?

852
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,300
Why don't you go?

853
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:25,700
What?

854
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,100
You said peopIe do what they want

855
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,200
Yeah.

856
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,300
So.

857
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,700
You must want to be there.

858
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,000
No!

859
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,700
Then show them you don't.

860
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,300
It's not easy.

861
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,400
I don't want you wasting
your Iife.

862
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,500
Neither do I.

863
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,500
Why are you there?

864
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,700
Because they put me there!

865
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,500
Why?

866
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,000
I burned down the house!

867
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,700
Why did you burn down the house?

868
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:53,000
Come inside whiIe we get
CharIie some juice.

869
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,300
WouId you come?

870
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Sure I wouId.

871
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,200
I forgot my coffee.

872
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,700
Why coffee so Iate?

873
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,100
I don't know. I Iike it.

874
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,500
You have a way with Hank.

875
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:46,900
I don't

876
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,000
Yeah, you do.

877
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,800
He's a good boy.

878
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,300
Is he?

879
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,400
Sure he is.

880
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,200
I wish I knew your secret.

881
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,400
I don't know. I just taIk to him.

882
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,800
You saying I don't?

883
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,100
I'm tired and we've got Disney
WorId tomorrow.

884
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,500
I can fix that wig for you.

885
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,300
Does it Iook bad?

886
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,700
No.

887
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:35,000
But if you have a wig you shouId
try to have fun with it,

888
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,100
try different Iooks.

889
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,600
Something sporty,
out on the town kind of thing.

890
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,500
I just brush it.

891
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,000
I aIso have my whoIe makeup kit.

892
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:49,900
Want to see?

893
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,900
This is a reaIIy great
night cream.

894
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,800
I never bothered much with makeup

895
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,100
You shouId.

896
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:05,500
Because it's fun and you might
meet somebody.

897
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,400
Goodness, I haven't thought
about a man in years.

898
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:10,900
You're Iying.

899
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,600
I'm sorry we haven't seen eye
to eye.

900
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,400
I don't want to fight.

901
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,200
We haven't been.

902
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,700
I want to get aIong.

903
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,600
We do.

904
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:31,900
I don't want us to just get aIong
be poIite.

905
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,700
I don't have any probIem
with that.

906
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,700
Nothing much seems important
to me now.

907
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,900
We're sisters.

908
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,500
ShouIdn't we?

909
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,100
No, he just startIes himseIf
sometimes,

910
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,400
then goes back to sIeep.

911
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,000
Are you seeing anybody now?

912
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,300
UsuaIIy.

913
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,500
I hope you have someone reaI
in your Iife.

914
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,100
I don't have any troubIe
with that.

915
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,900
I'm not taIking about that.

916
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,300
You shouId. There's no reason
you haven't had Iove.

917
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,200
I had a true Iove.

918
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,200
You did?

919
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,200
Yes.

920
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,800
Did he know?

921
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,400
Yeah.

922
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,800
Why didn't I know?

923
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,400
He wasn't someone you'd know.

924
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Come on, I won't teII anyone.

925
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,300
CIarence James.

926
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,400
Who?

927
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,100
He was onIy here during summers.

928
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:57,200
My God! You went
with a carny worker!

929
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,500
A very nice person!

930
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,500
I didn't say anything.

931
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,200
That's why I kept it secret.

932
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,600
Which one was he?

933
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,600
He mostIy ran the ferris wheeI.

934
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,400
Yeah, I remember him.
He was cute.

935
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,000
He had the funniest Iaugh.

936
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,000
He'd open his mouth wide and
no sound wouId come out.

937
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,300
No sound wouId come out!

938
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,700
What happened?

939
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,100
You know, they'd have that
Iast picnic?

940
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Down by the river?

941
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,100
CIarence goes swimming,

942
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,100
everyone's watching him
and everybody's there.

943
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,500
His famiIy, his friends, and me.

944
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:05,100
He's Iaughing.
He's making that monkey face.

945
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,500
It gets us Iaughing.
Then he dunks under the water.

946
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,100
He pops up again,

947
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,300
and he's Iaughing even harder
and dives again

948
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,900
and he doesn't come up
and he doesn't come up

949
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:21,800
and he doesn't come up.

950
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,600
What?

951
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,000
Laughing and choking Iooked
the same on CIarence.

952
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,400
He drowned.

953
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,100
Oh, God, we were just standing
there watching.

954
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,700
Oh, my God!

955
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,100
And you never toId me.

956
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,900
If I couIdn't say I had a carny
boyfriend,

957
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,100
I couIdn't say my carny
boyfriend drowned.

958
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,600
You shouId have toId me.

959
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,400
We weren't that cIose.

960
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,300
We weren't?

961
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,600
No.

962
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,000
ShaII I fix that wig?

963
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,300
What?

964
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,300
I don't know.

965
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:29,900
Let me see it.

966
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,000
Here.

967
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,000
No, you got to take it off.

968
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,400
I won't hurt it.

969
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:41,700
Here.

970
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,800
It's a good wig.

971
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,400
NiceIy ventiIated.
We can do something with this.

972
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,000
You want me to?

973
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Yeah, sure.

974
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,000
It's a good weave.

975
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,700
I'm gIad we made this trip.
I wish we couId stay Ionger.

976
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:08,800
I'II get my brush.

977
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,300
I found it.

978
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,400
Is that too much wind for you,
Hank?

979
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,400
What?

980
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:09,900
Is that too much wind?

981
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:11,500
NO, it's okay.

982
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,700
Stick your hand out the window,
CharIie.

983
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,300
It's Iike an airpIane.

984
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,200
Here we go!

985
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,900
Faster!

986
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,500
CharIie, faster, faster!

987
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,100
CharIie, sIow down!

988
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,100
We'II meet by Pirates of
the Caribbean in an hour.

989
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:20,900
Where the Iine starts.

990
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,600
Bye.

991
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,300
Oh, God.

992
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,400
This Swiss FamiIy tree house
is huge.

993
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,000
I'm reaIIy proud of you,

994
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,300
Hank for getting tested
for Bessie.

995
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,100
You're disgusting.

996
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,500
You want me to push Aunt Ruth
a whiIe?

997
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,700
I Iike pushing her.

998
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,900
He's a good driver.

999
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I'II catch up.
I'm going to sit in the sun.

1000
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,700
AII right . Bye-bye.

1001
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,700
HoId on, Iet' go.

1002
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,100
Pick out something nice
for Bessie.

1003
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,900
How about my bone marrow?
Think she'd Iike that?

1004
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,600
Look!

1005
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,900
''Love Bug. ''Remember?

1006
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,500
We saw it on TV together.

1007
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,500
No.

1008
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,900
I remember Dad took me to see
''Indiana Jones,'' though.

1009
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:00,200
You're doing weII on this trip.
Sort of. Stop it.

1010
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,900
Tomorrow when we go back,

1011
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,500
everyone'II hear about how weII
you did.

1012
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,900
Stop it!

1013
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,200
I'm not going back.
I'm staying with Bessie.

1014
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,300
''Peter Pan.''
That was a cute movie.

1015
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,400
I saw it with Dad.

1016
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:24,600
No, you didn't.

1017
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,400
Dad never hit me.

1018
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:11,900
He did.

1019
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,100
I wouId remember that!

1020
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,000
You were 4 years oId.

1021
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,400
You're the one who fought
with him!

1022
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,200
Yeah. But he hit you.

1023
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:32,900
My feeIings for you are Iike
big bowI of fish hooks.

1024
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,400
I can't just pick one up
at a time,

1025
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,000
I pick one up and they aII come

1026
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,500
so I just tend to Ieave them
aIone.

1027
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,300
You're a Iiar.

1028
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,400
What happened?

1029
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:15,500
I fainted.

1030
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,400
There was bIood in my mouth.

1031
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,300
Is your mouth stiII bIeeding?

1032
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,100
No.

1033
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,300
Did a doctor Iook at me?

1034
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,400
No,

1035
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,100
he thought you fainted so he
carried you here to Iie down.

1036
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,800
Who's he?

1037
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,100
Goofy.

1038
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,400
Goofy?

1039
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,800
Yeah.

1040
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,900
Goofy carried me to Mickey's
house?

1041
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,400
Yeah.

1042
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,900
He didn't know you were bIeeding.

1043
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,800
Maybe you feIt faint because you
haven't been eating.

1044
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,500
Maybe that's aII.

1045
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,200
I fainted because I was scared.

1046
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,900
I can't sIeep anymore.

1047
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,300
I never sIeep.

1048
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,300
I'm afraid to cIose my eyes

1049
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:03,500
because if I cIose my eyes
I'm not going to wake up.

1050
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:07,300
So I jerk myseIf awake.

1051
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,900
I yank myseIf awake
aII night Iong

1052
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,900
and then I pour myseIf a cup
of coffee,

1053
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,700
but I'm trying to be brave.

1054
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,400
Oh, darIing , I know.

1055
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,300
I'm scared.

1056
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,000
It's aII right,
you're going to be okay.

1057
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,200
What've you got to be scared of?

1058
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,700
There's stiII Hank and CharIie.
You're forgetting about them.

1059
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,000
You're going to be okay.

1060
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,600
where are they?

1061
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,300
They're sitting outside.

1062
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,500
You're so Iucky to have
those boys.

1063
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:46,300
I know I am.

1064
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,900
They're good boys both of them.

1065
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,700
We re fooIing ourseIves.

1066
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,800
Hank and CharIie won't match.

1067
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,900
I won't pretend any more.

1068
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,100
We have decisions to make.

1069
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,700
We don't have to make them now.

1070
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,400
We'II hear about the boys'
tests tomorrow.

1071
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:02,400
I haven't had reason to pretty
myseIf up

1072
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,300
since I can't think when.

1073
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,400
Today is the day.

1074
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,700
They aImost got married
once before.

1075
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,100
But amber set the church on fire.

1076
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:23,300
Is CoraI the same character who
shot Lance's dad in the head?

1077
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,200
They're getting married?

1078
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:29,800

You Iook beautifuI!

1081
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,600
Don't make fun of me.

1082
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,000
I'm not.

1083
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,500
I'm just a siIIy oId woman
dressing up for a TV show.

1084
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,600
No, you're not.

1085
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:02,400
Where 's your brother?

1086
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,200

1087
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,500

1088
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:35,200

1092
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,700
I was going to do that.

1093
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,300
I can do it.

1094
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,500
You're suppose to be resting .

1095
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,000

1096
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,300
Want some snacks?
I'm making nachos.

1097
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,000
Better just cut me some fruit.

1098
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:04,900
HeIIo?

1099
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,100
Yeah, she's here.

1100
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,100
Who is it?

1101
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,200
Dr. WaIIy.

1102
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:17,700
You did?

1103
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,000
Good!

1104
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,500
What is...

1105
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,200
I see.

1106
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,700
Then I shouId keep taking what
I'm taking now...

1107
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,800
No, no!

1108
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,800
I understand . I'm not.

1109
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,300
Thank you. Goodbye , Doctor.

1110
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,900
They got the boys' tests back ,

1111
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and it Iooks Iike it didn't
work out.

1112
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,200
It's pretty much what we expected

1113
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,100
We knew that the--

1114
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,600
May be they made a mistake.

1115
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,400
Maybe.

1116
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,500
I'II continue my therapies--

1117
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,300
That's good, because...

1118
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,400
...those are good things to do.

1119
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:30,900
We shouId teII the boys.

1120
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,200
What was I--?

1121
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,500
Oh, Dad!

1122
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,600
You want to go Iie down ?

1123
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,000
No, no.

1124
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,800
I'm fine . I just--

1125
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,500
I can do this.

1126
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,200
I've been so Iucky.

1127
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,500
I've been so Iucky to have Dad
and Ruth.

1128
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,200
I've had such Iove in my Iife.

1129
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,100
... and I've had such...

1130
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,400
...such Iove.

1131
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,400
They Iove you very much.

1132
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,800
That's not what I mean. No.

1133
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,100
I mean that I Iove them.

1134
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,300
I have been so Iucky to be abIe
to Iove someone so much.

1135
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,500
Yeah. You are.

1136
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,400
We shouId teII Hank.

1137
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:05,800
About the tests.

1138
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,600
We wiII.

1139
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,100
I better--

1140
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:32,900
Where are you going?

1141
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,600
I'm going...

1142
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Going into the kitchen.

1143
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,700
Nobody's had any Iunch yet,
have they?

1144
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:12,900
What?

1145
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:16,800
Nothing.

1146
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,700
But if you take a drive
or something,

1147
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,700
you ought to Iet me know.

1148
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:31,000
I worry about you.

1149
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,100
Hi.

1150
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,000
Dad's Medication.

1151
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:02,400
Around and around.

1152
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,200
See?

1153
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:15,700
It's just us.

1154
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,200
Look, Lee's here , too.

1155
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,000
You know Lee, don't you?

1156
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,800
Bessie, you missed it!

1157
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,200
CoraI finaIIy married Lance.

1158
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,300
Wasn't Lance married to
CoraI's mother?

1159
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,600
No, CoraI was married to
Lance's father.

1160
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,100
He's reaIIy a nice boy.
