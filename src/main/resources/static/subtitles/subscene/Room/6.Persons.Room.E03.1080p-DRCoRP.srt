1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,370
Over here...

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,370
﻿Is Ms. Leejiwon here?

3
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,200
﻿Ms. Leejiwon?

4
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,410
﻿What is it?

5
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,790
﻿l-m from the insurance company.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,160
﻿Ms. Lee Jiwon

7
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,160
﻿Let me go straight to the point.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,540
﻿You are currently staying in the hospital without injuries.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,740
﻿I specially did some investigation.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,450
﻿In the past year, you have been hospitalized 18 times for traffic accidents.

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,410
﻿The average hospital stay is 3 weeks.

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,410
﻿A total of 168 days.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,370
﻿Basically you are staying at the hospital every month.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,450
﻿If I were to pursue this according to the law

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,660
﻿Ms. Lee Jiwon, you will be in trouble!

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,080
﻿Faking a hospital stay, and insurance fraud.

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,330
﻿This is an offense tenable of up to 10 years jail and 20 million won fine.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,830
﻿Ms. Leejiwon

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,740
﻿You are faking it, right?

20
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,040
﻿Then why is there not a single symptom? Putting on a show?

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,490
﻿I'm really treating you as a younger sister, that's why I'm telling you this.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,490
﻿Before I call the police

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,200
﻿Quickly pack up and discharge yourself from the hospital.

24
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:24,990
﻿Pack up.

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,080
﻿What?

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,160
﻿You are currently staying in the hospital without injuries.

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,240
﻿How dare you malign me as a fraud?

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,790
﻿Insurance company employee?

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,490
﻿From which insurance company are you from?

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,410
﻿Let's go the legal route!

31
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,120
﻿I've recorded it all.

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,370
﻿You!

33
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,200
﻿With your threats and defamation

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,330
﻿I can report you to the police and consumer protection center.

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,870
﻿Also, your company. I can sue you till your pants drop.

36
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,700
﻿Let's see what you will become. We shall see.

37
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,580
﻿Let me show you what s craziness.

38
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,870
﻿Do you want to die?

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
﻿I didn't mean that.

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:00,950
﻿You.

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,290
﻿Younger sister?

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,740
﻿How old are you to call me younger sister?

43
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,490
﻿Take out your identification card.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,160
﻿I'm really sorry.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,620
﻿I didn’t mean that.

46
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,620
﻿If you don't give me

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,740
﻿Urn calling 112.

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,450
﻿Born in !94?

49
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,580
﻿21 years old?

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,620
﻿Life is hard.

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,490
﻿In the future, avoid me when you see me.

52
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,410
﻿I'm really sorry. I will definitely avoid.

53
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,200
﻿Alright.

54
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,910
﻿While Noona is still in a good mood, get out.

55
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,660
﻿Please...

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,830

﻿What?

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,660
﻿Weird dance?

75
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,160
﻿Seriously.

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
﻿What's the point of talking...

82
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,660
﻿I shall just keep my mouth shut.

83
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,740
﻿That...

84
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,620
﻿It seems...

85
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,160
﻿I haven't officially announced it yet.

86
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,410
﻿Tonight, I

87
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,910
﻿Will be treating everyone!

88
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,660
﻿Still alive.

89
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,240
﻿Indeed!

90
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,990
﻿I want fried chicken and beer!

91
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,240
﻿What do you mean fried chicken and beer?

92
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,490
Oh, right.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,490
﻿Then, I want fried chicken and cola.

94
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,240
﻿I want orange juice.

95
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,830
﻿First chicken, then...

96
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,660
﻿You are going to riot again.

97
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,660
﻿Dcryou wan time to punch you?

98
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,660
﻿No, I don't.

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
﻿I had too many of that already.

100
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,910
﻿I don't eat stuff like fried chicken.

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,660
﻿Don't count me in.

102
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,660
﻿Ms. Jiwon.

103
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,200
﻿Are you saying you don't eat chicken?

104
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,700
﻿Chicken! 
Chicken!

105
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,950
﻿Alright, alright!

106
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,910
﻿I'll join in.

107
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,910
﻿From where does she belong?

108
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,040
﻿The company alcohol ritual.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,870
﻿She's so serious making poktanju.

110
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,740
﻿It's really nice.

111
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,370
﻿Older brother.

112
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,450
﻿Please say a word.

113
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,910
﻿Ever since staying in the hospital

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
﻿Each and every day.

115
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,830
﻿It feels like a dream.

116
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,620
﻿Of course, not every thing is a good dream.

117
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,790
﻿I'm really happy to have known everyone.

118
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,040
﻿In the future

119
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,330
﻿I hope we will be able to maintain this fate.

120
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
﻿Everyone.

121
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,700
﻿Cheers.

122
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,240
﻿Oh my!

123
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,290
﻿One shot, one shot!

124
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,490
﻿How long are you doing to make me dance?

125
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,290
﻿Look at my shoulders.

126
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,830
﻿They're out of sockets!

127
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:19,950
﻿Lover shot!

128
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,160
﻿These days...

129
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,740
﻿I'm sorry for what I've said.

130
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,620
﻿My husband danced with others.

131
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,200
﻿He abandoned me and the children.

132
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,290
﻿I'm in the same situation.

133
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,370
﻿My husband had an affair.

134
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,290
﻿And then he ran off.

135
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,490
﻿Leaving 3 children behind.

136
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,830
﻿One day, that man

137
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,200
﻿brought a woman with child

138
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,790
﻿to appear before me.

139
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,370
﻿They are all children

140
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,830
﻿But my children...

141
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,370
﻿became children who were not loved.

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,990
﻿Because I couldn't take it

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,580
﻿I took the children and ran away.

144
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:30,120
﻿Now that the children are all married.

145
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,410
﻿I feel how dumb my life has been.

146
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,040
﻿So I made a decision

147
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,990
﻿To Uve a new life, I began dancing.

148
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,370
﻿It's not to seduce men.

149
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,370
﻿I'm sorry.

150
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,790
﻿I didn't know about this.

151
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,870
﻿Actually...

152
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,540
﻿I want to seduce men too.

153
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,120
﻿Speaking of which...

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,580
﻿Your burns seem pretty serious.

155
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,240
﻿What was the reason?

156
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,700
﻿It happened while I was working at the hotel.

157
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,080
﻿That day was especially busy.

158
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,740
﻿As I was so busy

159
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,040
﻿A group of customers came to eat.

160
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,660
﻿Because I was in a hurry to serve the group

161
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,870
﻿While moving the tables

162
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,370
﻿The gas hose was plucked out.

163
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,290
﻿Even now when I see lighted candles

164
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,740
﻿My heart will pound really quickly

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,410
﻿Even my hands tremble.

166
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,790
﻿She almost got into big trouble.

167
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,580
﻿Ms. Jiwon.

168
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,660
﻿No, I'm older than you, so I will speak comfortably.

169
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,660
﻿Is that alright?

170
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,040
﻿Honestly

171
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,290
﻿I'm very envious and jealous of you.

172
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,160
﻿You are pretty, and your body is great. Your qualities are excellent.

173
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,040
﻿Conversely, I only know how to work hard.

174
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,990
﻿Day by day, I wait to become an old virgin.

175
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,830
﻿I also wish to be like you, to be able to dress up nicely.

176
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,790
﻿And date someone.

177
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,080
﻿But I only know how to work hard.

178
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,620
﻿So much time has already passed.

179
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,450
﻿Pretty face and good body?

180
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,160
﻿Naturally?

181
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,290
﻿That's such a joke.

182
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,370
﻿When I was still a student

183
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,080
﻿I was so fat, like a pig.

184
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,120
﻿I didn’t have a single friend.

185
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,870
﻿I was always ostracized.

186
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,290
﻿I weakly lived till now.

187
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,410
﻿It was like I was dead every day.

188
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,870
﻿Actually, I previously had

189
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,830
﻿thoughts that dying would be better off.

190
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,830
﻿Why is the atmosphere like this?

191
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,830
﻿Who died?

192
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,120
﻿I have a body that will make noses bleed.

193
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,160
﻿That's Leejiwon!

194
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,580
﻿Swore that

195
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,450
﻿I would make a single female pictorial shoot.

196
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,330
﻿You don't believe?

197
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,450
﻿I will film it for you.

198
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,290
- I will really film it.
- ﻿I will really film it.

199
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,120
You are drunk. 
Stop talking.

200
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,160
﻿So noisy. So noisy.

201
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,160
﻿Eat this.

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,370
﻿Drink this.

203
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,120
﻿Rise and shine

204
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,870
﻿Come over.

205
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,870
﻿You come over.

206
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,740
﻿Come over.

207
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,370
﻿You come over.

208
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,660
﻿This rascal.

209
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,580
﻿You rascal, come over

210
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,290
﻿Are you not coming?

211
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,330
﻿Hurry up over here.

212
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,790
﻿One.

213
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,700
﻿Two.

214
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,410
﻿Three!

215
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,540
﻿It's mealtime!

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
﻿It's mealtime.

217
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,040
Did you sleep well?

218
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,740
﻿It's morning!

219
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,490
﻿It's so funny!

220
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,160
﻿Oh my!

221
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,990
﻿Hold on.

222
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,040
﻿It's so pretty!

223
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,740
﻿Unnie, put some here too.
