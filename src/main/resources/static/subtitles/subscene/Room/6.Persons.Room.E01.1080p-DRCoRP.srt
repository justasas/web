00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,120
Director!

2
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,160
﻿What happened?

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,620
﻿Welcome to heaven.

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,370
﻿Welcome.

5
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,910
﻿Who are you!?

6
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,540
﻿Where am I?!

7
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,540
﻿Are you alright?

8
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,540
﻿This time...

9
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,830
﻿In my opinion...

10
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,330
﻿He's messed up.

11
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,580
﻿By any chance...

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,370
﻿Did he turn into a vegetable?

13
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,540
﻿Don't say such things.

14
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,450
﻿What?

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,240
﻿I only spoke out of concern.

16
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,120
﻿She's a hottie.

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,490
﻿Don't be late.

18
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,660
﻿It's all your fault!

19
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,200
﻿You'll be sorry if he can't recover!

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,160
﻿Why do you always say this to me?

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,870
﻿Crazy bitch!

22
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,410
﻿Yoomi.

23
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,200
﻿Yes?

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:05,910
﻿Come here.

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,040
﻿Come and watch over this guy for a while.

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,540
﻿If anything comes up, call me straight away.

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:12,910
﻿OK!

28
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,120
﻿You woke up.

29
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,040
﻿You woke up!

30
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,830
﻿Be quiet.

31
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,870
﻿You'll wake people up.

32
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,450
﻿Thank goodness.

33
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,410
﻿I was so worried.

34
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,450
﻿Looks like you were looking after me?

35
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,240
﻿I'm just here because theinurse-unnie asked me to, for your information!

36
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,870
﻿You got up so I'm going back to my spot.

37
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,290
﻿Hey, wait a moment.

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,290
﻿Let me ask you for a favor.

39
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,620
﻿That Unnie...

40
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,910
﻿She got in for an injury while dancing

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,580
﻿Huh? Unnie?

42
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,370
﻿You don't mean...

43
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,540
﻿She's 68

44
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,330
﻿But she thinks she's still in 20's

45
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,620
﻿Like before

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,200
﻿put on makeup

47
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,240
﻿She has a flower on her head

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,700
﻿Like she's in her 20's

49
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,540
﻿Her no make up face isn't bad.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,790
﻿That was grandma.

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,660
﻿Okay?

52
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,790
﻿Park Wonju. 58 years old.

53
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,620
﻿But we still call her mother.

54
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,040
﻿While she was working

55
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,120
﻿She got burned.

56
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,080
﻿She has a son and a daughter.

57
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,330
﻿Says her son lives somewhere distant.

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,580
﻿Can't get a hold of him.

59
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,830
﻿Do you see the sweater?

60
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,580
﻿She's making it for her son.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,490
﻿You should call her mother as well

62
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,870
﻿It's for the best.

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,330
﻿Mom, mom

64
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,240
﻿Okay?

65
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,370
﻿The Unnie over there

66
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,450
﻿38, past her marriage age.

67
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,540
﻿Choi Haesun.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,870
﻿She’s always working late.

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,870
﻿Even at home.

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,830
﻿So

71
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,040
﻿She has turtle neck

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,990
﻿Lumbar disc

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,950
﻿And carpal tunnel syndrome.

74
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,700
﻿She still works like that.

75
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,080
﻿And

76
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,990
﻿That crazy Unnie from earlier

77
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,240
Lee Jiwon.

78
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,200
﻿27 years old.

79
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:00,990
﻿Nylon patient.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,540
﻿Nylon?

81
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
﻿In her own words

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,120
﻿She got in a car accident.

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
﻿But she's jogging everyday-

84
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,490
the morning-

85
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,540
﻿In my opinion

86
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,990
﻿She's fine.

87
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,410
﻿Nickname is Crazy bitch.

88
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,870
﻿She seems rather abnormal.

89
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,450
﻿You too.

90
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,790
﻿What was that just now?

91
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,660
﻿Wipe that smile off your face.

92
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,370
﻿I will introduce myself now.

93
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,660
﻿I'm Kim Yoomi.

94
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,950
﻿12 years old.

95
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,660
﻿I was hurt during school PE.

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,950
﻿I am rather smart.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,080
﻿I am one of the top in school.

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,040
﻿My dream is to become a doctor.

99
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,370
﻿My hobby is dancing.

100
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,160
﻿As you can plainly see, I'm rather good looking.

101
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,410
﻿So popular too.

102
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,040
﻿By the way, what have you been writing?

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,580
﻿Oh, it’s nothing.

104
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,290
﻿Names and ages. Those slDrt of things.

105
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,290
﻿Youre weird.

106
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,870
﻿Anyway, nice to meet you, guy.

107
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,410
﻿Aigoo

108
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,620
﻿Yes, I am in your hands.

109
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,740
﻿Oppa, you are kind of stupid

110
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,120
﻿And cute.

﻿What about your father?

115
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,490
﻿My father died when I was 16.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,580
﻿It's been just us 3 since then.

117
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:31,950
﻿Really?

118
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,240
﻿My dad died too.

119
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,910
﻿Before I was born.

120
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,870
﻿Dinner

121
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,330
﻿What's up with eating stinky food every day?

122
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,200
﻿Crazy bitch!

﻿I will cheer for you.

145
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,490
﻿Drinks are going down the throat.

146
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,870
﻿Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol!

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,410
﻿How long are you going to make me dance?

148
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,200
﻿Look at my shoulders.

149
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,120
﻿They're out'df their sockets!

150
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,450
﻿Do you want your shoulders out of their sockets?

151
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,620
﻿Actually

152
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,910
﻿I don't give out drinks

153
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,370
﻿I’m being generous.

154
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,620
﻿Yes.

155
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,870
﻿You are so cute.

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,200
﻿Th...thank you.

157
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,700
﻿By the way

158
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,540
﻿You are...

159
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,660
﻿What?

160
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,000
﻿Younger than I am, if I'm not mistaken...

161
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,120
Are you a 87 rabbit?

162
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,370
﻿That's right.

163
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,790
﻿I’m a 88 dragon!

164
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,990
﻿Roar- We re friends!

165
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
﻿A year difference doesn't mean anything once out in society.

166
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,490
﻿That's a little...

167
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,660
﻿Even with my parents who are 30 years older than I am

168
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,120
﻿I don’t use honorifics.

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,700
﻿Everyone

170
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,740
﻿Does that.

171
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:38,910
﻿Why?

172
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,910
﻿You got a problem?

173
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,200
﻿Who asked you to be born a year earlier?

174
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,290
﻿She's insane while sober.

175
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,830
﻿Even worse drunk.

176
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,370
﻿Time to get out of here!

177
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,490
Hey!

178
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,400
Oh my

179
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:50,910
﻿You'd better behave!

180
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,540
﻿- Wait, hold on!
﻿- You’d better behave!

181
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,290
﻿Stop it, please.

182
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,910
﻿Aish !

183
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
﻿I really want to

184
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,120
Beat her.

185
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,160
What's that?

186
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,660
﻿You're gonna hit me, huh?

187
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,200
﻿You...

188
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,700
﻿What did you think of my body line, when you got a peek?

189
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,540
﻿Amazing, right?
