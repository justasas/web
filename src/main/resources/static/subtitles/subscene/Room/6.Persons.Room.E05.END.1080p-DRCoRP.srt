00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,950
Are the two of you really unrelated?

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,580
﻿Minsoo...

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,370
How do you know that name?

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,290
Ahjumma.

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,120
﻿That's not right.

6
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,790
This...How can it be?

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,450
Why are you here?

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,410
O﻿ppa!

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,200
﻿Were you frightened?

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,910
﻿Where did you go?

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,450
Why are you acting like an idiot?

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,990
How can a man cry like that?

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,410
What is the meaning of this?

14
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,330
Did you plan this together to scare me?

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,620
Something like a hidden camera?

16
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,870
O﻿ppa.

17
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,790
You have slept too long.

18
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,660
Minsoo

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,370
Although it s hard for you to believe it.

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,290
But whatever happened and whomever you met here

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,370
﻿Are all your imagination.

22
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,790
What are you talking about..

23
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,830
How can this be an imagination?

24
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,450
﻿What are you talking about.

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,490
How can this be an imagination?

26
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,990
You are having such thoughts, right?

27
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,490
Is this a dream?

28
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,200
﻿This isn't a dream.

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,330
Please, stop it1

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,450
Stop it1

31
00:01:50,700 --> 00:02:01,660
Now, open your eyes and see the reality.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,700
﻿Please! Stop saying it!

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,620
Welbome to heaven

34
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,290
Welcome

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,540
My dad died too.

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,910
Mmsoo has the same broad shoulders as my son.

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,200
He's messed up

39
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,660
Did he turn into a vegetable?

40
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,290
You woke up

41
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,080

How does Oppa know my name?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
For coming back to my side

45
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,450
Thank you

46
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,790
﻿Why is this Oppa like that?

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,040
﻿Does your head hurt?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,200
Something badLhas happened.

49

Yes

54
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,040
That's a relief.

55
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,910
It s good to hear you saying you are fine.

56
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,910
I’m really fine

57
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,910
Since everyone is gathered

58
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,700
Let me introduce you to everyone in the ward.

59
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,950
That's not necessary.

60
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,370
I know everything.

61
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,240

Like me?

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,080
Now

65
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,290

I'm very thankful for the sweater.

76
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,120
Haesun-noona

77
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,370
Although we didn't share much together

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,080
But to help me in the background

79
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,450
I'm really thankful

80

Oh my!

100
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,580
Driving me nuts

101

﻿That.

104
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,160
Nurse!

105
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,450
Nurse!

106
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,740
﻿Son!

107
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,200
Son, it's mom!

108
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
It's mom!

109
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,080
Look at mom!

110
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,870
﻿Son!

111
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,870
What's the matter?

112
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,950
My son!

113
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,540
﻿My son finally opened his eyes after 3 years!

114
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,910
Quickly get the doctor-on-call

115
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,830
Madam!

116
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,490
﻿Did you do it right?

117
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,120
﻿Before injecting a patient, you haverfo verify it. Do you not know!?

118
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,240
﻿I'm very sorry.

119
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,450
The fluid was wrong, so I'm changing it for him.

120
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,660
﻿Mr Minsoo

121
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,370
How's your body now?

122
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,870
Do you have any stomaches or headaches?

123
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,040
I m fine, really.

124
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,950
My stomach is fine, and my head doesn't hurt.

125
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,240
In fact, I'm full of energy. My condition is perfect.

126
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,700
﻿That's a relief.

127
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,490
Quickly fix it, and change it to glucose fluid.

128
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,080
This kind of thing should have been done by yourself

129
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,080
How can.you blame others.

130
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,290
I'm so unlucky.

131
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,540
Return to that moment multiple times a day, every day.

132
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,410
Returning to the split moment I made a decision mistake.

133
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,040
﻿The moment which caused everything to go up in flames.

134
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,540
Actually

135
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,240
I haven't woken up from my deep coma.

136
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,370
I am having a happy dream again today.

137
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,740
Drinks are going down the throat.

138
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,040
﻿Alcohol, ﻿alcohol, ﻿alcohol, ﻿alcohol, ﻿alcohol, ﻿alcohol, ﻿alcohol, ﻿alcohol, ﻿alcohol.

﻿For my son...

141
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,910
Seeing everyone

142
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,790
I'm so happy

143
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,410
In the future

144
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,290
﻿I hope we will be able to maintain this fate.

145
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,490
