1
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,684
Never did eat your lunch, did ya?

2
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,854
I'd better
get back to the office.

3
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:16,941
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:19,944
Why don't you call your boss and
tell him to take the afternoon off.

5
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:22,447
It's Friday, anyway.
Huh?

6
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,450
Yeah? What do I do
with my free afternoon?

7
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,452
Walk you to the airport and...

8
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,955
Laze around here a while longer.

9
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:32,957
Checking out time is 3:00 p. M.

10
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,463
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in when you come in...

11
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,965
...but when your time's up...

12
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:47,930
I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:49,933
I have to go.

14
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:56,564
I can come down next week.

15
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:58,900
No.

16
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:02,195
Not even just to see you,
have lunch? In public.

17
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,615
Oh, we can see each other.
We can have dinner.

18
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:07,617
But respectably.

19
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,622
In my house, with my mother's picture
on the mantel...

20
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:15,625
...my sister helping me
to broil a steak for three.

21
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,835
I'd kinda like to
meet your sister.

22
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,837
She, um...

23
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,839
She look anything like you?

24
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:23,841
- Sam.
- No?

25
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,345
All right.

26
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:30,348
Marion, whenever possible
I want to see you...

27
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,350
...and under any conditions...

28
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,352
...even, uh, respectability.

29
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,646
You make respectability
sound so disrespectful.

30
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:38,648
No, I'm all for it.

31
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,487
Look, a couple years, I'll have
my father's debts paid off at the store.

32
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,991
And I told you, alimony stops as soon
as she gets married again.

33
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:51,411
Ohh. I haven't even been
married once yet.

34
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:55,039
Yeah, but when you do,
you'll swing.

35
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,334
So, let's get married.

36
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:02,755
You really wanna live in a hardware store
in Fairvale, eat beans out of a can with me?

37
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:06,467
- Oh?
- Yeah, that'd be a lot of laughs.

38
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:09,470
Tell you what...
When I send my ex-wife her money...

39
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:13,141
...you can lick the stamps.

40
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,518
I'll lick the stamps.

41
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:18,813
Marion, you wanna cut this off...

42
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:22,442
...go out and find yourself someone
who's, uh, available?

43
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,444
I'm thinkin' of it.

44
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:28,865
Don't you go break my heart, now.

45
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,619
Don't miss your plane.

46
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,705
Hey, wait.
We can leave together, can't we?

47
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:38,541
I'm late, and you have
to put your shoes on.

48
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:46,841
Is Mr. Lowery
back from lunch yet?

49
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:49,844
He's lunching with the man
who's buying the Harris St. Property.

50
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:52,847
- You know, the oil lease man?
- Right, right, right.

51
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:55,350
So, that's why he's late.

52
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,352
You getting a headache?

53
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:59,354
Lt'll pass.

54
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:03,358
Headaches are like resolutions: You forget
about 'em as soon as they stop hurting.

55
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,652
You got aspirins?

56
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:09,489
I have something.
Not aspirins, but...

57
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,992
My mother's doctor gave these to me
on the day of my wedding.

58
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:16,120
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

59
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:18,122
Any calls?

60
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:22,126
Oh, Teddy called me, and my mother
called to see if Teddy called.

61
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,463
And, oh, your sister called to say she'd
be going to Tucson to do some buying...

62
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,049
...and she'd be gone
the whole weekend, and...

63
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,051
Whoo!

64
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,053
Hot as fresh milk.

65
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:35,056
You girls oughta get your boss
to turn on the air-conditioning.

66
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,934
He can afford it today.

67
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:41,229
Marion, will you get those copies
of the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

68
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,940
- Of course.
- Tomorrow's the day.

69
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,443
What a sweet little girl.

70
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,239
- Not you, darlin'. My daughter.
- Oh.

71
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:56,744
She's my baby, but tomorrow she stands
up there and gets married away from me.

72
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:59,747
Here, I'd like you
to have a look at my baby.

73
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,792
Eighteen years old...

74
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:07,505
...and never known an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

75
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,967
Come on, Tom.
The air conditioner's on in my office.

76
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,303
You know what I do
with unhappiness?

77
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,305
I buy it off.

78
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:19,684
- You unhappy?
- Oh, not inordinately, no.

79
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,686
Oh.

80
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:26,024
I'm buyin' this house
as a wedding present for my baby.

81
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,026
Now, that's not buyin' happiness.

82
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,028
That's buyin' off unhappiness, see?

83
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,905
Yes, sir.

84
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:36,618
Four hundred thousand dollars, cash.

85
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,286
Not to worry, now.

86
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:41,831
I never carry more than I can afford
to lose. Count 'em up.

87
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:44,667
- I declare!
- I don't.

88
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,794
That's how I'm able to keep it.

89
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:51,633
Tom, uh, cash transactions of this size,
uh... Most irregular.

90
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:54,886
Yeah, well, so what?
It's my private money. Now it's yours.

91
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:58,348
Suppose we just
put this in the safe...

92
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:01,351
...and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

93
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:05,480
Speaking of feeling good, what happened to
that bottle you said you had in your desk?

94
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,775
Mmm.

95
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,490
You know, sometimes I can
keep my mouth shut.

96
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:21,663
Lowery, I'm dyin'
of thirst-a-roonie here.

97
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend.

98
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:29,212
Put it the safe deposit box
at the bank.

99
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:32,507
- We'll get him to give us a check on Monday instead.
- Okay.

100
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:39,889
Oh! Ahh.

101
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,394
He was flirting with you.

102
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:48,564
Guess he must have noticed
my wedding ring.

103
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:53,611
Uh-huh.

104
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:55,613
Lowery.

105
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:02,036
Come in.

106
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,207
- The copies.
- Thank you.

107
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:09,210
If you don't mind, I'd like to go
right on home after the bank.

108
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:12,213
- I-I'm feeling a slight headache.
- You go ahead on home.

109
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:16,134
Me and your boss are gonna go out and
get ourselves a little drinkin' done.

110
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:18,136
Of course.
Do you feel ill?

111
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,638
Oh, it's just...
just a little headache.

112
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:24,392
You need a weekend in Las Vegas.
Playground of the world.

113
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:27,562
I'm gonna spend the weekend in bed.
Thank you.

114
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:29,731
Only playground
to beat Las Vegas.

115
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,267
Mmm.

116
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:08,788
Marion, what...
what are you doin' up here?

117
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,791
Where in the world did you get
all that money?

118
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:16,212
Yeah. It's more than I need
to get out of debt.

119
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:22,176
So I said, "Sandy...

120
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,598
...you see anything there you haven't
at least had a fifth of before?"

121
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,558
Sandy looks all up and down...

122
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:35,023
Sandy looks all up and down the bar,
and he says, "No. "

123
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,782
5-27, you comin' in 10-1?

124
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:28,493
5-31, try again in your new location.

125
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,212
21-13, are you available
for check five duty?

126
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:41,714
Hold it right there.

127
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:51,391
- In quite a hurry.
- Yes.

128
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:54,394
I- I didn't intend
to sleep so long.

129
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:57,730
I almost had an accident last night
from, from, uh, sleepiness...

130
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:00,233
...so I decided to pull over.

131
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:02,777
- You slept here all night?
- Yes.

132
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,780
As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open, so...

133
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:09,200
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...

134
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:11,828
I mean, just to be safe.

135
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:15,331
- I just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?
- No, ma'am.

136
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:18,876
- Then I'm free to go?
- Is anything wrong?

137
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,878
There's nothing wrong...

138
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:23,881
...except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.

139
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:25,883
Now, just a moment.

140
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,636
Turn your motor off, please.

141
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:35,602
May I see your license
and registration?

142
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:38,521
- Why?
- Please.

143
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,306
Have a nice day.

144
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:43,813
Hey, Larry!
How soon do you want this?

145
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:47,567
Pick up line one.

146
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,778
It's about time.

147
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,780
O.B.'s working on that.

148
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:57,118
Be with you in a second!

149
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:22,268
5-28, was that Victor-Charlie-Bravo?

150
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:28,024
5-28, 10-4.
Victor-Charlie-Bravo.

151
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:36,699
I'm in no mood for trouble.

152
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:38,701
What?

153
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,704
There's an old saying
that the first customer of the day...

154
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:43,706
...is always the most trouble.

155
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,709
But I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna
treat you so fair and square...

156
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:49,212
...you're not gonna have
one human reason...

157
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:51,714
Can I trade in my car
and take another?

158
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,218
You can do anything you have a mind to.
Bein' a woman, you will.

159
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:57,220
- Is that yours?
- Yes. Yes.

160
00:17:57,303 --> 00:18:00,890
- There's nothing wrong with it. I'm just...
- Sick of the sight of it.

161
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:05,144
Well, have a look around, see if there's
anything that strikes your eye.

162
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:08,314
Meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

163
00:18:08,356 --> 00:18:10,984
I was just about to make some coffee.
You want some...

164
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:13,861
No, I'm in a hurry. I just wanna make
the change and start...

165
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:18,366
A person ought not to be in a hurry,
but it's too nice a day to argue.

166
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:21,369
So, I'll just shoot your car
in the garage.

167
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:23,371
O.B.!

168
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,457
Yeah, boss?

169
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:32,213
- What's up? - Can you take
this one, give it the once-over?

170
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:35,216
Sure. No problem.
I'll give it the standard.

171
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:40,513
Say, that's the one
I'd have picked for you myself.

172
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:43,016
- How much?
- Go ahead. Spin it around.

173
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:45,268
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it looks fine.

174
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:48,146
How much will it be
with my car?

175
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:51,649
- You don't want the usual
day-and-a-half to think it over? - No.

176
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:55,403
- You are in a hurry. Somebody chasin' ya?
- Well, of course not.

177
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:57,405
Please.

178
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:02,535
Well, that's the first time I ever saw
the customer high-pressure the salesman.

179
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:05,663
But I figure, uh, roughly...

180
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:08,541
...your car plus...

181
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,418
...four thousand?

182
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,046
Four thousand.
Four thousand.

183
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:16,674
Ah, you got time
to argue price, though, huh?

184
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:19,385
All right.
Four thousand dollars.

185
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:23,890
I take it, uh, you can prove that
that car is yours.

186
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:27,602
- I mean, out of state license and all.
- I have all the necessary papers.

187
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:31,230
- Is... Is there a ladies' room?
- L-In the building.

188
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:33,334
Thank you.

189
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,336
Hey!

190
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:38,798
Forgot your bag.

191
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:42,135
Put 'em in the back, please.

192
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:53,896
Heck, Officer, that was the first time
I ever saw the customer...

193
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,898
...high-pressure the salesman.

194
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:57,900
Is somebody chasin' her?

195
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:00,903
I'd better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

196
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:04,365
- She look like a bad one to you?
- Acted like one.

197
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:07,869
Funny thing is,
she paid me in cash.

198
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:20,089
Yes, Mr. Lowery?

199
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:23,092
Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

200
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:26,763
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

201
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:30,099
Buzz me the minute she comes in.

202
00:21:30,183 --> 00:21:33,811
Call her sister.
If no one's answering at the house...

203
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:37,815
I called her sister where she works...
Hard Core Vinyl Record Store.

204
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,818
She doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.

205
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,820
Run out to the house.

206
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:45,823
She may be unable to answer the phone.

207
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:49,118
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

208
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,539
No, I haven't
the faintest idea.

209
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:56,542
I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

210
00:21:56,584 --> 00:22:01,005
She said she didn't feel well, wanted
to leave early and I said she could.

211
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:04,425
That was the last I saw...
Wait a minute.

212
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:07,428
I did see her some time later, driving.

213
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:11,099
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

214
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:14,394
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

215
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:16,854
Quick.

216
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:20,108
Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $400,000.

217
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:23,111
I'll get it back,
and if any of it's missin'...

218
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:26,114
I'll replace it
with her fine, soft flesh.

219
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:29,117
- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

220
00:22:29,158 --> 00:22:31,786
A girl works for you for ten years,
you trust her.

221
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,789
It must be some kind of a mystery.
I can't...

222
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:37,792
Check with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her.

223
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,794
You still trust her?
Hot creepers, man.

224
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:42,797
She sat there while I dumped it out,
hardly even looked at it...

225
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,050
...plannin', and even flirtin' with me.

226
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:51,514
You trust her.

227
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:14,949
Gee, I'm sorry.
I- I didn't hear you in all this rain.

228
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,951
Go on in, please.

229
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:23,916
- It's a dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

230
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,127
Oh, we have 12, in fact.

231
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,129
Twelve cabins,
twelve vacancies.

232
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,258
They moved away the highway.

233
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,803
- Oh, I thought I had gotten off the main road.
- I knew you must've.

234
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:38,806
No one ever stops here anymore
unless they've done that.

235
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:41,476
Oh.

236
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:44,479
Ah, but it's no use
dwelling on our losses.

237
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,317
We just keep on lightin' the lights
and following the formalities.

238
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:54,113
Uh, and, uh,
your home address.

239
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,532
Town will do.

240
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:00,912
Los Angeles.

241
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,335
Cabin one.

242
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:11,005
It's closer, in case you want anything.
Right next to the office.

243
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:14,217
Oh, I want sleep more than
anything else. Except maybe food.

244
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,763
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside Fairvale.

245
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:22,141
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles.

246
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:24,310
I'll get your bags for you.

247
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,541
Uh, it's stuffy in here.

248
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:54,882
Well, the mattress is soft,
and there's hangers in the closet...

249
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:57,885
...and there's stationery
with "Bates Motel" written on it...

250
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:00,888
...just in case you want to make
your friends back home envious.

251
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,807
Ah. Mmm.

252
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,976
And, um...

253
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,978
...uh, the, uh...

254
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:10,398
Over there.

255
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,942
- The bathroom.
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:17,947
If you want anything at all just tap on
the wall, 'cause I'll be in the office.

257
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:20,825
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.
- Norman Bates.

258
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:24,871
- You have something that most girls don't have.
- I have?

259
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:29,709
There's not a name for it, but it's
something that puts a person at ease.

260
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,879
Well, thank you again.

261
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,591
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to that diner, are you?

262
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:39,344
- No.
- Would you do me a favor, then?

263
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:42,347
Would you have dinner with me?
I was just about to myself.

264
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,182
Nothing special.
Just sandwiches and milk.

265
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:46,935
But I'd like it if you came up
to the house.

266
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:50,939
I don't set a fancy table or anything,
but, uh, the kitchen's awful homey.

267
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:55,526
- I'd like to.
- All right.

268
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,738
Well, then you get settled in,
take off your wet shoes...

269
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,741
...and I'll be back
as soon as it's ready...

270
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:03,660
...with my trusty umbrella.

271
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:20,028
No, I tell you! No!

272
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:23,364
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper.

273
00:29:23,406 --> 00:29:25,450
By candlelight, I suppose...

274
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:29,495
...in the cheap, erotic fashion
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

275
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,497
Mother, please!

276
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,499
And then what?

277
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,501
After supper, music?
Whispers?

278
00:29:35,543 --> 00:29:37,837
Mother, she's just a stranger.

279
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:40,506
She's hungry,
and it's raining out.

280
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:43,426
"Mother, she was just a stranger. "

281
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,970
As if men don't desire strangers.
As if...

282
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:49,474
Well, I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

283
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:51,476
Do you understand, boy?

284
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:57,148
Go on. Tell her she'll not be appeasing
her ugly appetite with my food or my son.

285
00:29:57,231 --> 00:30:00,151
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

286
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:02,403
Shut up! Shut up!

287
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:04,906
Shut up!

288
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:41,401
I've caused you
some trouble.

289
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:45,738
No, uh, Mother...
my mother...

290
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,740
Oh, what's the phrase?

291
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:51,744
She isn't quite herself today.

292
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:55,581
Well, you shouldn't
have bothered.

293
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:58,584
I- I really don't have that much
of an appetite.

294
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,586
Uh, I'm sorry.

295
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:03,506
I wish I could apologize
for other people.

296
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,508
Don't worry about it.

297
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:12,515
Well, as long as
you've fixed us supper...

298
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,226
...we might as well eat it, huh?

299
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,990
It might be nicer and warmer...

300
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:30,992
...in the office.

301
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,512
It's stopped raining.

302
00:31:51,596 --> 00:31:55,558
Eating in an office is just...
too officious.

303
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:57,977
I have the parlor back here.

304
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,979
All right.

305
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,831
Sit down.

306
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:30,051
Thank you.

307
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,220
You're very kind.

308
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:34,973
Oh, it's all for you.

309
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:37,976
Go ahead.
I'm not hungry.

310
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:47,944
You eat like a bird.

311
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:49,946
You would know, of course.

312
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:51,948
Not really.

313
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:55,952
I hear that the expression "eats
like a bird" is really a falsity...

314
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:59,080
...because birds really eat
a tremendous lot.

315
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:02,250
I don't really know
anything about birds.

316
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,919
My hobby is stuffing things.

317
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:07,088
You know... Taxidermy.

318
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:13,595
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I guess
I'd rather stuff birds...

319
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:18,516
...well, because I hate the look
of beasts when they're stuffed.

320
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,518
You know?

321
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:23,146
Foxes and chimps?

322
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:27,108
Some people even stuff dogs and cats.
I couldn't do that.

323
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,945
No, I-I-I think only birds
look well stuffed...

324
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:34,073
...because, um, they're kind of passive
to begin with.

325
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:39,579
That's a strange hobby.
Curious.

326
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:41,247
It's uncommon too.

327
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:43,666
I imagine so.

328
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,669
It's not as expensive as you'd think.
Cheap, really.

329
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:49,797
Uh, needles, thread, sawdust.

330
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,426
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

331
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:55,428
A man should have a hobby.

332
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,805
Oh, it's more than a hobby.

333
00:33:57,847 --> 00:34:00,808
A hobby's supposed to pass your time,
not fill it.

334
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,727
Is your time so empty?

335
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,271
No. I run the office.

336
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:07,273
Tend the cabins, grounds.

337
00:34:07,315 --> 00:34:09,776
Do little errands
for my mother...

338
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:12,528
...the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

339
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:15,448
Don't you go out
w- with friends?

340
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,409
Uh, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

341
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:26,209
You haven't had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

342
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:28,211
Only my share.

343
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:30,255
Where are you goin'?

344
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:33,675
I didn't mean to pry.

345
00:34:35,718 --> 00:34:37,929
I'm looking for
a private island.

346
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,641
What are you running away from?

347
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,851
Why...
Why do you ask that?

348
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,355
No.

349
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:49,524
People never run away
from anything.

350
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:54,612
Rain didn't last long, did it?

351
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:57,448
You know what I think?

352
00:34:57,532 --> 00:35:00,410
I think we're all in our private traps,
clamped in 'em.

353
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:02,829
We can never get out.

354
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,542
Oh, we scratch and claw,
but only at the air...

355
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,877
...only at each other.

356
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:14,549
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

357
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:17,677
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

358
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:21,055
I was born into mine.

359
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,309
But I don't mind it anymore.

360
00:35:24,392 --> 00:35:27,604
Well, you should.
You should mind.

361
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:31,065
I do.

362
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,735
I just...
I say that I don't.

363
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:39,741
Y- You know, if anyone
ever spoke to me...

364
00:35:39,782 --> 00:35:43,161
...the way I heard...
the way she talked to you, I...

365
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:48,458
Sometimes when she
talks to me like that...

366
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,461
I feel like I could curse her out
and leave her forever.

367
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,504
Or at least defy her.

368
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:56,341
Well, but I know I can't.

369
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:58,343
She's ill.

370
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:00,136
She sounded strong.

371
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:04,057
Uh, no.
I mean, ill.

372
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:09,687
She had to raise me all by herself
after my father died.

373
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:13,191
I was only five.
Must've been quite a strain for her.

374
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:16,736
It's not like she had to go to work
or anything like that.

375
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,738
H- He left her a little money.

376
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,949
Anyway, um...

377
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:24,619
...a few years ago
Mother met this man.

378
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:28,665
He talked her into
building this motel.

379
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:31,167
He could've talked her
into anything.

380
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:36,714
And when he died too,
it was just...

381
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:40,426
...just too great of a shock for her.

382
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:42,428
And the way that he died...

383
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:48,643
I- I guess it's nothing you should be
talking about when you're eating.

384
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:51,020
But, anyway, uh...

385
00:36:51,104 --> 00:36:54,023
...it was just too great
of a loss for her...

386
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:57,777
...and, you know,
she had nothin' left.

387
00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:00,154
Except you.

388
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:02,156
Yeah.

389
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:06,369
A son's a poor substitute
for a lover.

390
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:09,080
Why don't you go away?

391
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:12,250
- To a private island, like you?
- No. No.

392
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,877
Not like me.
Just...

393
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,341
I couldn't do that.

394
00:37:20,383 --> 00:37:23,177
Who'd take care of her?

395
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:25,847
She'd be all alone up there.

396
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,974
The fire'd go out.

397
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:31,102
It'd be cold and damp...

398
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:33,104
...like a grave.

399
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:37,859
If you love someone,
you can't do that to 'em.

400
00:37:39,235 --> 00:37:41,195
Even if you hate 'em.

401
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:45,658
Understand, I...

402
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,871
I don't hate her.

403
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:52,290
I hate what she's become.

404
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:54,584
I hate the illness.

405
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:58,546
Well, wouldn't it be better...

406
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:00,548
...i- if y... if you...

407
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,595
...if you put her someplace or...

408
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:09,515
Do you mean an institution?

409
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:11,684
A madhouse?

410
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,483
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

411
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:21,611
Put her in... Someplace.

412
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:25,531
I'm sor...
I didn't mean to sound uncaring. L...

413
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:29,535
What do you know about caring? Have you
ever seen the inside of one of those places?

414
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:32,538
The laughing and the tears
and the cruel eyes studying you?

415
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,332
My mother, in there?

416
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:36,668
She's harmless.

417
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:39,671
She's as harmless as one
of these stuffed birds.

418
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:43,591
I am sorry, I...

419
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:45,593
I on... I only felt I...

420
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:48,763
- You felt what?
- It seemed that she was... She's hurting you.

421
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:52,141
L... I meant well.

422
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:56,896
People always mean well.

423
00:38:56,938 --> 00:39:00,692
They cluck their thick tongues
and they shake their heads...

424
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:04,821
...and they suggest,
oh, so very delicately.

425
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:16,958
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

426
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,961
I hate to think about it.
She needs me.

427
00:39:21,713 --> 00:39:24,882
It's not as if she were a maniac
or a raving thing.

428
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,968
She just...

429
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:28,970
...goes a little mad sometimes.

430
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:31,931
We all go a little mad sometimes.

431
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,933
Haven't you?

432
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,478
Yes.

433
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,525
Sometimes only one time
can be enough.

434
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:44,527
Thank you.

435
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:46,654
Oh, um...
Thank you, Norman?

436
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:49,324
Norman.

437
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:52,327
You're not goin' back
to your room already.

438
00:39:52,368 --> 00:39:54,329
Oh, I'm very tired...

439
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,415
...and I have a very long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

440
00:39:57,498 --> 00:39:59,918
Really.

441
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:02,420
I stepped into
a private trap back there...

442
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:06,758
...and I'd like to go and try to pull myself
out of it before it's too late for me too.

443
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:09,761
Well, you sure you don't wanna stay
just a little while longer...

444
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,763
...just for talk?

445
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:15,850
Well, I'd like to, but...

446
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:18,353
All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

447
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:20,980
I'll bring you some breakfast.
What time?

448
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:22,982
Very early.
Dawn.

449
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:27,487
All right,
Miss, um, uh...

450
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:29,781
Crane.

451
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:32,742
Crane.
That's it.

452
00:40:32,825 --> 00:40:34,744
Good night.

453
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:41,004
Mother?

454
00:47:41,087 --> 00:47:45,216
Oh, God!
Blood! Blood!

455
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,218
Blood, blood,
blood, blood...

456
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:49,220
...blood, blood,
blood, blood.

457
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:56,411
They tell you
what the ingredients are...

458
00:57:56,494 --> 00:58:00,957
...and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
any insect in the world...

459
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,752
...but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

460
00:58:04,794 --> 00:58:09,465
I believe, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

461
00:58:09,591 --> 00:58:11,801
Wow.

462
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:29,319
- Sam.
- Sam, there's a lady here for you.

463
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:38,578
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

464
00:58:38,661 --> 00:58:42,457
- Oh. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

465
00:58:42,498 --> 00:58:46,961
- Of course not. Is something wrong?
- She left home on Friday.

466
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:50,006
I was in Tucson over the weekend, and I
haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.

467
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:53,343
Look, if you two are in this together,
I don't care. It's none of my business.

468
00:58:53,384 --> 00:58:56,054
But I wanna talk to Marion, and I want
her to tell me it's none of my business.

469
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:58,681
- And then I'll go!
- Uh, Bob!

470
00:58:58,723 --> 00:59:02,018
- Run out and get yourself lunch.
- That's okay. I brought it with me.

471
00:59:02,101 --> 00:59:03,853
Run out and eat it.

472
00:59:10,026 --> 00:59:13,529
Now what... what thing
could we be in on together?

473
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:15,531
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

474
00:59:15,615 --> 00:59:19,535
Is Marion in trouble?
Or, what is it?

475
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:22,372
Let's all talk
about Marion, shall we?

476
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,877
Who are you, friend?

477
00:59:27,961 --> 00:59:33,216
My name's Arbogast, friend.
I'm a private investigator.

478
00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:35,927
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

479
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,930
I know you don't. If you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

480
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:41,432
W- What's your interest in this?

481
00:59:41,516 --> 00:59:43,935
Four hundred thousand dollars.

482
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:48,273
- Four hundred thousand dollars?
- That's right.

483
00:59:48,356 --> 00:59:51,276
One of you better tell me
what's going on here and tell me fast.

484
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,279
- I can... I can take just so much of this.
- Just take it easy, friend.

485
00:59:54,362 --> 00:59:56,406
Your girlfriend stole $400,000.

486
00:59:56,489 --> 00:59:59,576
What are you talking about?
What is this?

487
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:02,579
She was supposed to bank it
on Friday for her boss.

488
01:00:02,662 --> 01:00:05,206
She didn't.
No one has seen her since.

489
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:07,250
Oh, someone's seen her.

490
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:10,503
Someone always sees a girl
with $400,000.

491
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:14,382
Sam, they don't wanna prosecute. They just
want the money back. So if she's here, tell us.

492
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:17,427
She's not. She isn't.
She ain't here.

493
01:00:17,468 --> 01:00:19,762
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

494
01:00:19,846 --> 01:00:22,432
Did you come all the way up here
on a hunch and nothing more?

495
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:24,392
Not even a hunch.
Just hope.

496
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:27,312
You know, with a little checking,
I could get to believe you.

497
01:00:27,395 --> 01:00:29,856
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

498
01:00:29,939 --> 01:00:33,818
All I wanna do is find Marion
before she gets into this too deeply.

499
01:00:33,901 --> 01:00:36,571
Yeah. Did you check in Phoenix?
In the hospitals?

500
01:00:36,613 --> 01:00:40,575
- Maybe she had an accident or a holdup.
- No.

501
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:43,828
She was seen leaving town in her car,
by her employer, I might add.

502
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:47,332
Well, I can't believe it.
Can you?

503
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:49,792
Well, you know...

504
01:00:49,876 --> 01:00:54,172
...we're always quickest to doubt people
who have a record for being honest.

505
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:56,174
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

506
01:00:56,257 --> 01:00:59,010
Where there's a boyfriend...

507
01:00:59,093 --> 01:01:03,806
Well, she's not back there with the nuts
and bolts, but she's here in this town.

508
01:01:03,848 --> 01:01:07,435
Somewhere.
I'll find her.

509
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,695
- You haven't seen her?
- No.

510
01:01:35,129 --> 01:01:37,048
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

511
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:41,010
- I almost drove right past.
- Yeah, I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on.

512
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:43,304
But we do have a vacancy.
Twelve, in fact.

513
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:46,683
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
Some candy?

514
01:01:46,724 --> 01:01:48,685
No, thanks.

515
01:01:48,726 --> 01:01:52,188
Last two days, I've been to so many
motels, my eyes are bleary with the neon.

516
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,190
But you know,
this is the first one...

517
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:56,693
...that looks like
it's hiding from the world.

518
01:01:56,734 --> 01:01:58,861
I didn't really forget
to turn the sign on.

519
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:01,197
It just doesn't seem
like much use anymore.

520
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:06,411
You know, that used to be
the main highway right over there.

521
01:02:06,494 --> 01:02:08,913
- Wanna come in and register?
- No. No, no, no. Sit down.

522
01:02:08,997 --> 01:02:11,583
Don't wanna trouble you.
Just wanna ask you some questions.

523
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,626
No trouble at all.
Today's linen day.

524
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:17,297
I change the beds here once a week,
whether they've been used or not.

525
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,465
I just hate the smell
of dampness, you know?

526
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:23,052
Such a... I don't know...
kind of a creepy smell.

527
01:02:23,136 --> 01:02:26,014
Come on.

528
01:02:26,055 --> 01:02:30,351
- You out to buy a motel?
- Uh, no.

529
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:33,354
The reason I ask is because you said
you'd seen so many in the past couple days.

530
01:02:33,396 --> 01:02:35,565
I thought maybe you...
What was it you wanted to ask me?

531
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:37,567
Looking for a missing person.

532
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:41,529
- My name's Arbogast. I'm a
private investigator. - Mm-hmm.

533
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:45,658
I'm trying to trace a girl that's been
missing for, oh, about a week now.

534
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:50,288
- Mm-hmm.
- From Phoenix. It's a private matter.

535
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:53,333
Family wants to forgive her.
She's not in any trouble.

536
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:56,336
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in any trouble.

537
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:59,005
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah. Private investigator.

538
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:03,760
Uh, we have reason to believe
she came along this way.

539
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:08,056
Might've stopped in the area.
Did, uh, she stop here?

540
01:03:08,097 --> 01:03:10,767
No one's stopped here
for a couple weeks.

541
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,811
- Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
- Commit myself?

542
01:03:13,895 --> 01:03:17,607
- You sure sound like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

543
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,943
- Mm-mm.
- You're sure.

544
01:03:19,984 --> 01:03:21,945
Yeah.

545
01:03:22,028 --> 01:03:24,614
Well, it's possible
she used an alias.

546
01:03:24,656 --> 01:03:28,660
Marion Crane is her real name, but she
could've registered under a different one.

547
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:32,288
I don't even bother registering people anymore.
One by one, you sort of drop formalities.

548
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:36,292
I shouldn't even be changing the sheets,
but old habits die hard.

549
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:38,294
Oh, which reminds me.

550
01:03:39,379 --> 01:03:42,048
- What's that?
- The lights. The sign.

551
01:03:42,131 --> 01:03:44,801
We had a couple last week, said if it hadn't
been on, they would've driven right past.

552
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:48,513
- It looked like a deserted...
- Now, you see, that's my point.

553
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:50,515
You said, nobody had been here
for a couple of weeks.

554
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:52,517
Now there's this couple
came by, and...

555
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,061
- Yeah. Yeah.
- They didn't know you were open.

556
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:58,106
Well, as you say,
old habits die hard.

557
01:03:58,147 --> 01:04:00,483
It's possible this girl registered
under a different name.

558
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:03,653
- Could I look at your book?
- Mm-hmm.

559
01:04:03,695 --> 01:04:05,655
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

560
01:04:05,697 --> 01:04:09,701
I got the, uh...
got the date here somewhere.

561
01:04:09,784 --> 01:04:11,995
See? There's no one there.

562
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:14,372
I got a sample
of her handwriting.

563
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:25,258
Oh, yeah, here we are. "Marie Samuels. "
That's an interesting alias.

564
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:28,011
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

565
01:04:28,094 --> 01:04:33,516
Marie... Marion. Samuels.
Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

566
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,686
Was she in disguise, by any chance?
You wanna look at the picture again?

567
01:04:36,728 --> 01:04:39,689
Look, Mr. Arbogast,
I'm not lying to you. It's just that...

568
01:04:39,731 --> 01:04:41,524
No, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

569
01:04:41,608 --> 01:04:45,236
It's just i-i-it's hard
to keep track of time around here.

570
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,864
Oh, I know, I know.

571
01:04:51,326 --> 01:04:53,244
Oh, yeah.

572
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:58,499
Yeah, it was raining that night,
and her hair was all wet.

573
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:01,169
And I'll tell ya, that's not
a very good picture of her either.

574
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:02,921
No, I guess not.

575
01:05:03,004 --> 01:05:06,466
- At all.
- I guess not. Tell me all about her.

576
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:10,553
Well, she arrived rather late
one night and went to sleep...

577
01:05:10,637 --> 01:05:12,513
...and left early in the morning.

578
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:14,515
- How early?
- Very early.

579
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:17,560
- Which morning was this?
- The next day, so, Sunday.

580
01:05:17,644 --> 01:05:22,357
- Mm-hmm. Did, uh, anyone meet her here?
- Uh-uh.

581
01:05:22,398 --> 01:05:25,068
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- Nope.

582
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:29,030
- Did she make any phone calls or, uh...
- Mm-mm.

583
01:05:29,072 --> 01:05:31,241
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

584
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:34,202
- You spend the night with her?
- No.

585
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:38,248
Well, then, how do you know she didn't
make any phone calls?

586
01:05:38,331 --> 01:05:40,541
Well, we, um...

587
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:45,088
Well, she-she was
very tired, and...

588
01:05:45,171 --> 01:05:47,548
I- I... I'm starting
to remember it now.

589
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:52,428
I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

590
01:05:52,512 --> 01:05:56,307
Do you know how you do that? How you
make a mental picturization of something?

591
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:58,309
That's right.
Take your time.

592
01:05:58,393 --> 01:06:03,064
She was, uh...
Yeah, she was sitting back there.

593
01:06:03,106 --> 01:06:07,277
Mm-mm. She was standing back there,
and she had a sandwich in her hand...

594
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:11,239
...and she said that she had
a long drive ahead of her...

595
01:06:11,281 --> 01:06:14,742
...so she went to bed,
uh, straight to bed.

596
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:16,869
- Back where?
- Back from where she came from.

597
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:20,164
You said before, she was sitting
or standing "back there"?

598
01:06:20,248 --> 01:06:22,417
Yes. In my parlor back there.

599
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:25,169
She said she was very hungry,
so I made her a sandwich...

600
01:06:25,253 --> 01:06:30,091
...and, uh, she, uh, said she was tired
and went straight to sleep.

601
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:32,093
Oh, I see.

602
01:06:32,135 --> 01:06:34,137
How'd she pay you?
A check, cash?

603
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,974
- Cash.
- Oh, cash, huh? Hmm.

604
01:06:38,057 --> 01:06:41,269
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Why would she?

605
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:44,272
Yeah.

606
01:06:44,314 --> 01:06:46,357
Well, I guess that's about it,
Mr. Arbogast.

607
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:49,110
So, uh, I got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

608
01:06:49,152 --> 01:06:51,112
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

609
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:55,158
If it don't jell, it ain't Jell-O,
and this just ain't jelling.

610
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:58,620
It's not coming together somehow.
Something's missing.

611
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:01,664
I don't know what else you could expect
me to know. People just come and go.

612
01:07:01,748 --> 01:07:05,793
That's right.
She's not still here, is she?

613
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:08,546
- No.
- Mm.

614
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:12,884
If I wanted to check the cabins, all 12
of 'em, would I need a warrant for that?

615
01:07:12,967 --> 01:07:17,680
If you don't believe me, you can help me
change the beds, if you like.

616
01:07:17,722 --> 01:07:21,351
Uh, no.
No, thanks.

617
01:07:42,872 --> 01:07:45,375
Change your mind?

618
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:49,545
You know, I must have one of those faces
you just can't help believing.

619
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:51,547
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

620
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:54,300
Oh, there's someone
sitting up in the window.

621
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:56,886
- No, there isn't.
- Oh, sure, go ahead, take a look.

622
01:07:56,928 --> 01:08:01,391
Oh, that-that's my mother.
She's an in... invalid.

623
01:08:01,432 --> 01:08:05,144
An inval... An invalid.
It's practically like living alone.

624
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:07,772
Oh, I see.

625
01:08:07,855 --> 01:08:11,234
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would ya?

626
01:08:13,152 --> 01:08:17,156
- No.
- Not even if she paid you a lot of money?

627
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,242
- No.
- Well, let's just say...

628
01:08:19,284 --> 01:08:22,579
...for the sake of argument, that she
wanted you to gallantly protect her.

629
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:25,582
You'd know you were being used. You
wouldn't be made a fool of, would ya?

630
01:08:25,623 --> 01:08:29,919
I'm not a fool. I'm not capable of
being made a fool, not even by a woman.

631
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:31,921
It's not a slur on your manhood.
I'm sorry.

632
01:08:31,963 --> 01:08:36,467
Let's put it this way. She might've made a
fool of me, but she didn't fool my mother.

633
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:38,469
Well, then, your mother met her?
Could I talk to your mother?

634
01:08:38,553 --> 01:08:40,555
- As I just told you, she-she's confined.
- Yeah.

635
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:43,141
But just for a few minutes.
L... That's all.

636
01:08:43,224 --> 01:08:45,935
There might be some hint
that you overlooked.

637
01:08:46,019 --> 01:08:47,979
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

638
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:50,481
Mr. Arbogast,
I- I explained to you now...

639
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:52,775
Just for a moment.
I wouldn't disturb her.

640
01:08:52,817 --> 01:08:55,278
I've talked to you
all I want to.

641
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:00,450
- Yes, but just for one moment.
- I think it'd be much better if you left now.

642
01:09:00,491 --> 01:09:05,663
Okay. You know, you'd save me a lot of legwork
if you'd just let me talk to her about...

643
01:09:05,747 --> 01:09:07,874
- Do I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

644
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:10,877
All right.
Thanks anyway.

645
01:09:48,498 --> 01:09:52,543
Oh! Hello, Loomis?
It's Arbogast. Is Lila there?

646
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:55,046
Can I talk to her, please?

647
01:09:56,798 --> 01:10:00,760
Hello, Lila. Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

648
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:03,763
Yep. She spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

649
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:05,765
It's out here
on the old highway.

650
01:10:05,848 --> 01:10:09,269
I even know what cabin she was in.
Cabin number one.

651
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:12,188
Well, the young fella
that runs the place said...

652
01:10:12,272 --> 01:10:15,191
...she just spent the night,
left the next day, and that was it.

653
01:10:15,275 --> 01:10:17,902
No. No, not exactly.

654
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:20,071
Well, I did question him.
Believe me.

655
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:22,073
I think I got
all there was to get.

656
01:10:22,156 --> 01:10:24,826
I'll have to pick up
the pieces from here.

657
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:30,164
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied.

658
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:32,625
See, this boy has
a sick old mother.

659
01:10:32,709 --> 01:10:35,628
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

660
01:10:35,712 --> 01:10:40,633
No. No. Unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

661
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:45,179
Well, I was. I think
I'll go back to the motel first.

662
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:48,558
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in an hour.

663
01:10:48,641 --> 01:10:50,560
All right.

664
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:40,234
Bates?

665
01:14:10,134 --> 01:14:13,680
Sometimes, Saturday night has
a lonely sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

666
01:14:13,763 --> 01:14:17,684
Sam, please.
He said an hour or less.

667
01:14:20,395 --> 01:14:22,313
Yep.
Been three.

668
01:14:22,397 --> 01:14:25,316
Are we just gonna sit here
and wait?

669
01:14:27,151 --> 01:14:30,280
He'll be back.
Sit still.

670
01:14:30,321 --> 01:14:32,282
Hang on.

671
01:14:34,284 --> 01:14:37,328
How far is it to the old highway?

672
01:14:37,412 --> 01:14:41,082
You wanna go out there, don't ya?
Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.

673
01:14:41,124 --> 01:14:43,167
- Maybe scare her a little bit.
- Yeah.

674
01:14:43,251 --> 01:14:47,589
- Wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family. I'm going out there.

675
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:50,800
- Arbogast said...
- An hour or less.

676
01:14:50,842 --> 01:14:53,303
All right.
I'll call out there.

677
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:02,645
Well, I'm goin'.

678
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:06,149
You'll never find it.

679
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:07,650
- Lila.
- What?

680
01:15:07,692 --> 01:15:11,321
- I'll go. You stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?

681
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:13,823
I don't know. One of us has to be here
in case he's on the way.

682
01:15:13,907 --> 01:15:16,409
What am I supposed to do?
Just sit here and wait?

683
01:15:16,492 --> 01:15:19,746
Yeah.

684
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:21,748
Have another beer.

685
01:15:39,599 --> 01:15:41,517
Mr. Arbogast?

686
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:45,772
Mr. Arbogast?

687
01:15:49,067 --> 01:15:51,027
Arbogast!

688
01:16:07,293 --> 01:16:10,546
- Did he come back here?
- Sam.

689
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:14,175
No Arbogast. No Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

690
01:16:14,217 --> 01:16:18,221
Sick old lady unable to answer the door,
or unwilling.

691
01:16:18,304 --> 01:16:20,390
Where could he have gone?

692
01:16:20,473 --> 01:16:23,393
Maybe he had a lead.
Maybe he went right on ahead and...

693
01:16:23,476 --> 01:16:25,770
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.

694
01:16:25,853 --> 01:16:28,898
Sam, he called when he had nothing,
nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

695
01:16:28,982 --> 01:16:32,902
Don't you think he would've called
if he had anything at all?

696
01:16:34,904 --> 01:16:37,407
Yeah, I think
he would have.

697
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:39,659
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

698
01:16:39,742 --> 01:16:41,911
He's our deputy sheriff
around here.

699
01:16:41,995 --> 01:16:43,913
Let me get my Walkman.

700
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:50,753
Now, your sister's
been missing how long?

701
01:16:50,837 --> 01:16:53,548
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

702
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:57,885
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

703
01:16:57,927 --> 01:17:01,598
Uh, they thought
that she'd be coming to me.

704
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:04,434
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yeah.

705
01:17:04,475 --> 01:17:08,396
Then she's not missing
so much as she's run away.

706
01:17:08,438 --> 01:17:11,399
- Yeah, that's right.
- From what?

707
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:15,111
She stole some money.

708
01:17:15,194 --> 01:17:18,156
- A lot?
- Four hundred thousand dollars.

709
01:17:19,616 --> 01:17:21,784
And the police haven't
been able to...

710
01:17:21,826 --> 01:17:24,245
Everyone concerned thought that if they
could get her to give the money back...

711
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:27,415
...they could avoid involving her
with the police.

712
01:17:27,457 --> 01:17:30,752
Explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

713
01:17:30,793 --> 01:17:32,795
What exactly did he say
when he called?

714
01:17:32,879 --> 01:17:35,798
He said that Marion stayed there
for one night, and then she left.

715
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,800
With the $400,000?

716
01:17:37,842 --> 01:17:40,470
He didn't say anything about the money.
It's not important what he said on the phone.

717
01:17:40,511 --> 01:17:43,473
He was supposed to come back after he
talked to the mother, and he didn't.

718
01:17:43,514 --> 01:17:47,310
- That's what I want you to do something about.
- Like what?

719
01:17:47,393 --> 01:17:49,312
I- I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

720
01:17:49,395 --> 01:17:52,649
It's just that something is wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

721
01:17:52,732 --> 01:17:56,110
Well, I think there's something
wrong too, but not the same thing.

722
01:17:56,152 --> 01:17:58,279
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

723
01:17:58,321 --> 01:18:01,157
I think he got a hot lead
as to where your sister was going...

724
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,159
...probably from Norman Bates...

725
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:06,829
...and called to keep you still while he
took off after your sister and the money.

726
01:18:06,871 --> 01:18:09,999
No, he said he was dissatisfied
and was going back there.

727
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:13,461
Why don't you call Norman
and just let him say what happened?

728
01:18:17,966 --> 01:18:22,720
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

729
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:28,685
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

730
01:18:28,726 --> 01:18:32,063
I've been just fine, thanks.
Listen, we got worries here.

731
01:18:32,146 --> 01:18:35,108
Did you have a fellow
stop out there tonight?

732
01:18:35,191 --> 01:18:37,569
No, this one wouldn't be
a customer anyway.

733
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:40,029
- It's a private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

734
01:18:40,113 --> 01:18:42,031
Arbogast.

735
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:48,079
And after he left?

736
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:50,206
No, that's okay, Norman.

737
01:18:50,248 --> 01:18:52,208
Well, this detective was there.

738
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,878
Norman told him about the girl,
the detective thanked him, went away.

739
01:18:55,962 --> 01:18:59,549
He didn't come back?
Didn't see the mother?

740
01:18:59,591 --> 01:19:02,885
Your detective told you that
he couldn't come back right away...

741
01:19:02,969 --> 01:19:05,388
...because he wanted to question
Norman Bates' mother?

742
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:07,265
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

743
01:19:07,348 --> 01:19:09,350
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

744
01:19:09,392 --> 01:19:12,020
...in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

745
01:19:12,061 --> 01:19:16,899
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

746
01:19:16,983 --> 01:19:19,944
It ain't only local history, Sam.

747
01:19:20,028 --> 01:19:24,949
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on the Fairvale ledgers.

748
01:19:25,033 --> 01:19:28,077
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with...

749
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:30,747
- when she found out he was married.
- Oh.

750
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:34,083
Then she took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

751
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:38,046
Strychnine.
An ugly way to die.

752
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:40,965
Norman found them dead together.
In bed.

753
01:19:43,384 --> 01:19:48,306
You mean, that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window is not Norman Bates' mother?

754
01:19:48,389 --> 01:19:51,935
Now just a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

755
01:19:51,976 --> 01:19:54,938
Yeah. In the house
behind the motel.

756
01:19:54,979 --> 01:19:58,942
I called and pounded,
but she just ignored me.

757
01:19:58,983 --> 01:20:03,529
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs. Bates...

758
01:20:03,613 --> 01:20:06,783
...who's that woman buried
out in Green Lawn Cemetery?

759
01:20:45,863 --> 01:20:49,951
Mother, I, uh,
have to take you downstairs.

760
01:20:49,993 --> 01:20:53,079
I am sorry, boy...

761
01:20:53,162 --> 01:20:56,791
...but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

762
01:20:56,833 --> 01:21:02,755
- Please, Mother.
- No, I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

763
01:21:02,839 --> 01:21:06,676
Think I'm fruity, huh?
I'm staying right here.

764
01:21:06,718 --> 01:21:10,013
This is my room,
and no one will drag me out of it...

765
01:21:10,054 --> 01:21:12,849
...least of all my big, bold son.

766
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:14,851
They'll come now, Mother.

767
01:21:14,892 --> 01:21:18,146
He came after the girl.
Now someone will come after him.

768
01:21:18,187 --> 01:21:22,025
Mother, please,
it's just for a few days.

769
01:21:22,108 --> 01:21:24,527
Just for a few days
so they don't find you.

770
01:21:24,611 --> 01:21:27,196
"Just for a few days. "

771
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,198
In that dank fruit cellar?

772
01:21:29,282 --> 01:21:33,202
No! You hid me there once, boy,
and you won't do it again.

773
01:21:33,244 --> 01:21:38,833
Get out! Norman, what do you think
you're going to do?

774
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:41,794
Don't you touch me.
Don't!

775
01:21:41,878 --> 01:21:45,548
Put me down,
and I'll walk on my own.

776
01:21:55,224 --> 01:21:58,686
Guess we better decide what we're gonna
say and do when we walk in there.

777
01:21:58,728 --> 01:22:02,231
We're gonna register
as man and wife...

778
01:22:02,273 --> 01:22:04,484
...and then we're gonna
get shown to a cabin...

779
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:09,280
...and we're gonna search every inch
of that place inside and out.

780
01:22:30,218 --> 01:22:33,304
Nope. I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting?

781
01:22:33,388 --> 01:22:36,307
Someone's in the window.
I just saw something move.

782
01:22:38,309 --> 01:22:41,104
- Well.
- We were just coming up to ring for you.

783
01:22:41,145 --> 01:22:43,106
Suppose you want a room.

784
01:22:43,147 --> 01:22:46,067
Yeah, we were gonna try to make it
all the way to San Francisco...

785
01:22:46,109 --> 01:22:48,570
...but we don't like
the look of that sky.

786
01:22:48,611 --> 01:22:51,739
Looks like a bad day coming up.

787
01:22:51,781 --> 01:22:53,741
Okay.

788
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:01,165
Take you to cabin ten.

789
01:23:01,249 --> 01:23:04,460
- Uh, better sign in first.
- No, it isn't necessary.

790
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:08,590
No, my boss paid
for this trip...

791
01:23:08,631 --> 01:23:12,010
...and it's 90% business...

792
01:23:12,093 --> 01:23:14,220
...so he wants practically
notarized receipts.

793
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,223
I think we better sign in
and get a receipt.

794
01:23:17,307 --> 01:23:18,933
Mm-hmm.

795
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:24,856
Thank you.

796
01:23:29,777 --> 01:23:31,696
- All right.
- All right.

797
01:23:31,779 --> 01:23:33,823
I'll get your bags.

798
01:23:33,865 --> 01:23:36,034
Uh, haven't any.

799
01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:38,369
I'll show you
to your room then.

800
01:23:38,453 --> 01:23:40,371
First time I ever seen
that happen.

801
01:23:40,455 --> 01:23:46,002
You check into any place in this country
without a bag, you got to pay in advance.

802
01:23:47,378 --> 01:23:51,007
- Thirty-six dollars and fifty cents.
- All righty.

803
01:23:56,763 --> 01:23:59,349
All righty.

804
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:02,143
That receipt?

805
01:24:03,978 --> 01:24:06,314
I'll go on ahead.

806
01:24:09,525 --> 01:24:12,195
There's your receipt.
I'll show you the cabin.

807
01:24:12,237 --> 01:24:15,531
Nah, that's okay.
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

808
01:24:41,057 --> 01:24:44,018
We gotta go in there
and search that cabin, Sam...

809
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:47,272
...no matter what we're afraid of finding,
or how much it may hurt.

810
01:24:47,355 --> 01:24:49,274
I know.

811
01:24:49,357 --> 01:24:51,901
You think if something happened,
it happened here?

812
01:24:51,943 --> 01:24:55,321
I don't know. If you had
a useless business like this motel...

813
01:24:55,405 --> 01:24:59,867
...what would it take to get out,
get a new business someplace else?

814
01:24:59,909 --> 01:25:02,579
Four hundred thousand dollars?

815
01:25:03,913 --> 01:25:06,583
Well, how can we prove that?

816
01:25:06,624 --> 01:25:08,751
There's got to be some proof
that exists right now...

817
01:25:08,835 --> 01:25:11,421
...something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

818
01:25:11,462 --> 01:25:15,967
What makes
you sound so certain?

819
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:19,137
Arbogast.
He liked me, Sam.

820
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:21,139
Felt sorry for me. He was starting
to feel the same way about you.

821
01:25:21,222 --> 01:25:23,600
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

822
01:25:23,683 --> 01:25:26,269
He wouldn't have gone anywhere without
telling us unless he was stopped.

823
01:25:26,311 --> 01:25:29,105
And he was stopped,
so he must've found out something.

824
01:25:29,147 --> 01:25:32,609
All right.
We'll start with cabin one.

825
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:09,979
Bates?

826
01:26:50,895 --> 01:26:52,855
No shower curtain.

827
01:26:52,897 --> 01:26:54,857
Sam, look.

828
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:57,694
- What is it?
- Figuring that didn't get washed down.

829
01:26:57,777 --> 01:27:01,114
Look, some figure's been added to
or subtracted from 400,000.

830
01:27:01,197 --> 01:27:03,199
Proves Marion was here.
It's too wild a coincidence.

831
01:27:03,283 --> 01:27:07,036
Wait a minute.
Bates never denied she was here.

832
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,539
Uh...

833
01:27:09,622 --> 01:27:13,835
Doesn't it prove he found out
about the money?

834
01:27:13,876 --> 01:27:16,462
- Should we ask him where he's hidden it?
- No.

835
01:27:16,546 --> 01:27:19,674
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

836
01:27:19,716 --> 01:27:21,676
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

837
01:27:21,718 --> 01:27:24,387
- Hey, you can't go up there.
- Why not?

838
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:26,556
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

839
01:27:26,598 --> 01:27:29,183
One of us can keep him occupied, and
the other one can get to the old woman.

840
01:27:29,225 --> 01:27:32,186
You won't be able to hold him still,
if he doesn't wanna be held.

841
01:27:32,228 --> 01:27:34,355
I don't like you going
up in that house alone.

842
01:27:34,397 --> 01:27:37,859
I can handle a sick old woman.

843
01:27:37,901 --> 01:27:41,571
All right. I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

844
01:27:57,337 --> 01:27:59,547
- Looking for me?
- Uh, yeah, matter of fact.

845
01:27:59,589 --> 01:28:03,051
Uh, wife's taking a nap,
and, uh...

846
01:28:03,092 --> 01:28:05,595
I can never keep
quiet enough for her...

847
01:28:05,678 --> 01:28:09,098
...so I thought maybe
I'd look you up and talk.

848
01:28:09,182 --> 01:28:12,644
Good.
Satisfied with your cabin?

849
01:28:12,727 --> 01:28:15,271
Oh, it's fine.

850
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:11,077
Mrs. Bates?

851
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,871
You're alone here,
aren't you?

852
01:29:13,955 --> 01:29:16,040
It would drive me crazy.

853
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:19,002
That'd be a rather extreme reaction,
don't you think?

854
01:29:19,043 --> 01:29:23,006
That's just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do just about anything to get away.

855
01:29:23,047 --> 01:29:25,341
Wouldn't you?

856
01:29:25,425 --> 01:29:27,343
No.

857
01:29:27,427 --> 01:29:30,263
Mrs. Bates?

858
01:29:33,141 --> 01:29:35,893
Mrs. Bates?

859
01:30:34,202 --> 01:30:37,622
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented
here. I'm just doubtin' that you are.

860
01:30:37,705 --> 01:30:42,585
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under here, you'd unload this place.

861
01:30:42,627 --> 01:30:44,837
"This place"?

862
01:30:44,921 --> 01:30:47,590
This place happens to be
my only world.

863
01:30:47,632 --> 01:30:50,843
See, I grew up in that house up there
and had a very happy childhood.

864
01:30:50,927 --> 01:30:54,305
My mother and me...
were more than happy.

865
01:31:35,722 --> 01:31:39,058
You seem frightened.
Am I saying something frightening?

866
01:31:39,142 --> 01:31:41,060
I don't know
what you're saying.

867
01:31:41,144 --> 01:31:44,564
I'm talkin' about your mother,
about your motel.

868
01:31:45,648 --> 01:31:48,735
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

869
01:31:48,818 --> 01:31:51,988
Buy a new one, in a new town...

870
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:54,991
...where you won't
have to hide your mother.

871
01:31:55,074 --> 01:31:58,953
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here.

872
01:31:58,995 --> 01:32:01,998
Where you gonna get that kind of money?
Or, do you already have it somewhere?

873
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:05,126
- Shut up! Shut up.
- Huh?

874
01:32:05,168 --> 01:32:08,129
A lot of it.
Four hundred thousand dollars.

875
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:11,549
I bet your mother knows where it is
and what you did to get it.

876
01:32:11,633 --> 01:32:14,552
Where's that girl
that you came here with?

877
01:32:16,429 --> 01:32:18,723
I'll bet she'll tell us.

878
01:33:32,589 --> 01:33:34,507
Mrs. Bates?

879
01:34:43,618 --> 01:34:45,536
So, Norman.

880
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:49,332
If anybody can get any answers,
it'll be the psychiatrist.

881
01:34:49,374 --> 01:34:53,711
Even I couldn't get to Norman,
and he knows me.

882
01:34:53,795 --> 01:34:56,673
You warm enough, miss?

883
01:34:56,756 --> 01:35:00,218
Did he talk to you?

884
01:35:00,301 --> 01:35:02,637
No.

885
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:06,849
I got the whole story,
but not from Norman.

886
01:35:06,933 --> 01:35:08,851
I got it from his mother.

887
01:35:08,935 --> 01:35:12,021
Norman Bates no longer exists.

888
01:35:12,063 --> 01:35:15,191
He only half-existed
to begin with.

889
01:35:15,233 --> 01:35:18,194
Now, the other half
has taken over.

890
01:35:18,236 --> 01:35:20,196
Probably for all time.

891
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:23,199
- Did he kill my sister?
- Yes.

892
01:35:23,283 --> 01:35:26,869
I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

893
01:35:26,953 --> 01:35:30,373
If you drag the swamp
in the vicinity of the motel...

894
01:35:32,917 --> 01:35:37,046
To understand it as I understood it,
hearing it from the "mother"...

895
01:35:37,088 --> 01:35:40,216
...that is, the mother-half
of Norman's mind...

896
01:35:40,258 --> 01:35:42,260
...you have to go back ten years...

897
01:35:42,343 --> 01:35:46,055
...to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

898
01:35:47,599 --> 01:35:50,059
He was already
dangerously disturbed.

899
01:35:50,101 --> 01:35:52,937
Had been ever since his father died.

900
01:35:53,021 --> 01:35:56,774
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman...

901
01:35:56,858 --> 01:36:01,779
...and for years they lived as if
there was no one else in the world.

902
01:36:01,863 --> 01:36:07,035
Then she found a man, and it seemed to
Norman that she threw him over for this man.

903
01:36:07,076 --> 01:36:10,747
That pushed him over the thin line,
and he killed them both.

904
01:36:10,788 --> 01:36:15,919
So, he had to erase the crime,
at least in his mind.

905
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,340
He stole her corpse,
and a weighted coffin was buried.

906
01:36:20,423 --> 01:36:23,593
He hid the body in the fruit cellar
and treated it...

907
01:36:23,635 --> 01:36:28,264
...to keep it
as well as it would keep.

908
01:36:28,306 --> 01:36:33,019
And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.

909
01:36:33,102 --> 01:36:36,981
So, he began to think
and speak for her.

910
01:36:37,065 --> 01:36:39,943
At times, he could be
both personalities...

911
01:36:39,984 --> 01:36:41,945
...carry on conversations.

912
01:36:41,986 --> 01:36:45,615
At other times,
the mother-half took over completely.

913
01:36:45,657 --> 01:36:50,453
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only "Mother. "

914
01:36:50,495 --> 01:36:52,872
When he met your sister...

915
01:36:52,956 --> 01:36:56,876
...he was touched by her
and aroused by her.

916
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:01,547
He wanted her.
This set off his jealous mother.

917
01:37:01,631 --> 01:37:04,968
And "Mother" killed the girl.

918
01:37:05,051 --> 01:37:08,805
Whenever reality came too close...

919
01:37:08,888 --> 01:37:13,643
...when danger or desire
threatened that illusion...

920
01:37:13,726 --> 01:37:17,438
...he'd dress up...
even to a cheap wig he'd bought...

921
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:21,192
...and he'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair...

922
01:37:21,276 --> 01:37:24,070
...speak in her voice.

923
01:37:24,153 --> 01:37:27,574
He tried to be his mother.

924
01:37:29,909 --> 01:37:32,495
And now he is.

925
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:36,499
- And the $400,000? Who got that?
- The swamp.

926
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,919
These were crimes of passion,
not profit.

927
01:37:41,296 --> 01:37:45,550
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

928
01:37:45,633 --> 01:37:47,677
- Sure.
- All right.

929
01:38:03,192 --> 01:38:05,153
Thank you.

930
01:38:13,703 --> 01:38:19,375
It's sad when a mother has to speak
the words that condemn her own son...

931
01:38:19,459 --> 01:38:23,838
...but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.

932
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,840
They'll put him away now...

933
01:38:25,882 --> 01:38:28,843
...as I should have years ago.

934
01:38:28,885 --> 01:38:32,055
He was always bad.

935
01:38:32,138 --> 01:38:37,727
And in the end, he intended to tell them
that I killed those girls and that man.

936
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:41,356
As if I could do anything
except just sit and stare...

937
01:38:41,397 --> 01:38:43,733
...like one of his stuffed birds.

938
01:38:43,816 --> 01:38:49,239
Well, they know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

939
01:38:49,322 --> 01:38:51,824
I'll just sit here
and be quiet...

940
01:38:51,908 --> 01:38:56,079
...just in case they do suspect me.

941
01:38:56,162 --> 01:38:59,958
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

942
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:02,710
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

943
01:39:02,752 --> 01:39:04,796
I'm not even gonna
swat that fly.

944
01:39:04,879 --> 01:39:07,173
- I hope they are watching.
- They're probably watching me.

945
01:39:07,257 --> 01:39:10,176
- They'll see.
- Well, I'll let 'em.

946
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,303
They'll see, and they'll know.

947
01:39:12,387 --> 01:39:17,517
And they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly. "

948
01:39:33,616 --> 01:39:36,578
Yeah, you're gonna
get stuck on somethin'.

949
01:39:36,619 --> 01:39:38,580
Keep pullin'.

950
01:40:36,054 --> 01:40:38,890
- Don't go in there.
- Guys, it's done!

951
01:40:38,973 --> 01:40:41,392
It's all clear here.
Comin' through!

952
01:40:41,476 --> 01:40:43,728
All right, comin' through.
