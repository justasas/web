1
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,200
You never did eat your lunch,
did you?

2
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours...

3
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Why don't you call your boss
and tell him...

5
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,600
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,100
It's Friday anyway,
and hot.

7
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,900
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,600
Well, we could laze
around here a while longer.

9
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,400
Checking-out time is 3:00 PM.

10
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,000
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in...

11
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,400
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,300
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,400
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night...

14
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,100
in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,100
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,900
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

17
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, Sam, this is
the last time.

18
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,600
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

19
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,400
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

20
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,200
You come down here
on business trips,

21
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,600
and we steal lunch hours.

22
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,700
I wish you
wouldn't even come.

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,500
What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,700
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,200
- I can come down next week.
- No.

26
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,200
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch in public?

27
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

28
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
But respectably.

29
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,500
In my house with my mother's
picture on the mantel and...

30
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,300
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

31
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,700
And after the steak, do we
send sister to the movies...

32
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,800
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

33
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Sam!

34
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,200
All right.

35
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

36
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,400
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

37
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,900
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,100
I'm all for it. It requires patience,
temperance, a lot of sweating out.

39
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,500
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

40
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,600
But if I can see you and touch you
even as simply as this, I won't mind it.

41
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

42
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,500
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

43
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,500
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,
and she's living...

44
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
on the other side of the world.

45
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,200
I pay too.

46
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,300
They also pay
who meet in hotel rooms.

47
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,700
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

48
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

49
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,500
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- But when you do, you'll swing.

50
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,600
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

51
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,200
And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

52
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,000
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,600
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

54
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,500
I'll lick the stamps.

55
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,000
You want to cut this off, go out
and find yourself somebody available?

56
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,500
I'm thinking of it.

57
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,000
How could you even
think a thing like that?

58
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,800
- Don't miss your plane.
- We can leave together, can't we?

59
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,800
Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,
you have to put your shoes on.

60
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,100
Isn't Mr. Lowery
back from lunch?

61
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,100
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

62
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,600
The old lease man. That's why
he's late. You got a headache?

63
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,600
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions...

64
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,200
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

65
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,200
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,200
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

67
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,200
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

68
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Any calls?

69
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,800
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying...

71
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,500
and she'll be gone the whole weekend...

72
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,100
Wow. It's as hot
as fresh milk.

73
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,900
Hey, you girls oughta get your boss
to air condition ya up.

74
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
He can afford it today.

75
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,200
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

76
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,200
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my little girl.

77
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,700
Oh... Oh, not you.
My daughter.

78
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,100
A baby.

79
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,000
Tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

80
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,900
I want you to take a look at my baby.

81
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,600
Eighteen years old...

82
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,200
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

83
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

84
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,100
Do you know what I do
about unhappiness?

85
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,700
I buy it off.

86
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,100
Are, uh...
Are you unhappy?

87
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,200
Uh, not inordinately.

88
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,700
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

89
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,500
Forty thousand
dollars cash.

90
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,500
Now that's...
that's not buying happiness.

91
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,900
That's just buying off unhappiness.

92
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,200
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

93
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,700
- Count 'em!
- I declare!

94
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,300
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

95
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Tom, a cash transaction
of this size is most irregular.

96
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,300
Ah, so what?
It's my private money.

97
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,600
- Now it's yours.
- Suppose we put it in the safe,

98
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,100
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

99
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,200
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said was in your desk?

100
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,300
Uh-oh.

101
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,800
You know, uh, sometimes
I can keep my mouth shut.

102
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Lowery, I am dying
of "thirst-aroonie."

103
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

104
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,600
Put it in the safe deposit box in the
bank, and we'll get a check on Monday.

105
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,400
Yes.

106
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,800
He was flirting with you. I guess
he must've noticed my wedding ring.

107
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,100
Come in.

108
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,900
The copies. If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home after the bank.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,300
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

110
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,200
Because me and your boss are goin' out
and get ourselves...

111
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,300
a little drinkin' done, right?

112
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,100
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

113
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,600
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

114
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,100
I'm going to spend this weekend
in bed. Thank you.

115
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,200
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

116
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,800
Can't buy off unhappiness
with pills.

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,700
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

118
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,300
Marion, what in
the world... What are you doing up here?

119
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,100
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

120
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,000
What is it, Marion?

121
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,300
Uh, hold it there.

122
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,800
In quite a hurry.

123
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,300
I didn't intend to sleep so long. I
almost had an accident from sleepiness.

124
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,100
- So, I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

125
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,100
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

126
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,600
There are plenty of motels
in this area. You should've...

127
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,900
I mean, just to be safe.

128
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,900
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over.

129
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,900
Have I broken any laws?

130
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,300
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

131
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,500
Is anything wrong?

132
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,200
Of course not. Am I acting
as if there's something wrong?

133
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,100
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

134
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,000
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

135
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
I've told you there's nothing wrong,
except I'm in a hurry...

136
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,300
and you're taking up my time.

137
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,300
Now, just a moment.

138
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Turn your motor off, please.

139
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,800
May I see your license?

140
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,400
- Why?
- Please.

141
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,600
Be with you
in a second!

142
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,400
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

143
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
There's an old saying: "First customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

144
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,500
But I'm in no mood for it,

145
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,000
so I'm gonna treat you so fair
you won't have one reason...

146
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,600
- Can I trade my car and take another?
- Do anything you have a mind to.

147
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,600
Bein' a woman, you will.
That yours?

148
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,500
Yes, it's, it's... There's
nothing wrong with it. I just...

149
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,500
Sick of the sight of it.

150
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,000
Have a look around and see if there's
something that strikes your eyes,

151
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,400
and I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

152
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,400
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...

153
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,300
and just wanna make a change.

154
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,100
One thing people never oughta be
when they're buyin' used cars...

155
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,500
and that's in a hurry, but like I said,
it's too nice a day to argue.

156
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,600
I'll shoot your car
in the garage here.

157
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,600
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

158
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,300
- How much?
- Go ahead.

159
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

160
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,100
How much would it be
with my car?

161
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,400
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

162
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,700
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasin' ya?

163
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
Of course not.
Please.

164
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,700
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high pressured the salesman.

165
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,300
Ah, I figure roughly...

166
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,400
your car plus $700.

167
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,800
- Seven hundred.
- You always got time to argue money.

168
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
All right.

169
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,000
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

170
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,400
I mean, out-of-state license.
You got your pink slip...

171
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,600
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies room?

172
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,500
In the building.

173
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,200
Over there.

174
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,200
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

175
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,000
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

176
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,000
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this...

177
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,200
I might as well be perfectly honest with
you. It's not that I don't trust you...

178
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,800
But what? Is there
anything so terribly wrong...

179
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

180
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,800
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

181
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,400
All right,
let's go inside.

182
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,600
Hey!

183
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,300
Just put it in here, please.

184
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,700
Thank you.

185
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,100
Heck,
Officer, that was the first time...

186
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,900
I saw the customer
high pressure the salesman.

187
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,900
Somebody chasin' her?

188
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,900
I better have
a look at those papers, Charlie.

189
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,100
- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.

190
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

191
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,700
Yes, Mr. Lowery.

192
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,100
Caroline. Marion still isn't in?

193
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,800
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

194
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,300
Buzz me the minute
she comes in.

195
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,800
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.

196
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,100
I called her sister where she works...
The Music Makers Music Store...

197
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,100
and she doesn't know where Marion
is any more than we do.

198
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,800
You better run out to the house. She may
be, well, unable to answer the phone.

199
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,300
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

200
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,300
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

201
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,400
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

202
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,100
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

203
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,800
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.

204
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,200
I did see her
some time later driving...

205
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,400
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

206
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,500
Caroline,
get Mr. Cassidy for me.

207
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,700
After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!

208
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,100
I'm not taking
the responsibility.

209
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,500
Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works
for you for ten years, you trust her.

210
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,700
All right, yes,
you better come over.

211
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,200
Well, I ain't
about to kiss off $40,000!

212
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
I'll get it back, and if any of it's
missin', I'll replace it...

213
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,400
with her fine, soft flesh!

214
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,400
- We'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

215
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. I, I can't...

216
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,000
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

217
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,200
You still trustin'? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!

218
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,100
Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'.
And, and even flirtin' with me!

219
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.

220
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,700
- Dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

221
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
12 cabins, 12 vacancies.

222
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,500
They, uh... They moved
away the highway.

223
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,300
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

224
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops
here anymore unless they've done that.

225
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,600
But... there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

226
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,800
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

227
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,300
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

228
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,900
Los Angeles.

229
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,800
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want
anything. It's right next to the office.

230
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,700
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

231
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,200
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

232
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,000
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

233
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,400
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

234
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,700
Well, the, uh, mattress
is soft and...

235
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,100
there's hangers in the closet
and stationary...

236
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,100
with "Bates Motel"
printed on it...

237
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,700
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

238
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,900
And the, uh...

239
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,900
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

240
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
Yeah.

241
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,700
Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,
just... just tap on the wall.

242
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,800
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.

243
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,300
Norman Bates.

244
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,200
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

245
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,800
- No.
- Then would you do me a favor?

246
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
Would you have dinner with me?

247
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,000
I was just about to myself. Nothing
special... just sandwiches and milk.

248
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,800
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

249
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,300
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

250
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,100
- I'd like to.
- All right.

251
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,900
You get yourself settled and,
and take off your wet shoes.

252
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,400
- I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
- Okay.

253
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,000
With my... With my trusty umbrella.

254
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,900
No! I tell you no!

255
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,100
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

256
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,000
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion...

257
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,800
- of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
- Mother, please.

258
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,200
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

259
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

260
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,800
"Mother, she's just a stranger." As if
men don't desire strangers. As if...

261
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,500
Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

262
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,900
Do you understand, boy?
Go on.

263
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,000
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite...

264
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,800
with my food or my son!

265
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,800
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

266
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,400
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

267
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,600
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No, uh...

268
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,700
Mother...
My mother, uh...

269
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,400
What is the phrase?

270
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,700
She isn't quite
herself today.

271
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

272
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,300
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

274
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,300
Don't worry about it.

275
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,200
But as long as you've fixed
the supper, we may as well eat it.

276
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,500
It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer
and warmer in the office.

277
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,400
Well, it stopped
raining.

278
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,300
Uh, eating in an office
is just... just too officious.

279
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,400
- I have the parlor back here.
- All right.

280
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,700
- Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

281
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,000
You're very kind.

282
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,800
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

283
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,600
You... You eat like a bird.

284
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,100
And you'd know,
of course.

285
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,100
No, not really.

286
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,600
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"...

287
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,100
is really a fal...
false... falsity.

288
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,000
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

289
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,700
But I really don't know anything about
birds. My hobby is stuffing things.

290
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,900
You know, taxidermy.

291
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,400
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because...

292
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,000
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

293
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,000
You know,
foxes and chimps.

294
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

295
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,600
I think only birds
look well stuffed because...

296
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,400
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

297
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,300
It's a strange hobby.
Curious.

298
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,900
- Uncommon too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

299
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,800
And it's... it's not as expensive
as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

300
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,600
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

301
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,200
The chemicals are the only
thing that, that cost anything.

302
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,300
A man should have a hobby.

303
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,200
Well, it's...
it's more than a hobby.

304
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,500
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

305
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,600
Is your time so empty?

306
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,300
No. Uh...

307
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Well, I run the office...

308
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,900
and tend the cabins
and grounds...

309
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,800
and do little, uh,
errands for my mother...

310
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,700
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

311
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Do you go out with friends?

312
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,700
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

313
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,700
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

314
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,400
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

315
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,100
I didn't mean to pry.

316
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,900
I'm looking for
a private island.

317
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,800
What are you
running away from?

318
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,700
- Why do you ask that?
- No.

319
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,300
People never run away
from anything.

320
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,000
The rain didn't last long,
did it? You know what I think?

321
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,700
I think that...

322
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,700
we're all in
our private traps,

323
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,000
clamped in them, and none of us
can ever get out.

324
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,000
We scratch and...
and claw,

325
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,000
but only at the air,
only at each other.

326
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,900
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

327
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,600
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

328
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,200
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it anymore.

329
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,600
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

330
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

331
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,300
You know, if anyone ever talked
to me the way I heard...

332
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,100
the way she spoke to you...

333
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,200
Sometimes when she talks
to me like that,

334
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,700
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and, and leave her forever.

335
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,300
Or at least defy her.

336
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,000
But I know I can't.
She's ill.

337
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,100
She sounded strong.

338
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,800
No, I mean... ill.

339
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,100
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

340
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,800
I was only five and it,
it must've been quite a strain for her.

341
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,800
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or
anything. He left her a little money.

342
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,500
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

343
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,000
And he... he talked her
into building this motel.

344
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,200
He could have talked her
into anything.

345
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,300
And when he died too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

346
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,700
And the way
he died...

347
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,100
I guess it's nothing
to talk about while you're eating.

348
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,800
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

349
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,300
Except you.

350
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,600
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

351
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,200
Why don't you go away?

352
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,500
To a private island,
like you?

353
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,300
No... not like me.

354
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,600
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

355
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,500
She'd be alone up there.

356
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,700
The fire would go out.

357
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,600
It'd be cold and damp
like a grave.

358
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,000
If you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them.

359
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,200
You understand, I...
I don't hate her.

360
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,400
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.

361
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,600
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her... some place?

362
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,300
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

363
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,500
People always call
a madhouse "some place," don't they?

364
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Put her in "some place."

365
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,200
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

366
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,800
What do you know
about caring?

367
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

368
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,800
The laughing and the tears...

369
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,300
and the cruel eyes
studying you.

370
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,400
My mother there?

371
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,300
But she's harmless.

372
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,900
She's as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds.

373
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,800
I am sorry.

374
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,900
I only felt...
It seems she's hurting you.

375
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,600
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

376
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,300
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest...

377
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
oh, so very delicately...

378
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

379
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,800
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.

380
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,100
It... It's not as if she were
a... a maniac, a raving thing.

381
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,700
She...

382
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
She just goes
a little mad sometimes.

383
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,400
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

384
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,500
Haven't you?

385
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,700
Yes.

386
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Sometimes just one time
can be enough. Thank you.

387
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,200
Thank you, "Norman."

388
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,000
Norman.

389
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,500
Oh, you're not... you're not
going back to your room already?

390
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,300
I'm very tired.

391
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,500
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

392
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,400
Really?

393
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,800
I stepped into a private trap
back there...

394
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:48,300
and I'd like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it...

395
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,500
before it's too late
for me too.

396
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,000
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay a little while longer?

397
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,700
- I mean, just for talk.
- Oh, I'd like to, but...

398
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,300
All right. Well,
I'll see you in the morning.

399
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,300
I'll bring you some breakfast,
all right?

400
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,400
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

401
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,700
All right, Miss, uh...

402
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,800
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

403
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,100
Good night.

404
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,200
Ow! No!

405
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,800
No! Aaah!

406
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,300
Mother!
Oh, God, Mother!

407
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,900
Blood! Blood!

408
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,900
I've tried many brands.

409
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,700
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

410
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,800
Let's see what they say
about this one.

411
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,300
They tell you
what its ingredients are...

412
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,200
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

413
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,100
but they do not tell you
whether it's painless.

414
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,000
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

415
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,000
This one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others.

416
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,900
Sam?

417
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,000
Sam!
Lady wants to see ya.

418
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,400
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

419
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,200
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

420
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,600
- Well, of course not. Something wrong?
- Thank you.

421
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,600
She left home on Friday.

422
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,200
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

423
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,700
Not even
a phone call.

424
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,200
If you two are in this together,
it's none of my business,

425
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,500
but I want Marion to tell me it's none
of my business and then I'll go...

426
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,100
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will ya?

427
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,100
- That's okay. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

428
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,100
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

429
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,300
Sorry about the tears.

430
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,600
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

431
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,700
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

432
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,200
Who are you,
friend?

433
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,600
My name is Arbogast,
friend.

434
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,400
I'm a private
investigator.

435
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,100
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

436
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,200
I know you don't, because if you did
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

437
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,700
What's your interest
in this?

438
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,900
Well, $40,000.

439
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,200
- $40,000?
- That's right.

440
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,400
One of you'd better tell me what's going
on, and fast. I can take so much...

441
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,500
Now, take it easy,
friend.

442
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,300
It's just that your girlfriend
stole $40,000.

443
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,800
What are you talking about?
What is this?

444
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:30,300
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss, and she didn't.

445
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,600
- No one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

446
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,300
Someone always sees a girl
with $40,000.

447
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,700
They don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

448
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,700
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

449
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,500
Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more?

450
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,500
Oh, not even a hunch.
Just hope.

451
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,300
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

452
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,400
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

453
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,500
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

454
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,500
Did you check Phoenix?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

455
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,600
No, she was seen leaving town in her
own car... by her employer, I might add.

456
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,500
I can't believe it.
Can you?

457
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,400
We're always quickest
to doubt people...

458
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,900
who have a reputation
for being honest.

459
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,300
I think she's here,
Miss Crane.

460
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,800
Where there's
a boyfriend...

461
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,700
She's not back there with the nuts and
bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.

462
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,800
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

463
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,600
- Evening.
- Evening.

464
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,500
I almost drove
right past.

465
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,800
I'm always forgetting to turn
the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

466
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,800
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.

467
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,800
- Candy?
- No, thanks.

468
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,800
Last two days I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

469
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,200
but this is the first place that looks
like it's hiding from the world.

470
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,300
To tell the truth, I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

471
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,300
- Just doesn't seem like any use anymore.
- Oh?

472
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,800
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

473
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,800
- Wanna register?
- Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

474
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,800
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No trouble. Today's linen day.

475
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,800
I always change the beds once a week
whether they've been used or not.

476
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,300
Hate the smell of dampness. It's such
a, I don't know... creepy smell.

477
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,800
You out to buy
a motel?

478
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,200
No.

479
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,000
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen
so many the past couple of days,

480
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,800
I thought maybe...

481
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,800
What, uh... What was it
you wanted to ask?

482
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,500
I'm looking for
a missing person.

483
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,500
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

484
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,000
I've been trying
to trace a girl...

485
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,400
that's been missing for,
oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

486
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,400
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

487
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,500
She's not
in any trouble.

488
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,400
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

489
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,600
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

490
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,100
We have reason to believe she came
along this way. Did she stop here?

491
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,200
No one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

492
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,200
Mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

493
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,800
Commit myself?

494
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,200
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

495
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,900
- Mm-mmm. Yeah.
- Sure?

496
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,900
Well, she may have
used an alias.

497
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,900
Marion Crane's
her real name,

498
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,300
but she could've registered
under a different one.

499
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,500
I tell ya, I don't even much bother
with guests registering anymore.

500
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,600
One by one,
you drop the formalities.

501
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,500
I shouldn't even bother changing
the sheets, but old habits die hard.

502
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,400
Which reminds me...

503
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,500
Which reminds me...

504
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,300
- What's that?
- The sign.

505
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,700
A couple last week said
if the thing hadn't been on,

506
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,700
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

507
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,900
You see,
that's exactly my point.

508
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,400
Nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

509
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,300
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

510
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,600
As you say,
old habits die hard.

511
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,400
This girl could've registered
under another name. Mind if I look?

512
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,700
- No.
- Thank you.

513
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,800
All right.

514
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,600
I'll get the date
somewhere. Mm-hmm.

515
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,300
See, there's nobody.

516
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,700
Let's see, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

517
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,100
Oh, yes.

518
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,000
Here we are.

519
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,000
- Marie Samuels.
- Hmm.

520
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,000
That's an interesting
alias.

521
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,500
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

522
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,500
Marie, Marion.

523
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,700
- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
- Mm-hmm.

524
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:08,500
Mm-hmm. Was she
in disguise, by any chance?

525
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,300
- Wanna check the picture again?
- I wasn't lying to you.

526
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,300
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

527
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,300
It's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

528
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,700
I know.

529
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,800
Oh, yeah.

530
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,900
Well, i-i-it was raining
and, um, her hair was all wet.

531
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,000
I tell ya, it's not really
a very good picture of her.

532
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,800
No, I guess not.

533
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,800
Tell me all about her.

534
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Well, um,

535
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,000
she arrived, um, rather late
one night, went straight to sleep...

536
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,800
and, uh, left early
the next morning.

537
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,900
- How early?
- Oh, ex... very early.

538
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,300
Mm-hmm.
Which morning was that?

539
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,300
Uh, the, um...

540
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,600
Th-Th-Th-The next morning.

541
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,000
- Sunday.
- I see. Mm-hmm.

542
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,000
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

543
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,800
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

544
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,700
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

545
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,700
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

546
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,600
- Did you spend the night with her?
- No.

547
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:12,000
Then how would you know
she didn't make any calls?

548
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,300
Uh, w-w...

549
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,700
Well, she was very tired
a-and, uh...

550
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,500
See, I... N-Now I'm staring
to, um... remember.

551
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,000
I-I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

552
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,100
- If you make a mental picturization...
- Right. Take your time.

553
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:30,400
Um, she was...
she was sitting back there...

554
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,400
N-No, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand.

555
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,400
She said she had to
go to sleep early...

556
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,600
because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,
uh, ahead of her.

557
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,500
- Mm-hmm. Back where?
- Back where she came from.

558
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,200
No, you said before she
was standing back there...

559
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,200
Yes, b-back in my parlor.

560
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,200
She was very hungry,
I made her a sandwich...

561
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:56,100
and then she said she was tired and
she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.

562
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,200
I see.
How did she pay you?

563
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,100
- Cash? Check?
- Cash.

564
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,100
Cash, huh?
Mm-hmm.

565
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,500
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Uh-uh. Why should she?

566
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,700
Hmm.

567
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,700
Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,
I guess that's about it.

568
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,400
I-I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

569
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,300
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

570
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,800
See, if it doesn't jell,
it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

571
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,900
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

572
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,300
Well, I-I-I don't know
what you c-could expect me to know.

573
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,400
People just come and go,
you know.

574
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,900
That's right.
She isn't still here, is she?

575
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,800
No.

576
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:43,300
If I wanted to check the cabins, all
twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

577
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,900
If you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

578
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,000
Oh.
No, thanks.

579
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,000
Uh, change your mind?

580
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,600
Oh.

581
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:15,400
You know, I... I think I have one of
those faces you can't help believing.

582
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,300
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

583
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,000
Oh? There's somebody
sitting in the window.

584
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,200
- N-N-No, there isn't.
- Sure. Take a look.

585
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,300
Oh, th-that must be
my mother.

586
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,800
She's an, uh, "inavlid..."
an invalid.

587
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,300
Uh, it's practically
like living alone.

588
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,500
Oh, I see.

589
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,200
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

590
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,800
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

591
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,900
No.

592
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:45,600
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

593
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,900
You'd know
you were being used.

594
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,900
- You wouldn't be made a fool of.
- I'm not a fool.

595
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,600
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

596
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:56,500
- This is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

597
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:00,000
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

598
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,100
Then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

599
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,200
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

600
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,000
Just for a few minutes. There might be
some hint that you missed out on.

601
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,200
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

602
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,300
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- Mr. Arbogast, I-I think I've...

603
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,800
- I think I've talked to you all I want.
- Yes, but just for...

604
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,800
It'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

605
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,900
Well, all right.

606
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,800
You sure would save me a lot of
leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

607
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,100
- Would I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

608
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,100
All right.
Thanks, anyway.

609
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,800
Hello, Loomis.
This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

610
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,300
Let me talk to her,
please.

611
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,800
Hello, Lila.

612
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,600
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

613
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,500
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

614
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,700
It's out
on the old highway.

615
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,100
I even know what cabin she was in...
it was number one.

616
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,500
Well, this young fella that runs
the place said she just spent the night,

617
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,300
left the next day
and that was it.

618
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,800
Mmm.
Um, no, not exactly.

619
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,500
Well, I did question him,
believe me,

620
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,500
but I think I got
all there was to get.

621
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,500
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

622
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,000
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...

623
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,000
See, this boy
had a sick old mother.

624
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,000
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

625
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,300
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

626
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,800
Well, I was, but I think I'll go
back to the motel first.

627
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:29,700
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

628
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,800
All right, fine.
Listen, I...

629
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,800
You'll be happy to know
what I think.

630
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,700
Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

631
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,200
All right. See ya
in about an hour... or less.

632
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,200
All right, bye-bye.

633
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,800
Bates?

634
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,100
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely
sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

635
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,000
Sam, he said
an hour or less.

636
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,400
Yeah.

637
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,400
It's been three.

638
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,600
Are we just
going to sit here and wait?

639
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,800
He'll be back.

640
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,400
Let's sit still
and hang on, okay?

641
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,700
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

642
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,200
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.
- Yes.

643
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,500
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

644
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,500
- That wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.

645
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,500
- I'm going out there.
- Arbogast said...

646
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,600
An hour, or less.

647
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,100
Well, I'm going.

648
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,100
You'll never find it.

649
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,700
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go?

650
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,700
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

651
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,300
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

652
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,000
Yeah. Stay here.

653
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,100
Arbogast?

654
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,100
Arbogast!

655
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,900
Arbogast!

656
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,800
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

657
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,200
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

658
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,500
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door... or unwilling.

659
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,600
Where could he
have gone?

660
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,600
Maybe he got
some definite lead.

661
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,500
- Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?

662
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,500
- In a hurry.
- Sam, he called...

663
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,600
when he had nothing
but a dissatisfied feeling.

664
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:40,500
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

665
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,600
Yes, I think
he would've.

666
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,800
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

667
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,300
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- Let me get my coat.

668
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,500
Good evening.

669
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:02,600
Well, I... I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

670
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,700
Yes.

671
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,600
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

672
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,700
She's been here
searching for her sister.

673
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,700
There's this
private detective helping.

674
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,200
We got a call from this
detective... he'd traced her...

675
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,500
to that motel
on the old highway.

676
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,500
That must be
the Bates Motel.

677
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,500
He called to say he was going
to question Mrs. Bates.

678
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,600
Norman took a wife?

679
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,100
No, I-I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

680
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,100
That was early this evening. We
haven't seen or heard from him since.

681
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,700
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

682
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,900
She left Phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace.

683
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,600
How'd you and this detective come
to trace her to Fairvale?

684
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,800
They thought
she'd be coming to me.

685
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,300
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

686
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,400
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

687
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,400
That's right.

688
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,400
From what?

689
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,100
She stole some money.

690
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,100
A lot?

691
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,200
Forty thousand dollars.

692
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,300
The police haven't
been able to...

693
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,900
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

694
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,900
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

695
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,000
That explains
the private detective.

696
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,000
He traced her
to the Bates place.

697
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,000
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

698
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,400
He said Marion was there
for one night, then she left.

699
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,400
- With the $40,000?
- He didn't say anything...

700
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,900
about the money.

701
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,400
It isn't important
what he said, is it?

702
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,200
He was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

703
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,200
That's what I want you
to do something about.

704
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,800
Like what?

705
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,300
I'm sorry if
I seem overanxious.

706
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:40,100
I'm sure there's something wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

707
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,800
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, Miss, but not the same thing.

708
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,900
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

709
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:51,000
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin',

710
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,200
probably
from Norman Bates,

711
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:56,500
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

712
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:00,900
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

713
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,000
Call Norman and let him
say what happened.

714
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,100
At this hour?

715
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,700
He was out when I was there a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.

716
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,700
He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin'
the door in the dead of night,

717
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,700
like some people do.

718
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,700
This fellow lives
like a hermit.

719
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,500
You must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago.

720
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,500
Please. Call.

721
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,100
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

722
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,400
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

723
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,400
Ye... I been
just fine, thanks.

724
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,100
Listen, we got
worries here.

725
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:50,600
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

726
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,300
Well, this one
wouldn't be a customer.

727
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,400
- A private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

728
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,400
Arbogast.

729
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,800
And after he left?

730
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,700
No, that's...
that's okay, Norman.

731
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,300
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

732
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,300
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

733
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,700
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

734
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,700
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back...

735
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,200
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

736
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,300
Yes.

737
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,100
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

738
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:36,300
in Greenlawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

739
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,100
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

740
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,100
'Tain't only
local history, Sam.

741
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,000
It's the only case of murder
and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

742
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,900
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was... involved with...

743
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,400
when she found out
he was married,

744
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,700
then took a helpin' of
the same stuff herself.

745
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,400
Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.

746
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,200
Norman found them
dead together.

747
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,200
In bed.

748
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,700
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Bates' mother?

749
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:12,300
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

750
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,800
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

751
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,100
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

752
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,700
You saw
Norman Bates' mother?

753
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:23,400
But it had to be...
because Arbogast said so too!

754
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,100
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

755
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,100
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs. Bates,

756
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,800
who's that woman buried
out in Greenlawn Cemetery?

757
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,600
Now, Mother, um...
I-I'm gonna bring something up...

758
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,300
I am sorry, boy,

759
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,900
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

760
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,100
Please, Mother.

761
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:33,200
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

762
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,500
Ha! You think
I'm fruity, huh?

763
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,600
I'm staying right here.

764
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,600
This is my room and
no one will drag me out of it,

765
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,200
least of all
my big, bold son.

766
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,200
They'll come now, Mother.

767
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,900
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

768
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:54,200
Mother, please, it's just for
a few days so they won't find you.

769
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,500
Just for a few days?

770
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,300
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

771
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,800
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

772
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,900
Now get out!

773
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,600
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

774
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:13,800
Norman, what do you
think you're doing?

775
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,500
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

776
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,800
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

777
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,100
Wonderful sermon today.

778
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,600
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

779
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,000
We thought we'd drive out
to that motel with you.

780
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,400
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

781
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,000
- Did you two have breakfast?
- Didn't find anything?

782
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,700
Nothing. Let's
clear the way here.

783
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,200
What did he say
about my sister?

784
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,500
Just what he told your detective:
She used a fake name.

785
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,700
Saw the register myself. Saw the
whole place. That boy's alone there.

786
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,800
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

787
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,300
I know you're not
the seein'-illusions type,

788
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,300
but no woman was there and I don't
believe in ghosts, so there it is.

789
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,300
I still feel
there's something...

790
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,900
Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't
make you feel better.

791
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,400
Come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft.

792
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,400
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

793
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,000
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein' picked up.

794
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,100
How 'bout that?

795
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,200
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

796
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:31,400
Come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.

797
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,600
You too, Sam.

798
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,500
Thank you.

799
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:41,400
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

800
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,800
- You want me to drop you at the hotel...
- Sam.

801
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:49,400
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

802
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:52,700
Neither will I.
Come on.

803
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,900
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

804
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,200
We're going to register
as man and wife.

805
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,400
We're going to
get shown to a cabin,

806
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,200
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

807
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,400
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

808
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,500
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

809
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,700
Come on.

810
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,400
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

811
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,400
Uh-huh.
Suppose you want a room.

812
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,800
We were gonna try to make it
to San Francisco,

813
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,300
but we don't like the look
of that sky.

814
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,300
Looks like a bad day coming,
doesn't it?

815
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,800
- I'll take you to cabin ten.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

816
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,800
That's not necessary.

817
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,400
My boss is paying for this trip
and, uh, well, it's 90% business.

818
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:09,300
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

819
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,300
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

820
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:32,200
Thank you.

821
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,400
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

822
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:43,100
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

823
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,100
You check in any other place
in this country without bags...

824
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:49,100
- and you have to pay in advance.
- Ten dollars.

825
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,000
That receipt.

826
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,500
I'll go on ahead.

827
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:13,100
All right, there's
your receipt. I'll show you the cabin.

828
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,000
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

829
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,900
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

830
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,900
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

831
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,900
I know.

832
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,900
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

833
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,900
I don't know, but if you had...

834
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:49,400
a useless business like this motel,
what would you need to get out?

835
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,800
To get a new business somewhere else?
Forty thousand dollars?

836
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,800
How could we prove that...

837
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,600
If he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

838
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,000
There must be some proof
that exists now,

839
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,300
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

840
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:11,200
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

841
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,400
Or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel...

842
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,000
the same way about you.

843
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:17,700
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

844
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,300
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us,

845
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,900
unless he was stopped.

846
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:25,600
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

847
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,700
We'll start with cabin one.

848
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,700
If he sees us,
we're just taking the air.

849
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,600
Bates.

850
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,200
No shower curtain.

851
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,700
- Sam! Look!
- Huh? What is it?

852
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,100
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

853
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,900
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

854
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,600
That proves Marion was here.
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

855
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,600
Bates never denied she was here.

856
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,800
Oh. Doesn't that prove
he found out about the money?

857
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:19,500
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

858
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,900
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

859
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:26,300
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

860
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,600
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

861
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,700
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

862
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,900
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

863
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,200
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

864
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,300
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

865
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,300
I can handle a sick old woman.

866
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,300
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

867
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,300
Wait a minute.

868
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,600
If you get anything
out of the mother,

869
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,000
can you find your way
back to town?

870
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,300
Yes, of course.

871
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,700
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

872
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,100
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

873
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,400
Wife's taking a nap and...

874
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,400
I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I thought I'd look you up and talk.

875
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,800
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

876
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,900
I've been doing all the talking
so far, haven't I?

877
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,400
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time...

878
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,800
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

879
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,100
Here you are
doing all the listening.

880
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,600
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

881
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,300
Drive me crazy.

882
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:06,200
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

883
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:11,400
Just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do anything to get away.

884
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:13,600
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

885
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:20,800
Mrs. Bates?

886
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,200
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be contented here,

887
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,200
I'm just doubting that you are.

888
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,800
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you'd unload this place.

889
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,800
This place? This place happens
to be my only world.

890
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,900
I grew up in that house.
I had a very happy childhood.

891
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,500
My mother and I
were more than happy.

892
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,700
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

893
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,800
I don't know
what you've been saying.

894
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,900
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

895
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,300
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

896
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:10,100
Buy a new one in a new town where you
won't have to hide your mother.

897
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:13,100
Why don't you just get in
your car and drive away?

898
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:17,000
Where will you get the money to do that?
Or do you already have it socked away?

899
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,400
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.

900
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:27,200
I bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it.

901
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:31,000
I think
she'll tell us.

902
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,700
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

903
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,900
Mrs. Bates, it's...

904
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:05,400
Norman Bates!

905
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,300
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

906
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,200
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

907
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,300
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

908
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,200
Did he talk
to you?

909
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,200
No.

910
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:54,200
I got the whole story, but not from
Norman. I got it from his "mother."

911
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,100
Norman Bates
no longer exists.

912
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:02,000
He only half-existed
to begin with.

913
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:06,100
And now the other half
has taken over,

914
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:08,800
probably for all time.

915
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,500
Did he kill my sister?

916
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:16,000
Yes... and no.

917
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:18,900
Now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork...

918
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,600
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop...

919
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:24,700
A psychiatrist
doesn't lay the groundwork.

920
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:27,200
He merely tries
to explain it.

921
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:30,300
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

922
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:37,200
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

923
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:41,100
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

924
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:48,100
Uh, have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

925
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:51,300
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

926
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:54,400
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said,

927
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,400
the "mother."

928
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:02,200
To understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the "mother"...

929
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,900
that is from the "mother" half
of Norman's mind...

930
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,900
you have to go back
ten years...

931
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:11,500
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

932
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:16,600
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been since his father died.

933
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,900
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman,

934
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:26,900
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

935
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,000
Then she met a man,

936
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:35,400
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

937
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:39,000
That pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

938
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,200
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

939
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:48,900
most unbearable
to the son who commits it.

940
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:54,300
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

941
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:59,300
He stole her corpse.

942
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:04,200
A weighted coffin
was buried.

943
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,200
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar,

944
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,300
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

945
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:13,200
And that still
wasn't enough.

946
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:17,000
She was there...
but she was a corpse.

947
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,300
So he began to think
and speak for her,

948
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:25,400
give her half his life,
so to speak.

949
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:30,100
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

950
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:34,500
At other times, the "mother" half
took over completely.

951
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:39,100
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only "Mother,"

952
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:44,500
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her,

953
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:47,200
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him.

954
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:52,600
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

955
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,400
the "mother" side of him
would go wild.

956
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,700
When he met your sister,

957
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:04,400
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

958
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:07,300
He wanted her.

959
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:11,200
That set off the jealous "mother"
and "Mother" killed the girl.

960
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:18,100
After the murder Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep...

961
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,900
and, like a dutiful son, covered up
all traces of the crime...

962
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,500
he was convinced
his "mother" had committed!

963
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,000
Why was he...
dressed like that?

964
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,900
He's a transvestite.

965
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:32,700
Uh, not exactly.

966
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,300
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change,

967
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,600
or satisfaction,
is a transvestite.

968
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:42,900
But in Norman's case, he was simply
doing everything possible...

969
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,200
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

970
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,700
And when reality
came to close,

971
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,300
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

972
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:59,800
he dressed up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

973
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,800
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

974
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,200
He tried to be
his mother.

975
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:10,800
And, uh, now he is.

976
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:15,800
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the "mother."

977
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:19,900
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities...

978
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:23,400
there's always
a conflict, a battle.

979
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:27,200
In Norman's case,
the battle is over...

980
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:29,400
and the dominant personality
has won.

981
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:33,600
And the $40,000?
Who got that?

982
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:37,500
The swamp. These were
crimes of passion, not profit.

983
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,900
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

984
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,300
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

985
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:00,300
Thank you.

986
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,900
It's sad when
a mother has to speak the words...

987
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:12,200
that condemn her own son,

988
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,000
but I couldn't allow them
to believe that I would commit murder.

989
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:20,400
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

990
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:23,500
He was always bad,
and in the end...

991
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:27,900
he intended to tell them I killed
those girls and that man,

992
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:31,700
as if I could do anything
except sit and stare,

993
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,900
like one
of his stuffed birds.

994
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,400
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

995
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:44,100
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

996
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:50,900
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

997
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:54,800
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

998
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,200
I'm not even
gonna swat that fly.

999
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:00,700
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

1000
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,800
They'll see
and they'll know,

1001
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:08,400
and they'll say, "Why, she
wouldn't even harm a fly."
