1
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:55,155
You never did eat your lunch,
did you?

2
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:58,388
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours...

3
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,395
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:02,328
Why don't you call your boss
and tell him...

5
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,628
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:07,135
It's Friday anyway,
and hot.

7
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:12,004
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,600
Well, we could laze
around here a while longer.

9
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:18,511
Checking-out time is 3:00 PM.

10
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:22,017
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in...

11
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,485
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:27,318
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,324
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night...

14
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,121
in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:35,153
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,859
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

17
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,994
Oh, Sam, this is
the last time.

18
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,631
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

19
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:48,370
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

20
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:51,242
You come down here
on business trips,

21
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,646
and we steal lunch hours.

22
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:56,776
I wish you
wouldn't even come.

23
00:03:56,853 --> 00:04:00,482
What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,751
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:08,191
- I can come down next week.
- No.

26
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:13,361
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch in public?

27
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

28
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,642
But respectably.

29
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,542
In my house with my mother's
picture on the mantel and...

30
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:26,343
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

31
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,714
And after the steak, do we
send sister to the movies...

32
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,719
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

33
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,846
Sam!

34
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,185
All right.

35
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:45,859
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

36
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:50,463
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

37
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,873
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

38
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:59,245
I'm all for it. It requires patience,
temperance, a lot of sweating out.

39
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:03,581
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

40
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:08,716
But if I can see you and touch you
even as simply as this, I won't mind it.

41
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,518
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

42
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:16,497
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

43
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,501
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,
and she's living...

44
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,230
on the other side of the world.

45
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,136
I pay too.

46
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,302
They also pay
who meet in hotel rooms.

47
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:33,710
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

48
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,876
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

49
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:40,582
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- But when you do, you'll swing.

50
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:43,591
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

51
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,333
And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

52
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,962
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,667
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

54
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:01,505
I'll lick the stamps.

55
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:14,053
You want to cut this off, go out
and find yourself somebody available?

56
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,523
I'm thinking of it.

57
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,065
How could you even
think a thing like that?

58
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,896
- Don't miss your plane.
- We can leave together, can't we?

59
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,836
Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,
you have to put your shoes on.

60
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,143
Isn't Mr. Lowery
back from lunch?

61
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:48,122
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

62
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:51,649
The old lease man. That's why
he's late. You got a headache?

63
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:54,662
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions...

64
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,221
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

65
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,235
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

66
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:03,170
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

67
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:06,265
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

68
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,435
Any calls?

69
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,845
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

70
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:16,180
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying...

71
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,550
and she'll be gone the whole weekend...

72
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:26,258
Wow. It's as hot
as fresh milk.

73
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:31,028
Hey, you girls oughta get your boss
to air condition ya up.

74
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,193
He can afford it today.

75
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,295
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

76
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,308
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my little girl.

77
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,743
Oh... Oh, not you.
My daughter.

78
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,145
A baby.

79
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:51,118
Tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

80
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:56,090
I want you to take a look at my baby.

81
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,561
Eighteen years old...

82
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:04,293
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

83
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,495
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

84
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,095
Do you know what I do
about unhappiness?

85
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:12,733
I buy it off.

86
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,174
Are, uh...
Are you unhappy?

87
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,236
Uh, not inordinately.

88
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,819
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

89
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,515
Forty thousand
dollars cash.

90
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,492
Now that's...
that's not buying happiness.

91
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,997
That's just buying off unhappiness.

92
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,291
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

93
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:42,701
- Count 'em!
- I declare!

94
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,333
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

95
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:50,607
Tom, a cash transaction
of this size is most irregular.

96
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,342
Ah, so what?
It's my private money.

97
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,681
- Now it's yours.
- Suppose we put it in the safe,

98
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:00,153
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

99
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:05,286
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said was in your desk?

100
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:09,320
Uh-oh.

101
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:13,994
You know, uh, sometimes
I can keep my mouth shut.

102
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:22,470
Lowery, I am dying
of "thirst-aroonie."

103
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,779
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

104
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,753
Put it in the safe deposit box in the
bank, and we'll get a check on Monday.

105
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,382
Yes.

106
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:43,858
He was flirting with you. I guess
he must've noticed my wedding ring.

107
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:59,137
Come in.

108
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:04,885
The copies. If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home after the bank.

109
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:07,320
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

110
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,291
Because me and your boss are goin' out
and get ourselves...

111
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,293
a little drinkin' done, right?

112
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,159
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

113
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:19,793
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

114
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,167
I'm going to spend this weekend
in bed. Thank you.

115
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,368
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

116
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:32,846
Can't buy off unhappiness
with pills.

117
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:37,784
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

118
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:43,308
Marion, what in
the world... What are you doing up here?

119
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:46,143
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

120
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:50,151
What is it, Marion?

121
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:29,317
Uh, hold it there.

122
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,890
In quite a hurry.

123
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,454
I didn't intend to sleep so long. I
almost had an accident from sleepiness.

124
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:46,194
- So, I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

125
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:50,170
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

126
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:53,675
There are plenty of motels
in this area. You should've...

127
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,937
I mean, just to be safe.

128
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,946
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over.

129
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:01,005
Have I broken any laws?

130
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,313
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

131
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:07,517
Is anything wrong?

132
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,253
Of course not. Am I acting
as if there's something wrong?

133
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:16,321
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

134
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,094
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

135
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,335
I've told you there's nothing wrong,
except I'm in a hurry...

136
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:26,340
and you're taking up my time.

137
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,273
Now, just a moment.

138
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,905
Turn your motor off, please.

139
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:34,882
May I see your license?

140
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,521
- Why?
- Please.

141
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:48,676
Be with you
in a second!

142
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:54,378
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

143
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,509
There's an old saying: "First customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

144
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:59,520
But I'm in no mood for it,

145
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:02,056
so I'm gonna treat you so fair
you won't have one reason...

146
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:05,719
- Can I trade my car and take another?
- Do anything you have a mind to.

147
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:08,729
Bein' a woman, you will.
That yours?

148
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:11,493
Yes, it's, it's... There's
nothing wrong with it. I just...

149
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,501
Sick of the sight of it.

150
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,130
Have a look around and see if there's
something that strikes your eyes,

151
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,470
and I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

152
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,475
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...

153
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,306
and just wanna make a change.

154
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,141
One thing people never oughta be
when they're buyin' used cars...

155
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:27,580
and that's in a hurry, but like I said,
it's too nice a day to argue.

156
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:31,779
I'll shoot your car
in the garage here.

157
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,675
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

158
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,370
- How much?
- Go ahead.

159
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,140
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

160
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,147
How much would it be
with my car?

161
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:03,412
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

162
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:07,854
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasin' ya?

163
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:09,857
Of course not.
Please.

164
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:15,830
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high pressured the salesman.

165
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:20,392
Ah, I figure roughly...

166
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,461
your car plus $700.

167
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:27,975
- Seven hundred.
- You always got time to argue money.

168
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:30,102
All right.

169
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:37,151
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

170
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:40,416
I mean, out-of-state license.
You got your pink slip...

171
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,720
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies room?

172
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:46,625
In the building.

173
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,235
Over there.

174
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:58,225
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

175
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,030
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

176
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:04,038
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this...

177
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:08,406
I might as well be perfectly honest with
you. It's not that I don't trust you...

178
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:11,913
But what? Is there
anything so terribly wrong...

179
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,505
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

180
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,916
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

181
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:21,513
All right,
let's go inside.

182
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,693
Hey!

183
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:09,360
Just put it in here, please.

184
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,701
Thank you.

185
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:24,151
Heck,
Officer, that was the first time...

186
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,983
I saw the customer
high pressure the salesman.

187
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:28,989
Somebody chasin' her?

188
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:31,992
I better have
a look at those papers, Charlie.

189
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,258
- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.

190
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:40,529
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

191
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,774
Yes, Mr. Lowery.

192
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,178
Caroline. Marion still isn't in?

193
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,911
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

194
00:23:56,985 --> 00:24:00,443
Buzz me the minute
she comes in.

195
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,855
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.

196
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:08,294
I called her sister where she works...
The Music Makers Music Store...

197
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,161
and she doesn't know where Marion
is any more than we do.

198
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:14,964
You better run out to the house. She may
be, well, unable to answer the phone.

199
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,369
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

200
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:24,439
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

201
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:27,505
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

202
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:31,177
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

203
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,949
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.

204
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:37,355
I did see her
some time later driving...

205
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:41,486
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

206
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,532
Caroline,
get Mr. Cassidy for me.

207
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,766
After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!

208
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,205
I'm not taking
the responsibility.

209
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:57,735
Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works
for you for ten years, you trust her.

210
00:24:57,812 --> 00:24:59,746
All right, yes,
you better come over.

211
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:05,343
Well, I ain't
about to kiss off $40,000!

212
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,479
I'll get it back, and if any of it's
missin', I'll replace it...

213
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:09,490
with her fine, soft flesh!

214
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:12,527
- We'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

215
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:17,827
I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. I, I can't...

216
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,164
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

217
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:25,366
You still trustin'? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!

218
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,207
Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'.
And, and even flirtin' with me!

219
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,389
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.

220
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:07,827
- Dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

221
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:12,168
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
12 cabins, 12 vacancies.

222
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,573
They, uh... They moved
away the highway.

223
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:19,477
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

224
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:24,746
I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops
here anymore unless they've done that.

225
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:28,721
But... there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

226
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,022
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

227
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:40,390
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

228
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,039
Los Angeles.

229
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:56,948
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want
anything. It's right next to the office.

230
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:59,851
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

231
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:03,322
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

232
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:08,124
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

233
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:29,480
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

234
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,825
Well, the, uh, mattress
is soft and...

235
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:40,122
there's hangers in the closet
and stationary...

236
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,129
with "Bates Motel"
printed on it...

237
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,928
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

238
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,991
And the, uh...

239
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:52,067
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

240
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,472
Yeah.

241
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,876
Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,
just... just tap on the wall.

242
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:00,881
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.

243
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:03,440
Norman Bates.

244
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,345
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

245
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:11,858
- No.
- Then would you do me a favor?

246
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:13,621
Would you have dinner with me?

247
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:18,223
I was just about to myself. Nothing
special... just sandwiches and milk.

248
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:21,996
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

249
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,471
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

250
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,176
- I'd like to.
- All right.

251
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,974
You get yourself settled and,
and take off your wet shoes.

252
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:35,538
- I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
- Okay.

253
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:39,212
With my... With my trusty umbrella.

254
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:02,093
No! I tell you no!

255
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,230
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

256
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:09,174
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion...

257
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:12,872
- of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
- Mother, please.

258
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:16,314
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

259
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,512
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

260
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:25,048
"Mother, she's just a stranger." As if
men don't desire strangers. As if...

261
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:29,722
Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

262
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:32,027
Do you understand, boy?
Go on.

263
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,126
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite...

264
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,899
with my food or my son!

265
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:40,941
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

266
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,537
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

267
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:30,847
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No, uh...

268
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,826
Mother...
My mother, uh...

269
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:36,591
What is the phrase?

270
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:39,895
She isn't quite
herself today.

271
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:45,200
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

272
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,969
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:53,408
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

274
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:55,415
Don't worry about it.

275
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:59,419
But as long as you've fixed
the supper, we may as well eat it.

276
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:13,763
It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer
and warmer in the office.

277
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:29,479
Well, it stopped
raining.

278
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,509
Uh, eating in an office
is just... just too officious.

279
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:36,523
- I have the parlor back here.
- All right.

280
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:54,899
- Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

281
00:34:57,812 --> 00:35:01,145
You're very kind.

282
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:04,981
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

283
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:12,656
You... You eat like a bird.

284
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:17,231
And you'd know,
of course.

285
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:19,232
No, not really.

286
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,758
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"...

287
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:27,331
is really a fal...
false... falsity.

288
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:31,105
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

289
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:37,949
But I really don't know anything about
birds. My hobby is stuffing things.

290
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,953
You know, taxidermy.

291
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:44,583
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because...

292
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,059
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

293
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:49,119
You know,
foxes and chimps.

294
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:53,327
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

295
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,802
I think only birds
look well stuffed because...

296
00:35:56,871 --> 00:36:00,568
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

297
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:03,508
It's a strange hobby.
Curious.

298
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,139
- Uncommon too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

299
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:10,981
And it's... it's not as expensive
as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

300
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,782
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

301
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:16,323
The chemicals are the only
thing that, that cost anything.

302
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,382
A man should have a hobby.

303
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,362
Well, it's...
it's more than a hobby.

304
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:28,696
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

305
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,704
Is your time so empty?

306
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,434
No. Uh...

307
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:36,635
Well, I run the office...

308
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:39,043
and tend the cabins
and grounds...

309
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,980
and do little, uh,
errands for my mother...

310
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:44,847
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

311
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:48,047
Do you go out with friends?

312
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:52,892
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

313
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:59,857
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

314
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:06,700
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

315
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:09,242
I didn't mean to pry.

316
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,040
I'm looking for
a private island.

317
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:17,014
What are you
running away from?

318
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,879
- Why do you ask that?
- No.

319
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:25,391
People never run away
from anything.

320
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:32,154
The rain didn't last long,
did it? You know what I think?

321
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,827
I think that...

322
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,832
we're all in
our private traps,

323
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:44,175
clamped in them, and none of us
can ever get out.

324
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,175
We scratch and...
and claw,

325
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:52,185
but only at the air,
only at each other.

326
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:57,122
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

327
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,682
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

328
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:05,331
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it anymore.

329
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:08,766
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

330
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,304
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

331
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:18,540
You know, if anyone ever talked
to me the way I heard...

332
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:22,275
the way she spoke to you...

333
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,377
Sometimes when she talks
to me like that,

334
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:30,857
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and, and leave her forever.

335
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:33,359
Or at least defy her.

336
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:42,160
But I know I can't.
She's ill.

337
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:46,297
She sounded strong.

338
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,934
No, I mean... ill.

339
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:54,277
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

340
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:58,045
I was only five and it,
it must've been quite a strain for her.

341
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:01,987
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or
anything. He left her a little money.

342
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:06,720
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

343
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:10,195
And he... he talked her
into building this motel.

344
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,290
He could have talked her
into anything.

345
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:17,463
And when he died too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

346
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:20,864
And the way
he died...

347
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:27,311
I guess it's nothing
to talk about while you're eating.

348
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:32,011
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

349
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:34,452
Except you.

350
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:37,787
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

351
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,328
Why don't you go away?

352
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:44,626
To a private island,
like you?

353
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:51,531
No... not like me.

354
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:55,769
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

355
00:39:55,843 --> 00:39:58,676
She'd be alone up there.

356
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:02,914
The fire would go out.

357
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,817
It'd be cold and damp
like a grave.

358
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:11,256
If you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them.

359
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,426
You understand, I...
I don't hate her.

360
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:21,594
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.

361
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:28,831
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her... some place?

362
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:36,414
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

363
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:43,746
People always call
a madhouse "some place," don't they?

364
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:45,758
Put her in "some place."

365
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,429
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

366
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:52,932
What do you know
about caring?

367
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,197
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

368
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:00,001
The laughing and the tears...

369
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:02,440
and the cruel eyes
studying you.

370
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,478
My mother there?

371
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:09,540
But she's harmless.

372
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:14,053
She's as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds.

373
00:41:15,923 --> 00:41:17,914
I am sorry.

374
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:22,156
I only felt...
It seems she's hurting you.

375
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,827
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

376
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,531
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest...

377
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:33,664
oh, so very delicately...

378
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:44,479
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

379
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:48,989
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.

380
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:58,293
It... It's not as if she were
a... a maniac, a raving thing.

381
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:00,925
She...

382
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:04,095
She just goes
a little mad sometimes.

383
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,505
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

384
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:13,607
Haven't you?

385
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:17,776
Yes.

386
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:23,118
Sometimes just one time
can be enough. Thank you.

387
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:26,293
Thank you, "Norman."

388
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,158
Norman.

389
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,666
Oh, you're not... you're not
going back to your room already?

390
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:35,497
I'm very tired.

391
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:38,629
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

392
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:40,503
Really?

393
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:43,941
I stepped into a private trap
back there...

394
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:48,539
and I'd like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it...

395
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,651
before it's too late
for me too.

396
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,156
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay a little while longer?

397
00:42:56,223 --> 00:42:59,886
- I mean, just for talk.
- Oh, I'd like to, but...

398
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,394
All right. Well,
I'll see you in the morning.

399
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:04,397
I'll bring you some breakfast,
all right?

400
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:07,525
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

401
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:09,831
All right, Miss, uh...

402
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:11,894
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

403
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:14,167
Good night.

404
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:24,488
Ow! No!

405
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:26,924
No! Aaah!

406
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:31,481
Mother!
Oh, God, Mother!

407
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:35,112
Blood! Blood!

408
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,114
I've tried many brands.

409
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,948
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

410
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,955
Let's see what they say
about this one.

411
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,457
They tell you
what its ingredients are...

412
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:16,461
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

413
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,396
but they do not tell you
whether it's painless.

414
01:00:19,465 --> 01:00:23,299
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

415
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:27,305
This one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others.

416
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:41,083
Sam?

417
01:00:41,154 --> 01:00:44,180
Sam!
Lady wants to see ya.

418
01:00:50,129 --> 01:00:52,654
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

419
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,462
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

420
01:00:57,203 --> 01:00:59,865
- Well, of course not. Something wrong?
- Thank you.

421
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,836
She left home on Friday.

422
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:09,404
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

423
01:01:09,482 --> 01:01:11,973
Not even
a phone call.

424
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:15,487
If you two are in this together,
it's none of my business,

425
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:18,718
but I want Marion to tell me it's none
of my business and then I'll go...

426
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:22,318
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will ya?

427
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:25,421
- That's okay. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

428
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:34,365
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

429
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,567
Sorry about the tears.

430
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:39,907
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

431
01:01:39,979 --> 01:01:42,914
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

432
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:48,453
Who are you,
friend?

433
01:01:48,521 --> 01:01:50,785
My name is Arbogast,
friend.

434
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:53,690
I'm a private
investigator.

435
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,389
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

436
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:01,490
I know you don't, because if you did
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

437
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:04,001
What's your interest
in this?

438
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:07,198
Well, $40,000.

439
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:10,475
- $40,000?
- That's right.

440
01:02:13,846 --> 01:02:17,714
One of you'd better tell me what's going
on, and fast. I can take so much...

441
01:02:17,784 --> 01:02:19,718
Now, take it easy,
friend.

442
01:02:19,786 --> 01:02:23,552
It's just that your girlfriend
stole $40,000.

443
01:02:23,623 --> 01:02:26,057
What are you talking about?
What is this?

444
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:30,619
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss, and she didn't.

445
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:33,893
- No one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

446
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:36,491
Someone always sees a girl
with $40,000.

447
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:39,936
They don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

448
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,941
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

449
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,809
Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more?

450
01:02:46,879 --> 01:02:49,780
Oh, not even a hunch.
Just hope.

451
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,580
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

452
01:02:53,653 --> 01:02:56,588
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

453
01:02:56,656 --> 01:02:59,784
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

454
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,828
Did you check Phoenix?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

455
01:03:02,895 --> 01:03:08,026
No, she was seen leaving town in her
own car... by her employer, I might add.

456
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,660
I can't believe it.
Can you?

457
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,639
We're always quickest
to doubt people...

458
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,198
who have a reputation
for being honest.

459
01:03:17,276 --> 01:03:19,540
I think she's here,
Miss Crane.

460
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:22,046
Where there's
a boyfriend...

461
01:03:22,114 --> 01:03:27,051
She's not back there with the nuts and
bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.

462
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,054
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

463
01:04:06,826 --> 01:04:08,760
- Evening.
- Evening.

464
01:04:08,828 --> 01:04:10,762
I almost drove
right past.

465
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:14,095
I'm always forgetting to turn
the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

466
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:17,033
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.

467
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,037
- Candy?
- No, thanks.

468
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:23,041
Last two days I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

469
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,545
but this is the first place that looks
like it's hiding from the world.

470
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:29,547
To tell the truth, I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

471
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,550
- Just doesn't seem like any use anymore.
- Oh?

472
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:36,054
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

473
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,057
- Wanna register?
- Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

474
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,060
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No trouble. Today's linen day.

475
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:45,063
I always change the beds once a week
whether they've been used or not.

476
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:49,693
Hate the smell of dampness. It's such
a, I don't know... creepy smell.

477
01:04:51,003 --> 01:04:52,994
You out to buy
a motel?

478
01:04:54,507 --> 01:04:56,441
No.

479
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:59,205
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen
so many the past couple of days,

480
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:01,075
I thought maybe...

481
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:04,082
What, uh... What was it
you wanted to ask?

482
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,710
I'm looking for
a missing person.

483
01:05:06,786 --> 01:05:09,755
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

484
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,256
I've been trying
to trace a girl...

485
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,761
that's been missing for,
oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

486
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,695
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

487
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:20,698
She's not
in any trouble.

488
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:23,701
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

489
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:25,828
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

490
01:05:25,905 --> 01:05:30,433
We have reason to believe she came
along this way. Did she stop here?

491
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:33,444
No one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

492
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,446
Mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

493
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,004
Commit myself?

494
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:40,416
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

495
01:05:41,988 --> 01:05:44,081
- Mm-mmm. Yeah.
- Sure?

496
01:05:45,157 --> 01:05:47,091
Well, she may have
used an alias.

497
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:49,093
Marion Crane's
her real name,

498
01:05:49,161 --> 01:05:52,597
but she could've registered
under a different one.

499
01:05:52,665 --> 01:05:56,795
I tell ya, I don't even much bother
with guests registering anymore.

500
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,804
One by one,
you drop the formalities.

501
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:03,831
I shouldn't even bother changing
the sheets, but old habits die hard.

502
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,678
Which reminds me...

503
01:06:05,713 --> 01:06:06,736
Which reminds me...

504
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:09,547
- What's that?
- The sign.

505
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:12,948
A couple last week said
if the thing hadn't been on,

506
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:15,954
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

507
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:18,183
You see,
that's exactly my point.

508
01:06:18,257 --> 01:06:20,691
Nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

509
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,696
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

510
01:06:24,764 --> 01:06:26,823
As you say,
old habits die hard.

511
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:30,733
This girl could've registered
under another name. Mind if I look?

512
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:33,033
- No.
- Thank you.

513
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,072
All right.

514
01:06:37,143 --> 01:06:40,909
I'll get the date
somewhere. Mm-hmm.

515
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,471
See, there's nobody.

516
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:46,985
Let's see, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

517
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,254
Oh, yes.

518
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:52,256
Here we are.

519
01:06:52,324 --> 01:06:54,258
- Marie Samuels.
- Hmm.

520
01:06:54,326 --> 01:06:56,260
That's an interesting
alias.

521
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:58,762
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

522
01:06:58,831 --> 01:07:00,765
Marie, Marion.

523
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:03,996
- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
- Mm-hmm.

524
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:08,871
Mm-hmm. Was she
in disguise, by any chance?

525
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:12,570
- Wanna check the picture again?
- I wasn't lying to you.

526
01:07:12,645 --> 01:07:15,580
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

527
01:07:15,648 --> 01:07:17,513
It's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

528
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,914
I know.

529
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:21,043
Oh, yeah.

530
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,285
Well, i-i-it was raining
and, um, her hair was all wet.

531
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:28,292
I tell ya, it's not really
a very good picture of her.

532
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,021
No, I guess not.

533
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,030
Tell me all about her.

534
01:07:32,098 --> 01:07:34,191
Well, um,

535
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:38,396
she arrived, um, rather late
one night, went straight to sleep...

536
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,031
and, uh, left early
the next morning.

537
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:44,235
- How early?
- Oh, ex... very early.

538
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,541
Mm-hmm.
Which morning was that?

539
01:07:47,613 --> 01:07:49,547
Uh, the, um...

540
01:07:49,615 --> 01:07:52,880
Th-Th-Th-The next morning.

541
01:07:52,952 --> 01:07:55,250
- Sunday.
- I see. Mm-hmm.

542
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,255
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

543
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,053
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

544
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:02,924
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

545
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,929
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

546
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:08,933
- Did you spend the night with her?
- No.

547
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:12,266
Then how would you know
she didn't make any calls?

548
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,566
Uh, w-w...

549
01:08:16,642 --> 01:08:18,906
Well, she was very tired
a-and, uh...

550
01:08:18,978 --> 01:08:21,742
See, I... N-Now I'm staring
to, um... remember.

551
01:08:21,814 --> 01:08:24,282
I-I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

552
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,410
- If you make a mental picturization...
- Right. Take your time.

553
01:08:27,486 --> 01:08:30,683
Um, she was...
she was sitting back there...

554
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:33,691
N-No, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand.

555
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,694
She said she had to
go to sleep early...

556
01:08:36,762 --> 01:08:40,892
because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,
uh, ahead of her.

557
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:43,696
- Mm-hmm. Back where?
- Back where she came from.

558
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:46,465
No, you said before she
was standing back there...

559
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,473
Yes, b-back in my parlor.

560
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,476
She was very hungry,
I made her a sandwich...

561
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:56,481
and then she said she was tired and
she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.

562
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,483
I see.
How did she pay you?

563
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,314
- Cash? Check?
- Cash.

564
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,320
Cash, huh?
Mm-hmm.

565
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:06,848
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Uh-uh. Why should she?

566
01:09:06,926 --> 01:09:08,985
Hmm.

567
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:15,000
Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,
I guess that's about it.

568
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:18,628
I-I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

569
01:09:18,704 --> 01:09:21,639
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

570
01:09:21,707 --> 01:09:25,108
See, if it doesn't jell,
it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

571
01:09:25,177 --> 01:09:28,112
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

572
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:31,638
Well, I-I-I don't know
what you c-could expect me to know.

573
01:09:31,717 --> 01:09:33,651
People just come and go,
you know.

574
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:36,153
That's right.
She isn't still here, is she?

575
01:09:36,222 --> 01:09:38,019
No.

576
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:43,687
If I wanted to check the cabins, all
twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

577
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:47,198
If you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

578
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,257
Oh.
No, thanks.

579
01:10:06,252 --> 01:10:08,186
Uh, change your mind?

580
01:10:09,889 --> 01:10:11,823
Oh.

581
01:10:11,891 --> 01:10:15,691
You know, I... I think I have one of
those faces you can't help believing.

582
01:10:15,761 --> 01:10:17,626
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

583
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:20,290
Oh? There's somebody
sitting in the window.

584
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:22,459
- N-N-No, there isn't.
- Sure. Take a look.

585
01:10:22,534 --> 01:10:24,525
Oh, th-that must be
my mother.

586
01:10:24,603 --> 01:10:27,037
She's an, uh, "inavlid..."
an invalid.

587
01:10:27,106 --> 01:10:29,574
Uh, it's practically
like living alone.

588
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,735
Oh, I see.

589
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:36,543
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

590
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:39,049
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

591
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:41,143
No.

592
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:45,987
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

593
01:10:46,058 --> 01:10:48,117
You'd know
you were being used.

594
01:10:48,193 --> 01:10:51,185
- You wouldn't be made a fool of.
- I'm not a fool.

595
01:10:51,263 --> 01:10:53,823
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

596
01:10:53,899 --> 01:10:56,834
- This is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

597
01:10:56,902 --> 01:11:00,338
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

598
01:11:00,406 --> 01:11:03,341
Then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

599
01:11:03,409 --> 01:11:05,468
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

600
01:11:05,544 --> 01:11:09,310
Just for a few minutes. There might be
some hint that you missed out on.

601
01:11:09,381 --> 01:11:12,544
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

602
01:11:12,618 --> 01:11:14,552
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- Mr. Arbogast, I-I think I've...

603
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:18,078
- I think I've talked to you all I want.
- Yes, but just for...

604
01:11:18,157 --> 01:11:21,092
It'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

605
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,185
Well, all right.

606
01:11:23,262 --> 01:11:27,130
You sure would save me a lot of
leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

607
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,327
- Would I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

608
01:11:30,402 --> 01:11:32,336
All right.
Thanks, anyway.

609
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:30,128
Hello, Loomis.
This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

610
01:12:30,195 --> 01:12:32,629
Let me talk to her,
please.

611
01:12:33,966 --> 01:12:36,059
Hello, Lila.

612
01:12:36,135 --> 01:12:39,866
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

613
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,873
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

614
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,875
It's out
on the old highway.

615
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:48,435
I even know what cabin she was in...
it was number one.

616
01:12:48,514 --> 01:12:52,814
Well, this young fella that runs
the place said she just spent the night,

617
01:12:52,885 --> 01:12:55,581
left the next day
and that was it.

618
01:12:55,654 --> 01:12:59,090
Mmm.
Um, no, not exactly.

619
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:02,793
Well, I did question him,
believe me,

620
01:13:02,861 --> 01:13:05,796
but I think I got
all there was to get.

621
01:13:05,864 --> 01:13:08,799
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

622
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:12,303
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...

623
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:15,306
See, this boy
had a sick old mother.

624
01:13:15,374 --> 01:13:18,241
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

625
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,643
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

626
01:13:21,713 --> 01:13:26,207
Well, I was, but I think I'll go
back to the motel first.

627
01:13:26,285 --> 01:13:30,051
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

628
01:13:30,122 --> 01:13:32,056
All right, fine.
Listen, I...

629
01:13:32,124 --> 01:13:35,059
You'll be happy to know
what I think.

630
01:13:35,127 --> 01:13:39,063
Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

631
01:13:40,566 --> 01:13:43,501
All right. See ya
in about an hour... or less.

632
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:45,503
All right, bye-bye.

633
01:14:41,126 --> 01:14:43,060
Bates?

634
01:17:16,281 --> 01:17:20,479
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely
sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

635
01:17:22,421 --> 01:17:25,356
Sam, he said
an hour or less.

636
01:17:25,424 --> 01:17:27,654
Yeah.

637
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,660
It's been three.

638
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,855
Are we just
going to sit here and wait?

639
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,057
He'll be back.

640
01:17:34,132 --> 01:17:36,623
Let's sit still
and hang on, okay?

641
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,976
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

642
01:17:45,043 --> 01:17:47,477
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.
- Yes.

643
01:17:47,546 --> 01:17:49,844
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

644
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:52,850
- That wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.

645
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,852
- I'm going out there.
- Arbogast said...

646
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,854
An hour, or less.

647
01:18:00,492 --> 01:18:02,426
Well, I'm going.

648
01:18:02,494 --> 01:18:04,428
You'll never find it.

649
01:18:07,632 --> 01:18:10,066
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go?

650
01:18:10,135 --> 01:18:14,071
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

651
01:18:14,139 --> 01:18:16,573
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

652
01:18:16,641 --> 01:18:18,233
Yeah. Stay here.

653
01:18:38,497 --> 01:18:40,431
Arbogast?

654
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,434
Arbogast!

655
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,205
Arbogast!

656
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:20,096
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

657
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,505
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

658
01:19:23,575 --> 01:19:26,840
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door... or unwilling.

659
01:19:26,912 --> 01:19:28,846
Where could he
have gone?

660
01:19:28,914 --> 01:19:30,848
Maybe he got
some definite lead.

661
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:32,850
- Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?

662
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:34,852
- In a hurry.
- Sam, he called...

663
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,854
when he had nothing
but a dissatisfied feeling.

664
01:19:36,922 --> 01:19:40,858
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

665
01:19:40,926 --> 01:19:42,860
Yes, I think
he would've.

666
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:45,123
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

667
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:48,633
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- Let me get my coat.

668
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,809
Good evening.

669
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:02,973
Well, I... I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

670
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,982
Yes.

671
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,985
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

672
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,988
She's been here
searching for her sister.

673
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,990
There's this
private detective helping.

674
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,492
We got a call from this
detective... he'd traced her...

675
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,721
to that motel
on the old highway.

676
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:19,730
That must be
the Bates Motel.

677
01:20:19,798 --> 01:20:22,858
He called to say he was going
to question Mrs. Bates.

678
01:20:22,934 --> 01:20:24,868
Norman took a wife?

679
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:28,372
No, I-I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

680
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,432
That was early this evening. We
haven't seen or heard from him since.

681
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:35,105
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

682
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:38,206
She left Phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace.

683
01:20:38,283 --> 01:20:41,946
How'd you and this detective come
to trace her to Fairvale?

684
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,181
They thought
she'd be coming to me.

685
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,690
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

686
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:48,692
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

687
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,694
That's right.

688
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,696
From what?

689
01:20:54,466 --> 01:20:56,400
She stole some money.

690
01:20:56,468 --> 01:20:58,459
A lot?

691
01:20:58,537 --> 01:21:00,505
Forty thousand dollars.

692
01:21:00,572 --> 01:21:02,597
The police haven't
been able to...

693
01:21:02,674 --> 01:21:06,269
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

694
01:21:06,344 --> 01:21:09,279
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

695
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:11,281
That explains
the private detective.

696
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:13,340
He traced her
to the Bates place.

697
01:21:13,418 --> 01:21:16,353
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

698
01:21:16,421 --> 01:21:19,720
He said Marion was there
for one night, then she left.

699
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:21,725
- With the $40,000?
- He didn't say anything...

700
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,227
about the money.

701
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,730
It isn't important
what he said, is it?

702
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:30,564
He was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

703
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,569
That's what I want you
to do something about.

704
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:34,104
Like what?

705
01:21:34,172 --> 01:21:36,606
I'm sorry if
I seem overanxious.

706
01:21:36,675 --> 01:21:40,406
I'm sure there's something wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

707
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:44,244
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, Miss, but not the same thing.

708
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:47,251
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

709
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:51,415
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin',

710
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,457
probably
from Norman Bates,

711
01:21:53,525 --> 01:21:56,824
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

712
01:21:56,895 --> 01:22:01,332
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

713
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:03,333
Call Norman and let him
say what happened.

714
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:05,335
At this hour?

715
01:22:05,403 --> 01:22:10,067
He was out when I was there a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.

716
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:13,008
He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin'
the door in the dead of night,

717
01:22:13,078 --> 01:22:15,012
like some people do.

718
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,947
This fellow lives
like a hermit.

719
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,814
You must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago.

720
01:22:20,885 --> 01:22:22,819
Please. Call.

721
01:22:28,326 --> 01:22:32,490
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

722
01:22:38,603 --> 01:22:41,731
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

723
01:22:41,806 --> 01:22:44,741
Ye... I been
just fine, thanks.

724
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:47,403
Listen, we got
worries here.

725
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:50,915
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

726
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:54,584
Well, this one
wouldn't be a customer.

727
01:22:54,653 --> 01:22:57,713
- A private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

728
01:22:57,789 --> 01:22:59,723
Arbogast.

729
01:23:02,193 --> 01:23:04,127
And after he left?

730
01:23:06,831 --> 01:23:09,026
No, that's...
that's okay, Norman.

731
01:23:11,703 --> 01:23:14,638
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

732
01:23:14,706 --> 01:23:17,641
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

733
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:21,042
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

734
01:23:21,112 --> 01:23:24,047
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back...

735
01:23:24,115 --> 01:23:27,573
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

736
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:29,586
Yes.

737
01:23:29,654 --> 01:23:32,487
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

738
01:23:32,557 --> 01:23:36,721
in Greenlawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

739
01:23:36,795 --> 01:23:40,424
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

740
01:23:40,498 --> 01:23:42,432
'Tain't only
local history, Sam.

741
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,368
It's the only case of murder
and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

742
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:50,238
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was... involved with...

743
01:23:50,308 --> 01:23:52,776
when she found out
he was married,

744
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:56,041
then took a helpin' of
the same stuff herself.

745
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:59,743
Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.

746
01:23:59,818 --> 01:24:02,582
Norman found them
dead together.

747
01:24:02,654 --> 01:24:05,521
In bed.

748
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:08,024
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Bates' mother?

749
01:24:08,093 --> 01:24:12,689
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

750
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:15,130
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

751
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,430
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

752
01:24:17,502 --> 01:24:19,993
You saw
Norman Bates' mother?

753
01:24:20,071 --> 01:24:23,700
But it had to be...
because Arbogast said so too!

754
01:24:23,775 --> 01:24:27,472
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

755
01:24:27,545 --> 01:24:31,481
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs. Bates,

756
01:24:31,549 --> 01:24:35,178
who's that woman buried
out in Greenlawn Cemetery?

757
01:25:17,796 --> 01:25:21,994
Now, Mother, um...
I-I'm gonna bring something up...

758
01:25:22,066 --> 01:25:24,660
I am sorry, boy,

759
01:25:24,736 --> 01:25:28,331
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

760
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:30,340
Please, Mother.

761
01:25:30,408 --> 01:25:33,571
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

762
01:25:33,645 --> 01:25:36,808
Ha! You think
I'm fruity, huh?

763
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:38,940
I'm staying right here.

764
01:25:39,017 --> 01:25:41,918
This is my room and
no one will drag me out of it,

765
01:25:41,986 --> 01:25:44,511
least of all
my big, bold son.

766
01:25:44,589 --> 01:25:46,523
They'll come now, Mother.

767
01:25:46,591 --> 01:25:50,322
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

768
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:54,559
Mother, please, it's just for
a few days so they won't find you.

769
01:25:54,632 --> 01:25:56,827
Just for a few days?

770
01:25:56,901 --> 01:26:00,701
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

771
01:26:00,772 --> 01:26:04,173
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

772
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:07,234
Now get out!

773
01:26:07,312 --> 01:26:11,078
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

774
01:26:11,149 --> 01:26:14,175
Norman, what do you
think you're doing?

775
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:17,881
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

776
01:26:22,994 --> 01:26:26,157
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

777
01:26:31,502 --> 01:26:33,436
Wonderful sermon today.

778
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:35,972
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

779
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,304
We thought we'd drive out
to that motel with you.

780
01:26:38,376 --> 01:26:40,742
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

781
01:26:40,812 --> 01:26:43,372
- Did you two have breakfast?
- Didn't find anything?

782
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:47,111
Nothing. Let's
clear the way here.

783
01:26:47,185 --> 01:26:49,483
What did he say
about my sister?

784
01:26:49,554 --> 01:26:52,819
Just what he told your detective:
She used a fake name.

785
01:26:52,891 --> 01:26:57,157
Saw the register myself. Saw the
whole place. That boy's alone there.

786
01:26:57,228 --> 01:27:00,163
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

787
01:27:00,231 --> 01:27:02,665
I know you're not
the seein'-illusions type,

788
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:05,635
but no woman was there and I don't
believe in ghosts, so there it is.

789
01:27:05,703 --> 01:27:07,637
I still feel
there's something...

790
01:27:07,705 --> 01:27:11,266
Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't
make you feel better.

791
01:27:11,342 --> 01:27:15,779
Come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft.

792
01:27:15,847 --> 01:27:18,714
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

793
01:27:18,783 --> 01:27:22,310
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein' picked up.

794
01:27:22,387 --> 01:27:24,446
How 'bout that?

795
01:27:24,522 --> 01:27:27,616
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

796
01:27:27,692 --> 01:27:31,890
Come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.

797
01:27:31,963 --> 01:27:33,897
You too, Sam.

798
01:27:33,965 --> 01:27:36,900
Thank you.

799
01:27:36,968 --> 01:27:41,905
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

800
01:27:41,973 --> 01:27:45,170
- You want me to drop you at the hotel...
- Sam.

801
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:49,873
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

802
01:27:49,948 --> 01:27:53,145
Neither will I.
Come on.

803
01:27:53,217 --> 01:27:57,278
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

804
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:59,585
We're going to register
as man and wife.

805
01:27:59,657 --> 01:28:02,854
We're going to
get shown to a cabin,

806
01:28:02,927 --> 01:28:06,522
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

807
01:28:29,854 --> 01:28:32,789
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

808
01:28:32,857 --> 01:28:34,791
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

809
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:35,985
Come on.

810
01:28:39,297 --> 01:28:41,731
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

811
01:28:41,799 --> 01:28:43,733
Uh-huh.
Suppose you want a room.

812
01:28:43,801 --> 01:28:46,235
We were gonna try to make it
to San Francisco,

813
01:28:46,304 --> 01:28:48,738
but we don't like the look
of that sky.

814
01:28:48,806 --> 01:28:51,741
Looks like a bad day coming,
doesn't it?

815
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,051
- I'll take you to cabin ten.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

816
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:03,053
That's not necessary.

817
01:29:03,121 --> 01:29:06,818
My boss is paying for this trip
and, uh, well, it's 90% business.

818
01:29:06,891 --> 01:29:09,689
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

819
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,696
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

820
01:29:30,548 --> 01:29:32,482
Thank you.

821
01:29:34,852 --> 01:29:36,786
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

822
01:29:40,324 --> 01:29:43,418
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

823
01:29:43,494 --> 01:29:45,428
You check in any other place
in this country without bags...

824
01:29:45,496 --> 01:29:49,432
- and you have to pay in advance.
- Ten dollars.

825
01:29:56,007 --> 01:29:58,339
That receipt.

826
01:30:03,214 --> 01:30:05,842
I'll go on ahead.

827
01:30:10,521 --> 01:30:13,490
All right, there's
your receipt. I'll show you the cabin.

828
01:30:13,558 --> 01:30:16,425
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

829
01:30:34,912 --> 01:30:37,244
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

830
01:30:37,315 --> 01:30:40,250
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

831
01:30:40,318 --> 01:30:42,252
I know.

832
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,254
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

833
01:30:44,322 --> 01:30:46,256
I don't know, but if you had...

834
01:30:46,324 --> 01:30:49,782
a useless business like this motel,
what would you need to get out?

835
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:53,228
To get a new business somewhere else?
Forty thousand dollars?

836
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:58,126
How could we prove that...

837
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:01,000
If he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

838
01:31:01,072 --> 01:31:03,336
There must be some proof
that exists now,

839
01:31:03,407 --> 01:31:06,604
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

840
01:31:06,677 --> 01:31:11,671
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

841
01:31:11,749 --> 01:31:13,683
Or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel...

842
01:31:13,751 --> 01:31:15,309
the same way about you.

843
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:18,150
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

844
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:20,656
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us,

845
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:22,158
unless he was stopped.

846
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:26,060
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

847
01:31:28,332 --> 01:31:31,028
We'll start with cabin one.

848
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:35,998
If he sees us,
we're just taking the air.

849
01:32:07,972 --> 01:32:09,906
Bates.

850
01:32:58,589 --> 01:33:00,557
No shower curtain.

851
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:03,150
- Sam! Look!
- Huh? What is it?

852
01:33:03,227 --> 01:33:05,388
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

853
01:33:05,463 --> 01:33:09,399
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

854
01:33:09,467 --> 01:33:11,935
That proves Marion was here.
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

855
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,937
Bates never denied she was here.

856
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:17,168
Oh. Doesn't that prove
he found out about the money?

857
01:33:17,241 --> 01:33:19,869
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

858
01:33:19,944 --> 01:33:23,311
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

859
01:33:23,381 --> 01:33:26,714
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

860
01:33:26,784 --> 01:33:29,014
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

861
01:33:29,086 --> 01:33:31,020
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

862
01:33:31,088 --> 01:33:34,251
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

863
01:33:34,325 --> 01:33:37,658
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

864
01:33:37,728 --> 01:33:40,629
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

865
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,632
I can handle a sick old woman.

866
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,635
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

867
01:33:46,671 --> 01:33:48,662
Wait a minute.

868
01:33:48,739 --> 01:33:52,004
If you get anything
out of the mother,

869
01:33:52,076 --> 01:33:54,271
can you find your way
back to town?

870
01:33:54,345 --> 01:33:56,677
Yes, of course.

871
01:33:56,747 --> 01:34:00,114
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

872
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:25,534
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

873
01:34:25,609 --> 01:34:27,770
Wife's taking a nap and...

874
01:34:27,845 --> 01:34:31,804
I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I thought I'd look you up and talk.

875
01:34:31,882 --> 01:34:35,215
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

876
01:35:48,325 --> 01:35:51,294
I've been doing all the talking
so far, haven't I?

877
01:35:51,362 --> 01:35:53,796
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time...

878
01:35:53,864 --> 01:35:56,230
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

879
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,461
Here you are
doing all the listening.

880
01:35:58,536 --> 01:36:01,004
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

881
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:03,665
Drive me crazy.

882
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:06,676
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

883
01:36:06,744 --> 01:36:11,875
Just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do anything to get away.

884
01:36:11,949 --> 01:36:13,917
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

885
01:36:17,955 --> 01:36:21,186
Mrs. Bates?

886
01:37:38,002 --> 01:37:40,562
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be contented here,

887
01:37:40,638 --> 01:37:42,572
I'm just doubting that you are.

888
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:46,235
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you'd unload this place.

889
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:50,246
This place? This place happens
to be my only world.

890
01:37:50,314 --> 01:37:53,249
I grew up in that house.
I had a very happy childhood.

891
01:37:53,317 --> 01:37:55,945
My mother and I
were more than happy.

892
01:38:57,748 --> 01:39:00,182
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

893
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,184
I don't know
what you've been saying.

894
01:39:02,252 --> 01:39:05,380
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

895
01:39:05,456 --> 01:39:07,617
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

896
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:10,455
Buy a new one in a new town where you
won't have to hide your mother.

897
01:39:10,527 --> 01:39:13,428
Why don't you just get in
your car and drive away?

898
01:39:13,497 --> 01:39:17,399
Where will you get the money to do that?
Or do you already have it socked away?

899
01:39:17,468 --> 01:39:20,733
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.

900
01:39:24,174 --> 01:39:27,632
I bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it.

901
01:39:27,711 --> 01:39:31,442
I think
she'll tell us.

902
01:39:31,515 --> 01:39:35,144
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

903
01:40:39,983 --> 01:40:42,315
Mrs. Bates, it's...

904
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:05,869
Norman Bates!

905
01:41:34,138 --> 01:41:37,835
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

906
01:41:37,908 --> 01:41:40,604
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

907
01:41:40,677 --> 01:41:42,702
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

908
01:41:43,947 --> 01:41:46,609
Did he talk
to you?

909
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:49,584
No.

910
01:41:49,653 --> 01:41:54,716
I got the whole story, but not from
Norman. I got it from his "mother."

911
01:41:55,959 --> 01:41:59,554
Norman Bates
no longer exists.

912
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:02,360
He only half-existed
to begin with.

913
01:42:02,432 --> 01:42:06,528
And now the other half
has taken over,

914
01:42:06,603 --> 01:42:09,163
probably for all time.

915
01:42:10,908 --> 01:42:12,899
Did he kill my sister?

916
01:42:12,976 --> 01:42:16,468
Yes... and no.

917
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:19,243
Now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork...

918
01:42:19,316 --> 01:42:21,978
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop...

919
01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:25,180
A psychiatrist
doesn't lay the groundwork.

920
01:42:25,255 --> 01:42:27,655
He merely tries
to explain it.

921
01:42:27,724 --> 01:42:30,750
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

922
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:37,727
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

923
01:42:37,801 --> 01:42:41,601
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

924
01:42:45,609 --> 01:42:48,476
Uh, have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

925
01:42:48,545 --> 01:42:51,742
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

926
01:42:51,815 --> 01:42:54,841
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said,

927
01:42:54,918 --> 01:42:56,852
the "mother."

928
01:42:58,689 --> 01:43:02,682
To understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the "mother"...

929
01:43:02,759 --> 01:43:06,320
that is from the "mother" half
of Norman's mind...

930
01:43:06,396 --> 01:43:09,365
you have to go back
ten years...

931
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:11,958
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

932
01:43:12,035 --> 01:43:17,132
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been since his father died.

933
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:23,371
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman,

934
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:27,383
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

935
01:43:28,919 --> 01:43:31,410
Then she met a man,

936
01:43:31,488 --> 01:43:35,925
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

937
01:43:35,993 --> 01:43:39,429
That pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

938
01:43:39,496 --> 01:43:43,660
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

939
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:49,371
most unbearable
to the son who commits it.

940
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:54,809
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

941
01:43:57,214 --> 01:43:59,682
He stole her corpse.

942
01:44:01,551 --> 01:44:04,645
A weighted coffin
was buried.

943
01:44:04,721 --> 01:44:07,622
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar,

944
01:44:07,691 --> 01:44:10,785
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

945
01:44:10,861 --> 01:44:13,659
And that still
wasn't enough.

946
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:17,461
She was there...
but she was a corpse.

947
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:22,734
So he began to think
and speak for her,

948
01:44:22,806 --> 01:44:25,866
give her half his life,
so to speak.

949
01:44:25,943 --> 01:44:30,573
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

950
01:44:30,647 --> 01:44:34,981
At other times, the "mother" half
took over completely.

951
01:44:35,052 --> 01:44:39,648
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only "Mother,"

952
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:44,953
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her,

953
01:44:45,028 --> 01:44:47,690
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him.

954
01:44:47,764 --> 01:44:53,066
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

955
01:44:53,136 --> 01:44:56,867
the "mother" side of him
would go wild.

956
01:44:59,176 --> 01:45:02,145
When he met your sister,

957
01:45:02,212 --> 01:45:04,840
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

958
01:45:04,915 --> 01:45:07,679
He wanted her.

959
01:45:07,751 --> 01:45:11,619
That set off the jealous "mother"
and "Mother" killed the girl.

960
01:45:14,291 --> 01:45:18,591
After the murder Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep...

961
01:45:18,662 --> 01:45:22,393
and, like a dutiful son, covered up
all traces of the crime...

962
01:45:22,466 --> 01:45:24,866
he was convinced
his "mother" had committed!

963
01:45:24,935 --> 01:45:27,403
Why was he...
dressed like that?

964
01:45:27,471 --> 01:45:30,338
He's a transvestite.

965
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:33,103
Uh, not exactly.

966
01:45:33,176 --> 01:45:36,737
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change,

967
01:45:36,813 --> 01:45:39,008
or satisfaction,
is a transvestite.

968
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:43,382
But in Norman's case, he was simply
doing everything possible...

969
01:45:43,453 --> 01:45:46,650
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

970
01:45:48,058 --> 01:45:51,118
And when reality
came to close,

971
01:45:51,194 --> 01:45:54,789
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

972
01:45:57,167 --> 01:46:00,227
he dressed up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

973
01:46:00,303 --> 01:46:04,262
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

974
01:46:04,341 --> 01:46:06,571
He tried to be
his mother.

975
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:11,274
And, uh, now he is.

976
01:46:11,348 --> 01:46:16,342
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the "mother."

977
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:20,356
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities...

978
01:46:20,424 --> 01:46:23,951
there's always
a conflict, a battle.

979
01:46:24,027 --> 01:46:27,690
In Norman's case,
the battle is over...

980
01:46:27,764 --> 01:46:29,891
and the dominant personality
has won.

981
01:46:29,966 --> 01:46:34,096
And the $40,000?
Who got that?

982
01:46:34,171 --> 01:46:37,937
The swamp. These were
crimes of passion, not profit.

983
01:46:39,709 --> 01:46:42,371
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

984
01:46:43,713 --> 01:46:45,681
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

985
01:46:58,261 --> 01:47:00,695
Thank you.

986
01:47:07,304 --> 01:47:10,296
It's sad when
a mother has to speak the words...

987
01:47:10,373 --> 01:47:12,637
that condemn her own son,

988
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:16,509
but I couldn't allow them
to believe that I would commit murder.

989
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:20,983
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

990
01:47:21,051 --> 01:47:23,918
He was always bad,
and in the end...

991
01:47:23,987 --> 01:47:28,447
he intended to tell them I killed
those girls and that man,

992
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:32,222
as if I could do anything
except sit and stare,

993
01:47:32,295 --> 01:47:35,287
like one
of his stuffed birds.

994
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:38,926
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

995
01:47:39,002 --> 01:47:44,599
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

996
01:47:47,644 --> 01:47:51,410
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

997
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:55,281
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

998
01:47:55,352 --> 01:47:57,650
I'm not even
gonna swat that fly.

999
01:47:57,721 --> 01:48:01,157
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

1000
01:48:01,224 --> 01:48:03,158
They'll see
and they'll know,

1001
01:48:03,226 --> 01:48:08,926
and they'll say, "Why, she
wouldn't even harm a fly."

1002
01:48:12,469 --> 01:48:16,405
