1
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,900
I was a bit tense.

2
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,083
Will they let us do it again?

3
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,458
We'll do it as often as we like.

4
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,042
Adrien, finish in the visitor's room
in five minutes.

5
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:21,625
I love you.

6
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,583
In spite of the aggro
that's brought you?

7
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,125
That'll all soon be over.

8
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,542
Amélie drew this for you.

9
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,958
This how she see's us.

10
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,333
When you get out...

11
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,750
So, was it good?

12
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,300
The next time we'll make it a 3...

13
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,375
or a 4.

14
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,667
What's the big idea?

15
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,708
You wanna leave here
in a coffin?

16
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,875
So what?
Makes more for you.

17
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,667
You know where
the goddamn cash is.

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,125
Is it safe?

19
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,500
I can put some buddies
on the job.

20
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,917
They'll guard it
'til we get out.

21
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,083
I wouldn't trust
any buddies of yours.

22
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,750
Yeah!

23
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,417
And any reason why I
should trust YOU?

24
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,583
That's a nice drawing.

25
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:16,792
Is it your daughter's?

26
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,208
I didn't think
we were on speaking terms.

27
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,792
It was good like that.

28
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,792
You know...

29
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,792
there's not much nice
in the world.

30
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,833
You gotta hang on to it.

31
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:33,500
Come on you two,

32
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,542
out!

33
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,958
Time for a walk

34
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,792
Why I would go out today?

35
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,542
Nice weather.

36
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,417
You know the risk
I'd be taking.

37
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,792
You didn't have to assault that girl.

38
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,792
I did NOT do it.

39
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,625
Yeah... I was forgetting.

40
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,042
And I suppose your stickups
were done by your twin brother.

41
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:56,708
Or you wanted to pay for

42
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,500
your sick mother's operation.

43
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,750
Can I go now?

44
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,750
OK you scum...
move it!

45
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,333
Everyone here?

46
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,208
Let's go!

47
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,417
Isn't your rock-spider pal coming?

48
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,083
Scared, is he?

49
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,750
He's saying...

50
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:43,500
I don't give a fuck
what apes say.

51
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,958
Translate that!

52
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,833
I'm innocent.

53
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,667
I know I'll be cleared eventually.

54
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,875
I've got to survive
in this rat-hole.

55
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,792
I'm called a rock-spider.
They want me dead.

56
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:43,292
I continue praying my ordeal
will come to an end.

57
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,542
You sure?

58
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,625
You get out.

59
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,208
Without making trouble.

60
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,250
If you don't wanna cop shit...

61
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,792
then scram.

62
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:32,667
Don't you move.

63
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:42,833
What do you want?

64
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,500
As you don't go out,

65
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,583
we've come to pay you a visit.

66
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,917
You hear... repeat it.

67
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,583
"Spasiba".

68
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,375
Go on... repeat it.

69
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,625
Spasiba.

70
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,208
That means thank you.
You'll repeat it.

71
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,458
Understood?

72
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,375
We'll see if the little girls
get you excited now.

73
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,333
That's enough.

74
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,208
Qu'est-ce tu veux?

75
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,625
We better go down
before there's serious shit.

76
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,333
That's enough... stop!

77
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,500
Shut up... get out!

78
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,875
You shouldn't have
got involved.

79
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,000
6 months more.

80
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,875
Because you defended him.

81
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,458
That's not what
the report says.

82
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,333
The employment agency's
got nothing for me.

83
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,250
I can't afford the nanny.

84
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,667
I can't afford
the speech therapist.

85
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,958
And we've got all that money.

86
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,625
Do you realise that
this guy Franck Adrien,

87
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:11,083
went into hiding near our place
after his stick-up.

88
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,917
In Nièvre.

89
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,167
He's been put with me
to protect me.

90
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,042
I'm there to protect you.

91
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,000
That's true.

92
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,500
Why don't you tell me
where you've hidden it?

93
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,000
I'd just take what we need.

94
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,000
Trust me for once.

95
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,583
The reason I'm here's
because I was trusting.

96
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,250
I don't get to sleep.
Every other day,

97
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,625
they forget my medication.

98
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:53,708
The lawyer's going to see
what he can do.

99
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,500
You believe I'm going
to get out of this?

100
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,667
Of course.

101
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,542
Her mother said to the judge
that she'd invented everything.

102
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,625
He's going to question her
and she's going to crack.

103
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,125
You're getting out...
it's going to happen.

104
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,958
You'll give me a child.

105
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,583
You didn't need to
bring her in here.

106
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:17,958
This is no place for her.

107
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,542
She wanted to come.

108
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,625
What'd she say?

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,417
She wanted to see her father.

110
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,750
While I'm in here
I'm not her father.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,375
I don't want her to see me
as a convict.

112
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,667
I'm sorry, Franck.

113
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,208
We miss you so.

114
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,750
I miss both of you, too.

115
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,792
Amélie, you'll fall over.

116
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:11,208
Careful!

117
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,167
What a cutie!

118
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,958
What's your name?

119
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,625
She can't reply.

120
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,667
She has speaking problems.

121
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,542
She's going to learn to speak.

122
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,625
It'll take time.

123
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,500
She may be right
to take her time.

124
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,333
Say goodbye.

125
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:43,000
'Bye, Amélie.

126
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,750
You make a move
and you're a vegetable.

127
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,125
You wanna kill me, Novick?

128
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,417
Don't you wanna get your dough?

129
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,958
Exactly... the Russkie won't miss you.

130
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,125
I wanna know
where the cash's stashed.

131
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,250
So my buddies
can take care of it.

132
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,667
Look, they're not far away.

133
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,750
You've got nothing to say?

134
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,208
Go fuck yourself.

135
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,375
Cough up!

136
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,875
You know Marco's hideout

137
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:53,875
I'm listening.

138
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:56,000
It is under the false floor.

139
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,542
G'day, Franck.

140
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,875
How long have I been here?

141
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,292
4 days.

142
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,167
And Novick?

143
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,292
In solitary.

144
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,667
He only got a week.

145
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:12,542
So he get's out in 3 days...
gotta get outta here quick.

146
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,125
You're worried about your cash?

147
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,375
What are you talking about?

148
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,917
The reason you're in here.

149
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,583
Novick want's to pinch it.

150
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,667
Do you want any help?

151
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,167
How?

152
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,583
I'm getting out!

153
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,917
The girl's retracted her story.

154
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,500
She made it all up from A to Z.

155
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:45,083
There won't even
be a new trial.

156
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:50,333
I want to give you
my phone number.

157
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,958
Call when you get out.

158
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,250
This is not a good idea.

159
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,917
Why?

160
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,875
I won't forget what you did.

161
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,125
Let me help you.
I don't owe you anything.

162
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,167
Yes, that's quite right.

163
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,333
You're right.

164
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,125
OK.

165
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,625
Cheers.

166
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,750
Call me.

167
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,458
There's something you could do.

168
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,083
It's...

169
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,750
call my wife.

170
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,125
Tell her I'm well and that
Novick's watching her.

171
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,667
And then also,

172
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,750
she should see my father,
he'll help her.

173
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,250
Could you do that for me?

174
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,583
Sure, you can trust me.

175
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,167
Nothing's changed.
We even tidied your cell.

176
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,708
Novick's out?

177
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,292
He said you wanted
to take his share.

178
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,750
He wanted to kill you.

179
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,958
He's been transferred to Fresnes.
Happy?

180
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,333
Cigarettes?
I been waiting 3 days.

181
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,083
Adrien.

182
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,792
Visitors room.

183
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,875
You can feel the evil in here.

184
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,750
The color-scheme
doesn't help.

185
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,833
Nobody made you come.

186
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:50,958
Manuel Carrega,
constabulary captain.

187
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,667
Has something happened to Anna?

188
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,833
Anna?

189
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,917
I've got questions regarding
Jean-Louis Maurel.

190
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:03,292
Maurel?

191
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,500
He shared your cell.

192
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,417
You know he was accused of raping
a little girl?

193
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,833
Everyone knew about it.
He's been found innocent.

194
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,042
What did he tell you
about his life?

195
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,292
I wasn't interested.

196
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,792
He told me he was from Nièvre,
I've lived there and we talked a bit
about it.

197
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,917
He mention any places, people?

198
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,667
What are you on about?

199
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,333
I'm not on about him...
but I am about his next victims.

200
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,375
Wasn't he the victim?

201
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,750
Legally, yes.

202
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,958
Do I trust
what he's capable of?

203
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,667
Didn't the girl
retract her story?

204
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:54,042
Maurel's wife
managed to get to her.

205
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,208
You haven't charged her?

206
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,958
I'm looking for proof.

207
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,750
I need your testimony.

208
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What have you seen

209
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,583
or heard while you
were with him?

210
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,958
He seemed quite normal.

211
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,542
He's a manipulator.

212
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:09,667
He's cunning.

213
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,375
He's fooled more than one person.

214
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,042
He hasn't fooled me.

215
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:19,458
20 years ago I came to France
for a woman.

216
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,667
She'd left a guy
who beat her up.

217
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:26,000
I warned that her ex
was dangerous.

218
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,208
For nothing.

219
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,875
He set fire to where we lived.

220
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,125
She's dead.

221
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,750
I've survived.

222
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:41,500
I've escaped death

223
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,250
to help save others.

224
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,667
If anything else

225
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:54,833
comes back to you.

226
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,458
And if you'd just come
from the asylum?

227
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:01,042
Believe me...
I'm not the mad one.

228
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,625
The answering machine contains
too many messages.

229
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,208
Please try again later.
Goodbye.

230
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,875
Come on.

231
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm taking you to the meeting.

232
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,042
He had to come
Were are you going?

233
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,875
Not far.
He'll pay double.

234
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:11,000
Cinderella following Big Sister, out.

235
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,792
Waiting for Prince Charming.

236
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:20,917
We'll follow and join up.

237
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:23,167
OK

238
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,417
Is it far?
It's here.

239
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,875
You want to stay?

240
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,792
It's him who says what
he wants.

241
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,750
She's perfect.

242
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,667
You can leave us.

243
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,833
Will I move?

244
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,792
We don't know if it's him.

245
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,208
What's she doing?

246
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,167
She's confirming.

247
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,917
Let me do it.

248
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,958
You start undressing first.

249
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,708
Your turn.

250
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:43,792
I'm thirsty.

251
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:46,208
Could I get a glass of water?

252
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,625
It's Costa, go!

253
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,292
We've got him, boys!

254
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,125
Don't move!
Go, go!

255
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,833
Turn over, you fuck!

256
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,417
I wanna see your hands!

257
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,542
Move it!

258
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,167
Move it!

259
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,958
All OK?
He's in the bag.

260
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,542
The Corsican was right.

261
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,042
You were perfect.

262
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,667
Come on, get a move on.

263
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,000
You stay there.

264
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:28,583
Nico,

265
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,167
a bit of privacy.

266
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:14,875
I'm not translating.

267
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,083
Vous êtes 3!

268
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,292
Franck.

269
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,750
I can fix everything.

270
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:01,542
Nico!

271
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,792
Let me out!

272
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,167
They're going to kill me!

273
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,708
Let me out!

274
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,250
Nico, open the door!

275
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,833
I'll kill you, you fucker!

276
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,250
Nico!
Shit.

277
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,667
Ça va, chef?

278
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,333
2 more.

279
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:49,000
The Costas will spend Christmas
in the clink.

280
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,000
Hang on...

281
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:52,375
René is more cunning.

282
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,625
We'll need to be more cunning
to catch him..

283
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:55,708
Exactly.

284
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,792
Has The Holy Ghost
finished with your cover?

285
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,667
He wants Claire downstairs.

286
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,000
And what do you want?

287
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,125
Couldn't ask for more.

288
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
The prisoner

289
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,917
who got out dressed as a guard.

290
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,708
Franck Adrien, in for the bank

291
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:17,792
stickup.

292
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,500
I know.

293
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:20,625
So?

294
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:24,292
He had 2 months to go.
He's not ready.

295
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,417
He's going to make
the usual mistakes

296
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,375
getting back the hidden loot.

297
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:33,208
Anyone can catch him.
I'm staying on the Costas.

298
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,208
The boss wants the best.

299
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,250
The troop that's just had
3 major convictions...

300
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,208
you and your team.

301
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,542
If it's so simple,

302
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:43,875
you'll be back with the Costas
in no time.

303
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,375
Thank you, monsieur.

304
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,875
That's OK.

305
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,375
Would you know
where to find the eggs?

306
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,792
They're at the end, through there.

307
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,625
Would it be too much to ask
to come with me?

308
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:19,000
I always get lost
with all these aisles.

309
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,833
- Yes, follow me.
- Melissa!

310
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,375
I'm waiting for you.

311
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:26,208
Sorry, gotta go.

312
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:30,083
Doesn't matter,
I'll find them myself.

313
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,833
The man thwarted the security checks.

314
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,708
Franck Adrien, convicted
for the holdup of the Savings Bank

315
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,375
didn't have more than 8 months
of prison left.

316
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,500
He may be armed and
is considered dangerous.

317
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,250
Got it...
au revoir, monsieur.

318
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,917
Do you think he'll understand?

319
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,958
Nothing to worry about.
The police have good info, now.

320
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,875
Christine,

321
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,750
we knew he'd get out one day.

322
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,125
I've got everything worked out.

323
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,167
He doesn't know what's waiting for him.
Trust me.

324
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,875
Nobody's going to take our
happiness away.

325
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,042
She's sleeping?

326
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,667
She looks so adorable
like that.

327
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,667
Thanks for giving her to me.

328
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,958
He's got very few connections.

329
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,458
He avoids his relations.

330
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,042
His wife?
Yeah.

331
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,167
Anna Martens.
She used to visit him.

332
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,583
She's unemployed,
takes care of the kid.

333
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,458
The address she gave

334
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,208
is phony.

335
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,958
And his accomplices?

336
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,333
Guests of the state.

337
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,708
Jérôme Novick
was at Mérancourt.

338
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,167
It wasn't a great love affair.

339
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,958
He attacked Adrien
with a screwdriver.

340
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,125
Nice boy.

341
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,833
I'm going to question him.

342
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:18,958
How much did they get?

343
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,208
2 million.

344
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:21,375
2 million!

345
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,292
We've only got back pocket money.

346
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:27,833
He's going to want
to get the money back.

347
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,625
Watch the places he knows.

348
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,750
Houses, bars.

349
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:34,250
His picture's everywhere.

350
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,875
I've asked for
his visiting room videos.

351
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,500
Ça, c'est quoi?

352
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,542
Those who could've seen him
in their area.

353
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:43,917
100 calls.

354
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,708
Dobbing-in's a national sport.

355
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,583
Has the media spoken to Anna?

356
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:51,375
No.

357
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:56,083
We got an address for Anna
in the suburbs.

358
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,500
Who's he?

359
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,333
Anna?

360
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,958
Hey, watch where you're going!

361
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,125
What's going on?

362
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,583
Turn them out!

363
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,292
Nobody leaves.

364
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:35,792
Are you staying here?

365
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,708
No, I'm covering you.

366
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,833
Police, step aside.

367
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:05,625
Out of the way!

368
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,500
That's it.

369
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,208
Police, open up!

370
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,042
No one!

371
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:40,958
Come here.

372
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,417
Look.

373
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,333
We just missed him.

374
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,292
Marco!
Coming!

375
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:14,417
He's not far away.

376
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,625
We need reinforcements,
He's in the area.

377
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,375
With luck, we'll be back
in an hour.

378
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,583
Avec de la chance, dans une heure,
on est rentrés.

379
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,250
Don't move!

380
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:56,667
Don't you move.

381
00:37:58,667 --> 00:37:59,833
Let me past.

382
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,125
Of course!
Anything else?

383
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:06,083
I can't go back to prison now.

384
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,417
Don't move!

385
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:12,625
I've learned something

386
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,083
very important.

387
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,917
You can't shoot,
I'm not threatening you

388
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:20,042
You can see I'm unarmed

389
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,375
Adrien is on the street.
Warn everyone!

390
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,083
There he is!
Stop him!

391
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,333
You OK?

392
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,917
Close the next station!

393
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,208
If the train stops
he'll get off.

394
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,292
Is he crazy?

395
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,167
Divide up the zone
and set up road blocks.

396
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:58,667
I know,
good... thanks.

397
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:01,458
He's probably already far away.
Here...

398
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,250
yours?

399
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,500
He's crazy.

400
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:11,375
Something's driving him.
Something really strong.

401
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,542
"Anna, wherever you are,
I'll find you."

402
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:19,708
She's cleared off
with the cash.

403
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,917
Two for the price of one?

404
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,917
Yeah, that'll make
The Holy Ghost happy.

405
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:04,417
Yes?

406
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,083
Why did you do it?

407
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,458
Franck, I knew you'd call.

408
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:12,542
How are you?

409
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:16,125
Tell me, why did you do it?

410
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:21,083
Why did you kill her?

411
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:23,167
It was all her fault.

412
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,125
Thank God...
I know how to read people.

413
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,833
Your wife was unreliable.

414
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:33,958
She would have
given you problems.

415
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,250
I chose to save you
from all that.

416
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,125
What have you done with Amélie?

417
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:46,292
What have you done with
my little daughter?

418
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,292
Where is she, Maurel?

419
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,333
Have you killed her?

420
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:54,167
She's a lovely little thing.
I love her very much.

421
00:46:54,417 --> 00:46:56,292
I shan't do her
any harm at all.

422
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:59,667
Unless you try to find me.

423
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:39,417
What is it?

424
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,083
He wants us to grab Adrien
on his return.

425
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:43,458
He's in Corsica.

426
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,417
I'd love to go down to Corsica.

427
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:46,875
Anna's scrap of paper?

428
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,708
Amélie's drawings.

429
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:51,250
Naïve style endowed with
a certain potential.

430
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,083
Letters for her guy

431
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,750
that she hadn't sent.

432
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,958
Love letters.

433
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:02,375
"I understand your gesture.
It's a proof of love."

434
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:03,625
The stickup.

435
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:07,208
Why hadn't she posted
this deathless prose?

436
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:09,958
To be read in prison?

437
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:11,042
Not on.

438
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:12,083
They aren't the words

439
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:16,292
of a woman stabbing
someone in the back.

440
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:17,375
And Novick?

441
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:19,792
A heap of new insults.

442
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,667
It's a put-up job between
Adrien and his chick.

443
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:26,208
We know the addresses
he's given,

444
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:27,333
except for this one.

445
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:30,458
Le Pré-sur-Lamure?

446
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,667
What's that?
Their hide-out

447
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,333
after the bank job.

448
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,875
Martin, go round!

449
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:06,125
What's this?

450
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,667
What's this bullshit?

451
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:34,208
No thanks.

452
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,542
Are your reinforcements coming?
They're coming.

453
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,417
The policeman's refrain.

454
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:09,958
Are we gonna find the loot?

455
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,333
If it's not already gone.

456
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,208
What's that?

457
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:20,833
Why have you come?

458
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:24,167
It's nothing to do with your daughter.
What would you know?

459
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,000
Best you go home.

460
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,833
We should be Corsican.

461
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,542
There's something here!

462
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:35,375
Captain, come here.
Stay there.

463
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:43,875
Look.

464
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:52,000
Robert, no!
Pull him back!

465
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,958
Nobody touch anything.

466
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:15,333
It was his daughter?
Yeah. Julie.

467
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:18,458
Disappeared. He'd been hoping
she was just a runaway.

468
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,500
The guy who did that
is a monster.

469
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:31,000
Is it one of Adrien's victims?

470
00:51:31,292 --> 00:51:33,833
No way that it fits Adrien's profile.

471
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:37,083
He has a wife
and a disabled child.

472
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,917
That doesn't fit with a killer

473
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:41,458
There are always exceptions.

474
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,417
There are some connections.

475
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:47,500
He was living in the area when
Julie disappeared.

476
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,083
We found his DNA
on the map and the jacket.

477
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,833
That's not all.
What else?

478
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:57,667
There are 2 other maps
of areas way up in the mountains.

479
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,875
Maybe we'll find other bodies.

480
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,042
We're not going to get
carried away

481
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:05,083
If it's a serial killer,
they'll want to bring in the Feds.

482
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:06,917
They'd want the file.

483
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,167
We have to get him now.

484
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:10,958
Listen, Claire.

485
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:13,833
They don't teach this
at police school,

486
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:17,500
but next time, this guy
doesn't get to get away.

487
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,833
Understood?

488
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,250
Quite understood.

489
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:23,250
Have a good day.

490
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:49,750
I don't want to hurt you.

491
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,958
What the fuck
are you doing here?

492
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,708
You're going to help me
find Maurel.

493
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:57,417
Where are your guns?

494
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:58,958
I don't have any.

495
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:02,208
Don't take me for an idiot,
where are they?

496
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:04,458
They're there.

497
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,750
In the cupboard.

498
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:15,458
Go.

499
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:19,583
He always lived in the area.

500
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I met him 5 years ago.

501
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:27,542
I questioned him about
a girl from Dijon.

502
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:37,417
Sylvie Desmée.

503
00:53:37,792 --> 00:53:40,167
He'd been seen talking to her.

504
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:42,083
I smelled a rat.

505
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,875
Maurel raised
too many questions.

506
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:47,750
He lied about details.

507
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:51,500
I sensed that he was
playing with me.

508
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:53,417
He was a bad one.

509
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:59,042
The girl was never found...
no body, no proof.

510
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:02,542
There were the other
disappearances.

511
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:12,167
The resemblance is striking.

512
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,042
It's been admitted
that it was a serial killer.

513
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:18,708
But a cop investigates facts,
not potential suspects.

514
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:20,833
You've gone ahead anyway?

515
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,583
Quietly. Got nowhere for a long time.

516
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,542
He was invisible.

517
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:31,167
No record, town hall official,
liked by all.

518
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:34,083
He was never far away
when the disappearances occurred.

519
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:35,583
Finally,

520
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,708
2 bodies were found
a month apart.

521
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:41,375
I brought Maurel in,

522
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:44,792
but his DNA didn't match.

523
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:46,208
For the second time,

524
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:47,958
he trapped us.

525
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:52,250
His sperm sample was at the station,

526
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,875
Next day it'd disappeared.
I was suspected.

527
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,167
At the same time,

528
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:01,292
he brought a complaint against me
for harassment.

529
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,500
I was dismissed.

530
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,333
I'm not allowed
to live near him.

531
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,708
You're no longer
in the constabulary?

532
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:11,583
No, I lied to you.

533
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:13,458
I investigate privately.

534
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:17,125
Bugger! I was hoping
you'd be able to help me.

535
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,875
The little girl's 5.

536
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,167
She doesn't look like these girls...

537
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:23,708
Could he harm her?

538
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,708
She's not his normal victim type.

539
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:30,458
If he wanted to have a good time,
he wouldn't hesitate.

540
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,583
I've got the phone number.

541
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,083
An old constabulary captain's

542
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,833
maybe got some contacts?

543
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:44,792
Want a snort?

544
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,083
- Thanks!

545
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:52,708
It's good stuff.

546
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:58,125
The paper?

547
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:02,958
You know him?

548
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,125
The constabulary have

549
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,792
found 2 more bodies.

550
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:11,458
Sylvie Desmée and Karine
Garcia, reported missing.

551
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:14,250
This is a serial killer for sure!

552
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:22,125
Thanks, I'm on it.

553
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:26,500
A truck driver dropped Adrien
at Lussaune, in Nièvre.

554
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:28,417
You coming?

555
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,875
Yeah, coming.

556
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:37,292
I've come to see Bourgoin.

557
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:40,208
You got a serial killer for 'him?

558
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,500
Bourgoin,
Lussaune Constabulary office.

559
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:14,667
I need information
on a suspect's number.

560
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,667
It's me.
You got something?

561
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:49,667
The line's been dead
for 48 hours.

562
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:52,083
He used it 12 times.

563
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:55,000
The last time was to
Pré-sur-Lamure.

564
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,792
One of my hideouts.
What else?

565
00:57:58,167 --> 00:57:59,542
Several calls

566
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:01,083
to the Alpes-Maritimes region.

567
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,042
Where in Alpes-Maritimes?

568
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:06,417
There's an area of 40 k's
around a village.

569
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:08,000
Chasseignes.

570
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:10,333
That's maybe where he's living.

571
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:14,417
He takes a medication, Xyrex.

572
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:17,292
He was jumpy
when he didn't get it.

573
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:19,417
Is there a pharmacy
in Chasseignes?

574
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:36,167
There are the cops everywhere.
You reported me?

575
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:37,917
No I didn't.

576
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:40,333
Where's your gun?

577
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:43,667
A gun's against regu...
Stuff your regulations.

578
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:46,167
I wouldn't need
to depend on you.

579
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:10,000
Carrega?

580
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,667
How come you're here?
I was looking for Bourgoin.

581
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:16,083
He's directing the search.
The search?

582
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,375
The fugitive's been reported
in the area.

583
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:20,625
He may have killed

584
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,750
3 young girls.

585
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:22,792
What do you mean?

586
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:25,000
Including Sylvie Desmée.

587
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:27,042
You remember her.

588
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:29,250
I'm going to give you a hand.

589
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:33,708
Carrega... you forgotten
you don't work here any more?

590
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,875
Take the lane.

591
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,792
We're taking the lane
with the tall hedges.

592
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,542
Your guns, over the hedge.

593
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,958
Hurry up!

594
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:30,292
Go on!

595
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:32,167
On the ground!

596
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:36,125
On the ground!

597
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,458
Stay down or...

598
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,375
Or you'll strangle me
like the others?

599
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:43,333
What are you talking about?

600
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:47,708
Sylvie Desmée, Karine Garcia,
they ring a bell?

601
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:52,458
What are you talking about?
Your DNA on the maps

602
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,667
in your old hideout.

603
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:58,208
HQ to Bravo 2.
Put me on to Captain Linée.

604
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,542
Bugger!

605
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:06,958
He's fucked you
like he's fucked me.

606
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:11,292
Stop!

607
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:12,917
All units!

608
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:14,000
Stop!

609
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:24,083
Stop him!

610
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,125
Get in!

611
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,792
Bugger, there he is!

612
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:46,458
Stop!

613
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:57,625
You OK?

614
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:03,958
They believe it's you...

615
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:07,083
I know.
Who do YOU think it is?

616
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:10,292
Maurel, as I've always known.

617
01:03:11,167 --> 01:03:13,292
Chasseignes's 600 km.

618
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:15,500
There's one pharmacy.

619
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,667
There's the address.

620
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,042
Bugger!
They've been warned.

621
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:26,208
Hang on!

622
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:55,917
Stop!

623
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:58,083
Jump out!

624
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,042
Don't worry,
he's gotta be stopped!

625
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:03,792
Think about your daughter,
jump!

626
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:40,625
The injured man is in intensive care
at Auxerre hospital.

627
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:43,250
Condition serious.

628
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:48,625
They used to think he was crazy.
Now they're upset.

629
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,083
Not my problem.

630
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:53,708
Got Adrien?
No. On and on it goes.

631
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,750
Tell me,

632
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:58,667
how did he make Carrega
smash through a road-block?

633
01:04:58,917 --> 01:05:01,042
Believe me,
he's very persuasive.

634
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,375
For you, eh?

635
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,500
All looks very nice and expensive.
This isn't a parade!

636
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:21,875
You had him!

637
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:24,500
It's just a matter of time.
There's no time left!

638
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,292
The constabulary's furious.

639
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:28,125
We've allowed a killer

640
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,167
to escape.

641
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:30,500
I'm responsible.

642
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:31,833
I'm in charge.

643
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:36,042
A bit of criminal analysis
will do you good.

644
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:37,083
Commander...

645
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,333
Why did you spare him?

646
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:42,042
I'm not sure he's the one
who killed them.

647
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:45,417
I beg your pardon?
He could have shot me.

648
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:47,083
It doesn't add up.

649
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,458
You put in a report
based on woman's intuition.

650
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,458
I'm going to try and get Adrien...

651
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,542
and not miss him.

652
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:57,083
Cut off between D981
and D18 in the Beuch forest.

653
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:59,250
Received, Delta 3.

654
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,917
Block off the intersection
of Rue de L'étang

655
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:04,208
and D981...

656
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,292
On D18...

657
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:08,750
No sign of suspect.

658
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:10,542
Suspect has escaped area.

659
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:27,083
Christine,

660
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:29,208
I've never been so happy.

661
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,875
Me too.

662
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,208
It's hard for me to stop
thinking about that guy.

663
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:36,750
His face is plastered everywhere.

664
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,583
The police will get him.

665
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,208
Look.

666
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,708
France's Most Wanted.

667
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Come on.
I'm going to buy you a dress.

668
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,667
Here's a beautiful dress!

669
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:10,667
You like it?
You'll try it on?

670
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:14,208
You'll be a real princess.

671
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:17,750
My goodness, you're so beautiful!
Jean-Louis!

672
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,875
Isn't she beautiful with this?

673
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:27,667
Jean-Louis?

674
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,625
No, Jean-Louis.

675
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,333
I told you, Christine.

676
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,292
I gave you the little girl.

677
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:44,000
It's too risky.

678
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:45,417
The little girl is too.

679
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:48,708
You saw how she was
looking at the newspapers?

680
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:54,542
You got nothing new,
what are you stuffing around with?

681
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:57,042
I'm matching Adrien's movements

682
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:58,500
with his supposed crimes.

683
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,375
Supposed?

684
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:03,625
You think that we're
pinning these murders on him?

685
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:07,333
He thinks so.
He said: "He's fucked me."

686
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:08,458
Who was he talking about?

687
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,917
I know it's someone
we should be looking for.

688
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,750
Can you help me?

689
01:13:22,292 --> 01:13:23,875
I should be out on the job.

690
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:25,708
Please!

691
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,625
Alright..No!
Don't wanna know about it!

692
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,250
You're a pain in the neck.
Go back to Paris. Shit!

693
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,958
Excuse me.
Can you help me?

694
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:52,208
We're looking for

695
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:54,458
a doctor...

696
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:55,958
Our daughter's sick.

697
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,333
She has a stomach ache.

698
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:00,000
There's Dr Berlot.

699
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,167
He's further on, in Verneuil.

700
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:04,625
You need to keep to the right and...

701
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:07,000
Could you show us perhaps?

702
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:09,833
I have to get back.

703
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:13,583
We'll take you home afterwards.

704
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,500
You'd be a great help.

705
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:17,125
Hullo.

706
01:14:17,542 --> 01:14:20,542
My wife's worried
it could be serious.

707
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,208
Alright then.

708
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:26,208
Get in the front.

709
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:27,625
It's easier.

710
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:28,917
Let me take that.

711
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:32,208
I'll mind it.
Thanks.

712
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,583
We all belt up in my car.

713
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:01,000
This is very nice of you.

714
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:03,167
How old are you?

715
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,583
That's it then.

716
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:10,292
At 16,
girls are still very nice.

717
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:18,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

718
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:22,958
No.
It's there on the right.

719
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,375
No, we'd rather

720
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:29,292
keep going to the right.

721
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,042
That doesn't bother you?

722
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:36,542
I was talking about,

723
01:15:36,917 --> 01:15:38,167
whether you had a boyfriend?

724
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:39,042
Yes.

725
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,125
What's that got
to do with anything?

726
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,083
It doesn't concern you.

727
01:15:47,917 --> 01:15:49,875
I want to get out.

728
01:15:55,792 --> 01:15:57,417
What are you doing?

729
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,083
Leave me alone!

730
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,542
Help!

731
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:01,083
What are you up to?

732
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:04,375
I love you.

733
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:10,167
Will they let us do it again?

734
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,208
An envelope for you.

735
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,917
From Paris.

736
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,417
Thanks I was waiting for it.

737
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:01,375
It's him.
What about it?

738
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:04,875
He's been to see Adrien
in prison.

739
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:06,333
Are you saying that...

740
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,208
They'd already met.

741
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,833
Hadn't you realised that?

742
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,542
They've taken ages
to send this stuff.

743
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:15,583
Carrega used an alias
to see Adrien.

744
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:16,917
Olivier Desmée.

745
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:18,625
One of Adrien's victims was

746
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,208
Sylvie Desmée.

747
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:23,667
Carrega was obsessed with
the case.

748
01:19:23,917 --> 01:19:26,708
He claimed to know
the identity of the killer.

749
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:29,667
Adrien?
So, some miserable wretch...

750
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,083
Named what?

751
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:36,375
He was questioned.
What was his name again...?

752
01:19:38,542 --> 01:19:39,292
Yeah... Maurel!

753
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:42,417
That's it,
Jean-Louis Maurel.

754
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:21,292
Here we are!

755
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:26,125
Had some work done here...

756
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,833
And there

757
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,000
Careful.

758
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:30,333
Attention.

759
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:31,917
Ideal for a family.

760
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,542
Rent's not high.

761
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:36,625
The owner's keen.

762
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:39,208
All this'll be removed.

763
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:19,000
An address?
You aren't on the job.

764
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:20,875
If Lucciani finds out...

765
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,125
Give me the address.

766
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:27,208
Maurel rented a house
in the Alpes-Maritimes

767
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:28,917
2 weeks after he got out.

768
01:21:29,292 --> 01:21:31,500
He pays through a Swiss bank

769
01:21:31,917 --> 01:21:32,833
in Lausanne

770
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,708
Are you going to give me
the address?

771
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,792
You're not planning on
going there?

772
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,125
I'm very late.

773
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,292
Jean-Jacques, I know.

774
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,417
I'll get the ball rolling.
Let's go!

775
01:23:51,542 --> 01:23:53,583
Everybody hungry?

776
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:28,875
I told him.
That's him for sure.

777
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:30,542
He strangled those girls?

778
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,042
A woman has a daughter

779
01:24:33,417 --> 01:24:36,167
who disappeared yesterday.
Girl aged 16.

780
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:40,708
That's her.

781
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:44,125
See you soon.
Next time at our place.

782
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:45,750
Return match.

783
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:54,292
Take care.

784
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:33,167
Jean-Louis Maurel?

785
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:35,125
That's me.

786
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,625
Claire Linné,
I'm looking for Franck Adrien.

787
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:42,042
That's someone
I'd rather forget.

788
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,625
May I come in?

789
01:26:45,542 --> 01:26:47,250
Certainly.

790
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:50,833
This is my wife, Christine.

791
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:09,750
My little sweetie-pie.

792
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,708
It's Daddy.

793
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:32,292
I think I've told you everything.

794
01:27:32,542 --> 01:27:34,333
He hasn't been
in touch with you?

795
01:27:38,417 --> 01:27:40,542
If he had, I would've
called the police.

796
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:46,083
I was the victim
of a judicial mistake.

797
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:49,833
I wouldn't want to
help a criminal.

798
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,458
Is it true what was reported?

799
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:58,375
The inquiry's underway, madame.

800
01:28:00,292 --> 01:28:01,208
Look carefully.

801
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:04,083
Is this the man that was at
the supermarket.

802
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:06,333
I don't think so.

803
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,667
What is it

804
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:10,833
I'm fed up, Alex.
Claire...

805
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,792
Claire inquired about
Jean-Louis Maurel.

806
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:16,250
Woman's intuition?

807
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,125
Maurel lives 20km from here.
What?

808
01:28:19,542 --> 01:28:21,167
She's gone there.

809
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:22,500
Call her.

810
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,667
She's not contactable.
Should we go there?

811
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:47,208
I wish I could've
been more help.

812
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:49,500
Don't hesitate to call.

813
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:52,250
Will do.

814
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:39,583
So happy to see you here.

815
01:29:43,167 --> 01:29:45,208
I've missed you.

816
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:50,708
How did you find
our little nest?

817
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,875
It's cosy.

818
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:56,542
Thanks to you, Franck.

819
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:59,042
I'll never be able to
thank you enough.

820
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:02,167
You're my guardian angel.

821
01:30:03,042 --> 01:30:03,958
He's got Amélie.

822
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:08,417
Trust me... he'll give her
back to us.

823
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:24,500
You know, Franck,

824
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:29,208
nobody understands
what I'm looking for.

825
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:32,000
Nobody.

826
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:34,500
Nobody.

827
01:30:35,917 --> 01:30:37,625
Filthy scum!

828
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:42,208
It's all over, now.

829
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:43,875
We're all back together.

830
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:45,417
The whole family.

831
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:48,125
Not in front of her.
Drop your gun!

832
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,667
I said

833
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:51,417
drop your gun!

834
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:54,125
He's here... I've got him.

835
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:58,125
He wanted to kill us!

836
01:30:58,542 --> 01:30:59,458
Don't move!

837
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,667
Jean-Louis!

838
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:07,792
Jean-Louis!

839
01:31:27,542 --> 01:31:30,167
Get him!
he's got Amélie!

840
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:32,875
The cop?

841
01:31:33,292 --> 01:31:34,708
I'll fix that.

842
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,750
Stop here.

843
01:33:06,167 --> 01:33:08,125
You go on, I'll take a look.

844
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:31,833
Would you like to walk on ahead, Amélie?

845
01:33:58,917 --> 01:34:01,875
Don't go near the edge.
Stay close to Daddy.

846
01:34:28,167 --> 01:34:30,625
You OK, Franck?

847
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:43,333
Maurel.

848
01:34:46,125 --> 01:34:47,125
Maurel!

849
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,208
Don't move.
Drop your gun!

850
01:34:55,042 --> 01:34:56,042
I've got the fugitive.

851
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:58,333
He's down there.

852
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:10,667
Maurel!

853
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:32,750
Help's coming.

854
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:33,750
Franck.

855
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:36,250
It's all over, Amélie's safe.

856
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:41,125
Cri de douleur

857
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,042
There's extenuating circumstances.

858
01:35:43,417 --> 01:35:44,417
Trust me.

859
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:48,167
I can't trust anyone.

860
01:35:48,792 --> 01:35:50,417
It'll be the last time.

861
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:02,625
Who fired? You bastard!

862
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:08,708
It came from over there!
Drop it you bastard!

863
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,625
Drop your gun!
Don't move!

864
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:12,792
Raise your hands.

865
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:15,125
In the air!
Don't move!

866
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:20,375
Take it easy.

867
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:04,250
Look along here.

868
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:06,167
That's it, thanks.

869
01:37:06,542 --> 01:37:08,500
I'm here.

870
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:10,667
You OK?
Yes, thanks.

871
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:12,208
We've got Maurel.

872
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:16,083
Adrien's body must have gone further.
We'll find it.

873
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,958
You know, Claire...

874
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,500
No better.

875
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:32,833
Maurel's wife's
spilled the beans.

876
01:37:33,083 --> 01:37:35,292
He was doing all the killing
and raping. Not Adrien.

877
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:40,000
She's admitted 8 murders,
but there's others.

878
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:42,500
Without Adrien,
there would have been more.

879
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,167
Go and tell him.

880
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:48,042
And say what?

881
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,208
I lack your woman's intuition.

882
01:37:53,917 --> 01:37:55,000
Thank you, Claire.

883
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,292
I tried to aim for once

884
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,083
Three months later

885
01:38:38,417 --> 01:38:41,125
She's solitary,
but she's hanging in there.

886
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:43,000
She's working better

887
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:44,958
with the speech therapist.

888
01:38:45,208 --> 01:38:46,125
She's happy

889
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,542
when you come to see her.

890
01:38:49,333 --> 01:38:51,792
You told me to tell you
about any mail.

891
01:38:52,917 --> 01:38:53,750
She got a letter.

892
01:38:54,167 --> 01:38:56,042
I have a photocopy.

893
01:38:58,208 --> 01:39:00,250
From Morocco?

894
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:06,542
Just this, no words?

895
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:10,208
No, since she got the letter,

896
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:13,292
she's seemed happier.

897
01:39:14,542 --> 01:39:16,125
Do you know who it's from?

898
01:39:30,542 --> 01:39:31,792
Papa.

899
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,900
