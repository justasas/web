0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:02,296
Sazu489...

1
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,183
Sir?

2
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:05,885
Sir, can you hear me?

3
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:09,486
He's alive!

4
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:11,750
Get your ass back here.
Take some cover.

5
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,688
Don't have time
to take a nap.

6
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,013
The prisoner escaped
before we covered.

7
00:02:16,014 --> 00:02:19,230
I think he took a rifle.
He went over there...

8
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,378
Rifle.

9
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:59,611
Any signs?
-Negative.

10
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:18,845
Starting sequence complete.

11
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:22,557
Clea 19, on line.
Hello, commander Karza.

12
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,981
Now, Clea, activate
system link.

13
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:28,467
System is link. -You got
guys on line? -Check.

14
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:32,322
Check. -Clea, patch
me in the base.

15
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:34,305
Transmitting.

16
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,413
Alpha base, this is Commander
Karza. Do you copy?

17
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:40,941
Copy, Commander.
This is Alpha base.

18
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:44,004
Prometheus is down.
I repeat, Prometheus is down.

19
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:48,587
We have three survivors
and need immediately instructions.

20
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,293
Without pick in up
the ship's biken.

21
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:53,115
Ship biken is not functional.

22
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:56,205
We need your coordinates.

23
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:59,629
I.T.A. in 10 hours.

24
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,276
All alive need to activate
your personal biken.

25
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:06,339
Copy that. -What is the
status of your cargo?

26
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:10,436
Cargo has survived
and left crash side.

27
00:04:10,437 --> 00:04:12,520
Commander, mission
parameter is remaining.

28
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,859
Organism must be delivered.

29
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,947
And Karzo, it imperative
that you bring him alive.

30
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:20,350
Is that understood?

31
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,049
Commander, do you copy?

32
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:27,216
Yeah, roger that.
Karzo out.

33
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:30,476
End transmission.
-Thanks for the help.

34
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:32,639
What else is new?
-Enough.

35
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,167
This mission has been
joke from the start.

36
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:37,129
You think that is joke that
we lost our ship and our crew?

37
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,225
Your prisoner brought my
men down single handed.

38
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:42,276
And you couldn't do it
damn thing to stop it.

39
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:47,329
I don't see anything funny
about that. Do you soldier?

40
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,884
No, sir.
-Good.

41
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:52,637
Now, Clea, speak with
the Lieutenant.

42
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:55,915
Hello, Centauri 7.
Oh, you are hurt.

43
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,637
Yeah, give me diagnostic.

44
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,877
Serious some stenches trauma
to your left shoulder.

45
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:06,564
No broken bones.
Heart beat is elevated.

46
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:09,567
Otherwise you should be
in excellent condition.

47
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:11,471
Clea, skip
trace improvement.

48
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,960
Activating tracking system.

49
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:18,076
Redirecting cells to repairing
nerve and tissue damage.

50
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:20,119
Increasing endorphins
to counter pain.

51
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,109
Better.

52
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,416
The subject is 250 meters
southeast from your position

53
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,266
and moving away
as steady range.

54
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:33,724
Are you sure
he's moving away?

55
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:36,970
Yes, Commander.
-We on the move and set out.

56
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,660
We need supplies.

57
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:42,295
How much left?
-We'll take Logan's pack.

58
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:49,487
Clea, any idea
where we are?

59
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:51,341
Planet is on charged.

60
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:54,976
Computer shows you on
unknown set of coordinates.

61
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:57,836
Gravity to that
planet is the rest.

62
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:58,837
Give us the status.

63
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,385
Atmosphere is tin.

64
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,241
Likely surrenders have
been unconscious.

65
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,429
My advice, keeping
your helmets on it

66
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,934
to until I finished
activating your bodies.

67
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:09,392
Surface's temperature
is 116 degrees. -Nice.

68
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:11,668
Going cells are
in 72 percent,

69
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,304
which can last just
about 100 hours.

70
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:15,827
Anything else?

71
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:17,703
Calculating the
position of the sun.

72
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:20,907
I estimated 34
hours of day light

73
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:21,908
with 5 hours of night.

74
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,243
Sound like a paradise.
Maybe I'll move here.

75
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:28,875
I can't wait on that.

76
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:32,215
I'm sure you could, sir.

77
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:46,122
According to Clea, it will be
mess to get this thing.

78
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:49,047
Let's move out.

79
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,910
Clea, give me a torch.

80
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:15,275
What you'll gonna do?

81
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:18,613
Weld it act together?

82
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:34,054
He's on the move
again. Let's go.

83
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,905
On your feet.

84
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,655
This is brutal.

85
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:42,432
I don't understand
how those thing

86
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,919
can move so fast
on this heat. -Simple.

87
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,139
If he wants to live,
pure survival instinct.

88
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,920
What's the rush?
He gets no food, no water.

89
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,560
We can track every
move he makes.

90
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,446
Let him die first.

91
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,009
There no be a
needs to recovery.

92
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,138
You heard them.
They want it alive.

93
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,833
Why? -Is not your place to
question orders, Lieutenant.

94
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,884
It is when accosting me
the lifes of my men.

95
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:07,761
This should be a simple
transport mission.

96
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:10,531
Are you done crying, soldier?

97
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:13,301
Get lost.

98
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:19,611
May it up and move out.

99
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:22,287
Both of you.

100
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:48,114
Closing in on subject.
Sublimate press air increasing.

101
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,977
There!

102
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,770
Where is it?

103
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,394
Up on the ridge.
8 o'clock.

104
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:08,073
Look like we can get up
on a north side.

105
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:11,195
Grab his rifle.
I will cover you.

106
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:13,913
Go!

107
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:23,519
I see it.
-Shut him.

108
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,158
It won't alive.

109
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,816
I'm in command now.
Take it down.

110
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:33,689
Target lock.
-Take the shoot.

111
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,251
Down.

112
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:39,460
Hold the position.

113
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:41,550
It's secure.
I got it.

114
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,635
I said hold position.
I coming up.

115
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,867
It's nothing here
but his cloak.

116
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:57,472
Fall back!
Fall back!

117
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,521
Clea?

118
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:24,809
Clea?

119
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:55,978
I thought you are dead.
-You are not that lucky.

120
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,086
Where is my rifle?

121
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,916
Ask Tursai.

122
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,172
Night is falling.

123
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:04,368
Let's the place
to set up camp.

124
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,723
Hard to take the ground.
Only to access points.

125
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:09,312
I still can catch him.

126
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:11,324
If you need the rest,
you stay here and I'll...

127
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,018
Why do you think
that I want to hear

128
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,084
your opinion soldier?
I don't.

129
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,978
He was to green. He would
never set in any unit.

130
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,772
He wasn't the one
who rush us into the ambush.

131
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:27,545
The situation that determine
outcome, Lieutenant.

132
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:29,415
Components
and the skill do.

133
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,648
Unfortunately, your team
wasn't good enough for those trick.

134
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,003
Now, make
yourself useful

135
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:38,831
and set up parameter
around those rocks over there.

136
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,985
You have your orders.

137
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:52,358
43 degrees and dropping.

138
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,544
Private channel's open it.

139
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:07,143
What's the Commander's
condition?

140
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:09,973
He's suffering from a
plasma wound to his side.

141
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,697
Extreme nerve
damage has been

142
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:16,275
sustained on his
left long izenteret.

143
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,398
What meds you got him on?

144
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,223
500 CC sustrofin
and 250 CC for crioksen.

145
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:27,074
Don't surprise he stayed on
his feet as long as he did.

146
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:28,957
Reduce his medication.

147
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,070
We have a long way
to travel tomorrow

148
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:31,734
and I am not to
carry him.

149
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:33,293
I'm not sure if
Commander Karzo

150
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:35,202
would agree with
your assessment.

151
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,605
Keep the information on fly.

152
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:38,249
He doesn't need to know.

153
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,153
It is not in my programming
to lie, Lieutenant.

154
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:44,199
You want be lying,
you just not share information.

155
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,859
Can you do that?
-Of, course.

156
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,525
Thanks.

157
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,947
Odd.
-What's that?

158
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:53,418
You have been from all the soldier
that I have been a signed to

159
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:56,980
you are the only one
that's he ever thank me.

160
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:59,178
Do you mind it?
-No.

161
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:00,690
I quite preferred.

162
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:04,450
Isn't get tirelessness been
endless it worried about.

163
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:07,339
We have in
common then.

164
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,331
You must work compliant
with the military directed, Centauri.

165
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:13,234
So, I been told.

166
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,446
According to your record

167
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:18,619
some of yours
previous inseportinations

168
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,930
border it dangerously
close to treason. -And?

169
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,084
It's a question, why you
chosen to be a soldier?

170
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:30,809
It is does, doesn't it?

171
00:17:56,926 --> 00:18:02,326
Atmosphere conditioning will
be completed in 10 seconds.

172
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:06,222
I advise you to keep yours
eyes more on objective

173
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:09,544
instead of me, Lieutenant.

174
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,036
Atmospheric adaptation
is complete.

175
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:16,635
It is now safe to
remove your helmets.

176
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,595
Why is the prisoner
not effected on tin air?

177
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,497
He doesn't
wear the life suit.

178
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,724
They can adapt to
almost any conditions.

179
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:33,297
All this was in the file.

180
00:18:35,552 --> 00:18:36,815
Permission to
speak freely, sir?

181
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,752
Permission?
It never stop you before.

182
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,390
Go ahead.

183
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:43,553
What's the special really?

184
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:44,835
Why is that thing
so important?

185
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:47,254
Does it matter?
-Yes, it does.

186
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:50,145
Why? -I lost my ship
and my crew.

187
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:52,131
I would like to know why.
-You are a soldier.

188
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,008
We both are.
We follow orders

189
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,002
without questions.

190
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:04,920
Tell me what you know

191
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,495
otherwise I go alone.

192
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:09,864
Disobey orders is
a treason, soldier.

193
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:12,565
Punishment by death.

194
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:30,487
All right. This thing is
the last of his kind.

195
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,021
We destroyed
his home world

196
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,183
and now somehow figure
we return the favor.

197
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:36,581
So, we'll catch it that thing
and get it back to the base.

198
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:39,286
We made a world
to go home too.

199
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,262
Now you know
what's I do.

200
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,492
Is that you make
feel better, soldier?

201
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:46,771
Sit down and discuss when some
wild thing is around on us.

202
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:49,223
You delivery to kept
us in the dark.

203
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,879
You did need to know.
-I see.

204
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,275
This mission
was a hero maker.

205
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,776
Everything we know
was at risk.

206
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:59,939
Are you deaf
as you stupid?

207
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:02,009
What level was
this mission?

208
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,446
This discussion is over.

209
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:07,420
What level was
this mission, sir?

210
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:11,601
41. Nobel class.
-Highest level.

211
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:13,448
And you was so
with your ego

212
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:16,144
you didn't badger to tell us
how danger the creature was.

213
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,173
Your men were
incompetent.

214
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:20,139
Don't blame me
for your mistakes.

215
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,970
You jeopardized this mission.

216
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,735
You got my verscio.

217
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm your superior officer

218
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,208
and you speak
to me as such.

219
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,726
Why?

220
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,817
You don't deserve it.

221
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:55,287
Let's see what
fight you got in.

222
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:59,401
You are no worth it.

223
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,827
Clea? What's the
present position?

224
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:34,899
I had no visual.

225
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,680
Clea?

226
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,755
Clea?

227
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:17,407
Come on.

228
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:28,004
Come on, baby.

229
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:30,237
Don't live me alone now.

230
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:32,537
Starting sequence complete.

231
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:36,635
Clea 19 on line.
Hello, Centauri 7.

232
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:37,636
Clea.

233
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:39,840
I thought I lost you there.
-You cant to get rid of

234
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:41,083
me so easily, Centauri.

235
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:44,028
I suffered some damage but
seems to be function in properly.

236
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,865
I'm quite adorable,
you know.

237
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,422
That's why keep
you out, babe.

238
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:52,085
I thought that was my
charming personality.

239
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,444
Clea. What's the
prison location?

240
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,932
78 and increasing.

241
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:11,991
Look likes just
you and me now.

242
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:14,149
I'm sorry about
Commander Karza

243
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,060
but if I must
say I'm pleased

244
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,821
that it was you
who survived.

245
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,947
Well, that makes two of us.

246
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:33,679
Keep trace prisoner.

247
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,375
200 microcliks on
your current location.

248
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:40,181
Continuing in south
eastern direction.

249
00:23:40,182 --> 00:23:42,764
On the move again.

250
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:54,218
I hope you'll rot, sir.

251
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,145
It's been moving on a
steady pace for hours.

252
00:25:12,146 --> 00:25:15,126
Hopefully the damn
things collapse it.

253
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:18,420
Without the water source it could
be coming to dehydration.

254
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:21,155
Exactly.

255
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,353
Still...

256
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:28,675
I'm going in.

257
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:33,353
Report me any movement.
-Of course.

258
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,307
Be careful, Centauri.

259
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,673
I get it.

260
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,314
Clea, my grid?

261
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,265
What is it, Centauri?

262
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:01,260
It's the tracking device.

263
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:03,920
Tear out from it's
own throat.

264
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,109
Very clever.

265
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,137
He can't go far.

266
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:10,288
He cannot brag.

267
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:12,278
Do you hear me?

268
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:17,596
I bringing you in.

269
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,772
Dead or alive.

270
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:39,050
Centauri?
Are you all right?

271
00:27:42,402 --> 00:27:46,064
Centauri 7?
Please answer.

272
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:06,366
Clea?

273
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:08,305
Which the time would be?

274
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:11,005
How long I have been out?

275
00:31:11,844 --> 00:31:14,849
Clea?

276
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:06,602
The head.

277
00:34:06,603 --> 00:34:11,536
I had to kick the head.

278
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:56,739
Pull on that.

279
00:36:14,497 --> 00:36:15,925
Hello?

280
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:19,080
Unknown user,
please identify.

281
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:22,633
Repeat, identify.

282
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:25,297
Identify.

283
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:27,026
Horn Jericho.

284
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:31,336
Un authorized user.
Terminating access.

285
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:06,578
Private channel,
open it. -Clea?

286
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:10,037
Where are you?
-I'm not sure.

287
00:37:10,537 --> 00:37:13,867
I'm in the possession
un authorized user.

288
00:37:16,105 --> 00:37:20,694
Can you give me a signal
of his location? -Of course.

289
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:27,739
Got it.

290
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,276
He tried to access me

291
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:31,652
but I terminated
the communication.

292
00:37:31,653 --> 00:37:33,731
It's spoke to you?
-Yes.

293
00:37:33,732 --> 00:37:35,636
And it's understood you.
-Yes.

294
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:37,727
This damn thing is more
smart then I thought.

295
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:39,523
Keep that signal going.
Still on the private channel.

296
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,680
I'm on my way.

297
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,535
Clea?

298
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:37,735
Clea?

299
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:40,178
She won't be helping
you anymore.

300
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:46,051
We can't get out from
this planet without her.

301
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:51,610
How I do use her?
-You can't.

302
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:55,010
And if you have her

303
00:38:55,098 --> 00:38:58,020
you still be stuck on this
flooring rock as well.

304
00:38:58,021 --> 00:38:59,503
You get no way to go.

305
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,965
Maybe I not
plan on go anywhere.

306
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:06,542
If you want a die

307
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:10,105
kill yourself now and
save me the trouble.

308
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:12,795
What if I want to
take you with me?

309
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:17,084
You do then done already.

310
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:20,578
You are not dumb
as you look.

311
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:23,577
What's it you want?

312
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,767
I know you
can still hear me.

313
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:36,695
You are playing games?

314
00:39:36,696 --> 00:39:39,234
Well, here is mine.

315
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:42,002
I know why they
want you brought in.

316
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:45,318
And I don't care.

317
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:49,521
I'm gonna hunt you down
and I wanna kill you.

318
00:39:49,936 --> 00:39:52,808
That's my game.

319
00:42:35,272 --> 00:42:37,768
Give up, Sedonian.

320
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:40,739
You will never catch me.

321
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:46,186
You been out smart
enough to run.

322
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:54,368
Go home.

323
00:42:55,102 --> 00:42:58,441
Why you still got a
home to go back to.

324
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:03,701
I know something new
I hate about your race.

325
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:07,404
You packed not enough water.

326
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:11,524
Because that's more
human thing.

327
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:14,562
Always be prepare it.

328
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,414
I'm actually surprise you
last as long you have.

329
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:23,986
Seem how incompetent you are.

330
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,171
Now I know why they put
that helmet mask on you.

331
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:30,396
You talk too much.

332
00:46:30,575 --> 00:46:33,330
They you want to know
if I can speak your language.

333
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:35,398
You are right.

334
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:37,473
It's a good for
somebody like you

335
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:39,037
to speak the language
of the stars.

336
00:46:39,038 --> 00:46:41,784
Something we pick it
up from the Draks.

337
00:46:45,191 --> 00:46:48,037
Draks are noble race.

338
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,602
You don't know
anything about that.

339
00:46:49,603 --> 00:46:50,666
Nobel?

340
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:54,058
They are disease on a
galaxy, filthy creatures.

341
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:55,815
That's funny.

342
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:58,456
They say the same
thing about you.

343
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:01,582
Lying bugs.

344
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:03,776
I tell you this

345
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:06,337
no one miss you guys
when you gone.

346
00:47:06,506 --> 00:47:09,725
Your the race is in extinct,
human, not mine.

347
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,241
Not so long.

348
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:13,495
Is that so?
-Yap.

349
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:15,941
I taken yours to hell.

350
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,315
I hold your fenecy, human.

351
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:21,425
Been that you
last of your kind

352
00:47:21,426 --> 00:47:23,590
how do you hope to
accomplish this remarkable fit?

353
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,825
Don't you know why?
-I don't care.

354
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:27,692
That's why.

355
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:29,821
You want this war
on your advent

356
00:47:29,822 --> 00:47:31,498
and lost your home world.

357
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:34,264
Those the consequence.
-We didn't enter this war.

358
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:35,393
You attacked us.

359
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,044
You were harboring Draks fugitives.
-You mean refugees.

360
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:40,518
Big difference.
They need our help.

361
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:42,719
You choose the wrong side.

362
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,713
No.

363
00:47:44,714 --> 00:47:47,414
It's cost us everything
but we chose the right side.

364
00:47:47,415 --> 00:47:51,374
Now, it's gonna cost
you everything.

365
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,317
We all die.
That's your solution.

366
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:57,758
How can you
been so naive?

367
00:47:57,759 --> 00:47:59,953
Another pack will
ride on our place.

368
00:47:59,954 --> 00:48:01,661
An endless cycle.

369
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:03,664
The only way to brake it

370
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:06,195
is to take control from
those with power

371
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:09,318
to rule them instead.

372
00:48:10,218 --> 00:48:12,576
You thought about this?
-No.

373
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:15,717
It's the way it is.

374
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:19,664
Maybe you are right.

375
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:24,429
Human.

376
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,212
You have two options.

377
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:28,317
You can come with
me and survive

378
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,421
or you can join to the rest
of your race in oblivion.

379
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:33,570
It's your decision.

380
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:35,844
I'd choose option
number three.

381
00:48:35,845 --> 00:48:38,058
What is what?

382
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:05,942
Clea?

383
00:50:06,217 --> 00:50:08,252
Clea? Are you there?

384
00:50:08,253 --> 00:50:10,989
Centauri 7?
-Yeah, it's me.

385
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,007
Has the human
then recaptured? -No.

386
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:16,543
Then have you
do retrieve me?

387
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:18,870
Radio sit it
on the skeleton.

388
00:50:18,871 --> 00:50:20,908
Why he live it behind?

389
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:25,127
Odd, that creature
is kind it dangerously so.

390
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:26,870
Like he figured something else.

391
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:29,520
But what is he doing?

392
00:50:29,521 --> 00:50:31,679
I missing something.

393
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,464
I wonder...
-Wonder what?

394
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,341
Clea?

395
00:50:36,342 --> 00:50:39,325
Centauri, I may know
what the human is doing.

396
00:50:39,326 --> 00:50:40,911
Great, tell me.

397
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:44,119
It would be better
if I didn't. -Why is that?

398
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,583
If you know it might
influence your actions.

399
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:49,065
I don't...
What?

400
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:52,644
Do you trust me, Centauri?
-With my life.

401
00:50:52,645 --> 00:50:55,831
And here I do
need you to do.

402
00:51:04,948 --> 00:51:07,270
We may have
another problem.

403
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:10,408
What now?
-I think my forward

404
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:12,458
Commander Karza did more
damage to my entire circle

405
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:14,586
then I first thought.

406
00:51:14,587 --> 00:51:16,941
What you mean?
-My battery isn't holding

407
00:51:16,942 --> 00:51:18,857
the power cells
charge very well.

408
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:20,831
I'm not going to be able
to conserve enough power

409
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:23,702
to activate your biken when the
rescue mission will arrive.

410
00:51:23,703 --> 00:51:26,278
Shut down the other system
restraining power.

411
00:51:26,279 --> 00:51:29,589
I have but two main resources
left from my system’s memory

412
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,637
and your medical unit I'm
afraid you have to shutting down

413
00:51:32,638 --> 00:51:34,571
to until you'll
need me, Centauri.

414
00:51:34,572 --> 00:51:36,199
That's not happened.

415
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:37,761
Cut my meds.

416
00:51:38,072 --> 00:51:40,747
I don't think that
is a good idea.

417
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:42,251
Cut them.

418
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:45,659
Meds unit is shutting down.

419
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:49,800
Your pain receptor
the spank in

420
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:53,309
and your heart break
is increasing. -I'm good.

421
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,456
Meds should give
us enough power

422
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:58,274
provided when will ship
arrived for designated time.

423
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:01,520
With little luck
I'll get on him.

424
00:52:38,064 --> 00:52:41,754
I picking a communications
from orbit. -Our pick up?

425
00:52:41,755 --> 00:52:44,098
No, this is art
military channel

426
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,916
and unknown craft
is approaching.

427
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:48,324
They could come
down here? -Yes.

428
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:50,507
But my system can
track it.

429
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:53,627
Try raise them.

430
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,657
No respond.

431
00:52:56,658 --> 00:52:58,919
They got it to
the radio silence.

432
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,512
It can't be good.

433
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:04,005
Maybe some randeu
wous with the human.

434
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:05,798
Maybe is not the last one.

435
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:09,354
Or they could be Draks.

436
00:56:22,353 --> 00:56:24,977
Great.

437
00:56:46,192 --> 00:56:48,434
Hey!

438
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:56,286
What?

439
00:57:01,808 --> 00:57:03,246
What?

440
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:11,378
Money?

441
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,308
Sadonians?

442
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:15,737
They are paying you.

443
00:57:15,738 --> 00:57:18,111
You are bounty hunter.

444
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:21,564
That is such an ugly word.

445
00:57:21,565 --> 00:57:25,896
Soldier of fortune
more like it.

446
00:57:26,304 --> 00:57:29,753
They want you been alive, ha?

447
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:35,219
Just as I thought.
Slyeck.

448
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:37,348
What would the Slyeck
be doing here?

449
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:38,778
Bounty hunter.

450
00:57:38,779 --> 00:57:41,236
Alpha base must he send
him like a back up.

451
00:57:41,237 --> 00:57:42,095
It is.

452
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:45,313
Alpha base or
the Slyeck? -Both.

453
00:57:45,314 --> 00:57:46,697
What you going to do?

454
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:48,581
He's got my weapons
and my prisoner.

455
00:57:48,582 --> 00:57:51,427
I gonna go get them back.

456
00:57:56,952 --> 00:58:00,282
True your kind will
world wound?

457
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:02,697
Maybe.

458
00:58:03,661 --> 00:58:06,736
True or lie?

459
00:58:08,214 --> 00:58:10,094
True.

460
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,345
Deserve it they do.

461
00:58:12,346 --> 00:58:15,484
Scare them good you do, a?

462
00:58:15,644 --> 00:58:20,178
You like Sadonians?
-No one like Sadonians.

463
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:24,567
The way where we
planet make slaves.

464
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:27,826
There way or no way.

465
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:42,258
If I kill you
they all die.

466
00:58:42,259 --> 00:58:47,075
No more Sadonians.
-Wait. Remember?

467
00:58:47,076 --> 00:58:48,076
I'm money.

468
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:51,147
You kill me, no money.

469
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:56,349
Maybe I'll take you
to the ship first.

470
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:59,393
Talk with elders.

471
00:58:59,394 --> 00:59:02,622
Good idea.
Smart.

472
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:06,729
No! Fuck that money.
I'll be hero.

473
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,623
No more Sadonians.
-No, wait.

474
00:59:32,673 --> 00:59:35,267
You have your
business here, Slyeck?

475
00:59:39,128 --> 00:59:41,157
That human is my prisoner.

476
00:59:46,268 --> 00:59:48,683
He's mine.

477
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,629
I don't think so.

478
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:39,201
Now what?

479
01:01:39,202 --> 01:01:40,669
We wait.

480
01:01:41,859 --> 01:01:43,346
On what?

481
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:45,739
Extraction.

482
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:47,866
Ship should be here soon.

483
01:01:53,681 --> 01:01:55,831
What did they
call you, human?

484
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,969
What is your name?

485
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:58,970
Jericho.

486
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:00,389
Lieutenant Orn Jericho.

487
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:01,390
Lieutenant?

488
01:02:01,391 --> 01:02:04,094
We are the same right.

489
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,995
I'm Centauri 7.

490
01:02:05,996 --> 01:02:08,320
I didn't ask.

491
01:02:08,702 --> 01:02:10,635
Not wise to upset me

492
01:02:10,636 --> 01:02:12,517
consider on your
position, human.

493
01:02:12,518 --> 01:02:14,921
No wonder your
kind didn't make it.

494
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:17,262
No common sense.
-Was that a reason?

495
01:02:17,263 --> 01:02:19,867
I thought was you
genocide war to did it.

496
01:02:19,868 --> 01:02:22,577
War is war.
You lost.

497
01:02:22,578 --> 01:02:24,513
As long I'm still alive

498
01:02:24,514 --> 01:02:26,821
the war ain't over.

499
01:02:28,516 --> 01:02:31,007
You never did answer
to my question.

500
01:02:32,284 --> 01:02:34,699
How were you going to
destroy my planet?

501
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,700
Are. -What?

502
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:38,372
You said were.
Past tense.

503
01:02:38,373 --> 01:02:39,373
It's are.

504
01:02:39,374 --> 01:02:43,163
All right. How are you going
to destroy my planet?

505
01:02:43,164 --> 01:02:45,130
We sent as ship
towards your planet

506
01:02:45,131 --> 01:02:47,915
feel the capacity
with the filmpejlo.

507
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:49,273
When's the impact

508
01:02:49,274 --> 01:02:52,057
your world is
blowing to dust.

509
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:56,907
How long range will detective
harbor before reaches...

510
01:02:56,908 --> 01:02:58,484
Is clocked.

511
01:02:58,485 --> 01:03:00,322
You will never see it coming.

512
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:06,140
Another trick we pick
it up from the Draks.

513
01:03:09,103 --> 01:03:12,300
So, that's why they
want you alive.

514
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:16,553
They want to get the ship
coordinates out of you. -They'll try.

515
01:03:16,983 --> 01:03:19,292
But you'll die first.

516
01:03:19,293 --> 01:03:21,255
That's right.

517
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,746
Well, no then is no
reason to keep you alive.

518
01:03:23,747 --> 01:03:27,358
I can kill you right now.
-You could.

519
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,215
But?
-Come on.

520
01:03:29,216 --> 01:03:31,283
Everybody wants
to be a hero.

521
01:03:31,284 --> 01:03:32,882
It's a one glimmer hope

522
01:03:32,883 --> 01:03:35,423
that you might be
a savior world.

523
01:03:35,424 --> 01:03:37,356
I told you, I don't care.

524
01:03:37,357 --> 01:03:38,909
They can go to
the twelve hells.

525
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:41,090
I don't believe you.

526
01:03:41,091 --> 01:03:43,920
Centauri, I have
incoming transmission.

527
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:45,674
Patch it through.

528
01:03:45,675 --> 01:03:47,860
Commander Karzo,
this is battle ship Aurora.

529
01:03:47,861 --> 01:03:50,263
Do you copy?
-Copy that Aurora.

530
01:03:50,264 --> 01:03:51,626
Karzo is dead.

531
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:54,400
This is Lieutenant Centauri 7
as acting commander.

532
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:55,863
Copy that, Lieutenant.

533
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:57,578
We'll arrived in the
last known signal point

534
01:03:57,579 --> 01:03:59,975
from Prometheus
before you went down.

535
01:03:59,976 --> 01:04:02,384
We waiting on bipen location.

536
01:04:02,385 --> 01:04:05,162
Clea, activate personal biken.

537
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:09,548
Signal ineshiated.
-Aurora, you have it?

538
01:04:09,549 --> 01:04:13,183
Affirmative. It's weak
but we should be able to find.

539
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:17,107
ITA in 15 minutes.
-Roger that.

540
01:04:17,108 --> 01:04:19,400
Centauri 7 out.

541
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:26,304
When we get back to Sedonia

542
01:04:26,305 --> 01:04:28,815
they gonna torture you.

543
01:04:28,816 --> 01:04:31,436
They will get the
information they want.

544
01:04:31,437 --> 01:04:33,946
You won't last.

545
01:04:33,947 --> 01:04:38,608
The plan we won't be there
by the time we arrived. -That soon?

546
01:04:39,211 --> 01:04:41,275
And all this?

547
01:04:41,276 --> 01:04:43,902
The wild chase to give ship
the time you need it?

548
01:04:43,903 --> 01:04:46,155
Get the long
before we'll do.

549
01:04:47,186 --> 01:04:49,813
Why plans full of people
they are innocent?

550
01:04:49,814 --> 01:04:51,126
They are not
responsible for the war

551
01:04:51,127 --> 01:04:52,789
or your planet
destruction?

552
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:55,710
The high counsel is.
-You all fall of blindly.

553
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:57,184
It's no excuse.
-It's the law.

554
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,140
What's the God
that you creed?

555
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:01,304
Your Gods would telling me
the way to entire world?

556
01:05:01,305 --> 01:05:04,262
No, we split out on different
stars and surrounding races.

557
01:05:04,263 --> 01:05:05,663
By slaving
and destroying now.

558
01:05:05,664 --> 01:05:09,079
They don't accept our
way of life then yes.

559
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,995
You make me sick.

560
01:05:10,996 --> 01:05:14,426
This from the race that couldn't
defend them self get it other.

561
01:05:14,427 --> 01:05:16,256
Let lonely and
beating the army.

562
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:19,189
Only an ignorant species will
make war against own kind.

563
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,190
Shut up!

564
01:05:20,191 --> 01:05:22,501
You command mass murder
on a galactic scale

565
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:23,926
and you think
it's holly crusade.

566
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:25,918
This is a lie!

567
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:27,418
Unless some
come as a long

568
01:05:27,419 --> 01:05:30,196
and takes away
control from you.

569
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:32,583
Your words, not mine.

570
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:34,422
That will never happened.

571
01:05:35,342 --> 01:05:37,663
I wonder why.

572
01:05:53,737 --> 01:05:55,676
You are right.

573
01:05:55,677 --> 01:05:58,714
I do care
about my world.

574
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,680
I have wife
and child there.

575
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,520
I would like to
see them again.

576
01:06:12,908 --> 01:06:15,475
Our women don't fight.

577
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:18,143
They care about
the children.

578
01:06:18,144 --> 01:06:22,440
Our soldiers
are up there.

579
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,876
As one warrior to another

580
01:06:24,877 --> 01:06:29,487
I respectfully ask that you take
this war to those responsible.

581
01:06:33,585 --> 01:06:36,295
You'll just be killing
the women and children.

582
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:41,302
Is that what you want a
legacy of your kind to be?

583
01:06:55,732 --> 01:06:57,950
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

584
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,614
Is that...
-Where the ship is.

585
01:07:02,615 --> 01:07:06,235
Call your people. I'll give
them the coordinates.

586
01:07:06,236 --> 01:07:08,844
You better hurry.
You don't have much time.

587
01:07:08,845 --> 01:07:11,164
Clea? Patch me to
the Alpha base.

588
01:07:11,165 --> 01:07:13,061
Transmitting.

589
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:16,317
Alpha base, this is Lieutenant
Centauri 7. Do you copy?

590
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:18,531
Copy Lieutenant.
What is your status?

591
01:07:18,532 --> 01:07:19,958
The prisoner is in custody

592
01:07:19,959 --> 01:07:22,890
and willing to give
coordinates of the bomb ship.

593
01:07:22,925 --> 01:07:24,762
Lieutenant, we are ready to
get the information.

594
01:07:24,763 --> 01:07:26,930
Please, sent to us
immediately.

595
01:07:26,931 --> 01:07:29,033
What's the
coordinates? -No.

596
01:07:29,034 --> 01:07:32,761
I want to be the
one who tells them.

597
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:38,100
The coordinates are 22...
-Non authorized user.

598
01:07:38,101 --> 01:07:40,592
Clea, authorized the human.

599
01:07:40,593 --> 01:07:42,979
Stage your name.
-Orn Jericho.

600
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,602
Orn Jericho’s now authorized.

601
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:53,056
The coordinates are 22- 9,
7-13, 0-40, 2-6-0.

602
01:07:53,057 --> 01:07:55,379
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

603
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,790
It's an M-class
star frigate.

604
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:07,275
We have confirmation
the ship does identify.

605
01:08:07,276 --> 01:08:11,528
Sending Bell ship to
intercept. -We found it.

606
01:08:12,396 --> 01:08:13,787
Well done, Lieutenant.

607
01:08:13,788 --> 01:08:15,101
We no longer
need the prisoner.

608
01:08:15,102 --> 01:08:17,681
You may terminated
him at will.

609
01:08:17,682 --> 01:08:20,932
Roger that.
Centauri 7 out.

610
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,092
They want me that
terminated you.

611
01:08:32,093 --> 01:08:36,512
I saved your world.
Your family.

612
01:08:38,367 --> 01:08:39,846
Not really.

613
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:42,289
I don't have any
wife and children.

614
01:08:46,264 --> 01:08:49,107
That's good and you won't have
anything to worried about

615
01:08:49,108 --> 01:08:51,449
when your planet
blowing on bits.

616
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:53,715
You didn't think
that I give you

617
01:08:53,716 --> 01:08:55,378
the real coordinates,
did you?

618
01:08:55,379 --> 01:08:56,842
We have confirmation
on the craft.

619
01:08:56,843 --> 01:08:58,758
It's a decoy,
you idiot.

620
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:03,780
No men. There is nothing
but salvage on that ship.

621
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,807
You can't stop this.

622
01:09:11,808 --> 01:09:13,938
It's already over.

623
01:09:21,371 --> 01:09:23,719
Superior race, ha?

624
01:09:24,058 --> 01:09:26,584
I'm giving you
some advice, alien.

625
01:09:27,988 --> 01:09:31,313
Never let your weapon forward
in the hand of your enemy.

626
01:11:18,944 --> 01:11:21,510
I'm gonna let you in
our little secret.

627
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:23,465
We never lunch
the bomb ship.

628
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:24,697
We couldn't.

629
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:27,738
We've no idea
where the Sadonia was.

630
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:31,043
But now that I'm authorized
the access you date a base

631
01:11:31,044 --> 01:11:33,677
she's gonna tell me
everything I need to know.

632
01:11:33,678 --> 01:11:37,118
You think, I forced the crash
your ship by accident?

633
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:38,995
You want it the bomb ship?

634
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,102
I let you right to it.

635
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:47,152
Now, you gonna learn
what's feels like

636
01:11:47,153 --> 01:11:49,830
to be a last of your kind.

637
01:12:07,091 --> 01:12:09,776
You want to know the
different between you and me?

638
01:12:09,777 --> 01:12:13,879
I did have a wife and
son back on the Earth.

639
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:27,644
Centauri 7,
this is the Aurora.

640
01:12:27,645 --> 01:12:29,581
We just clear
out the gate

641
01:12:29,582 --> 01:12:30,582
and enter into the atmosphere.

642
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:34,174
The craft it's on it's
way down. Stand by.

643
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,056
Centauri 7, this is
Commander Chane

644
01:12:57,057 --> 01:12:59,727
in the Aurora.

645
01:12:59,728 --> 01:13:02,649
We are on the ground.

646
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:04,854
What is your status?

647
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:12,823
Centauri 7, you picking
up my transmission?

648
01:13:13,835 --> 01:13:16,859
Centauri 7,
do you copy?

649
01:13:33,982 --> 01:13:36,250
The only one
who made it, ha?

650
01:13:40,557 --> 01:13:42,062
You look like hell.

651
01:13:42,063 --> 01:13:43,789
Must a be the rough one.

652
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:47,474
Get you to the
informative right away.

653
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,575
Clea, upload the
coordinates to the Sedonia

654
01:16:43,576 --> 01:16:46,117
into the ship computer.

655
01:16:47,517 --> 01:16:49,506
Clea.

656
01:16:50,999 --> 01:16:54,555
Clea, I command you
to respond.

657
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:09,376
San of a bitch.

658
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:54,593
Alpha base. This is
on the craft Jewelry size.

659
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:56,788
Commander Chane is
no longer responsive.

660
01:18:04,802 --> 01:18:08,542
Starting sequence
complete. Clea 19.

661
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:11,688
Hello, Centauri 7.
-Hello, Clea.

662
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:13,299
It's good to have you back.

663
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,595
I take you by
my new casing

664
01:18:15,596 --> 01:18:17,425
that you follow
my instructions.

665
01:18:21,017 --> 01:18:24,910
Centauri, I have incoming
transmission for Alpha base.

666
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:27,106
Patch it through.

667
01:18:27,965 --> 01:18:30,593
Lieutenant,
this is Alpha base.

668
01:18:31,604 --> 01:18:34,141
What's going on
now down there?

669
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:35,692
If I were you

670
01:18:35,693 --> 01:18:38,943
I'd be more concerning
what's going on up there.

671
01:18:38,944 --> 01:18:41,021
Centauri 7, you
are on the orders.

672
01:18:41,022 --> 01:18:42,467
What is the status
of the human?

673
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,124
Find another one to
do your dirty work.

674
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:47,295
Centauri 7 out.
End of transmission.

675
01:18:50,905 --> 01:18:52,894
Whatever you
planning to do, Centauri

676
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,491
I suggest you to
do it quickly.

677
01:18:54,492 --> 01:18:56,326
It won't be long before
the human traced

678
01:18:56,327 --> 01:18:58,983
the source of that
signal at the Sedonia.

679
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,710
He already has.

680
01:19:02,711 --> 01:19:05,066
Is not that right.

681
01:19:06,429 --> 01:19:09,111
He didn't kill you. Why?

682
01:19:09,112 --> 01:19:11,037
Same reason you
didn't kill me.

683
01:19:12,325 --> 01:19:15,011
Yeah, what's that?

684
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:18,229
I'll tell you
when I see you.

685
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:26,276
Centauri, how we may suppose
to get out from here?

686
01:19:26,277 --> 01:19:28,523
Another our ship has to pass
be around here somewhere.

687
01:19:28,524 --> 01:19:31,085
You realized we would be
breaking 26 high council's laws

688
01:19:31,086 --> 01:19:33,516
by taking this
course of action.

689
01:19:33,517 --> 01:19:36,404
Is that a problem?
-Not at all.

690
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:39,770
Let's get to twelve
hells off this rock.

691
