1
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,183
Sir?

2
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,885
Sir, can you hear me?

3
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:15,486
He's alive!

4
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:17,750
Get your ass back here.
Take some cover.

5
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:19,688
Don't have time
to take a nap.

6
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:22,013
The prisoner escaped
before we covered.

7
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:25,230
I think he took a rifle.
He went over there...

8
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:45,378
Rifle.

9
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:05,611
Any signs?
-Negative.

10
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,845
Starting sequence complete.

11
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:28,557
Clea 19, on line.
Hello, commander Karza.

12
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,981
Now, Clea, activate
system link.

13
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:34,467
System is link. -You got
guys on line? -Check.

14
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:38,322
Check. -Clea, patch
me in the base.

15
00:03:38,323 --> 00:03:40,305
Transmitting.

16
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,413
Alpha base, this is Commander
Karza. Do you copy?

17
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:46,941
Copy, Commander.
This is Alpha base.

18
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:50,004
Prometheus is down.
I repeat, Prometheus is down.

19
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:54,587
We have three survivors
and need immediately instructions.

20
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,293
Without pick in up
the ship's biken.

21
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:59,115
Ship biken is not functional.

22
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:02,205
We need your coordinates.

23
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:05,629
I.T.A. in 10 hours.

24
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,276
All alive need to activate
your personal biken.

25
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:12,339
Copy that. -What is the
status of your cargo?

26
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:16,436
Cargo has survived
and left crash side.

27
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:18,520
Commander, mission
parameter is remaining.

28
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:20,859
Organism must be delivered.

29
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,947
And Karzo, it imperative
that you bring him alive.

30
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:26,350
Is that understood?

31
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,049
Commander, do you copy?

32
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:33,216
Yeah, roger that.
Karzo out.

33
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:36,476
End transmission.
-Thanks for the help.

34
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,639
What else is new?
-Enough.

35
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,167
This mission has been
joke from the start.

36
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:43,129
You think that is joke that
we lost our ship and our crew?

37
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,225
Your prisoner brought my
men down single handed.

38
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:48,276
And you couldn't do it
damn thing to stop it.

39
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:53,329
I don't see anything funny
about that. Do you soldier?

40
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,884
No, sir.
-Good.

41
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,637
Now, Clea, speak with
the Lieutenant.

42
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:01,915
Hello, Centauri 7.
Oh, you are hurt.

43
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,637
Yeah, give me diagnostic.

44
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:08,877
Serious some stenches trauma
to your left shoulder.

45
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,564
No broken bones.
Heart beat is elevated.

46
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:15,567
Otherwise you should be
in excellent condition.

47
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:17,471
Clea, skip
trace improvement.

48
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:19,960
Activating tracking system.

49
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:24,076
Redirecting cells to repairing
nerve and tissue damage.

50
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:26,119
Increasing endorphins
to counter pain.

51
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,109
Better.

52
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,416
The subject is 250 meters
southeast from your position

53
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,266
and moving away
as steady range.

54
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,724
Are you sure
he's moving away?

55
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:42,970
Yes, Commander.
-We on the move and set out.

56
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,660
We need supplies.

57
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:48,295
How much left?
-We'll take Logan's pack.

58
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:55,487
Clea, any idea
where we are?

59
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,341
Planet is on charged.

60
00:05:57,342 --> 00:06:00,976
Computer shows you on
unknown set of coordinates.

61
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,836
Gravity to that
planet is the rest.

62
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:04,837
Give us the status.

63
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:06,385
Atmosphere is tin.

64
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,241
Likely surrenders have
been unconscious.

65
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,429
My advice, keeping
your helmets on it

66
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,934
to until I finished
activating your bodies.

67
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,392
Surface's temperature
is 116 degrees. -Nice.

68
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:17,668
Going cells are
in 72 percent,

69
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,304
which can last just
about 100 hours.

70
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,827
Anything else?

71
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:23,703
Calculating the
position of the sun.

72
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:26,907
I estimated 34
hours of day light

73
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:27,908
with 5 hours of night.

74
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:31,243
Sound like a paradise.
Maybe I'll move here.

75
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:34,875
I can't wait on that.

76
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:38,215
I'm sure you could, sir.

77
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:52,122
According to Clea, it will be
mess to get this thing.

78
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:55,047
Let's move out.

79
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,910
Clea, give me a torch.

80
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:21,275
What you'll gonna do?

81
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:24,613
Weld it act together?

82
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:40,054
He's on the move
again. Let's go.

83
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,905
On your feet.

84
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:46,655
This is brutal.

85
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,432
I don't understand
how those thing

86
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,919
can move so fast
on this heat. -Simple.

87
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,139
If he wants to live,
pure survival instinct.

88
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,920
What's the rush?
He gets no food, no water.

89
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:58,560
We can track every
move he makes.

90
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,446
Let him die first.

91
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,009
There no be a
needs to recovery.

92
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,138
You heard them.
They want it alive.

93
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:08,833
Why? -Is not your place to
question orders, Lieutenant.

94
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,884
It is when accosting me
the lifes of my men.

95
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,761
This should be a simple
transport mission.

96
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,531
Are you done crying, soldier?

97
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:19,301
Get lost.

98
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:25,611
May it up and move out.

99
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,287
Both of you.

100
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:54,114
Closing in on subject.
Sublimate press air increasing.

101
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,977
There!

102
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,770
Where is it?

103
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:07,394
Up on the ridge.
8 o'clock.

104
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:14,073
Look like we can get up
on a north side.

105
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,195
Grab his rifle.
I will cover you.

106
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:19,913
Go!

107
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:29,519
I see it.
-Shut him.

108
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:31,158
It won't alive.

109
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,816
I'm in command now.
Take it down.

110
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:39,689
Target lock.
-Take the shoot.

111
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,251
Down.

112
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:45,460
Hold the position.

113
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:47,550
It's secure.
I got it.

114
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,635
I said hold position.
I coming up.

115
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,867
It's nothing here
but his cloak.

116
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:03,472
Fall back!
Fall back!

117
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:27,521
Clea?

118
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,809
Clea?

119
00:13:57,624 --> 00:14:01,978
I thought you are dead.
-You are not that lucky.

120
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,086
Where is my rifle?

121
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:06,916
Ask Tursai.

122
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,172
Night is falling.

123
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:10,368
Let's the place
to set up camp.

124
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:13,723
Hard to take the ground.
Only to access points.

125
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:15,312
I still can catch him.

126
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,324
If you need the rest,
you stay here and I'll...

127
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:19,018
Why do you think
that I want to hear

128
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,084
your opinion soldier?
I don't.

129
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,978
He was to green. He would
never set in any unit.

130
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,772
He wasn't the one
who rush us into the ambush.

131
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:33,545
The situation that determine
outcome, Lieutenant.

132
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:35,415
Components
and the skill do.

133
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,648
Unfortunately, your team
wasn't good enough for those trick.

134
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,003
Now, make
yourself useful

135
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:44,831
and set up parameter
around those rocks over there.

136
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,985
You have your orders.

137
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:58,358
43 degrees and dropping.

138
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,544
Private channel's open it.

139
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:13,143
What's the Commander's
condition?

140
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:15,973
He's suffering from a
plasma wound to his side.

141
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,697
Extreme nerve
damage has been

142
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:22,275
sustained on his
left long izenteret.

143
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,398
What meds you got him on?

144
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,223
500 CC sustrofin
and 250 CC for crioksen.

145
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:33,074
Don't surprise he stayed on
his feet as long as he did.

146
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,957
Reduce his medication.

147
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,070
We have a long way
to travel tomorrow

148
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:37,734
and I am not to
carry him.

149
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,293
I'm not sure if
Commander Karzo

150
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,202
would agree with
your assessment.

151
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:42,605
Keep the information on fly.

152
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:44,249
He doesn't need to know.

153
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,153
It is not in my programming
to lie, Lieutenant.

154
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:50,199
You want be lying,
you just not share information.

155
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,859
Can you do that?
-Of, course.

156
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,525
Thanks.

157
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:56,947
Odd.
-What's that?

158
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:59,418
You have been from all the soldier
that I have been a signed to

159
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,980
you are the only one
that's he ever thank me.

160
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,178
Do you mind it?
-No.

161
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:06,690
I quite preferred.

162
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:10,450
Isn't get tirelessness been
endless it worried about.

163
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,339
We have in
common then.

164
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,331
You must work compliant
with the military directed, Centauri.

165
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:19,234
So, I been told.

166
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,446
According to your record

167
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,619
some of yours
previous inseportinations

168
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,930
border it dangerously
close to treason. -And?

169
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,084
It's a question, why you
chosen to be a soldier?

170
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,809
It is does, doesn't it?

171
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:08,326
Atmosphere conditioning will
be completed in 10 seconds.

172
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:12,222
I advise you to keep yours
eyes more on objective

173
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:15,544
instead of me, Lieutenant.

174
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:18,036
Atmospheric adaptation
is complete.

175
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:22,635
It is now safe to
remove your helmets.

176
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,595
Why is the prisoner
not effected on tin air?

177
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,497
He doesn't
wear the life suit.

178
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:36,724
They can adapt to
almost any conditions.

179
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:39,297
All this was in the file.

180
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:42,815
Permission to
speak freely, sir?

181
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:45,752
Permission?
It never stop you before.

182
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,390
Go ahead.

183
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,553
What's the special really?

184
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:50,835
Why is that thing
so important?

185
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:53,254
Does it matter?
-Yes, it does.

186
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:56,145
Why? -I lost my ship
and my crew.

187
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:58,131
I would like to know why.
-You are a soldier.

188
00:18:58,132 --> 00:19:01,008
We both are.
We follow orders

189
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:04,002
without questions.

190
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:10,920
Tell me what you know

191
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:13,495
otherwise I go alone.

192
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:15,864
Disobey orders is
a treason, soldier.

193
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:18,565
Punishment by death.

194
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:36,487
All right. This thing is
the last of his kind.

195
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:38,021
We destroyed
his home world

196
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,183
and now somehow figure
we return the favor.

197
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:42,581
So, we'll catch it that thing
and get it back to the base.

198
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,286
We made a world
to go home too.

199
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,262
Now you know
what's I do.

200
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:49,492
Is that you make
feel better, soldier?

201
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:52,771
Sit down and discuss when some
wild thing is around on us.

202
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:55,223
You delivery to kept
us in the dark.

203
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:57,879
You did need to know.
-I see.

204
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,275
This mission
was a hero maker.

205
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:02,776
Everything we know
was at risk.

206
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:05,939
Are you deaf
as you stupid?

207
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,009
What level was
this mission?

208
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,446
This discussion is over.

209
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:13,420
What level was
this mission, sir?

210
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:17,601
41. Nobel class.
-Highest level.

211
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:19,448
And you was so
with your ego

212
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:22,144
you didn't badger to tell us
how danger the creature was.

213
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,173
Your men were
incompetent.

214
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:26,139
Don't blame me
for your mistakes.

215
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,970
You jeopardized this mission.

216
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:29,735
You got my verscio.

217
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm your superior officer

218
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,208
and you speak
to me as such.

219
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:35,726
Why?

220
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,817
You don't deserve it.

221
00:20:57,018 --> 00:21:01,287
Let's see what
fight you got in.

222
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:05,401
You are no worth it.

223
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,827
Clea? What's the
present position?

224
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:40,899
I had no visual.

225
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,680
Clea?

226
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,755
Clea?

227
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,407
Come on.

228
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:34,004
Come on, baby.

229
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:36,237
Don't live me alone now.

230
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:38,537
Starting sequence complete.

231
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:42,635
Clea 19 on line.
Hello, Centauri 7.

232
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:43,636
Clea.

233
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,840
I thought I lost you there.
-You cant to get rid of

234
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:47,083
me so easily, Centauri.

235
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:50,028
I suffered some damage but
seems to be function in properly.

236
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:52,865
I'm quite adorable,
you know.

237
00:22:52,866 --> 00:22:54,422
That's why keep
you out, babe.

238
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:58,085
I thought that was my
charming personality.

239
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:05,444
Clea. What's the
prison location?

240
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:08,932
78 and increasing.

241
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:17,991
Look likes just
you and me now.

242
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:20,149
I'm sorry about
Commander Karza

243
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,060
but if I must
say I'm pleased

244
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:23,821
that it was you
who survived.

245
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,947
Well, that makes two of us.

246
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:39,679
Keep trace prisoner.

247
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,375
200 microcliks on
your current location.

248
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:46,181
Continuing in south
eastern direction.

249
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:48,764
On the move again.

250
00:23:56,748 --> 00:24:00,218
I hope you'll rot, sir.

251
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,145
It's been moving on a
steady pace for hours.

252
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:21,126
Hopefully the damn
things collapse it.

253
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:24,420
Without the water source it could
be coming to dehydration.

254
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:27,155
Exactly.

255
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,353
Still...

256
00:25:32,354 --> 00:25:34,675
I'm going in.

257
00:25:36,312 --> 00:25:39,353
Report me any movement.
-Of course.

258
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,307
Be careful, Centauri.

259
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,673
I get it.

260
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:03,314
Clea, my grid?

261
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:05,265
What is it, Centauri?

262
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:07,260
It's the tracking device.

263
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:09,920
Tear out from it's
own throat.

264
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:12,109
Very clever.

265
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,137
He can't go far.

266
00:27:14,138 --> 00:27:16,288
He cannot brag.

267
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,278
Do you hear me?

268
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:23,596
I bringing you in.

269
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,772
Dead or alive.

270
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:45,050
Centauri?
Are you all right?

271
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:52,064
Centauri 7?
Please answer.

272
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:12,366
Clea?

273
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,305
Which the time would be?

274
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:17,005
How long I have been out?

275
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:20,849
Clea?

276
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:12,602
The head.

277
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:17,536
I had to kick the head.

278
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:02,739
Pull on that.

279
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:21,925
Hello?

280
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:25,080
Unknown user,
please identify.

281
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:28,633
Repeat, identify.

282
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:31,297
Identify.

283
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:33,026
Horn Jericho.

284
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:37,336
Un authorized user.
Terminating access.

285
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:12,578
Private channel,
open it. -Clea?

286
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:16,037
Where are you?
-I'm not sure.

287
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:19,867
I'm in the possession
un authorized user.

288
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:26,694
Can you give me a signal
of his location? -Of course.

289
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:33,739
Got it.

290
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,276
He tried to access me

291
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:37,652
but I terminated
the communication.

292
00:37:37,653 --> 00:37:39,731
It's spoke to you?
-Yes.

293
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:41,636
And it's understood you.
-Yes.

294
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,727
This damn thing is more
smart then I thought.

295
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,523
Keep that signal going.
Still on the private channel.

296
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:47,680
I'm on my way.

297
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:41,535
Clea?

298
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:43,735
Clea?

299
00:38:43,736 --> 00:38:46,178
She won't be helping
you anymore.

300
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:52,051
We can't get out from
this planet without her.

301
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:57,610
How I do use her?
-You can't.

302
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:01,010
And if you have her

303
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:04,020
you still be stuck on this
flooring rock as well.

304
00:39:04,021 --> 00:39:05,503
You get no way to go.

305
00:39:05,504 --> 00:39:08,965
Maybe I not
plan on go anywhere.

306
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,542
If you want a die

307
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:16,105
kill yourself now and
save me the trouble.

308
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,795
What if I want to
take you with me?

309
00:39:20,182 --> 00:39:23,084
You do then done already.

310
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:26,578
You are not dumb
as you look.

311
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,577
What's it you want?

312
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,767
I know you
can still hear me.

313
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:42,695
You are playing games?

314
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:45,234
Well, here is mine.

315
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:48,002
I know why they
want you brought in.

316
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:51,318
And I don't care.

317
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:55,521
I'm gonna hunt you down
and I wanna kill you.

318
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,808
That's my game.

319
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:43,768
Give up, Sedonian.

320
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,739
You will never catch me.

321
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:52,186
You been out smart
enough to run.

322
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:00,368
Go home.

323
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:04,441
Why you still got a
home to go back to.

324
00:46:06,356 --> 00:46:09,701
I know something new
I hate about your race.

325
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:13,404
You packed not enough water.

326
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:17,524
Because that's more
human thing.

327
00:46:17,654 --> 00:46:20,562
Always be prepare it.

328
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,414
I'm actually surprise you
last as long you have.

329
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:29,986
Seem how incompetent you are.

330
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,171
Now I know why they put
that helmet mask on you.

331
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:36,396
You talk too much.

332
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:39,330
They you want to know
if I can speak your language.

333
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:41,398
You are right.

334
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:43,473
It's a good for
somebody like you

335
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:45,037
to speak the language
of the stars.

336
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:47,784
Something we pick it
up from the Draks.

337
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:54,037
Draks are noble race.

338
00:46:54,038 --> 00:46:55,602
You don't know
anything about that.

339
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:56,666
Nobel?

340
00:46:56,667 --> 00:47:00,058
They are disease on a
galaxy, filthy creatures.

341
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:01,815
That's funny.

342
00:47:01,816 --> 00:47:04,456
They say the same
thing about you.

343
00:47:05,014 --> 00:47:07,582
Lying bugs.

344
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:09,776
I tell you this

345
00:47:09,777 --> 00:47:12,337
no one miss you guys
when you gone.

346
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:15,725
Your the race is in extinct,
human, not mine.

347
00:47:15,726 --> 00:47:17,241
Not so long.

348
00:47:17,242 --> 00:47:19,495
Is that so?
-Yap.

349
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:21,941
I taken yours to hell.

350
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:25,315
I hold your fenecy, human.

351
00:47:25,316 --> 00:47:27,425
Been that you
last of your kind

352
00:47:27,426 --> 00:47:29,590
how do you hope to
accomplish this remarkable fit?

353
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:31,825
Don't you know why?
-I don't care.

354
00:47:31,826 --> 00:47:33,692
That's why.

355
00:47:33,693 --> 00:47:35,821
You want this war
on your advent

356
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:37,498
and lost your home world.

357
00:47:37,499 --> 00:47:40,264
Those the consequence.
-We didn't enter this war.

358
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:41,393
You attacked us.

359
00:47:41,394 --> 00:47:44,044
You were harboring Draks fugitives.
-You mean refugees.

360
00:47:44,045 --> 00:47:46,518
Big difference.
They need our help.

361
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:48,719
You choose the wrong side.

362
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,713
No.

363
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:53,414
It's cost us everything
but we chose the right side.

364
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:57,374
Now, it's gonna cost
you everything.

365
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:01,317
We all die.
That's your solution.

366
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:03,758
How can you
been so naive?

367
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:05,953
Another pack will
ride on our place.

368
00:48:05,954 --> 00:48:07,661
An endless cycle.

369
00:48:07,662 --> 00:48:09,664
The only way to brake it

370
00:48:09,665 --> 00:48:12,195
is to take control from
those with power

371
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:15,318
to rule them instead.

372
00:48:16,218 --> 00:48:18,576
You thought about this?
-No.

373
00:48:18,577 --> 00:48:21,717
It's the way it is.

374
00:48:23,745 --> 00:48:25,664
Maybe you are right.

375
00:48:28,403 --> 00:48:30,429
Human.

376
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,212
You have two options.

377
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:34,317
You can come with
me and survive

378
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,421
or you can join to the rest
of your race in oblivion.

379
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:39,570
It's your decision.

380
00:48:39,571 --> 00:48:41,844
I'd choose option
number three.

381
00:48:41,845 --> 00:48:44,058
What is what?

382
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,942
Clea?

383
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,252
Clea? Are you there?

384
00:50:14,253 --> 00:50:16,989
Centauri 7?
-Yeah, it's me.

385
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,007
Has the human
then recaptured? -No.

386
00:50:20,008 --> 00:50:22,543
Then have you
do retrieve me?

387
00:50:22,544 --> 00:50:24,870
Radio sit it
on the skeleton.

388
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:26,908
Why he live it behind?

389
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:31,127
Odd, that creature
is kind it dangerously so.

390
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,870
Like he figured something else.

391
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:35,520
But what is he doing?

392
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:37,679
I missing something.

393
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,464
I wonder...
-Wonder what?

394
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:42,341
Clea?

395
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:45,325
Centauri, I may know
what the human is doing.

396
00:50:45,326 --> 00:50:46,911
Great, tell me.

397
00:50:46,912 --> 00:50:50,119
It would be better
if I didn't. -Why is that?

398
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,583
If you know it might
influence your actions.

399
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,065
I don't...
What?

400
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:58,644
Do you trust me, Centauri?
-With my life.

401
00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:01,831
And here I do
need you to do.

402
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:13,270
We may have
another problem.

403
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:16,408
What now?
-I think my forward

404
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:18,458
Commander Karza did more
damage to my entire circle

405
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:20,586
then I first thought.

406
00:51:20,587 --> 00:51:22,941
What you mean?
-My battery isn't holding

407
00:51:22,942 --> 00:51:24,857
the power cells
charge very well.

408
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:26,831
I'm not going to be able
to conserve enough power

409
00:51:26,832 --> 00:51:29,702
to activate your biken when the
rescue mission will arrive.

410
00:51:29,703 --> 00:51:32,278
Shut down the other system
restraining power.

411
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:35,589
I have but two main resources
left from my system’s memory

412
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,637
and your medical unit I'm
afraid you have to shutting down

413
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:40,571
to until you'll
need me, Centauri.

414
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:42,199
That's not happened.

415
00:51:42,268 --> 00:51:43,761
Cut my meds.

416
00:51:44,072 --> 00:51:46,747
I don't think that
is a good idea.

417
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:48,251
Cut them.

418
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:51,659
Meds unit is shutting down.

419
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:55,800
Your pain receptor
the spank in

420
00:51:55,801 --> 00:51:59,309
and your heart break
is increasing. -I'm good.

421
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,456
Meds should give
us enough power

422
00:52:01,457 --> 00:52:04,274
provided when will ship
arrived for designated time.

423
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:07,520
With little luck
I'll get on him.

424
00:52:44,064 --> 00:52:47,754
I picking a communications
from orbit. -Our pick up?

425
00:52:47,755 --> 00:52:50,098
No, this is art
military channel

426
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:51,916
and unknown craft
is approaching.

427
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:54,324
They could come
down here? -Yes.

428
00:52:54,325 --> 00:52:56,507
But my system can
track it.

429
00:52:57,603 --> 00:52:59,627
Try raise them.

430
00:53:01,008 --> 00:53:02,657
No respond.

431
00:53:02,658 --> 00:53:04,919
They got it to
the radio silence.

432
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,512
It can't be good.

433
00:53:07,723 --> 00:53:10,005
Maybe some randeu
wous with the human.

434
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,798
Maybe is not the last one.

435
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:15,354
Or they could be Draks.

436
00:56:28,353 --> 00:56:30,977
Great.

437
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:54,434
Hey!

438
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,286
What?

439
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:09,246
What?

440
00:57:15,163 --> 00:57:17,378
Money?

441
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,308
Sadonians?

442
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:21,737
They are paying you.

443
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,111
You are bounty hunter.

444
00:57:24,276 --> 00:57:27,564
That is such an ugly word.

445
00:57:27,565 --> 00:57:31,896
Soldier of fortune
more like it.

446
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:35,753
They want you been alive, ha?

447
00:57:38,323 --> 00:57:41,219
Just as I thought.
Slyeck.

448
00:57:41,427 --> 00:57:43,348
What would the Slyeck
be doing here?

449
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:44,778
Bounty hunter.

450
00:57:44,779 --> 00:57:47,236
Alpha base must he send
him like a back up.

451
00:57:47,237 --> 00:57:48,095
It is.

452
00:57:48,238 --> 00:57:51,313
Alpha base or
the Slyeck? -Both.

453
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:52,697
What you going to do?

454
00:57:52,698 --> 00:57:54,581
He's got my weapons
and my prisoner.

455
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:57,427
I gonna go get them back.

456
00:58:02,952 --> 00:58:06,282
True your kind will
world wound?

457
00:58:06,988 --> 00:58:08,697
Maybe.

458
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:12,736
True or lie?

459
00:58:14,214 --> 00:58:16,094
True.

460
00:58:16,553 --> 00:58:18,345
Deserve it they do.

461
00:58:18,346 --> 00:58:21,484
Scare them good you do, a?

462
00:58:21,644 --> 00:58:26,178
You like Sadonians?
-No one like Sadonians.

463
00:58:26,179 --> 00:58:30,567
The way where we
planet make slaves.

464
00:58:30,566 --> 00:58:33,826
There way or no way.

465
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:48,258
If I kill you
they all die.

466
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:53,075
No more Sadonians.
-Wait. Remember?

467
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:54,076
I'm money.

468
00:58:54,077 --> 00:58:57,147
You kill me, no money.

469
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:02,349
Maybe I'll take you
to the ship first.

470
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:05,393
Talk with elders.

471
00:59:05,394 --> 00:59:08,622
Good idea.
Smart.

472
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,729
No! Fuck that money.
I'll be hero.

473
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:15,623
No more Sadonians.
-No, wait.

474
00:59:38,673 --> 00:59:41,267
You have your
business here, Slyeck?

475
00:59:45,128 --> 00:59:47,157
That human is my prisoner.

476
00:59:52,268 --> 00:59:54,683
He's mine.

477
01:00:20,143 --> 01:00:22,629
I don't think so.

478
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:45,201
Now what?

479
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,669
We wait.

480
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:49,346
On what?

481
01:01:49,385 --> 01:01:51,739
Extraction.

482
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,866
Ship should be here soon.

483
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:01,831
What did they
call you, human?

484
01:02:01,912 --> 01:02:03,969
What is your name?

485
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:04,970
Jericho.

486
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,389
Lieutenant Orn Jericho.

487
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,390
Lieutenant?

488
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:10,094
We are the same right.

489
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:11,995
I'm Centauri 7.

490
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:14,320
I didn't ask.

491
01:02:14,702 --> 01:02:16,635
Not wise to upset me

492
01:02:16,636 --> 01:02:18,517
consider on your
position, human.

493
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:20,921
No wonder your
kind didn't make it.

494
01:02:20,922 --> 01:02:23,262
No common sense.
-Was that a reason?

495
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:25,867
I thought was you
genocide war to did it.

496
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:28,577
War is war.
You lost.

497
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,513
As long I'm still alive

498
01:02:30,514 --> 01:02:32,821
the war ain't over.

499
01:02:34,516 --> 01:02:37,007
You never did answer
to my question.

500
01:02:38,284 --> 01:02:40,699
How were you going to
destroy my planet?

501
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,700
Are. -What?

502
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:44,372
You said were.
Past tense.

503
01:02:44,373 --> 01:02:45,373
It's are.

504
01:02:45,374 --> 01:02:49,163
All right. How are you going
to destroy my planet?

505
01:02:49,164 --> 01:02:51,130
We sent as ship
towards your planet

506
01:02:51,131 --> 01:02:53,915
feel the capacity
with the filmpejlo.

507
01:02:53,785 --> 01:02:55,273
When's the impact

508
01:02:55,274 --> 01:02:58,057
your world is
blowing to dust.

509
01:03:00,335 --> 01:03:02,907
How long range will detective
harbor before reaches...

510
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:04,484
Is clocked.

511
01:03:04,485 --> 01:03:06,322
You will never see it coming.

512
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:12,140
Another trick we pick
it up from the Draks.

513
01:03:15,103 --> 01:03:18,300
So, that's why they
want you alive.

514
01:03:18,902 --> 01:03:22,553
They want to get the ship
coordinates out of you. -They'll try.

515
01:03:22,983 --> 01:03:25,292
But you'll die first.

516
01:03:25,293 --> 01:03:27,255
That's right.

517
01:03:27,256 --> 01:03:29,746
Well, no then is no
reason to keep you alive.

518
01:03:29,747 --> 01:03:33,358
I can kill you right now.
-You could.

519
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,215
But?
-Come on.

520
01:03:35,216 --> 01:03:37,283
Everybody wants
to be a hero.

521
01:03:37,284 --> 01:03:38,882
It's a one glimmer hope

522
01:03:38,883 --> 01:03:41,423
that you might be
a savior world.

523
01:03:41,424 --> 01:03:43,356
I told you, I don't care.

524
01:03:43,357 --> 01:03:44,909
They can go to
the twelve hells.

525
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,090
I don't believe you.

526
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:49,920
Centauri, I have
incoming transmission.

527
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:51,674
Patch it through.

528
01:03:51,675 --> 01:03:53,860
Commander Karzo,
this is battle ship Aurora.

529
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:56,263
Do you copy?
-Copy that Aurora.

530
01:03:56,264 --> 01:03:57,626
Karzo is dead.

531
01:03:57,627 --> 01:04:00,400
This is Lieutenant Centauri 7
as acting commander.

532
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:01,863
Copy that, Lieutenant.

533
01:04:01,864 --> 01:04:03,578
We'll arrived in the
last known signal point

534
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:05,975
from Prometheus
before you went down.

535
01:04:05,976 --> 01:04:08,384
We waiting on bipen location.

536
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:11,162
Clea, activate personal biken.

537
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:15,548
Signal ineshiated.
-Aurora, you have it?

538
01:04:15,549 --> 01:04:19,183
Affirmative. It's weak
but we should be able to find.

539
01:04:19,984 --> 01:04:23,107
ITA in 15 minutes.
-Roger that.

540
01:04:23,108 --> 01:04:25,400
Centauri 7 out.

541
01:04:29,443 --> 01:04:32,304
When we get back to Sedonia

542
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:34,815
they gonna torture you.

543
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:37,436
They will get the
information they want.

544
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:39,946
You won't last.

545
01:04:39,947 --> 01:04:44,608
The plan we won't be there
by the time we arrived. -That soon?

546
01:04:45,211 --> 01:04:47,275
And all this?

547
01:04:47,276 --> 01:04:49,902
The wild chase to give ship
the time you need it?

548
01:04:49,903 --> 01:04:52,155
Get the long
before we'll do.

549
01:04:53,186 --> 01:04:55,813
Why plans full of people
they are innocent?

550
01:04:55,814 --> 01:04:57,126
They are not
responsible for the war

551
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,789
or your planet
destruction?

552
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:01,710
The high counsel is.
-You all fall of blindly.

553
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:03,184
It's no excuse.
-It's the law.

554
01:05:03,185 --> 01:05:05,140
What's the God
that you creed?

555
01:05:05,141 --> 01:05:07,304
Your Gods would telling me
the way to entire world?

556
01:05:07,305 --> 01:05:10,262
No, we split out on different
stars and surrounding races.

557
01:05:10,263 --> 01:05:11,663
By slaving
and destroying now.

558
01:05:11,664 --> 01:05:15,079
They don't accept our
way of life then yes.

559
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,995
You make me sick.

560
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:20,426
This from the race that couldn't
defend them self get it other.

561
01:05:20,427 --> 01:05:22,256
Let lonely and
beating the army.

562
01:05:22,257 --> 01:05:25,189
Only an ignorant species will
make war against own kind.

563
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:26,190
Shut up!

564
01:05:26,191 --> 01:05:28,501
You command mass murder
on a galactic scale

565
01:05:28,502 --> 01:05:29,926
and you think
it's holly crusade.

566
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,918
This is a lie!

567
01:05:31,919 --> 01:05:33,418
Unless some
come as a long

568
01:05:33,419 --> 01:05:36,196
and takes away
control from you.

569
01:05:36,197 --> 01:05:38,583
Your words, not mine.

570
01:05:38,584 --> 01:05:40,422
That will never happened.

571
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:43,663
I wonder why.

572
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:01,676
You are right.

573
01:06:01,677 --> 01:06:04,714
I do care
about my world.

574
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,680
I have wife
and child there.

575
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,520
I would like to
see them again.

576
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,475
Our women don't fight.

577
01:06:21,476 --> 01:06:24,143
They care about
the children.

578
01:06:24,144 --> 01:06:28,440
Our soldiers
are up there.

579
01:06:28,441 --> 01:06:30,876
As one warrior to another

580
01:06:30,877 --> 01:06:35,487
I respectfully ask that you take
this war to those responsible.

581
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:42,295
You'll just be killing
the women and children.

582
01:06:42,296 --> 01:06:47,302
Is that what you want a
legacy of your kind to be?

583
01:07:01,732 --> 01:07:03,950
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

584
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:08,614
Is that...
-Where the ship is.

585
01:07:08,615 --> 01:07:12,235
Call your people. I'll give
them the coordinates.

586
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,844
You better hurry.
You don't have much time.

587
01:07:14,845 --> 01:07:17,164
Clea? Patch me to
the Alpha base.

588
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:19,061
Transmitting.

589
01:07:19,062 --> 01:07:22,317
Alpha base, this is Lieutenant
Centauri 7. Do you copy?

590
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:24,531
Copy Lieutenant.
What is your status?

591
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:25,958
The prisoner is in custody

592
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,890
and willing to give
coordinates of the bomb ship.

593
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:30,762
Lieutenant, we are ready to
get the information.

594
01:07:30,763 --> 01:07:32,930
Please, sent to us
immediately.

595
01:07:32,931 --> 01:07:35,033
What's the
coordinates? -No.

596
01:07:35,034 --> 01:07:38,761
I want to be the
one who tells them.

597
01:07:40,638 --> 01:07:44,100
The coordinates are 22...
-Non authorized user.

598
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,592
Clea, authorized the human.

599
01:07:46,593 --> 01:07:48,979
Stage your name.
-Orn Jericho.

600
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,602
Orn Jericho’s now authorized.

601
01:07:51,603 --> 01:07:59,056
The coordinates are 22- 9,
7-13, 0-40, 2-6-0.

602
01:07:59,057 --> 01:08:01,379
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

603
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,790
It's an M-class
star frigate.

604
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,275
We have confirmation
the ship does identify.

605
01:08:13,276 --> 01:08:17,528
Sending Bell ship to
intercept. -We found it.

606
01:08:18,396 --> 01:08:19,787
Well done, Lieutenant.

607
01:08:19,788 --> 01:08:21,101
We no longer
need the prisoner.

608
01:08:21,102 --> 01:08:23,681
You may terminated
him at will.

609
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,932
Roger that.
Centauri 7 out.

610
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,092
They want me that
terminated you.

611
01:08:38,093 --> 01:08:42,512
I saved your world.
Your family.

612
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:45,846
Not really.

613
01:08:45,847 --> 01:08:48,289
I don't have any
wife and children.

614
01:08:52,264 --> 01:08:55,107
That's good and you won't have
anything to worried about

615
01:08:55,108 --> 01:08:57,449
when your planet
blowing on bits.

616
01:08:58,428 --> 01:08:59,715
You didn't think
that I give you

617
01:08:59,716 --> 01:09:01,378
the real coordinates,
did you?

618
01:09:01,379 --> 01:09:02,842
We have confirmation
on the craft.

619
01:09:02,843 --> 01:09:04,758
It's a decoy,
you idiot.

620
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:09,780
No men. There is nothing
but salvage on that ship.

621
01:09:15,771 --> 01:09:17,807
You can't stop this.

622
01:09:17,808 --> 01:09:19,938
It's already over.

623
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,719
Superior race, ha?

624
01:09:30,058 --> 01:09:32,584
I'm giving you
some advice, alien.

625
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:37,313
Never let your weapon forward
in the hand of your enemy.

626
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:27,510
I'm gonna let you in
our little secret.

627
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:29,465
We never lunch
the bomb ship.

628
01:11:29,466 --> 01:11:30,697
We couldn't.

629
01:11:30,909 --> 01:11:33,738
We've no idea
where the Sadonia was.

630
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:37,043
But now that I'm authorized
the access you date a base

631
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,677
she's gonna tell me
everything I need to know.

632
01:11:39,678 --> 01:11:43,118
You think, I forced the crash
your ship by accident?

633
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:44,995
You want it the bomb ship?

634
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,102
I let you right to it.

635
01:11:50,234 --> 01:11:53,152
Now, you gonna learn
what's feels like

636
01:11:53,153 --> 01:11:55,830
to be a last of your kind.

637
01:12:13,091 --> 01:12:15,776
You want to know the
different between you and me?

638
01:12:15,777 --> 01:12:19,879
I did have a wife and
son back on the Earth.

639
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:33,644
Centauri 7,
this is the Aurora.

640
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,581
We just clear
out the gate

641
01:12:35,582 --> 01:12:36,582
and enter into the atmosphere.

642
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:40,174
The craft it's on it's
way down. Stand by.

643
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,056
Centauri 7, this is
Commander Chane

644
01:13:03,057 --> 01:13:05,727
in the Aurora.

645
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:08,649
We are on the ground.

646
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,854
What is your status?

647
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:18,823
Centauri 7, you picking
up my transmission?

648
01:13:19,835 --> 01:13:22,859
Centauri 7,
do you copy?

649
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,250
The only one
who made it, ha?

650
01:13:46,557 --> 01:13:48,062
You look like hell.

651
01:13:48,063 --> 01:13:49,789
Must a be the rough one.

652
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:53,474
Get you to the
informative right away.

653
01:16:46,809 --> 01:16:49,575
Clea, upload the
coordinates to the Sedonia

654
01:16:49,576 --> 01:16:52,117
into the ship computer.

655
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:55,506
Clea.

656
01:16:56,999 --> 01:17:00,555
Clea, I command you
to respond.

657
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:15,376
San of a bitch.

658
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:00,593
Alpha base. This is
on the craft Jewelry size.

659
01:18:00,594 --> 01:18:02,788
Commander Chane is
no longer responsive.

660
01:18:10,802 --> 01:18:14,542
Starting sequence
complete. Clea 19.

661
01:18:14,893 --> 01:18:17,688
Hello, Centauri 7.
-Hello, Clea.

662
01:18:17,689 --> 01:18:19,299
It's good to have you back.

663
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,595
I take you by
my new casing

664
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,425
that you follow
my instructions.

665
01:18:27,017 --> 01:18:30,910
Centauri, I have incoming
transmission for Alpha base.

666
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,106
Patch it through.

667
01:18:33,965 --> 01:18:36,593
Lieutenant,
this is Alpha base.

668
01:18:37,604 --> 01:18:40,141
What's going on
now down there?

669
01:18:40,142 --> 01:18:41,692
If I were you

670
01:18:41,693 --> 01:18:44,943
I'd be more concerning
what's going on up there.

671
01:18:44,944 --> 01:18:47,021
Centauri 7, you
are on the orders.

672
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,467
What is the status
of the human?

673
01:18:48,468 --> 01:18:50,124
Find another one to
do your dirty work.

674
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:53,295
Centauri 7 out.
End of transmission.

675
01:18:56,905 --> 01:18:58,894
Whatever you
planning to do, Centauri

676
01:18:58,895 --> 01:19:00,491
I suggest you to
do it quickly.

677
01:19:00,492 --> 01:19:02,326
It won't be long before
the human traced

678
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:04,983
the source of that
signal at the Sedonia.

679
01:19:06,693 --> 01:19:08,710
He already has.

680
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:11,066
Is not that right.

681
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:15,111
He didn't kill you. Why?

682
01:19:15,112 --> 01:19:17,037
Same reason you
didn't kill me.

683
01:19:18,325 --> 01:19:21,011
Yeah, what's that?

684
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,229
I'll tell you
when I see you.

685
01:19:29,242 --> 01:19:32,276
Centauri, how we may suppose
to get out from here?

686
01:19:32,277 --> 01:19:34,523
Another our ship has to pass
be around here somewhere.

687
01:19:34,524 --> 01:19:37,085
You realized we would be
breaking 26 high council's laws

688
01:19:37,086 --> 01:19:39,516
by taking this
course of action.

689
01:19:39,517 --> 01:19:42,404
Is that a problem?
-Not at all.

690
01:19:42,405 --> 01:19:45,770
Let's get to twelve
hells off this rock.

691
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:50,967
BY AUDIO NOTE:
REŠO
