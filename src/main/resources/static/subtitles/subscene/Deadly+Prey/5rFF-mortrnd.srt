1
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:32,260
DEADLY RUN

2
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:38,281
Brussels, late summer...

3
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:45,820
No, Madeleine...
This time I'm warm.

4
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,508
I think I know which one she is...
I'm sure of it.

5
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:53,158
- You listening?
- Hurry, my bath's running.

6
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,758
She's the one with the sad look.
Upper left.

7
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:02,316
Marie had that look. She was a
cheerful child, but often seemed sad.

8
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,815
- The opposite of me.
- In all respects.

9
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,404
- Did I guess right?
- Wrong.

10
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:13,202
Wait...
She's the third from the right...

11
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:17,276
with the barrette.
She has your nose.

12
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:20,799
Your nose exactly...
Madeleine, answer me!

13
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,392
- I can't.
- Why not?

14
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:25,256
You know you only get one guess.

15
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:29,202
- No second chance?
- Sure. Next year.

16
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,791
OK, Madeleine.

17
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:34,837
While I've got you...

18
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:39,071
"Abundance of bread"... in 8 letters.

19
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:42,654
- Opulence?
- It fits. You're a genius!

20
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:44,734
When you put your mind to it.

21
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,236
- How is she?
- That's going too far!

22
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,414
Bitch!

23
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,214
And I almost jumped
out a window for her!

24
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:06,240
It was November... bitter cold...

25
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,384
Madeleine stopped me.
Whereas that idiot Taruchi...

26
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,828
I saw his hammer just in time...
He saw nothing.

27
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:19,806
Really dumb.

28
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:23,514
I fired through my pocket.

29
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:28,590
So now I've missed
two perfect chances to die...

30
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,670
Some day...

31
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:34,061
I'll die of sorrow in bed...

32
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:36,512
like all fathers.

33
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,652
Opulence...

34
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:49,083
Marie was born in 1953,
the year Stalin died.

35
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,523
I'd married Madeleine in 1952...

36
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:58,446
The year of the "H" bomb.
The "H" atoll. 6 letters: Bikini.

37
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:01,193
They left me in 1954...

38
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,379
the year of the cold war.

39
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:07,581
I got the photo in 1961.

40
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,661
Nothing happened that year.

41
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,970
Except the photo...

42
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,071
At first, I picked the girl
with the barrette...

43
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:19,222
"You're wrong," Madeleine said.

44
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:25,772
Then I decided, she was
the little imp smiling at the camera.

45
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:28,698
"Wrong again," said Madeleine.

46
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:33,822
Now I love them all...
They're all my little Marie.

47
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:37,416
I dread disappointing them.

48
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:40,193
Because I will...

49
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:43,018
the day I open the door,
and enter the photo...

50
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,222
and Marie comes to me...

51
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,945
Be patient, Marie.

52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Wait for me...

53
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,347
Where were you?
Doing crosswords?

54
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:04,002
No, sewing, Mrs. Schmidt-Boulanger...
A loose button.

55
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:07,946
"The Eye!" My best agent.

56
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:13,866
The underworld
nicknamed him "The Eye."

57
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:16,683
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo.

58
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:20,777
- The name mean anything to you?
- I should hope so.

59
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:23,258
The celebrated boot makers.

60
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:27,374
- Established in Brussels since...?
- Since forever!

61
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,554
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo have a son...

62
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:32,080
- Paul.
- Let's be brief.

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,187
It seems Paul has a girlfriend.
A French girl.

64
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:42,329
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo would like
some information about her.

65
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:50,640
- You follow me?
- What?

66
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,786
She phoned the house
several times...

67
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,971
Or we wouldn't have known
the young lady existed.

68
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:59,562
How do you know she's young?

69
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,490
Hugo Jr. is 23.

70
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,372
We'll have no trouble
finding out who she is.

71
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:11,209
The Hugo’s want a quick report.

72
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,110
- Can you do that?
- Sure.

73
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,215
Can we meet tomorrow,
same time?

74
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,714
- I'll see you out.
- No need.

75
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,779
- I insist...
- We're really grateful.

76
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:24,709
The cashier is down the hall
to the left.

77
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,675
See you tomorrow.

78
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:30,618
To the left! The cashier's office...

79
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:34,726
I hope you got the picture.

80
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:37,181
Absolutely, madam.

81
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:41,817
College boy meets hooker,
parents panic, fat fees for you!

82
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:44,934
- Simple, no?
- Keep it that way.

83
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:48,968
- Where will you begin?
- By sewing on my button.

84
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:52,391
That's a woman's job.

85
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:56,388
I dare you!

86
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:03,022
The Taruchi case was simple
until you complicated it.

87
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:07,695
Taruchi was a small-time
blackmailer... a petty crook.

88
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,105
A crook with a hammer
in his hand isn't petty!

89
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:14,551
That hammer was found
in Taruchi's pocket...

90
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,727
so don't try to snow me.

91
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,527
You wanted it in my skull?

92
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,391
You disappoint me!

93
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:26,772
I expected a little gratitude.
I got you off the blacklist.

94
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:29,798
Now I'm giving you a new case...

95
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:31,884
restoring your dignity!

96
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:34,820
- I'm generous!
- Very.

97
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:39,609
I warn you... One more foul-up...

98
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,374
and you'll sweep floors
till you retire.

99
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:48,788
When I'm 65, Marie will be 39.

100
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,875
Too late for celebrations.

101
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:01,251
Have I really put on weight?

102
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:05,204
Around the ass...
and even so... not much.

103
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:09,135
But you'll always have
pretty hands.

104
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:12,344
You'll always have a pretty face...

105
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:16,628
a pretty fur coat...
and a pretty blue car.

106
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,030
What's my car got to do with it?

107
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:22,923
Just talking.

108
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:32,464
Hugo And Co. Founded 1802...

109
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:35,500
Like the great French writer,
in 4 letters.

110
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,041
The illustrious shoemakers...

111
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:56,089
Outlets on 5th Avenue,
Via Venetto.

112
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:01,162
Exclusive suppliers to the
national jumping team.

113
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,049
Mr. Paul will sell everything.

114
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,972
Absolutely everything,
to the last shoehorn.

115
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:09,666
In order to take wenches sailing
on expensive waters.

116
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:14,873
The Adriatic sea, for instance.
It's an extremely fashionable sea.

117
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:18,822
His open collar and his cashmere
sweater are to his credit.

118
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:21,340
Rather handsome and easy going.

119
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,562
If he gets off the highway
in Morteau, I’ll kill him.

120
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,125
70... 80...

121
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,977
90...

122
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:37,410
100...

123
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:40,574
A tidy sum.

124
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:27,772
We'll walk in parks
as we used to, Marie.

125
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:31,855
Botanical gardens...

126
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:34,502
I'll teach you the
Latin names of roses.

127
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,554
Shit!

128
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:41,110
Who has the right
to separate a man and his daughter?

129
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:47,979
- You like talking to yourself?
- Not really.

130
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,040
I'm waiting for my dad.
Looking for your son?

131
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,523
My little girl.

132
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,073
My dad's an engineer.

133
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,661
When I'm big,
I want to own a dodgem.

134
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,334
Who decides of the kids’ fate?

135
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,041
Who says: You’ll compose a symphony?

136
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:32,088
You’ll be a typist?
And you a fighter pilot?

137
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,580
You a son of a bitch?

138
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:41,582
What about you?
What will you be later?

139
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,926
I’ll be a private detective.

140
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:46,444
Want to take a picture?

141
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,742
OK.

142
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:55,218
At last!
Who gave you that?

143
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,213
- That man.
- Give it right back to him!

144
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,791
Well, bye-bye!

145
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:10,515
- Lucie!
- Sorry!

146
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:10,051
Lucie Brentano...
born Sept. 22, 1962.

147
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:14,947
Student... no distinguishing traits.

148
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,827
Address:
33 rue Champollion, Paris...

149
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,637
September 22...

150
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:26,671
Virgo...

151
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:29,350
The sign of gentleness.

152
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,446
"Dear Schmidt-Boulanger...

153
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,426
"The lady is named
Lucie Brentano.

154
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:29,492
"She likes peace and quiet.

155
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:33,804
"Smokes 'Senior Service'...
"and screws singing 'La Paloma. "'

156
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,032
Capricorn... symbol of winter...

157
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:00,719
Lucie Brentano, student...

158
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,836
Blue eyes... Straight nose...

159
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:08,915
Distinguishing trait:
Killed a man last night.

160
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,936
- Have a good trip?
- Excellent.

161
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:00,920
- Put it in the safe.
- Certainly.

162
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:12,413
Hello, Voragine.

163
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:16,504
So you're out of the closet.
To kill whom this time?

164
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:20,296
Know the brunette
at the front desk?

165
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:26,086
Eve Granger... model.
You see her occasionally.

166
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,573
Not much baggage, no men.
How's Schmidt-Boulanger?

167
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:32,324
- Spreading out?
- It's prosperity.

168
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,190
Can you get me
on a flight to Nice this evening?

169
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,179
The 6:45 would suit me.

170
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,716
Flight 417 to Nice.
Of course, miss.

171
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:47,789
"Paul Hugo's fish bait,
Mrs. Schmidt-Boulanger..."

172
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:52,448
No, If I tell her that,
she'll call the cops.

173
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:54,716
So I'll say...

174
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,636
Paul and Lucie
went to Reno to marry.

175
00:19:57,716 --> 00:20:00,966
That's no good either.
Paul left alone...

176
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:05,218
By plane, alone... Montreal...

177
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:09,222
Air Canada... First class.

178
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:12,090
His tramp ditched him.

179
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,850
Not if he just took
all his cash out of the bank.

180
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,537
Very well. So get moving.

181
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:21,730
Get me a ticket to Montreal with
an open return. It's for "The Eye."

182
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,116
- What?
- Money, money.

183
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,677
Get 400 francs ready.

184
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,717
- 800...
- 450! And get a receipt!

185
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:31,381
Hooker or no,
why'd he dump her?

186
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,474
- Jealous.
- A rival?

187
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:37,360
Let's just say, another man.
A father.

188
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,346
As I understand it,
the girl's mother was a nothing.

189
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:45,957
She was raised by her father,
a superior type of man.

190
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:49,694
She's always bragging about him.

191
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,470
Paul must have felt
unable to compete.

192
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,463
- So he fled.
- How'd you learn all this?

193
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:01,049
Use a mike?

194
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,450
No my dear, I haven't always
been called "The Eye."

195
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,181
They used to call me "The Ear."

196
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:25,013
Your dumb daughter is here.
Try to recognize her. Good luck.

197
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:09,265
She has lilac eyes...

198
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:11,646
she killed a man,
she looks like a kid...

199
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:15,515
- and she eats pears.
- Beg pardon?

200
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:18,271
"To blind," in 6 letters.

201
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,399
- Dazzle?
- Too easy.

202
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:26,599
Departure of Flight 417 for Nice.
Boarding now...

203
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:33,914
Capricorns, luck is still with you.

204
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:37,876
If you plan to travel,
now would be a good time.

205
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:46,891
Michel! Michel, darling!
I thought you didn’t wait for me!

206
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:48,568
- I was scared!
- Scared?

207
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:52,251
More sorry than scared.
I thought you'd forgotten me.

208
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:55,406
80 people expect you
in Monte Carlo, Dorothee.

209
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:58,987
Dorothee! It's crazy!
Dorothee who?

210
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,067
Beg pardon?

211
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:05,670
"To blind," in 6 letters.
It's not "dazzle."

212
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:08,837
"Betray."

213
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:11,710
You're all golden. Sunbathing?

214
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,790
I've been sailing.

215
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:47,970
I wonder what Felix
will give his future daughter-in-law.

216
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,881
- I'm the aunt from Vittel.
- I'm the Paris cousin.

217
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,283
Cousin on the girl’s side,
of course.

218
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:57,560
The last of the Orthiz?
- Himself.

219
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:03,743
Dorothee, in the name of the family...
and of all the Meyerganzes...

220
00:24:03,823 --> 00:24:06,455
allow me to present you with this.

221
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:10,495
They're only emeralds.

222
00:24:35,064 --> 00:24:37,804
Sanseveria... Asplenium Nidus...

223
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:42,708
Asparagus plumosis...

224
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,994
- ... and one mink coat!
- Mink!

225
00:24:56,473 --> 00:25:00,306
Emeralds!
You're nice to be with, Michel.

226
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:03,972
Now that you're warm,
are you hungry?

227
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:08,569
- I want to screw.
- Can't think of everything.

228
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:37,691
Dorothee Orthiz, just about to indulge
in an imperial engagement night.

229
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:41,376
But Lucie Brentano gets her
kicks in the shoe business.

230
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:47,003
Problem. Splash.
No more problem.

231
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,184
We're clearing away.
Would you like something?

232
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,264
No, thank you.

233
00:25:57,699 --> 00:26:01,569
- No problem, right?
- We all have problems.

234
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:04,205
More or less.

235
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:54,931
Dorothee! Michel! Where are you?

236
00:26:59,926 --> 00:27:03,118
- Have you seen the kids?
- I was looking for them.

237
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:06,217
If you ask me they must have...
how to put it? Eloped!

238
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,297
They’re young enough for that.

239
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:09,195
- Is Miss Granger back?
- Miss Granger?

240
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:12,215
I mean, Miss Orthiz.

241
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:16,299
Yes, she is back.
Would you care to call her?

242
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:18,779
No, she may be sleeping.

243
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:21,367
Thanks.

244
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:24,938
I’m sure it’s her.
Her name is Doris Fleming.

245
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:26,931
She stole a boyfriend
from me once.

246
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:30,819
They went to Morocco
and he never was heard of again.

247
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:51,177
Come in!

248
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:31,746
She could have put on a robe,
don't you think?

249
00:29:59,768 --> 00:30:02,783
We are flying at an altitude
of 25,000 feet.

250
00:30:02,863 --> 00:30:08,507
And on our right,
we can see The Black Forest.

251
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:27,858
She's killed 2 men...
eats pears, reads Shakespeare:

252
00:30:27,938 --> 00:30:31,565
Active, voracious, cultivated.

253
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:54,921
Don't get excited, boss.

254
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:58,546
It's long-distance
and you're paying for it, so listen.

255
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:01,553
- Where are you? Montreal?
- Marrakesh.

256
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:04,940
- What!
- I don't set the itinerary.

257
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,351
Paul Hugo is the kind of guy
who flirts incessantly.

258
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:11,331
First Montreal, now Morocco.

259
00:31:14,363 --> 00:31:16,485
- And tomorrow?
- Home!

260
00:31:16,565 --> 00:31:20,525
Bring that clown back
before his parents call in the cops.

261
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:17,882
My darling little daughter.

262
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:22,731
I put a cross so you’ll know
where your Daddy lives.

263
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,653
I do think a lot about you.

264
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:34,035
Are you writing to Marie?

265
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,864
Yes. The little one can barely
take our separations,

266
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:40,441
but then, her mother has
to see her sometimes.

267
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:43,494
You should send them a picture
of you in your djellaba.

268
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:46,013
It really suits you.
- Yes, yes, thank you.

269
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:48,622
Have you read the horoscope?
It’s excellent.

270
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,876
As you can see,
I’m taking up your bad habits.

271
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:55,891
Capricorns:
avoid useless agitation;

272
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:58,327
things are coming to meet you.

273
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:00,562
You’ll meet new people

274
00:33:00,642 --> 00:33:05,015
and become really popular.
Love, love, love...

275
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:10,801
P.S. Beware!

276
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:14,275
The forces of evil
crawl like spiders towards you.

277
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,708
See you tonight, my friend.

278
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:44,042
Stop following me!

279
00:33:44,245 --> 00:33:46,245
I'm not!

280
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:51,015
We always seem to go
the same way.

281
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:54,025
Hey, Ariane!

282
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:57,580
We have a date tonight.
Don't forget.

283
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:02,357
Bet 200 francs you'll sleep
with one of those idiots.

284
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:05,245
Not likely.

285
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,648
When you get horny,
come sleep with me.

286
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:12,422
My name is Cora. I'm in 317.

287
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,552
I’d like to change rooms. I’m just
next door to a couple of newlyweds

288
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:22,958
who wail like wild animals,
and I can’t sleep a wink.

289
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:25,170
Don’t you have anything
around the number 300?

290
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,883
Number 308 is free
and 320 soon will be too.

291
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:31,358
- What about 316?
- We never offer it.

292
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,766
It’s an emergency room,
with a mere shower.

293
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:36,787
I love them. I love showers.

294
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:16,537
My father is an anthropologist.

295
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:24,477
He even went up the Nile...

296
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:27,756
God knows how far.

297
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:30,805
Another time he went
to the North Cape.

298
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:34,869
He sent me a postcard
from the Lofoten Islands.

299
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:43,031
I wonder where he is now.

300
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:45,233
What are you talking about?

301
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:49,566
- About my father.
- Who cares about him?

302
00:36:28,538 --> 00:36:31,682
- You mustn't be home much.
- Unfortunately.

303
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:35,194
My wife always wanted me
to take a sedentary job...

304
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:37,907
Teacher, or some such.

305
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,410
But when the Nile obsesses you...

306
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:43,460
We had some painful scenes.

307
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,646
Just before a voyage
to the North Cape...

308
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:49,141
Madeleine threatened to jump
out of a window..

309
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:52,963
- "Go ahead, do it," I said.
- My God!

310
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,043
Blackmail.

311
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,726
Excuse me now...

312
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,227
it's time to take the waters.
See you tonight.

313
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:06,578
What a farce!

314
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:20,415
You were amoral.
Now you're boring, Jerry.

315
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:24,735
- I'm not answerable to anyone.
- Of course not.

316
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:28,589
I'm simply warning you:
Cora's a bitch.

317
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,111
Lays girls, but hates 'em.

318
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:34,256
When she's through with you...
she'll dump you.

319
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,218
You talk about her
as if she were a guy.

320
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:44,397
- Talking of me?
- Yes.

321
00:37:44,477 --> 00:37:47,280
- Was it amusing?
- Rather.

322
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,453
What'd he say? That I'm a nympho?
Paranoid? Manic-something?

323
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:53,533
A bitch!

324
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:58,508
Funny: Roman whores took milk baths.
Today's use Clorox.

325
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:03,596
No wonder the streams are polluted.

326
00:38:03,777 --> 00:38:08,561
Don't touch that! Makes me nervous.
Stop biting your nails. It's tacky.

327
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:17,258
Here's your ticket to Brussels,
Miss Chevallier.

328
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,682
A single with dining car.

329
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:23,197
- Your taxi will be here at 8:00 p.m.
- Thank you.

330
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:30,749
Please get my bill ready.

331
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:35,805
So? This is the big night!

332
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:37,507
You’re going to pick up
Marie at the station?

333
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:39,637
Yes. At 11:57 PM.
- Here.

334
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,456
You’ll give this to her.

335
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:45,319
It’s nothing, really. I did it to
pass the time. I hope she’ll like it.

336
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:51,394
Thank you.
It’s... It’s pretty.

337
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:55,274
Do you know what?
Somebody stole my necklace!

338
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:57,729
Stole, stole!

339
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:02,503
You probably lost them at the
Roman Baths. Or in the shower.

340
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,506
You’re always flaunting
those rocks of yours.

341
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:06,632
Stop it! Can’t you see
I’m really upset?

342
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,816
Don’t get upset. We’re going.

343
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:14,455
Really, this is...
You’ve got a heart,

344
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:16,537
well done.

345
00:40:29,379 --> 00:40:31,941
Things could have
been different, Jerry.

346
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:34,462
I mean: a little better.

347
00:40:34,795 --> 00:40:37,049
Too late, unfortunately:
I’m going back to Brussels.

348
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:40,434
- I’m going back to Brussels.
- Excuse me, my cab is waiting.

349
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:42,081
Let him wait,
your luggage is in my car.

350
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:44,161
What?

351
00:40:46,437 --> 00:40:48,755
Can’t he mind his own business?
What a sod!

352
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:51,168
You were right after all:
she’s a monster.

353
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,515
She dumped me just like that.

354
00:42:30,957 --> 00:42:32,445
Hello, madam,
did you have a nice trip?

355
00:42:32,525 --> 00:42:35,098
- Excellent.
- Keeping your room for the week?

356
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,250
Probably.

357
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,079
Could you give me the envelope
I put in the safe?

358
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,159
I'll come with you.

359
00:42:57,552 --> 00:43:00,108
Hello "The Eye!" Still on her tail?

360
00:43:00,188 --> 00:43:02,188
She just arrived.

361
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,982
- I heard you were in Montreal.
- In Marrakesh.

362
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:09,655
I was in Marrakesh.

363
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:12,217
- Is it nice there?
- Ask Flatfoot.

364
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:15,788
You've had many calls.
One person came by twice.

365
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:22,028
I've thought about it.
I don't want my room.

366
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:24,127
Very well, madam.

367
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:32,444
She's really got you running.
No time to put your bag down.

368
00:43:32,524 --> 00:43:34,238
I'll put it down one day, Voragine.

369
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:36,603
That day, I'll push
the classroom door...

370
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:40,245
Let me go! Let me go,
or I'll break your arm!

371
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,397
- Keep the change.
- Change? You must be mistaken.

372
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:09,695
You've given me 100.

373
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:17,585
Scumbag. It's 1,000.

374
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,432
Pardon me.
It must be my mistake.

375
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:22,512
That's all right. Keep it anyway.

376
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:28,873
This happens all the time,
but it doesn't really matter.

377
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:32,528
It's deplorable.

378
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:36,177
It's quite deplorable,
but it doesn't really matter.

379
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:40,419
What's the book?

380
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,327
I heard you turning pages.

381
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,645
Hamlet.

382
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:49,680
It's hard to make actors say:

383
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,066
"To be or not to be."

384
00:44:52,146 --> 00:44:54,640
Or... "Murder...

385
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,073
"though it have no tongue...

386
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:00,839
"will speak with most
miraculous organ."

387
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:21,142
Do you know the
recording of "La Paloma"

388
00:45:21,222 --> 00:45:24,738
by Hans Albert, in the 30s?

389
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,416
- No.
- That’s too bad.

390
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,533
What time is it?

391
00:45:35,168 --> 00:45:38,033
I can hear pages,
but not the hands on a watch.

392
00:45:38,457 --> 00:45:39,774
11:50 p.m.

393
00:45:39,854 --> 00:45:42,473
The Rome train
leaves in 15 minutes.

394
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:44,644
I'm going to Rome, too.

395
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:51,068
Capricorns. If you intend to travel,
jump on the opportunity.

396
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,548
Now is the time.

397
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:56,706
Train suits you better than plane.

398
00:45:57,632 --> 00:45:59,632
Have a nice trip.

399
00:46:11,993 --> 00:46:14,625
What if I said I was brunette,
had black eyes...

400
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,911
and smoked "Marlboros?"

401
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:19,373
Fine, but I wouldn't believe you.

402
00:46:19,453 --> 00:46:21,473
You're blond, blue eyed...

403
00:46:21,553 --> 00:46:24,370
and smoke "Players."

404
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:27,418
"Senior Service."

405
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:32,215
And you won't take off your coat.

406
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:44,134
Been thinking about my coat?

407
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:46,214
Constantly.

408
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,406
My antenna tells me everything.

409
00:46:53,486 --> 00:46:55,523
That's why I don't need
a white cane.

410
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:58,555
I can foretell storms, hurricanes...

411
00:46:58,635 --> 00:47:01,019
earthquakes...

412
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:05,229
In my youth...
it saved my mother's life.

413
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:10,196
We were on holiday in Sicily. Suddenly,
I smelled a snake under the stones...

414
00:47:10,276 --> 00:47:12,276
A foul smell.

415
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,665
You're "The Eye?" You phoned?

416
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:47,777
I'm Mrs. Comolli. Come on up.

417
00:47:49,217 --> 00:47:53,221
His name is Forbes. He's Swiss.

418
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:57,912
Very wealthy, very shrewd,
speaks 8 languages and loves art.

419
00:47:57,992 --> 00:48:00,814
Has one of the finest homes
on the coast.

420
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:03,883
Here's the address and phone.

421
00:48:04,566 --> 00:48:06,812
- What does one say?
- Thank you.

422
00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:10,004
No, I meant what does
one say to your boss?

423
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:13,211
She telexes daily.
She's sick of chasing you!

424
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,640
Everybody’s running after
someone else, little lady.

425
00:48:17,224 --> 00:48:20,062
One day she'll show you the door!

426
00:48:20,888 --> 00:48:24,706
When I’m shown the door, you’ll only
have to push it, Madame Comolli.

427
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:26,982
There will be a blackboard,
and little girls.

428
00:48:27,062 --> 00:48:32,649
Marie will say: "Here I am!"
and all the little girls will applaud.

429
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:49,072
Hamlet.
A tragedy in five acts.

430
00:48:49,152 --> 00:48:51,618
The castle of Ellsinore.

431
00:48:52,017 --> 00:48:54,370
A terrace, battlements...

432
00:49:52,717 --> 00:49:54,717
I've been waiting for you.

433
00:49:55,614 --> 00:49:58,605
Good news:
Schlosser's paintings are coming.

434
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:01,522
One is specially fine.

435
00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:05,457
I'm sure you'll love it, too.
The Traveller.

436
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:07,865
When you touch it...

437
00:50:07,945 --> 00:50:12,102
it's as smooth, as exquisite,
as a Latour.

438
00:50:30,821 --> 00:50:32,962
You're exquisite, too, Charlotte.

439
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:38,299
You're exquisite, Charlotte.

440
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:41,494
Charlotte who?

441
00:50:56,311 --> 00:51:00,262
Look where you're going!
I don't believe it.

442
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:10,288
Come on.

443
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,237
Come on, move it.

444
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,655
Bastard smokes in bed!

445
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:39,735
Why do you let him?

446
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,139
Why does he have the right?

447
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:44,526
Because he's blind?

448
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:46,959
Or because he's rich?

449
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:52,295
We spent our vacations...

450
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:54,776
in Denmark...

451
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:58,010
I smelled a snake under the stones...

452
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,460
A foul smell...

453
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:04,470
I can stink, too.

454
00:54:04,552 --> 00:54:07,634
Bump into furniture. Play dumb.

455
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,340
Looking for something?

456
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,965
My granddaughter's ball...

457
00:55:01,045 --> 00:55:04,828
a sort of round red ball.
A red ball.

458
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:07,368
It must've come over the wall.

459
00:55:07,448 --> 00:55:10,610
Wait, Marie.

460
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,690
I'm coming.

461
00:55:25,897 --> 00:55:27,904
Goddamn blind man!

462
00:55:32,856 --> 00:55:34,903
But, Mrs. Schmidt-Boulanger...

463
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,743
- Hugo's flying out tonight.
- Where to?

464
00:55:38,823 --> 00:55:40,638
If I knew, I'd tell you.

465
00:55:40,718 --> 00:55:45,622
Anyway, Mrs. Comolli will give me
some expense money.

466
00:55:45,702 --> 00:55:49,838
Screw Paul Hugo and Mrs. Comolli.
- Oh shit!

467
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:52,680
Those fingerprints did it:

468
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,052
she was born Dec. 20, 1962...

469
00:55:56,132 --> 00:56:00,452
Did some time in jail.
2 years ago.

470
00:56:00,532 --> 00:56:03,480
The French police
have nothing on her since.

471
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,639
Catherine Leiris.

472
00:56:07,775 --> 00:56:11,776
- There's no warrant out?
- You expected Bonnie Parker?

473
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,893
No, no...

474
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:21,273
Won’t you ask me,
any news of your blind man.

475
00:56:21,353 --> 00:56:23,353
Because I’ve got some.

476
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:26,877
Alright. Wait,
I’ll translate them for you.

477
00:56:29,616 --> 00:56:33,227
Art and business will soon
be happily married.

478
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:38,447
"The marriage is announced
of Miss Charlotte Vincent...

479
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:41,859
"whose current exhibit
is a big hit...

480
00:56:41,939 --> 00:56:44,260
"and Mr. Ralph Forbes...

481
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,329
"the well-known Swiss architect."

482
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:53,390
What's come over you?

483
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:56,014
Nothing.

484
00:57:33,399 --> 00:57:37,872
- Happy birthday, my love.
- Happy birthday!

485
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:42,662
Congratulations!
The exhibit is marvellous.

486
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:45,092
Congratulate Mr. Forbes.

487
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:49,020
It was his idea.
Sorry, I'm out of cigarettes.

488
00:58:03,004 --> 00:58:05,004
Happy birthday, Marie.

489
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:16,579
Go on...

490
00:58:20,913 --> 00:58:23,116
Go on, she's all alone.

491
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:25,281
Go on.

492
00:58:37,658 --> 00:58:39,658
Happy birthday, Catherine.

493
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:48,047
You must be mistaken.

494
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:52,061
Just pulling names out of my hat.

495
00:58:52,588 --> 00:58:54,938
Like: Catherine Leiris...

496
00:58:58,203 --> 00:59:00,203
Lucie Brentano...

497
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:03,292
Lucie Orthiz...

498
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:08,302
Did you bring this trash?

499
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:12,167
I'm out for myself. Aren't you?

500
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:18,122
No comment?

501
00:59:18,202 --> 00:59:20,724
"Murder, though it have no tongue...

502
00:59:20,804 --> 00:59:23,870
"will speak with most
miraculous organ..."

503
00:59:25,538 --> 00:59:27,538
You talking to me?

504
00:59:27,716 --> 00:59:32,229
Just pulling words out of my hat.
I could also whip out my .38...

505
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:34,961
and splatter the walls with ketchup.

506
00:59:37,113 --> 00:59:39,513
Louis, there's a maniac here.

507
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:41,719
- What?
- There's a maniac!

508
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:44,107
Is. 38 a big calibre?

509
00:59:44,554 --> 00:59:46,554
That's what he's got.

510
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:57,697
- I’ve got to talk to you.
- Now? - Yes. Come.

511
00:59:57,777 --> 00:59:59,777
Excuse me.

512
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:27,485
The last time someone told me
"Happy birthday," I was 11.

513
01:00:27,868 --> 01:00:30,628
That year, I wanted
a majorette costume.

514
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:34,760
But it was much too expensive.
Daddy kept saying,

515
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,917
"Everything will be better,
once we have a little money."

516
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:41,054
It's just that there was
never any money.

517
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:43,383
Nothing ever got better.

518
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:50,125
Wait.

519
01:00:51,368 --> 01:00:54,030
Charlotte,
did you see something?

520
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:58,899
No, nothing. It's strange.
It's like what I wanted to tell you.

521
01:01:00,604 --> 01:01:03,676
It's a man wearing a uniform
with big buttons...

522
01:01:03,756 --> 01:01:05,950
and a shiny cap.

523
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:11,681
His wife probably left him
a long time ago.

524
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:14,776
Maybe she's dead.

525
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,455
The girls at school knew
the shiny cap.

526
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:28,163
The teachers, too.
Everybody made fun of them...

527
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:31,476
because her dad's job
was opening taxi doors.

528
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,449
Even he knew
he was incompetent.

529
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:44,660
He got fired. He became a washroom
attendant in a grand hotel.

530
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,717
Mr Pee Pee.

531
01:01:46,805 --> 01:01:49,518
When he comes home at night,
he still reeks of ammonia.

532
01:01:51,121 --> 01:01:54,104
The 22nd of December
is his daughter’s birthday.

533
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,814
She’s eleven.

534
01:02:00,044 --> 01:02:02,249
An old neighbour gave her
some pears.

535
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:05,349
That’s all they have for dinner.

536
01:02:06,738 --> 01:02:08,738
It’s very cold.

537
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:12,197
They went into a department store
in order to get warm.

538
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:20,973
There was music playing: "La Paloma".
It was beautiful.

539
01:02:21,466 --> 01:02:26,444
The father said: Wait a second,
I’ll go and fetch something for you.

540
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:31,072
He tried to steal a sweater
but he got caught.

541
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:36,021
I waited for him all night at home.

542
01:02:40,175 --> 01:02:44,173
The next day, two fucking inspectors
came and told me he was dead.

543
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:41,515
9221319?

544
01:03:41,595 --> 01:03:43,551
"Hello Mr. Forbes...

545
01:03:43,631 --> 01:03:46,235
"I'm sorry, I can't let you
marry Charlotte."

546
01:03:46,315 --> 01:03:50,213
No...
"9221319? Hello, Forbes?

547
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,851
"Catherine Leiris stole a car.

548
01:03:52,931 --> 01:03:56,625
"A Swiss can't marry a thief.
"She's also slightly lesbian..."

549
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,823
"9221319? Hello, Binky?

550
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:04,000
"She's killed lots of guys.
"She'll kill you, too.

551
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:08,287
"You don't stand a chance...
so give her back to me."

552
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:11,550
"9221319...

553
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,790
"Catherine, I love you."

554
01:04:15,526 --> 01:04:18,551
Can you help me across?

555
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,292
Talking to yourself?

556
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:26,239
- I was phoning you.
- Oh yes, what about?

557
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,905
About Marie... I mean Charlotte.

558
01:04:28,985 --> 01:04:30,985
You can't marry her.

559
01:04:31,102 --> 01:04:33,130
I'm against the marriage.

560
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:35,276
I beg your pardon, but...

561
01:04:35,356 --> 01:04:37,998
I'm her father, if you must know.

562
01:04:38,777 --> 01:04:41,463
She surely spoke of me.
She always does.

563
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:44,428
The man in the shiny cap:
"Mr. Pee Pee."

564
01:04:44,508 --> 01:04:48,968
- A ridiculous figure.
- Ridiculous, that's it.

565
01:04:49,048 --> 01:04:54,070
She spoke of you... her time
in jail... the car she stole...

566
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,211
As if she wanted to put me off.

567
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:58,936
She could have said anything...

568
01:04:59,016 --> 01:05:02,085
I don't scare easily.

569
01:05:03,742 --> 01:05:06,182
The blind have priority, Mr. Forbes.

570
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,246
You don't stand in line for movies...
you get seats on buses...

571
01:05:11,326 --> 01:05:15,389
But you can't run red lights...
or steal people's kids.

572
01:05:15,784 --> 01:05:17,784
You won't get my daughter.

573
01:05:18,054 --> 01:05:20,499
What have you ever done for her?

574
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:24,679
I lugged Meyerganz...
through the sewers of Monte Carlo...

575
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:28,436
and hid Jerry's bags in the ferns.

576
01:05:29,085 --> 01:05:31,085
What did you do?

577
01:05:32,376 --> 01:05:35,364
You just spouted a lot of crap...

578
01:05:39,308 --> 01:05:41,099
Your intuitions... Hamlet...

579
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:43,729
The snake under the stones
and the cigars in bed...

580
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:46,849
I'm not denying you my daughter
because you're a cripple...

581
01:05:46,929 --> 01:05:50,981
but because... you're a phoney.

582
01:05:51,061 --> 01:05:53,061
We can cross now.

583
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:17,482
What's going on?
What's going on?

584
01:06:50,021 --> 01:06:54,448
Capricorn: "Now is the winter
of our discontent..."

585
01:06:54,528 --> 01:06:56,840
All the planets are hostile.

586
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,287
Change surroundings.

587
01:07:36,072 --> 01:07:38,990
Hello, miss.
Your passport, please.

588
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:52,583
Thank you.

589
01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:22,488
Oh no, shit!
Don't fool with hitchhikers.

590
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,426
Thanks... You're real nice.

591
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,206
I'm going to Biarritz.

592
01:08:31,354 --> 01:08:35,064
That's great. So am I.

593
01:08:37,422 --> 01:08:39,603
You might ask me my name.

594
01:08:40,177 --> 01:08:42,177
What's your name?

595
01:08:42,272 --> 01:08:44,272
Betty.

596
01:08:44,628 --> 01:08:46,702
You could say, "It's a nice name."

597
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:50,071
And offer me a smoke.

598
01:08:50,731 --> 01:08:52,731
Help yourself.

599
01:08:56,983 --> 01:09:01,280
Last night a truck driver
tried to ball me.

600
01:09:02,026 --> 01:09:06,298
That idiot is at the hospital.
For a long time.

601
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:08,910
You don't look that strong.

602
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,604
No, but I've got what it takes.

603
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:17,365
You're driving too fast.
Why so fast?

604
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,720
If it's to show off to that dog...

605
01:09:20,135 --> 01:09:22,615
you'll have an accident,
like Forbes...

606
01:09:34,694 --> 01:09:36,746
We can stop here if you want.

607
01:09:41,456 --> 01:09:43,545
Now what?

608
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:47,528
Get out.

609
01:09:50,802 --> 01:09:53,254
I've got what it takes, too.

610
01:09:56,006 --> 01:09:58,006
Throw out the penknife.

611
01:10:09,044 --> 01:10:12,018
For some reason,
I don't feel like killing you.

612
01:10:13,355 --> 01:10:16,248
I loved a man, he's dead,
and I'm tired.

613
01:10:18,911 --> 01:10:20,911
No more Biarritz?

614
01:10:21,499 --> 01:10:25,612
- If you promise to be good.
- I promise. I swear.

615
01:11:04,289 --> 01:11:07,212
Do you want me to tell you
about the brothel in Miramas?

616
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,762
What fun I had there!

617
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,570
It was near Marseille.

618
01:11:15,809 --> 01:11:18,083
I was something like,
eight or nine.

619
01:11:19,882 --> 01:11:22,612
There was a room filled with toys.

620
01:11:23,808 --> 01:11:29,556
Lots of things: there were dolls,
plush Mickey Mouse’s,

621
01:11:29,636 --> 01:11:33,918
and... what was there again?

622
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:39,542
There was... what’s the name?
A circuit with miniature cars.

623
01:11:39,622 --> 01:11:42,204
I used to love it!

624
01:11:42,284 --> 01:11:45,870
I spent all my afternoons
in that room.

625
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:50,064
Before she locked me in, Mom forced
me to take my clothes off,

626
01:11:50,144 --> 01:11:52,419
and then I could play.

627
01:11:55,999 --> 01:12:00,246
And one day...
I noticed the holes in the wall.

628
01:12:01,431 --> 01:12:03,996
There were guys
next door watching me.

629
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:08,220
I was part of the show...

630
01:12:12,476 --> 01:12:14,731
There are holes in the
walls here, too.

631
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:17,545
Someone's watching us.

632
01:12:18,825 --> 01:12:21,750
Hey, go easy on the brandy.

633
01:12:23,398 --> 01:12:25,670
I swear someone's watching us.

634
01:12:28,091 --> 01:12:30,199
Let me tell you something.

635
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:35,465
People who make holes in walls
only exist if you think they do.

636
01:12:38,418 --> 01:12:40,590
Still there, old man?

637
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:44,416
I'm here, Marie.

638
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:51,475
Forbes died accidentally.

639
01:13:52,451 --> 01:13:57,196
It said so in the papers.
Accidentally.

640
01:14:43,169 --> 01:14:45,217
Hey! That's my car!

641
01:14:45,297 --> 01:14:48,669
There's not room
for both of us in this deal.

642
01:14:48,749 --> 01:14:51,035
Looks like my gun, too.

643
01:14:51,991 --> 01:14:55,928
There are things in the trunk...
I care about them.

644
01:14:56,008 --> 01:14:58,715
Always hang on to things
you care about.

645
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:02,256
There are also some cookies
on the back seat.

646
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:04,336
Give him his cookies.

647
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:09,939
Thanks.

648
01:15:11,631 --> 01:15:13,631
Have a good trip!

649
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:51,610
I'm always losing you, Marie.
It won't do.

650
01:15:52,182 --> 01:15:55,480
I hope you don't get
into any trouble.

651
01:15:56,309 --> 01:15:59,077
Wait for me, my sweet,
I'm coming.

652
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,813
Xerox!

653
01:16:51,383 --> 01:16:53,383
Seal it!

654
01:17:03,658 --> 01:17:05,898
Here. There was another
of those yellow letters.

655
01:17:06,959 --> 01:17:09,569
- Won’t you open it?
- What for? I know what’s inside.

656
01:17:09,649 --> 01:17:12,064
Cut-off point: today, 10 AM.

657
01:17:37,905 --> 01:17:41,062
- I've been looking for you all over.
- I haven't!

658
01:17:41,142 --> 01:17:43,617
I thought I'd see you sooner.

659
01:17:44,078 --> 01:17:46,106
What kept you?

660
01:17:46,557 --> 01:17:48,557
Where's lover-boy?

661
01:17:49,348 --> 01:17:51,348
Pension Hortensias.

662
01:17:51,982 --> 01:17:54,859
I've had enough of that place.
I'm going home to Paris.

663
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:57,312
14 rue de la Butte aux Cailles.

664
01:17:58,555 --> 01:18:00,613
Will you buy me a drink?

665
01:18:00,693 --> 01:18:04,025
- Take the lady's order.
- A Fernet...

666
01:18:04,364 --> 01:18:06,511
No...

667
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:10,607
a Pernod... No! A shandy.

668
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,080
Why not mix all three?

669
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,160
Get her a black coffee.

670
01:18:18,004 --> 01:18:20,004
Am I bothering you?

671
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:23,301
You were sketching?

672
01:18:24,383 --> 01:18:26,407
Looked like schoolgirls...

673
01:18:26,487 --> 01:18:29,873
What a stupid thing to say.
Schoolgirls?

674
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:33,960
Are you zonked, or what?

675
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:41,202
So lover-boy threw you out?

676
01:18:42,855 --> 01:18:44,855
Tell me all about it.

677
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,615
There's nothing to say.

678
01:18:48,075 --> 01:18:50,005
Nothing, really.

679
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:52,819
I banged on the door all night.

680
01:18:52,899 --> 01:18:56,416
I even used my head... See?

681
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:01,740
He wouldn't open.
He told me to get lost. And worse.

682
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:06,140
He said: "You're old, you stink..."
He even called me ugly.

683
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:11,478
It's true... you're extremely ugly.

684
01:19:14,534 --> 01:19:16,838
Let's talk about the girls.

685
01:19:17,223 --> 01:19:19,420
How are they?
Where are they staying?

686
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,890
You mean Princess Eugenie.

687
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:24,552
In a suite.

688
01:19:24,644 --> 01:19:27,611
And she throws away hundreds
and thousands at the casino.

689
01:19:27,691 --> 01:19:31,041
If it goes on like this,
your model won’t get a cent.

690
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:33,896
Maybe it will bring back his civility.

691
01:19:41,074 --> 01:19:45,957
Oh, no! You’re not going to joke
about my appearance again?

692
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:54,225
Maybe it would be less atrocious
with bangs.

693
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,374
Give it a try. Down to there...

694
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,178
There it is.

695
01:20:40,004 --> 01:20:43,993
- Lost something, Super sleuth?
- You bet.

696
01:20:44,642 --> 01:20:47,980
You took my car,
my gun and some photos.

697
01:20:48,673 --> 01:20:51,547
The car's been recovered.
I want the rest.

698
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:54,247
You can forget the gun.

699
01:20:54,459 --> 01:20:57,365
50,000 will buy back the photos.

700
01:20:58,302 --> 01:21:00,361
You're a bastard.

701
01:21:00,697 --> 01:21:03,234
What can you do
with my mementos?

702
01:21:03,501 --> 01:21:05,501
Invest them.

703
01:21:06,527 --> 01:21:08,793
The Hugo case...

704
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:12,039
The Meyerganz case...

705
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,368
The Pallenberg case, today...

706
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:20,165
Right now she's at the bank.

707
01:21:20,649 --> 01:21:25,288
Once she shows up here with the
money... the blackmailer will disappear.

708
01:21:30,046 --> 01:21:32,046
The little girls...

709
01:21:32,782 --> 01:21:35,624
- The photos of those schoolgirls?
- Censored.

710
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:37,704
Destroyed!

711
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:49,039
Shame on you, dirty old man.

712
01:22:00,108 --> 01:22:03,498
- My shoes?
- They're tacky as hell.

713
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:06,632
Taruchi wore them, too.

714
01:22:07,403 --> 01:22:09,403
Who's Taruchi?

715
01:22:10,189 --> 01:22:12,410
An extremely tacky guy.

716
01:22:16,261 --> 01:22:18,261
A jerk like you...

717
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,892
who thought he was smart.

718
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:25,636
- Good day, sir.
- Hold it, smart-ass.

719
01:22:26,126 --> 01:22:29,634
Your turn to answer.
Who gave you my address?

720
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:34,817
Which one? Pension Hortensias?

721
01:22:34,897 --> 01:22:37,976
Or the one
on Rue de la Butte aux Cailles?

722
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:41,795
Hey, that’s below the belt.
- Yes..

723
01:22:42,368 --> 01:22:44,368
Let me guess...

724
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:48,757
- Not Madame Ugly?
- Right...

725
01:22:49,311 --> 01:22:53,346
A sugarless coffee, a few
quickly dried tears, then the swoon.

726
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:55,426
Love at first sight.

727
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:05,328
He said "love at first sight"
Like that?

728
01:23:05,408 --> 01:23:07,387
Like that?

729
01:23:07,467 --> 01:23:09,722
It’s not a question of money anymore,

730
01:23:10,179 --> 01:23:12,675
it’s a love story, my poor Germaine.

731
01:23:14,038 --> 01:23:16,038
You wouldn’t even recognize him.

732
01:23:16,438 --> 01:23:19,086
He wears incredible shoes,

733
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:22,405
light ties... silk shirts.

734
01:23:22,806 --> 01:23:26,370
- What's she like?
- He spoke vaguely of her.

735
01:23:26,464 --> 01:23:29,511
White yacht...
Parasols... delicacies...

736
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:31,444
What about me?
Did he tell you about me?

737
01:23:31,524 --> 01:23:35,411
- Four lettered words!
- The bastard.

738
01:23:35,955 --> 01:23:38,250
After all the things I did for him!

739
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:41,489
I even walked the street for him,
yes sir, in Barcelona.

740
01:23:41,569 --> 01:23:43,923
On the Ramblas, in 1958.

741
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:48,272
I don’t look the part, do I?

742
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:50,698
Do I look like a detective?

743
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:54,305
In the Barrio Chino,
they called me "Castagnet"...

744
01:23:54,385 --> 01:23:57,739
That’s why I felt funny when you
advised me to wear bangs.

745
01:23:58,131 --> 01:24:01,536
Well, of course I didn’t know,
when I said "bangs"...

746
01:24:12,511 --> 01:24:14,355
She’s not that hot, after all.

747
01:24:14,435 --> 01:24:17,653
Don’t you think I would
be prettier as a brunette?

748
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:22,727
- Do you know what I’m going to do?
- Don’t be reckless, kid!

749
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:25,988
Since the bastard is
indulging in a passion,

750
01:24:26,068 --> 01:24:28,627
I’m going to offer him
a crime of passion.

751
01:24:28,707 --> 01:24:31,355
- Come, come, be reasonable!
- Like hell.

752
01:24:38,468 --> 01:24:40,591
Don’t be reckless, I said.

753
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,798
Take a shower, while you're at it.

754
01:24:48,117 --> 01:24:50,117
I'm coming.

755
01:24:55,102 --> 01:24:57,102
This bag's heavy!

756
01:24:57,533 --> 01:25:01,805
- No mistakes, I hope?
- No, all in 50's and 100's.

757
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:09,631
- Why are you here?
- To please you, my liege.

758
01:25:09,711 --> 01:25:11,711
"My liege."

759
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:17,205
The detective was right.

760
01:25:18,769 --> 01:25:20,963
You got your pimp shoes on.

761
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:26,053
- Where you headed?
- What did he tell you?

762
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:31,678
Looking for the sun?
With that cow, under her parasol?

763
01:25:36,109 --> 01:25:38,640
Listen, Germaine...
Don't do anything silly.

764
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,385
Germaine can't listen.
She's deaf.

765
01:25:41,465 --> 01:25:44,063
Dead!

766
01:26:32,047 --> 01:26:34,047
Goodbye, Castagnet.

767
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:51,989
So, tell me: how was it?

768
01:26:52,069 --> 01:26:56,766
- Crazy. Totally sexual.
- Good for you.

769
01:26:56,846 --> 01:26:59,112
But what with all that,
we’re going without a penny.

770
01:27:00,061 --> 01:27:02,238
I don’t get it: you’re saying you’ve
got bank accounts everywhere.

771
01:27:02,318 --> 01:27:04,958
You’re talking about Dreyfuss,
the Pommier Bank, the Credit Lyonnais.

772
01:27:05,038 --> 01:27:07,192
Where I’ve got an account,
they’ve got my picture.

773
01:27:07,272 --> 01:27:09,981
Hey, let’s go where you
don’t have an account.

774
01:27:54,392 --> 01:27:57,750
Marie! I’m getting angry,
Come back home!

775
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,231
Come back home now!

776
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:13,786
They threw a paving stone!
Two girls, with masks on.

777
01:28:13,866 --> 01:28:16,709
Masks? What kind of masks?
- Pinocchio!

778
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,783
Don’t you ever do things
like that again, Marie.

779
01:30:09,483 --> 01:30:11,805
You’ll end up breaking my heart.

780
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,063
From that day on,
the day Catherine lost Betty...

781
01:30:20,143 --> 01:30:24,691
the detective realized dark forces
would always pursue the girl.

782
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:28,532
Slowly, inexorably...
like a glacier on the move.

783
01:30:28,612 --> 01:30:31,685
She could only
elude them by moving on...

784
01:30:31,765 --> 01:30:35,032
anywhere... ceaselessly.

785
01:30:36,526 --> 01:30:40,667
A deadly whirl...
but that's how it had to be.

786
01:30:47,436 --> 01:30:51,219
Up north...
they crashed a police roadblock.

787
01:30:51,299 --> 01:30:53,904
For the detective,
it was a new

788
01:30:53,984 --> 01:30:56,579
and exhilarating experience.

789
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:10,106
We’re now putting
Herve Claude on the air

790
01:32:10,186 --> 01:32:12,278
so he can give us all
the latest information

791
01:32:12,358 --> 01:32:14,429
about the accomplice
of Betty Shapira,

792
01:32:14,509 --> 01:32:16,687
who was killed yesterday
during the deadly hold-up

793
01:32:16,767 --> 01:32:18,867
of the Credit
Commercial bank in Melun.

794
01:32:19,195 --> 01:32:21,195
Over to you, Claude.

795
01:32:21,897 --> 01:32:25,255
We just learned from a reliable
source that the said accomplice

796
01:32:25,335 --> 01:32:29,060
is supposed to be already wanted
for several other murders,

797
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:32,708
including Paul Hugo’s,
whose body was just discovered

798
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:35,128
by the police in a pond,
in the Brussels area.

799
01:32:35,208 --> 01:32:38,515
According to commissioner Cervin,

800
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:42,977
there could be a connection
between this case

801
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:45,424
and the strange disappearance
of Michel Meyerganz,

802
01:32:45,504 --> 01:32:47,744
in Monte-Carlo last year.

803
01:32:47,824 --> 01:32:51,962
The double murder in the
Black Forest is also remembered

804
01:32:52,042 --> 01:32:56,231
Cora Pallenberg and Jerry Beaufil
were killed the same night,

805
01:32:56,311 --> 01:32:59,209
September the 26th of last year.

806
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:02,521
The police incline to think
that the perpetrator

807
01:33:02,601 --> 01:33:06,698
of all those murders is
the same person

808
01:33:06,778 --> 01:33:10,199
Catherine Leiris,
born on December the 22nd, 1962,

809
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:12,572
convicted of robbery in 1979

810
01:33:12,652 --> 01:33:17,522
and incarcerated in the
Fleury-Merogis prison from 1979 to...

811
01:34:49,869 --> 01:34:52,695
So they drove for a long time,
going north by northeast,

812
01:34:52,775 --> 01:34:54,752
to a city that Catherine
might have known,

813
01:34:54,832 --> 01:34:58,611
but the existence of which had never
even been dreamed by the detective.

814
01:34:58,691 --> 01:35:01,302
But it really was called Charleville.

815
01:35:20,872 --> 01:35:24,530
The next month, Catherine
checked in the Hotel du Canal,

816
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:29,086
where she lived cloistered,
but for a short walk in the evenings.

817
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:37,269
How to find again the unfathomable
grace of Lucie Brentano,

818
01:35:37,349 --> 01:35:39,191
the radiance of Dorothee Orthiz,

819
01:35:39,271 --> 01:35:41,927
the beauty of Ariane Chevalier.

820
01:35:42,007 --> 01:35:45,176
In this sad and idle passer-by?

821
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,930
Enough to make one believe that this
girl seemed interested in nothing...

822
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:53,472
including herself. It's incredible.

823
01:36:22,765 --> 01:36:26,258
One day, the detective thought that
spiders were crawling up the walls,

824
01:36:26,338 --> 01:36:29,399
that the junkies jumped
in the gutters again.

825
01:36:30,169 --> 01:36:34,065
False alarm.
It was the 22nd of December.

826
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:36,691
Since nobody else thought about it,

827
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:39,222
Catherine was celebrating
her own birthday.

828
01:36:39,462 --> 01:36:42,031
Her dress was too loose fitting,
its flounces ludicrous,

829
01:36:42,111 --> 01:36:44,292
its pattern extravagant.

830
01:36:44,372 --> 01:36:47,360
My God!
Already one year since Rome!

831
01:36:47,838 --> 01:36:51,230
mused the detective, who thought
the whole thing was delicious.

832
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:56,560
Just think, two days ago
I was still in Vegas.

833
01:36:57,156 --> 01:36:59,156
At the "Flamingo."

834
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:03,014
It's better than here, you know.

835
01:37:03,094 --> 01:37:05,094
I know.

836
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:08,568
No kidding, sweetheart.
You know Vegas?

837
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:10,955
My father had an office there.

838
01:37:11,035 --> 01:37:13,523
A whole floor to himself,
on the Strip.

839
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:17,586
Buy me a Pimm's?

840
01:37:17,914 --> 01:37:21,815
- It's my birthday today.
- Julien!

841
01:37:21,895 --> 01:37:24,364
A Pimm's for the lady.

842
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:26,999
2.50 francs, plus the olives,
makes 3 francs.

843
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:29,079
I didn't order olives.

844
01:37:29,444 --> 01:37:31,587
She should go before she
makes a fool of herself,

845
01:37:31,667 --> 01:37:33,010
don't you think?

846
01:37:33,504 --> 01:37:35,504
Run away, quick.

847
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:39,371
- Who?
- The young girl at the bar.

848
01:37:40,049 --> 01:37:42,774
Anyway, there are
only young girls here.

849
01:37:47,788 --> 01:37:50,115
He died the evening
of my birthday.

850
01:37:51,509 --> 01:37:54,128
Over 1,000 people
came to the funeral.

851
01:37:55,243 --> 01:37:58,646
- Whose funeral?
- My father's.

852
01:38:02,352 --> 01:38:05,357
I'm sure nobody went
to Betty's funeral.

853
01:38:06,691 --> 01:38:08,933
It was probably very sad.

854
01:38:10,375 --> 01:38:12,755
What did those assholes
do with the mask?

855
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:20,901
Who put this here?

856
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:25,330
That odd man at the back.
He left right after.

857
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:27,517
He left you a note.

858
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:39,448
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARIE

859
01:38:45,881 --> 01:38:47,724
At this critical point
in their relationship...

860
01:38:47,804 --> 01:38:50,732
the ogre decided to
talk to the little girl.

861
01:38:50,812 --> 01:38:53,592
He asked,
"What are you going to do now?"

862
01:38:54,031 --> 01:38:56,031
I'm going home.

863
01:39:00,115 --> 01:39:02,474
But what does that mean,
"home?"

864
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:04,699
Her home.

865
01:39:06,484 --> 01:39:09,991
Catherine Nieris,
born on Dec. 22, 1962...

866
01:39:10,071 --> 01:39:13,882
in Bobigny... Seine St. Denis.

867
01:39:14,688 --> 01:39:18,855
How can she go back to the
cockroaches... the rotting walls...

868
01:39:18,935 --> 01:39:21,442
back to the slums?

869
01:39:41,357 --> 01:39:44,290
Server wanted -
Interesting salary - Tips

870
01:39:57,889 --> 01:39:58,980
No. Never seen her.

871
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:01,726
I'll leave the photos,
you get back to me.

872
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,160
Hello, reception.

873
01:41:04,737 --> 01:41:07,636
- Let's go.
- That money's not mine.

874
01:41:07,716 --> 01:41:10,418
I'm not doing it for
myself, either.

875
01:41:13,254 --> 01:41:15,708
I'll scream, I'll shout for help!

876
01:41:15,788 --> 01:41:19,413
I've shouted for help for 20 years.
No one ever answered.

877
01:41:53,619 --> 01:41:55,619
Come in.

878
01:41:59,442 --> 01:42:01,442
Ignore the mess.

879
01:42:04,674 --> 01:42:06,732
I can't offer you much.

880
01:42:07,370 --> 01:42:09,370
A Coke? Beer?

881
01:42:10,039 --> 01:42:12,235
Brandy?

882
01:42:16,574 --> 01:42:18,930
Make yourself at home.

883
01:42:21,649 --> 01:42:24,024
Perhaps you'd like a shower?

884
01:42:24,533 --> 01:42:28,150
A shower?
That's a dumb thing to suggest!

885
01:42:29,466 --> 01:42:31,466
We'll see...

886
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:35,806
She goes into the bathroom...
I go to the window.

887
01:42:46,154 --> 01:42:48,154
I live alone.

888
01:42:48,384 --> 01:42:50,384
My wife left me.

889
01:42:51,489 --> 01:42:53,489
Left with my daughter.

890
01:42:57,486 --> 01:42:59,513
I never saw them again.

891
01:43:02,644 --> 01:43:05,888
At first, it was very painful...
Now it's better.

892
01:43:09,217 --> 01:43:11,535
Don't fool with that.
It's loaded.

893
01:43:15,852 --> 01:43:18,209
Don't... It's loaded...

894
01:43:31,212 --> 01:43:35,550
What time you through? No!
What are your hours, miss?

895
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:40,198
When do you get off?
When does your shift end?

896
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:43,463
Pardon?

897
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:53,100
What would you like?

898
01:43:53,271 --> 01:43:55,401
Turkey in supreme
sauce, please.

899
01:43:55,481 --> 01:43:57,891
We don’t have any left.
- Oh?

900
01:44:00,798 --> 01:44:02,798
When do you get off?

901
01:44:03,517 --> 01:44:05,517
2:00 a. m.

902
01:44:06,082 --> 01:44:08,412
Mind meeting me for a drink?

903
01:44:09,453 --> 01:44:11,453
No..

904
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:21,110
That looks better.

905
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:23,946
You're right.
More appetizing than ours.

906
01:44:24,026 --> 01:44:26,284
Very well presented.

907
01:44:28,773 --> 01:44:31,349
I forgot... Don't wait in front.

908
01:44:31,429 --> 01:44:33,996
The staff leaves by the stage door.

909
01:44:34,076 --> 01:44:36,991
- At the rear.
- How will I know it?

910
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:40,413
The trash cans are yellow,
I'll be in blue.

911
01:45:25,182 --> 01:45:28,676
Say!
- Beg your pardon?

912
01:45:28,756 --> 01:45:31,923
You’re drinking my beer, sir.
- Excuse me, I...

913
01:45:32,003 --> 01:45:34,422
It’s no big deal.
You may finish it.

914
01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:41,383
- What time is it?
- 1:55.

915
01:46:32,723 --> 01:46:35,313
My girlfriend smoked those.

916
01:46:45,653 --> 01:46:49,164
- Does the smell of tobacco bother you?
- No. My own smell is bothering me.

917
01:46:49,244 --> 01:46:51,804
The smell of French fries:
it permeates everything.

918
01:46:53,071 --> 01:46:55,071
Where do you want us to go?

919
01:46:55,692 --> 01:47:00,903
Maybe you’ve got an idea?
To a club? Your place? Mine?

920
01:47:00,983 --> 01:47:03,987
- I live in a hotel.
- So do I.

921
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:06,110
Let’s make it your place.

922
01:47:07,114 --> 01:47:09,049
My name's Catherine...

923
01:47:09,129 --> 01:47:11,129
Catherine Leiris.

924
01:47:17,399 --> 01:47:21,334
When you asked what time I got off,
I thought I knew you.

925
01:47:21,559 --> 01:47:25,283
- I've never been in the "Miami".
- I didn't mean there.

926
01:47:25,363 --> 01:47:29,316
People think they know me:
I'm so ordinary looking.

927
01:47:30,711 --> 01:47:32,711
I look like everybody.

928
01:47:34,073 --> 01:47:36,073
When I grow a beard...

929
01:47:37,128 --> 01:47:39,408
I'm like any bearded guy.

930
01:47:56,268 --> 01:47:58,268
Ignore the mess.

931
01:48:12,889 --> 01:48:14,889
Sit down.

932
01:48:17,905 --> 01:48:20,233
What would you like?

933
01:48:21,437 --> 01:48:23,652
I have a nice little white wine.

934
01:48:23,732 --> 01:48:25,732
A Coke?

935
01:48:25,826 --> 01:48:28,571
A drop of brandy? No, a Coke...

936
01:48:29,031 --> 01:48:31,031
Brandy.

937
01:48:46,874 --> 01:48:48,894
Won't you take off your jacket?

938
01:48:50,014 --> 01:48:52,842
- I'll take it off.
- I didn't mean...

939
01:48:52,922 --> 01:48:56,131
Then let's change the subject.

940
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:59,270
Just talk.

941
01:48:59,839 --> 01:49:01,839
About you?

942
01:49:04,922 --> 01:49:06,922
OK...

943
01:49:07,066 --> 01:49:09,066
Let's go.

944
01:49:11,813 --> 01:49:14,151
I wasn't always a waitress.

945
01:49:14,815 --> 01:49:16,815
I've been waited on.

946
01:49:18,172 --> 01:49:20,870
My father was
an international thief.

947
01:49:21,271 --> 01:49:23,830
Police everywhere
chased him for years.

948
01:49:25,285 --> 01:49:27,336
On my birthday...

949
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:30,253
he collapsed,
his pockets full of diamonds.

950
01:49:30,333 --> 01:49:32,736
He said: "Happy birthday,"
and died.

951
01:49:34,629 --> 01:49:36,629
You loved him?

952
01:49:37,763 --> 01:49:39,763
Yes.

953
01:49:43,046 --> 01:49:45,046
That's all crap.

954
01:49:45,794 --> 01:49:49,111
My father was a famous doctor...
a blind pianist...

955
01:49:50,156 --> 01:49:53,278
A brilliant architect...
My father was, what else was he?

956
01:49:58,506 --> 01:50:00,994
But I really loved him.

957
01:50:04,323 --> 01:50:06,708
I'm terribly sorry...
maybe you wanted cookies?

958
01:50:06,788 --> 01:50:08,869
No thanks, I'm fine.

959
01:50:09,677 --> 01:50:11,728
If you feel like resting...

960
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:14,372
go right ahead.

961
01:50:20,391 --> 01:50:22,622
Unless you'd like a shower?

962
01:50:27,336 --> 01:50:31,607
- The French fries?
- Not at all... I...

963
01:50:32,044 --> 01:50:34,044
It's a good idea.

964
01:50:37,628 --> 01:50:41,639
I'm in a luxury hotel...
but there's no shower.

965
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:49,100
There's a clean washcloth.
And a mitten for rub-downs.

966
01:50:49,762 --> 01:50:52,336
Careful... The hot and cold knobs
have been reversed.

967
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,676
Red is cold, blue's hot.

968
01:50:54,756 --> 01:50:57,039
Never fails!

969
01:51:18,476 --> 01:51:22,127
- You married?
- Yes...

970
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,206
I mean, no... I was.

971
01:51:26,974 --> 01:51:28,974
My wife left me...

972
01:51:30,145 --> 01:51:32,145
a long time ago.

973
01:51:38,939 --> 01:51:40,939
She left with my daughter...

974
01:51:42,901 --> 01:51:44,901
Marie...

975
01:51:46,306 --> 01:51:48,434
Back in 1958.

976
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:56,784
Marie died in 1962.

977
01:51:57,644 --> 01:51:59,662
It must have been painful.

978
01:52:00,648 --> 01:52:02,648
Yes.

979
01:52:06,531 --> 01:52:09,383
- You got over it?
- No.

980
01:52:16,352 --> 01:52:18,858
I lost the only photo I had of her.

981
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,365
It was taken in 1962...

982
01:52:22,445 --> 01:52:26,465
Just before the vacation,
a school picture...

983
01:52:27,167 --> 01:52:29,963
She had her arms crossed,
like a sad clown?

984
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:32,043
Not at all.

985
01:52:32,330 --> 01:52:34,700
Marie was very cheerful.

986
01:52:44,119 --> 01:52:46,119
Look what I found...

987
01:52:54,403 --> 01:52:56,691
Don't fool with it.
It's loaded.

988
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:05,571
Calm down.
Calm down, troubled soul...

989
01:54:35,768 --> 01:54:38,207
Stop, Marie, please...

990
01:55:53,931 --> 01:55:55,931
I know where I saw you...

991
01:55:56,376 --> 01:55:58,376
You're the photographer.

992
01:55:59,296 --> 01:56:01,150
Yes...

993
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:03,230
In the park, in Brussels.

994
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:09,712
By the carousel...
The Hugo case...

995
01:56:51,064 --> 01:56:53,821
I didn’t hear any news.
I phoned.

996
01:56:57,248 --> 01:57:00,260
Mrs. Schmidt-Boulanger told me
you didn’t work for her anymore.

997
01:57:06,294 --> 01:57:09,871
- L'oeil...
- Yes, Madeleine?

998
01:57:11,568 --> 01:57:13,568
What happened?

999
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:16,858
I lost the photo of Marie.

1000
01:57:22,505 --> 01:57:24,505
I'm telling you this for us.

1001
01:57:24,993 --> 01:57:26,993
If you've lost the photo...

1002
01:57:27,289 --> 01:57:29,347
maybe we should stop
phoning each other?

1003
01:57:29,427 --> 01:57:31,427
Maybe you're right.

1004
01:57:33,756 --> 01:57:36,113
- What'll you do now?
- Nothing.

1005
01:57:37,083 --> 01:57:39,142
Wait.

1006
01:57:46,129 --> 01:57:48,185
He waited less than 3 years.

1007
01:57:48,265 --> 01:57:53,482
He knew it was his last night on earth
when he finally saw the door...

1008
01:57:58,094 --> 01:58:00,516
Marie!

1009
01:58:02,372 --> 01:58:04,229
Catherine!

1010
01:58:04,309 --> 01:58:06,345
Careful... It's him.

1011
01:58:06,425 --> 01:58:10,304
He opened the door...
and went into the photo...

1012
01:58:10,384 --> 01:58:12,384
Here he comes.
