1
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:07,045
I was a bit tense.

2
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:09,238
Will they let us do it again?

3
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:12,479
We'll do it as often as we like.

4
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,922
Adrien, finish in the visitor's room
in 5 minutes.

5
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:18,363
I love you.

6
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:23,124
In spite of the aggro
that's brought you?

7
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,558
That'll all soon be over.

8
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:30,796
Amélie drew this for you.

9
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:34,041
This how she see's us.

10
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:36,359
When you get out...

11
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,519
So, was it good?

12
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:45,084
The next time we'll make it a 3...

13
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:46,956
or a 4.

14
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,485
What's the big idea?.

15
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,479
You wanna leave here
in a coffin?

16
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:34,440
So what?
Makes more for you.

17
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:38,119
You know where
the goddamn cash is.

18
00:02:38,887 --> 00:02:40,479
Is it safe?

19
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:42,758
I can put some buddies
on the job.

20
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,043
They'll guard it
'til we get out.

21
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:47,159
I wouldn't trust
any buddies of yours.

22
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:48,755
Yeah!

23
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:53,236
And any reason why I
should trust YOU?

24
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:07,761
That's a nice drawing.

25
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:08,957
Is it your daughter's?

26
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:11,243
I didn't think
we were on speaking terms.

27
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,723
It was good like that.

28
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,646
You know...

29
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,556
...there's not much nice
in the world.

30
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,440
You gotta hang on to it.

31
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:24,962
Come on you two,

32
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:25,998
out!

33
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,285
Time for a walk

34
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:31,036
Why I would go out today?

35
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:32,716
Nice weather.

36
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,486
You know the risk
I'd be taking.

37
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,756
You didn't have to assault that girl.

38
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:40,603
I did NOT do it.

39
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,366
Yeah...I was forgetting.

40
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,644
And I s'pose your stickups
were done by your twin brother.

41
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:47,240
Or you wanted to pay for

42
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:48,960
your sick mother's operation.

43
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:50,196
Can I go now?

44
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,879
OK you scum...
move it!

45
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,319
Everyone here?

46
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:03,086
Let's go!

47
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:14,283
[Speaking Russian]

48
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,556
Isn't your rock-spider pal coming?

49
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,126
Scared, is he?

50
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:28,596
He's saying...

51
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:32,164
I don't give a fuck
what apes say.

52
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,524
Translate that!

53
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:13,760
I'm innocent.

54
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,516
I know I'll be cleared eventually.

55
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:20,526
I've got to survive
in this rat-hole.

56
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:24,282
I'm called a rock-spider.
They want me dead.

57
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:29,560
I continue praying my ordeal
will come to an end.

58
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:34,605
You sure?

59
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:57,757
You get out.

60
00:05:58,127 --> 00:05:59,242
Without making touble.

61
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,162
If you don't wanna cop shit...

62
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:03,642
...then scram.

63
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:16,996
Don't you move.

64
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:26,758
What do you want?

65
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:31,201
As you don't go out,

66
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,205
we've come to
pay you a visit.

67
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:40,603
[Russian]

68
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,161
You hear...repeat it.

69
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,723
"Spasiba."

70
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,440
Go on...repeat it.

71
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:47,642
Spasiba.

72
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,157
That means thank you.
You'll repeat it.

73
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:51,357
Understood?

74
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:00,844
We'll see if the little girls
get you excited now.

75
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:18,083
That's enough.

76
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,800
Qu'est-ce tu veux?.

77
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:28,926
We better go down
before there's serious shit.

78
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,923
That's enough...stop!

79
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:48,039
Shut up...get out!

80
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,004
You shouldn't've
got involved.

81
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,081
6 months more.

82
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:23,880
Because you defended him.

83
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:26,365
That's not what
the report says.

84
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,046
The employment agency's
got nothing for me.

85
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:32,880
I can't afford the nanny.

86
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,161
I can't afford
the speech therapist.

87
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:39,320
And we've got all
that money.

88
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:45,759
Do you realise that
this guy Franck Adrien,

89
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:49,044
went into hiding near our place
after his stick-up.

90
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:51,760
In Nièvre.

91
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:54,887
He's been put with me
to protect me.

92
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,677
I'm there to protect you.

93
00:08:58,047 --> 00:08:59,560
That's true.

94
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,641
Why don't you tell me
where you've hidden it?

95
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:10,115
I'd just take what we need.

96
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:15,845
Trust me for once.

97
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:21,239
The reason I'm here's
because I was trusting.

98
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:24,756
I don't get to sleep.
Every other day,

99
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:27,038
they forget my medication.

100
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:29,967
The lawyer's going to see
what he can do.

101
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:32,645
You believe I'm going
to get out of this?

102
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,759
Of course.

103
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,477
Her mother said to the judge
that she'd invented everything.

104
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:41,407
He's going to question her
and she's going to crack.

105
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:43,837
You're getting out...
it's going to happen.

106
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,566
You'll give me a child.

107
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:51,922
You didn't need to
bring her in here.

108
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:53,276
This is no place for her.

109
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:54,762
She wanted to come.

110
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:56,762
What'd she say?

111
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:58,480
She wanted to see her father.

112
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,720
While I'm in here
I'm not her father.

113
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,276
I don't want her to see me
as a convict.

114
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,363
I'm sorry, Franck.

115
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:10,766
We miss you so.

116
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:14,198
I miss both of you, too.

117
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,045
Amélie, you'll fall over.

118
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:44,398
Careful!

119
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:47,236
What a cutie!

120
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,918
What's your name?

121
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,439
She can't reply.

122
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:55,365
She has speaking problems.

123
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,124
She's going to
learn to speak.

124
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:00,159
It'll take time.

125
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,837
She may be right
to take her time.

126
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,556
Say goodbye.

127
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,883
'Bye, Amélie.

128
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,398
You make a move
and you're a vegetable.

129
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,561
You wanna kill me, Novick?

130
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,798
Don't you wanna get your dough?

131
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:55,164
Exactly...the Russki won't miss you.

132
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:57,279
I wanna know
where the cash's stashed.

133
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:03,158
So my buddies
can take care of it.

134
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,443
Look, they're not far away.

135
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,238
You've got nothing to say?

136
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:14,602
Go fuck yourself.

137
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:15,723
Cough up!

138
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,965
You know Marco's hideout

139
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:22,957
I'm listening.

140
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,999
It is under the false floor.

141
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:21,196
G'day, Franck.

142
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,284
How long've I been here?

143
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:27,642
4 days.

144
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,445
And Novick?

145
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,486
In solitary.

146
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,763
He only got a week.

147
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:38,446
So he get's out in 3 days...
gotta get outta here quick.

148
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,805
You're worried
about your cash?

149
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:46,956
Whadda you talking about?

150
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,364
The reason you're in here.

151
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,922
Novick want's to pinch it.

152
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,925
Do you want any help?

153
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:00,163
How?

154
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:02,485
I'm getting out!

155
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,720
The girl's retracted her story.

156
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:07,237
She made it all up
from A to Z.

157
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,717
There won't even
be a new trial.

158
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:14,724
I want to give you
my phone number.

159
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,286
Call when you get out.

160
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:18,483
This is not
a good idea.

161
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,080
Why?

162
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,999
I won't forget
what you did.

163
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:25,116
Let me help you.
I don't owe you anything.

164
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:28,001
Yes, that's quite right.

165
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,157
You're right.

166
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:32,760
OK.

167
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,166
Cheers.

168
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,199
Call me.

169
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:40,766
There's something
you could do.

170
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,321
it's...

171
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,803
call my wife.

172
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:51,003
Tell her I'm well and that
Novick's watching her.

173
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,325
And then also,

174
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,286
she should see my father,
he'll help her.

175
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,399
Could you do that for me?

176
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,565
Sure,
you can trust me.

177
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,357
Nothing's changed.
We even tidied your cell.

178
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:57,835
Novick's out?

179
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:02,239
He said you wanted
to take his share.

180
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:03,602
He wanted to kill you.

181
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:06,680
He's been transferred to Fresnes.
Happy?

182
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:19,524
Cigarettes?
I been waiting 3 days.

183
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,880
Adrien.

184
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:30,526
Visitors room.

185
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:58,445
You can feel the evil in here.

186
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:00,245
The colour-scheme
doesn't help.

187
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,239
Nobody made you come.

188
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,156
Manuel Carrega,
constabulary captain.

189
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:10,726
Has something
happened to Anna?

190
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,839
Anna?

191
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,646
I've got questions regarding
Jean-Louis Maurel.

192
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:19,996
Maurel?.

193
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,118
He shared your cell.

194
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,882
You know he was accused of raping
a little girl?

195
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:28,166
Everyone knew about it.
He's been found innocent.

196
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:33,160
What did he tell you
about his life?

197
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:35,325
I wasn't interested.

198
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:38,718
He told me he was from Nevers,
I've lived there and we talked a bit about it.

199
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:41,681
He mention any places,
people?

200
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,325
What are you on about?

201
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,838
I'm not on about him...
but I am about his next victims.

202
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:50,760
Wadsn't he the victim?

203
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,000
Legally, yes.

204
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:59,039
Do I trust
what he's capable of?

205
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:01,637
Didn't the girl
retract her story?

206
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:08,682
Maurel's wife
managed to get to her.

207
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:10,766
You haven't charged her?

208
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:13,403
I'm looking for proof.

209
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,081
I need your testimony.

210
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:17,282
What have you seen

211
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,797
or heard while you
were with him?

212
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:21,116
He seemed quite normal.

213
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:22,602
He's a manipulator.

214
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:23,717
He's cunning.

215
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,284
He's fooled more than one person.

216
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,842
He hasn't fooled me.

217
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:33,080
20 years ago I came to France
for a woman.

218
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,204
She'd left a guy
who beat her up.

219
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:39,396
I warned that her ex
was dangerous.

220
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,519
For nothing.

221
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,076
He set fire to
where we lived.

222
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,204
She's dead.

223
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:48,722
I've survived.

224
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:54,240
I've escaped death

225
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:55,926
to help save others.

226
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:05,957
If anything else

227
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:07,043
comes back to you.

228
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:08,606
And if you'd just come
from the asylum?

229
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:13,006
Believe me...
I'm not the mad one.

230
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:25,085
The answering machine contains
too many messages.

231
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:28,558
Please try again later.
Goodbye.

232
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:37,837
Come on.

233
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:00,961
I'm taking you to the meeting.

234
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:03,882
He had to come
Were are you going?

235
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,646
Not far.
He'll pay double.

236
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:20,161
Cinderella following Big Sister, out.

237
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,645
Waiting for Prince Charming.

238
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,685
We'll follow and join up.

239
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:31,844
OK

240
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,556
Is it far?
It's here.

241
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:01,359
You want to stay?

242
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,165
It's him who says what
he wants.

243
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,002
She's perfect.

244
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,846
You can leave us.

245
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:20,516
Will I move?

246
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:22,366
We don't know if it's him.

247
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:25,642
What's she doing?

248
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:27,520
She's confirming.

249
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,236
Let me do it.

250
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,166
You start undressing first.

251
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:41,482
Your turn.

252
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:49,243
I'm thirsty.

253
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,563
Could I get a glass
of water?

254
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:52,956
It's Costa, go!

255
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,443
We've got him, boys!

256
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,323
Don't move!
Go, go!

257
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:10,881
Turn over, you fuck!

258
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:14,355
I wanna see your hands!

259
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:18,317
Move it!

260
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:20,839
Move it!

261
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,365
All OK?
He's in the bag.

262
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:31,759
The Corsican was right.

263
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:34,123
You were perfect.

264
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:23,686
Come on,
get a move on.

265
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:24,996
You stay there.

266
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:27,477
Nico,

267
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:28,996
a bit of privacy.

268
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:08,397
[Russian]

269
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:11,885
I'm not translating.

270
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:52,403
Vous êtes 3!

271
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:38,680
Franck.

272
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:41,040
I can fix everything.

273
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,283
Nico!

274
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,444
Let me out!

275
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:57,796
They're going to kill me!

276
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,203
Let me out!

277
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:04,566
Nico, open the door!

278
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,044
I'll kill you, you fucker!

279
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:09,363
Nico!
Shit.

280
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,646
Ça va, chef?.

281
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:34,882
2 more.

282
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,442
The Costas'll spend Christmas
in the clink.

283
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:38,437
Hang on...

284
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:40,684
René's more cunning.

285
00:28:41,047 --> 00:28:42,878
We'll need to be more cunning
to catch him..

286
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:43,918
Exactly.

287
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:49,721
Has The Holy Ghost
finished with your cover?

288
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:52,518
He wants Claire downstairs.

289
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,758
And whadda YOU want?

290
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:56,765
Couldn't ask for more.

291
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,082
The prisoner

292
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:00,403
who got out
dressed as a guard.

293
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:04,040
Franck Adrien, in
for the bank

294
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:05,083
stickup.

295
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:06,721
I know.

296
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:07,803
So?

297
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:11,359
He had 2 months to go.
He's not ready.

298
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:14,326
He's going to make
the usual mistakes

299
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,200
getting back the hidden loot.

300
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:19,919
Anyone can catch him.
I'm staying on the Costas.

301
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:21,800
The boss wants the best.

302
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:24,720
The troop that's just had
3 major convictions...

303
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:26,600
you and your team.

304
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:27,882
If it's so simple,

305
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:30,124
you'll be back with the Costas
in no time.

306
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:46,922
Thank you, monsieur.

307
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,357
That's OK.

308
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:53,641
Would you know
where to find the eggs?

309
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:55,963
They're at the end, through there.

310
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,647
Would it be too much to ask
to come with me?

311
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:03,846
I always get lost
with all these aisles.

312
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:06,598
Yes, follow me.
- Melissa!

313
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:09,002
I'm waiting for you.

314
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:10,762
Sorry, gotta go.

315
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:14,483
Doesn't matter,
I'll find them myself.

316
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:29,637
The man thwarted the security checks.

317
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:32,396
Franck Adrien, convicted
for the holdup of the Savings Bank

318
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,884
didn't have more than 8 months of prison left.

319
00:30:36,247 --> 00:30:39,876
He may be armed and
is considered dangerous.

320
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:46,320
Got it...
au revoir, monsieur.

321
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,439
D'you think
he'll understand?

322
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:03,356
Nothing to worry about.
The police have good info, now.

323
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,116
Christine,

324
00:31:07,487 --> 00:31:09,876
we knew he'd get out
one day.

325
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:12,123
i've got everything worked out.

326
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:16,039
He doesn't know what's waiting for him.
Trust me.

327
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:18,638
Nobody's going to take our
happiness away.

328
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:23,566
She's sleeping?

329
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:26,116
She looks so adorable
like that.

330
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:28,997
Thanks for giving her to me.

331
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,198
He's got very few connections.

332
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:33,597
He avoids his relations.

333
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:35,116
His wife?
Yeah.

334
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:38,081
Anna Martens.
She used to visit him.

335
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:40,403
She's unemployed,
takes care of the kid.

336
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,239
The address she gave

337
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:43,881
is phony.

338
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:45,560
And his accomplices?

339
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:47,845
Guests of the state.

340
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,157
Jérôme Novick
was at Mérancourt.

341
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:51,556
It wasn't a great  love affair.

342
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:54,202
He attacked Adrien
with a screwdriver.

343
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:55,323
Nice boy.

344
00:31:55,687 --> 00:31:56,961
I'm going to question him.

345
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,035
How much did they get?

346
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:00,237
2 million.

347
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:01,323
2 million!

348
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,121
We've only got back pocket money.

349
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:07,555
He's going to want
to get the money back.

350
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,202
Watch the places he knows.

351
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:11,317
Houses, bars.

352
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:13,717
His picture's
everywhere.

353
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:16,237
I've asked for
his visiting room videos.

354
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:18,722
Ça, c'est quoi?.

355
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:21,647
Those who could've seen him
in their area.

356
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:22,963
100 calls.

357
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,675
Dobbing-in's a national sport.

358
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:28,405
Has the media spoken to Anna?

359
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,157
No.

360
00:32:31,527 --> 00:32:34,644
We got an address for Anna
in the suburbs.

361
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:54,240
Who's he?

362
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,000
Anna?.

363
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:49,436
Hey, watch where you're going!

364
00:33:49,687 --> 00:33:52,440
What's going on?

365
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:53,876
Turn them out!

366
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:08,920
Nobody leaves.

367
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:10,362
Are you staying here?

368
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:12,206
No, I'm covering you.

369
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:35,360
Police, step aside.

370
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:39,002
Out of the way!

371
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,839
That's it.

372
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:45,358
Police, open up!

373
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:10,126
No one!

374
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:12,924
Come here.

375
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,200
Look.

376
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:21,956
We just missed him.

377
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:37,279
Marco!
Coming!

378
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:45,043
He's not far away.

379
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:48,120
We need reinforcements,
He's in the area.

380
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:50,762
With luick, we'll be back
in an hour.

381
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:53,846
Avec de la chance, dans une heure, on est rentrés.

382
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,275
Don't move!

383
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:25,636
Don't you move.

384
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:28,642
Let me past.

385
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,879
Of course!
Anything else?

386
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:34,640
I can't go back to prison
now.

387
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:37,842
Don't move!

388
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:40,923
I've learnt something

389
00:36:41,287 --> 00:36:42,356
very important.

390
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,042
You can't shoot,
I'm not threatening you

391
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,040
You can see
I'm unarmed

392
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:03,723
Adrien is on the street.
Warn everyone!

393
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,200
There he is!
Stop him!

394
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:53,636
You OK?

395
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:56,082
Close the next station!

396
00:39:56,447 --> 00:39:59,245
If the train stops
he'll get off.

397
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:36,766
Is he crazy?

398
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:11,240
Divide up the zone
and set up road blocks.

399
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:15,521
I know,
good...thanks.

400
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,201
He's probably already far away.
Here...

401
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:19,921
...yours?

402
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:24,003
He's crazy.

403
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,757
Something's driving him.
Something really strong.

404
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:33,647
"Anna, wherever you are,
I'll find you."

405
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,725
She's cleared off
with the cash.

406
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:37,876
Two for the price of one?

407
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:41,683
Yeah, that'll make
The Holy Ghost happy.

408
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:13,842
Yes?

409
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:17,399
Why did you do it?

410
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:20,606
Franck, I knew
you'd call.

411
00:44:20,847 --> 00:44:21,677
How are you?

412
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:25,086
Tell me,
why did you do it?

413
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,878
Why did you kill her?

414
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:31,879
It was all her fault.

415
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:36,606
Thank God...
I know how to read people.

416
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:39,202
Your wife was unreliable.

417
00:44:39,647 --> 00:44:42,207
She would have
given you problems.

418
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:47,286
I chose to save you
from all that.

419
00:44:48,007 --> 00:44:50,043
What've you done
with Amélie?

420
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:54,075
What've you done with
my little daughter?

421
00:44:54,487 --> 00:44:55,966
Where is she, Maurel?

422
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:57,920
Have you killed her?

423
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:01,603
She's a lovely little thing.
I love her very much.

424
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:03,678
I shan't do her
any harm at all.

425
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:06,885
Unless you try
to find me.

426
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:45,043
What is it?

427
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,637
He wants us to grab Adrien
on his return.

428
00:45:47,887 --> 00:45:48,922
He's in Corsica.

429
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:50,800
I'd love to go down
to Corsica.

430
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,202
Anna's scrap of paper?

431
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:53,966
Amélie's drawings.

432
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:56,402
Naïve style endowed with a certain potential.

433
00:45:57,927 --> 00:45:59,155
Letters for her guy

434
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:00,755
that she hadn't sent.

435
00:46:01,127 --> 00:46:02,879
Love letters.

436
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:07,116
"I understand your gesture.
It's a proof of love."

437
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:08,317
The stickup.

438
00:46:08,687 --> 00:46:11,724
Why hadn't she posted
this deathless prose?

439
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:14,398
To be read in prison?

440
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:15,404
Not on.

441
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:16,404
They aren't the words

442
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:20,476
of a woman stabbing
someone in the back.

443
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:21,518
And Novick?

444
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:23,837
A heap of new insults.

445
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:26,562
It's a put-up job between
Adrien and his chick.

446
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:29,964
We know the addresses
he's given,

447
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:31,077
except for this one.

448
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:34,077
Le Pré-sur-Lamure?

449
00:46:34,447 --> 00:46:36,199
What's that?
Their hide-out

450
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:37,761
after the bank job.

451
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:54,602
Martin, go round!

452
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:08,317
What's this?

453
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:15,526
What's this bullshit?

454
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:33,003
[Russian]

455
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:35,277
No thanks.

456
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:06,284
Are your reinforcements coming?
They're coming.

457
00:48:06,647 --> 00:48:08,080
The policeman's refrain.

458
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,596
Are we gonna find the loot?

459
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:10,882
If it's not already gone.

460
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:14,600
What's that?

461
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:20,005
Why've you come?

462
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:23,239
It's nothing to do with your daughter.
What would you know?

463
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:24,960
Best you go home.

464
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:27,681
We should be Corsican.

465
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:29,321
There's something here!

466
00:48:31,527 --> 00:48:33,995
Capitain, come here.
Stay there.

467
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:42,122
Look.

468
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:49,925
Robert, no!
Pull him back!

469
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:55,643
Nobody touch anything.

470
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,322
It was his daughter?
Yeah. Julie.

471
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:15,326
Disappeared. He'd been hoping
she was just a runaway.

472
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:22,081
The guy who did that
is a monster.

473
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:27,397
Is it one of Adrien's victims?

474
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:30,081
No way that it fits Adrien's profile.

475
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:33,205
He has a wife
and a disabled child.

476
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:34,966
That doesn't fit with a killer

477
00:49:35,207 --> 00:49:37,437
There are always exceptions.

478
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,279
There are some connections.

479
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:43,200
He was living in the area when
Julie disappeared.

480
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,644
We found his DNA
on the map and the jacket.

481
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:49,283
That's not all.
What else?

482
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:52,998
There are 2 other maps
of areas way up in the mountains.

483
00:49:53,287 --> 00:49:55,084
Maybe we'll find
other bodies.

484
00:49:55,447 --> 00:49:57,165
We're not going to get
carried away

485
00:49:57,407 --> 00:50:00,080
If it's a serial killer,
they'll want to bring in the Feds.

486
00:50:00,327 --> 00:50:01,840
They'd want the file.

487
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,004
We have to get him now.

488
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,720
Listen, Claire.

489
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:08,481
They don't teach this
at police school,

490
00:50:08,727 --> 00:50:12,003
but next time, this guy
doesn't get to get away.

491
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:14,240
Understood?

492
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:15,636
Quite understood.

493
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,525
Have a good day.

494
00:50:41,687 --> 00:50:42,961
I don't want to hurt  you.

495
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,118
What the fuck
are you doing here?

496
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:47,722
You're going to help me
find Maurel.

497
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,358
Where are your guns?

498
00:50:50,607 --> 00:50:51,801
I don't have any.

499
00:50:52,047 --> 00:50:54,959
Don't take me for an idiot,
where are they?

500
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:57,085
They're there.

501
00:50:57,327 --> 00:50:59,318
In the cupboard.

502
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:07,676
Go.

503
00:51:09,247 --> 00:51:11,636
He always lived
in the area.

504
00:51:12,007 --> 00:51:14,919
I met him 5 years ago.

505
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:19,240
I questioned him about
a girl from Dijon.

506
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:28,721
Sylvie Desmée.

507
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,362
He'd been seen
talking to her.

508
00:51:31,727 --> 00:51:33,206
I smelled a rat.

509
00:51:33,447 --> 00:51:35,915
Maurel raised
too many questions.

510
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:38,676
He lied about details.

511
00:51:39,047 --> 00:51:42,278
I sensed that he was
playing with me.

512
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:44,119
He was a bad one.

513
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:49,483
The girl was never found...
no body, no proof.

514
00:51:49,727 --> 00:51:52,878
There were the other
disappearances.

515
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,084
The resemblance is striking.

516
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:03,880
It's been admitted
that it was a serial killer.

517
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:08,399
But a cop investigates facts,
not potential suspects.

518
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,439
You've gone ahead anyway?

519
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:14,005
Quietly. Got nowhere for a long time.

520
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:15,885
He was invisible.

521
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:20,325
No record, town hall official, liked by all.

522
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:23,155
He was never far away
when the disappearances occurred.

523
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:24,597
Finally,

524
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,561
2 bodies were found
a month apart.

525
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:30,122
I brought Maurel in,

526
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:33,404
but his DNA didn't match.

527
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:34,796
For the second time,

528
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:36,441
he trapped us.

529
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:40,561
His sperm sample was at the station,

530
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:44,044
Next day it'd disappeared.
I was suspected.

531
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:46,276
At the same time,

532
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:49,241
he brought a complaint against me
for harassment.

533
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:51,360
I was dismissed.

534
00:52:51,727 --> 00:52:54,116
I'm not allowed
to live near him.

535
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:55,436
You're no longer
in the constabulary?

536
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,120
No, I lied to you.

537
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:00,959
I investigate privately.

538
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:04,478
Bugger! I was hoping
you'd be able to help me.

539
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,086
The little girl's 5.

540
00:53:07,327 --> 00:53:09,318
She doesn't look like these girls...

541
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:10,761
Could he harm her?

542
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:13,645
She's not his normal victim type.

543
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:17,277
If he wanted to have a good time,
he wouldn't hesitate.

544
00:53:18,247 --> 00:53:19,316
I've got the phone number.

545
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:20,756
An old constabulary captain's

546
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:22,401
maybe got some contacts?

547
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,002
Want a snort?

548
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:33,206
[Russian] - Thanks!

549
00:53:36,887 --> 00:53:38,639
It's good stuff.

550
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:43,837
The paper?

551
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:48,446
You know him?

552
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:49,563
The constabulary have

553
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,157
found 2 more bodies.

554
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:56,605
Sylvie Desmée and Karine
Garcia, reported missing.

555
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:59,315
This is a serial killer for sure!

556
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,841
Thanks , I'm on it.

557
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:11,046
A truck driver dropped Adrien
at Luzon, in Nièvre.

558
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:12,886
You coming?

559
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:15,277
Yeah, coming.

560
00:54:20,207 --> 00:54:21,435
I've come to see Bourgoin.

561
00:54:21,687 --> 00:54:24,201
You got a serial killer for 'im?

562
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:54,275
Bourgoin,
Luzon Constabulary office.

563
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:57,280
I need information
on a suspect's number.

564
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,964
It's me.
You got something?

565
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:30,885
The line's been dead
for 48 hours.

566
00:55:31,247 --> 00:55:33,203
He used it 12 times.

567
00:55:33,567 --> 00:55:36,001
The last time was to
Pré-sur-Lamure.

568
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:38,681
One of my hideouts.
What else?

569
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:40,366
Several calls

570
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:41,876
to the Alpes-Maritimes region.

571
00:55:42,247 --> 00:55:43,726
Where in Alpes-Maritimes?

572
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:46,999
There's an area of 40 k's
around a  village.

573
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:48,482
Chasseignes.

574
00:55:48,847 --> 00:55:50,724
That's maybe where he's living.

575
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:54,644
He takes a medication,
Xyrex.

576
00:55:54,887 --> 00:55:57,401
He was jumpy
when he didn't get it.

577
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,478
Is there a pharmacy
in Chasseignes?

578
00:56:12,407 --> 00:56:15,558
There are the cops everywhere.
You reported me?

579
00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:17,201
No I didn't.

580
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:19,523
Where's your gun?

581
00:56:19,887 --> 00:56:22,720
A gun's against regu...
Stuff your regulations.

582
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:25,157
I wouldn't need
to depend on you.

583
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:45,638
Carrega?.

584
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:49,156
How come you're here?
I was looking for Bourgoin.

585
00:57:49,407 --> 00:57:51,477
He's directing the search.
The search?

586
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:54,600
The fugitive's been reported
in the area.

587
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:55,802
He may have killed

588
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:56,917
3 young girls.

589
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:57,917
What do you mean?

590
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,005
Including Sylvie Desmée.

591
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:01,966
You remember her.

592
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,084
I'm going to give you a hand.

593
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:08,362
Carrega... you forgotten
you don't work here any more?

594
00:58:27,927 --> 00:58:29,679
Take the lane.

595
00:58:32,727 --> 00:58:34,365
We're taking the lane
with the tall hedges.

596
00:58:56,887 --> 00:58:59,117
Your guns,
over the hedge.

597
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:01,437
Hurry up!

598
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:02,718
Go on!

599
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:04,482
On the ground!

600
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:08,286
On the ground!

601
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:10,525
Stay down or...

602
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:13,321
Or you'll strangle me
like the others?

603
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:15,205
What are you talking about?

604
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:19,406
Sylvie Desmée, Karine Garcia,
they ring a bell?

605
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:23,961
What are you talking about?
Your DNA on the maps

606
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,085
in your old hideout.

607
00:59:26,447 --> 00:59:29,519
HQ to Bravo 2.
Put me on to Capitain Linée.

608
00:59:32,287 --> 00:59:33,640
Bugger!

609
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:37,918
He's fucked you
like he's fucked me.

610
00:59:41,087 --> 00:59:42,042
Stop!

611
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:43,601
All units!

612
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:44,677
Stop!

613
00:59:53,207 --> 00:59:54,356
Stop him!

614
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,762
Get in!

615
01:00:12,127 --> 01:00:13,242
Bugger, there he is!

616
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:15,837
Stop!

617
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:26,556
You OK?

618
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:32,606
They believe
it's you...

619
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:35,606
I know.
Who do YOU think it is?

620
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,686
Maurel, as I've always known.

621
01:00:39,527 --> 01:00:41,563
Chasseignes's 600 km.

622
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:43,684
There's one pharmacy.

623
01:00:43,967 --> 01:00:45,764
There's the address.

624
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:52,879
Bugger!
They've been warned.

625
01:00:53,247 --> 01:00:53,963
Hang on!

626
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:22,481
Stop!

627
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:24,565
Jump out!

628
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:27,401
Don't worry,
he's gotta be stopped!

629
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,076
Think about your daughter,
jump!

630
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:05,402
The injured man is in intensive care
at Auxerre hospital.

631
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:07,922
Condition serious.

632
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:13,080
They used to think he was crazy.
Now they're upset.

633
01:02:13,447 --> 01:02:14,516
Not my problem.

634
01:02:14,767 --> 01:02:17,998
Got Adrien?
No. On and on it goes.

635
01:02:18,247 --> 01:02:18,963
Tell me,

636
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,720
how did he make Carrega
smash through a road-block?

637
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,003
Believe me,
he's very persuasive.

638
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:33,960
For you, eh?

639
01:02:40,087 --> 01:02:43,682
All looks very nice and expensive.
This isn't a parade!

640
01:02:44,047 --> 01:02:45,002
You had him!

641
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,522
It's just a matter of time.
There's no time left!

642
01:02:47,887 --> 01:02:49,240
The constabulary's furious.

643
01:02:49,487 --> 01:02:51,000
We've allowed a killer

644
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,004
to escape.

645
01:02:52,247 --> 01:02:53,316
I'm responsible.

646
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:54,597
I'm in charge.

647
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,639
A bit of criminal analysis
'd do you good.

648
01:02:58,887 --> 01:02:59,603
Commander...

649
01:02:59,967 --> 01:03:01,798
Why did you spare him?

650
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:04,398
I'm not sure he's the one
who killed them.

651
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:07,600
I beg your pardon?
He could have shot me.

652
01:03:07,847 --> 01:03:09,200
It doesn't add up.

653
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,476
You put in a report
based on woman's intuition.

654
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:15,324
I'm going to try and get Adrien...

655
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:17,359
...and not miss him.

656
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:16,436
Cut off between D981
and D18 in the Beuch forest.

657
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,484
Received, Delta 3.

658
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:22,006
Block off the intersection
of Rue de l'étang

659
01:04:22,367 --> 01:04:23,277
and D981...

660
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,245
On D18...

661
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:27,637
No sign of suspect.

662
01:04:27,887 --> 01:04:29,320
Suspect has escaped area.

663
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:35,606
Christine,

664
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:37,640
I've never been so happy.

665
01:08:37,887 --> 01:08:39,240
Me too.

666
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:42,479
It's hard for me to stop
thinking about that guy.

667
01:08:43,247 --> 01:08:44,919
His face is plastered everywhere.

668
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:47,635
The police'll get him.

669
01:08:47,887 --> 01:08:49,161
Look.

670
01:08:49,527 --> 01:08:51,563
France's Most Wanted.

671
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:06,245
Come on.
I'm going to buy you a dress.

672
01:09:12,687 --> 01:09:14,598
Here's a beautiful dress!

673
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:17,475
You like it?
You'll try it on?

674
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:20,845
You'll be a real princess.

675
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:24,279
My goodmess, you're so beautiful!
Jean-Louis!

676
01:09:24,647 --> 01:09:26,319
Isn't she beautiful with this?

677
01:09:32,327 --> 01:09:33,760
Jean-Louis?.

678
01:09:40,727 --> 01:09:42,365
No, Jean-Louis.

679
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:45,958
I told you, Christine.

680
01:09:46,327 --> 01:09:47,806
I gave you the little girl.

681
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:49,480
It's too risky.

682
01:09:49,847 --> 01:09:50,836
The little girl is too.

683
01:09:51,207 --> 01:09:53,960
You saw how she was
looking at the newspapers?

684
01:09:56,967 --> 01:09:59,561
You got nothing new,
whatta you stuffing 'round with?

685
01:09:59,927 --> 01:10:01,997
I'm matching Adrien's movements

686
01:10:02,247 --> 01:10:03,396
with his supposed crimes.

687
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,166
Supposed?

688
01:10:05,407 --> 01:10:08,319
You think that we're
pinning these murders on him?

689
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:11,845
He thinks so.
He said: "He's fucked me."

690
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:12,923
Who was he talking about?

691
01:10:13,927 --> 01:10:17,203
I know it's someone
we should be looking for.

692
01:10:20,647 --> 01:10:21,841
Can you help me?

693
01:10:26,207 --> 01:10:27,720
I should be out on the job.

694
01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:29,516
Please!

695
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,241
Alright..No!
Don't wanna know about it!

696
01:10:33,487 --> 01:10:35,796
You're a pain in the neck.
Go back to Paris. Shit!

697
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:53,756
Excuse me.
Can you help me?

698
01:10:54,127 --> 01:10:54,957
We're looking for

699
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:57,082
a doctor....

700
01:10:57,327 --> 01:10:58,521
Our daughter's sick.

701
01:10:58,887 --> 01:10:59,842
She has a stomach ache.

702
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,406
There's Dr Berlot.

703
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:04,485
He's further on, in Verneuil.

704
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,877
You need to kep to the right and...

705
01:11:07,247 --> 01:11:09,158
Coukld you show us perhaps?

706
01:11:10,807 --> 01:11:11,876
I have to get back.

707
01:11:12,407 --> 01:11:15,479
We'll take you home
afterwards.

708
01:11:15,727 --> 01:11:17,319
You'd be a great help.

709
01:11:18,047 --> 01:11:18,877
Hullo.

710
01:11:19,247 --> 01:11:22,159
My wife's worried
it could be serious.

711
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,605
Alright then.

712
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:27,597
Get in the front.

713
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:28,956
It's easier.

714
01:11:29,447 --> 01:11:30,197
Let me take that.

715
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:33,321
I'll mind it.
Thanks.

716
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:37,556
We all belt up
in my car.

717
01:11:59,007 --> 01:12:00,963
This is very nice of you.

718
01:12:02,247 --> 01:12:03,077
How old are you?

719
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:06,325
That's it then.

720
01:12:07,127 --> 01:12:09,880
At 16,
girls are still very nice.

721
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:17,319
Do you have a boyfriend?

722
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:22,040
No.
It's there on the right.

723
01:12:24,967 --> 01:12:26,286
No, we'd rather

724
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:28,126
keep going to the right.

725
01:12:28,767 --> 01:12:29,836
That doesn't bother you?

726
01:12:34,367 --> 01:12:35,083
I was talking about,

727
01:12:35,447 --> 01:12:36,675
whether you had a boyfriend?

728
01:12:36,927 --> 01:12:37,484
Yes.

729
01:12:37,847 --> 01:12:39,519
What's that got
to do with anything?

730
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:42,322
It doesn't concern you.

731
01:12:46,007 --> 01:12:47,884
I want to get out.

732
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:55,125
What are you doing?

733
01:12:55,687 --> 01:12:56,756
Leave me alone!

734
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:35,599
Help!

735
01:13:54,887 --> 01:13:56,240
What are you up to?

736
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,003
I love you.

737
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:02,560
Will they let us do it again?

738
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:18,921
An envelope for you.

739
01:15:19,287 --> 01:15:20,561
From Paris.

740
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,001
Thanks
I was waiting for it.

741
01:15:50,247 --> 01:15:51,726
It's him.
What about it?

742
01:15:52,647 --> 01:15:55,115
He's been to see Adrien
in prison.

743
01:15:55,367 --> 01:15:56,516
Are you saying that...

744
01:15:57,007 --> 01:15:58,281
They'd already met.

745
01:15:58,807 --> 01:15:59,876
Hadn't you realised that?

746
01:16:00,247 --> 01:16:02,477
They've taken ages
to send this stuff.

747
01:16:02,727 --> 01:16:05,366
Carrega used an alias
to see Adrien.

748
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:06,642
Olivier Desmée.

749
01:16:06,887 --> 01:16:08,286
One of Adrien's victims was

750
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,763
Sylvie Desmée.

751
01:16:11,007 --> 01:16:13,123
Carrega was obsessed with
the case.

752
01:16:13,367 --> 01:16:16,040
He claimed to know
the identity of the killer.

753
01:16:16,687 --> 01:16:18,882
Adrien?
So, some miserable wretch...

754
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,165
Named what?

755
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:25,325
He was quetioned.
What was his name again...?

756
01:16:27,407 --> 01:16:28,123
Yeah... Maurel!

757
01:16:28,487 --> 01:16:31,126
That's it,
Jean-Louis Maurel.

758
01:17:07,807 --> 01:17:08,478
Here we are!

759
01:17:09,327 --> 01:17:13,081
Had some work done here...

760
01:17:13,687 --> 01:17:14,722
And there

761
01:17:14,967 --> 01:17:15,877
Careful.

762
01:17:16,247 --> 01:17:17,123
Attention.

763
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:18,641
Ideal for a family.

764
01:17:19,207 --> 01:17:21,198
Rent's not high.

765
01:17:21,447 --> 01:17:23,199
The owner's keen.

766
01:17:23,447 --> 01:17:25,677
All this'll be removed.

767
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:03,877
An address?
You aren't on the job.

768
01:18:04,367 --> 01:18:05,641
If Lucciani finds out...

769
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:07,804
Give me the address.

770
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,725
Maurel rented a house
in the Alpes-Maritimes

771
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,366
2 weeks after he got out.

772
01:18:13,727 --> 01:18:15,877
He pays through a Swiss bank

773
01:18:16,247 --> 01:18:17,157
in Lausanne

774
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,882
Are you going to give me 
the address?

775
01:18:20,247 --> 01:18:21,885
You're not planning on
going there?

776
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:14,525
I'm very late.

777
01:20:14,887 --> 01:20:17,560
Jean-Jacques, I know.

778
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:29,201
I'll get the ball rolling.
Let's go!

779
01:20:30,287 --> 01:20:32,278
Everybody hungry?

780
01:21:02,927 --> 01:21:06,158
I told him.
That's him for sure.

781
01:21:06,607 --> 01:21:07,722
He strangled those girls?

782
01:21:08,607 --> 01:21:10,120
A woman has a daughter


783
01:21:10,487 --> 01:21:13,126
who disappeared yesterday.
Girl aged 16.

784
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:17,481
That's her.

785
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,767
See you soon.
Next time at our place.

786
01:21:21,007 --> 01:21:22,326
Return match.

787
01:21:28,887 --> 01:21:30,525
Take care.

788
01:23:04,407 --> 01:23:05,476
Jean-Louis Maurel?

789
01:23:06,367 --> 01:23:07,322
That's me.

790
01:23:07,687 --> 01:23:09,723
Claire Linné,
I'm looking for Franck Adrien.

791
01:23:11,007 --> 01:23:13,999
That's someone
I'd rather forget.

792
01:23:14,887 --> 01:23:16,445
May I come in?

793
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:18,965
Certainly.

794
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:22,438
This is my wife,
Christine.

795
01:23:39,007 --> 01:23:40,565
My little sweetie-pie.

796
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,439
It's Daddy.

797
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:02,203
I think I've told you everything.

798
01:24:02,447 --> 01:24:04,199
He hasn't been 
in touch with you?

799
01:24:08,087 --> 01:24:10,157
If he had, I would've
called the police.

800
01:24:11,247 --> 01:24:15,445
I was the victim
of a judicial mistake.

801
01:24:15,687 --> 01:24:19,043
I wouldn't want to
help a criminal.

802
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:24,478
Is it true what
was reported?

803
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:27,241
The enquiry's underway,
madame.

804
01:24:29,087 --> 01:24:29,997
Look carefully.

805
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:32,756
Is this the man that was at
the supermarket.

806
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:34,883
I don't think so.

807
01:24:36,247 --> 01:24:37,157
What is it

808
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:39,204
I'm fed up, Alex.
Claire...

809
01:24:39,447 --> 01:24:42,041
Claire inquired about 
Jean-Louis Maurel.

810
01:24:43,007 --> 01:24:44,406
Woman's intuition?

811
01:24:44,967 --> 01:24:47,197
Maurel lives 20km from here.
What?

812
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:49,125
She's gone there.

813
01:24:49,687 --> 01:24:50,403
Call her.

814
01:24:50,767 --> 01:24:52,519
She's not contactable.
Should we go there?

815
01:25:11,567 --> 01:25:14,127
I wish I could've 
been more help.

816
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:16,358
Don't hesitate to call.

817
01:25:16,607 --> 01:25:18,962
Will do.

818
01:26:02,047 --> 01:26:04,402
So happy
to see you here.

819
01:26:07,847 --> 01:26:09,838
I've missed you.

820
01:26:10,647 --> 01:26:15,118
How did you find
our little nest?

821
01:26:15,607 --> 01:26:17,165
It's cosy.

822
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:20,684
Thanks to you, Franck.

823
01:26:21,367 --> 01:26:23,119
I'll never be able to
thank you enough.

824
01:26:23,967 --> 01:26:26,083
You're my guardian angel.

825
01:26:26,927 --> 01:26:27,837
He's got Amélie.

826
01:26:29,647 --> 01:26:32,081
Trust me...he'll give her 
back to us.

827
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,559
You know, Franck,

828
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:52,040
nobody understands
what I'm looking for.

829
01:26:53,327 --> 01:26:54,726
Nobody.

830
01:26:55,647 --> 01:26:57,126
Nobody.

831
01:26:58,487 --> 01:27:00,159
Filthy scum!

832
01:27:01,647 --> 01:27:04,559
It's all over, now.

833
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:06,121
We're all back together.

834
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:07,602
The whole family.

835
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:10,236
Not in front of her.
Drop your gun!

836
01:27:11,047 --> 01:27:11,718
I said

837
01:27:12,087 --> 01:27:13,361
drop your gun!

838
01:27:14,247 --> 01:27:15,965
He's here...I've got him.

839
01:27:18,607 --> 01:27:19,835
He wanted to kill us!

840
01:27:20,207 --> 01:27:21,083
Don't move!

841
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:26,119
Jean-Louis!

842
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:29,082
Jean-Louis!

843
01:27:48,047 --> 01:27:50,561
Get him!
he's got Amélie!

844
01:27:52,447 --> 01:27:53,197
The cop?

845
01:27:53,567 --> 01:27:54,920
I'll fix that.

846
01:29:19,207 --> 01:29:20,401
Stop here.

847
01:29:22,727 --> 01:29:24,604
You go on, 
I'll take a look.

848
01:29:44,247 --> 01:29:47,364
Would you like to walk on ahead, Amélie?

849
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:16,200
Don't go near the edge.
Stay close to Daddy.

850
01:30:41,447 --> 01:30:43,802
You OK, Franck?

851
01:30:55,047 --> 01:30:56,002
Maurel.

852
01:30:58,687 --> 01:30:59,642
Maurel!

853
01:31:03,847 --> 01:31:05,485
Don't move.
Drop your gun!

854
01:31:07,247 --> 01:31:08,236
I've got the fugitive.

855
01:31:08,607 --> 01:31:10,404
He's down there.

856
01:31:21,527 --> 01:31:22,277
Maurel!

857
01:31:42,047 --> 01:31:43,446
Help's coming.

858
01:31:43,687 --> 01:31:44,403
Franck.

859
01:31:44,767 --> 01:31:46,803
it's all over,
Amélie's safe.

860
01:31:50,007 --> 01:31:51,486
Cri de douleur

861
01:31:51,847 --> 01:31:53,326
There's extenuating circumstances.


862
01:31:53,687 --> 01:31:54,642
Trust me.

863
01:31:57,207 --> 01:31:58,276
I can't trust anyone.

864
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,405
It'll be the last time.

865
01:32:09,687 --> 01:32:12,155
Who fired? You bastard!

866
01:32:14,847 --> 01:32:17,998
It came from over there!
Drop it you bastard!

867
01:32:18,247 --> 01:32:20,761
Drop your gun!
Don't move!

868
01:32:21,007 --> 01:32:21,917
Raise your hands.

869
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,158
In the air!
Don't move!

870
01:32:27,807 --> 01:32:29,160
take it easy.

871
01:33:09,727 --> 01:33:11,285
Look along here.

872
01:33:11,647 --> 01:33:13,126
That's it, thanks.

873
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:15,364
I'm here.


874
01:33:16,087 --> 01:33:17,440
You OK?
Yes, thanks.

875
01:33:17,807 --> 01:33:18,922
We've got Maurel.

876
01:33:20,007 --> 01:33:22,646
Adrien's body must have gone further.
We'll find it.

877
01:33:26,887 --> 01:33:28,286
You know, Claire...

878
01:33:31,167 --> 01:33:32,646
No better.

879
01:33:37,007 --> 01:33:38,725
Maurel's wife's
spilled the beans.

880
01:33:38,967 --> 01:33:41,083
He was doing all the killing 
and raping.  Not Adrien.

881
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:45,635
She's admitted 8 murders,
but there's others.

882
01:33:46,207 --> 01:33:48,004
Without Adrien,
there would have been more.

883
01:33:49,687 --> 01:33:50,563
Go and tell him.

884
01:33:52,287 --> 01:33:53,356
And say what?

885
01:33:54,007 --> 01:33:55,406
I lack your woman's
intuition.

886
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:00,002
Thank you, Claire.

887
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:04,122
I tried to aim
for once

888
01:34:21,123 --> 01:34:23,123
Three months later

889
01:34:41,687 --> 01:34:44,281
She's solitary,
but she's hanging in there.

890
01:34:44,967 --> 01:34:46,082
She's working better


891
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:47,960
with the speech therapist.

892
01:34:48,207 --> 01:34:49,083
She's happy

893
01:34:49,447 --> 01:34:51,438
when you come to see her.

894
01:34:52,167 --> 01:34:54,522
You told me to tell you
about any mail.

895
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:56,437
She got a letter.

896
01:34:56,807 --> 01:34:58,604
I have a photocopy.

897
01:35:00,687 --> 01:35:02,678
From Morocco?

898
01:35:07,487 --> 01:35:08,681
Just this, no words?

899
01:35:09,847 --> 01:35:12,236
No, since she got the letter,

900
01:35:12,607 --> 01:35:15,167
she's seemed happier.

901
01:35:16,367 --> 01:35:17,880
Do you know who it's from?

902
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:32,921
Papa.

903
01:35:33,287 --> 01:35:35,847
...

904
01:35:36,087 --> 01:35:39,036
