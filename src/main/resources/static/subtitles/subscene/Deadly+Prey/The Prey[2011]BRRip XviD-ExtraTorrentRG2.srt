1
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,589
I was a bit tense.

2
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,873
Will they let us do it again?

3
00:01:12,132 --> 00:01:15,249
We'll do it as often as we like.

4
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:17,794
Adrien, finish in the visitor's room
in 5 minutes.

5
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,378
I love you.

6
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:26,338
In spite of the aggro
that's brought you?

7
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,915
That'll all soon be over.

8
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,329
Amélie drew this for you.

9
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,709
This how she see's us.

10
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,124
When you get out...

11
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:46,541
So, was it good?

12
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:49,213
The next time we'll make it a 3...

13
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:51,163
or a 4.

14
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,422
What's the big idea?.

15
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:36,499
You wanna leave here
in a coffin?

16
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,625
So what?
Makes more for you.

17
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:44,457
You know where
the goddamn cash is.

18
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:46,916
Is it safe?

19
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,290
I can put some buddies
on the job.

20
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,670
They'll guard it
'til we get out.

21
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:53,874
I wouldn't trust
any buddies of yours.

22
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,536
Yeah!

23
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:00,204
And any reason why I
should trust YOU?

24
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:15,334
That's a nice drawing.

25
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:16,580
Is it your daughter's?

26
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:18,961
I didn't think
we were on speaking terms.

27
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,545
It was good like that.

28
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,548
You know...

29
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:26,579
...there's not much nice
in the world.

30
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,583
You gotta hang on to it.

31
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:33,252
Come on you two,

32
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:34,331
out!

33
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,714
Time for a walk

34
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,579
Why I would go out today?

35
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:41,329
Nice weather.

36
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:43,173
You know the risk
I'd be taking.

37
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,579
You didn't have to assault that girl.

38
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:49,545
I did NOT do it.

39
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:51,381
Yeah...I was forgetting.

40
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,796
And I suppose your stickups
were done by your twin brother.

41
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,458
Or you wanted to pay for

42
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,250
your sick mother's operation.

43
00:03:58,507 --> 00:03:59,538
Can I go now?

44
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:07,541
OK you scum...
move it!

45
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,124
Everyone here?

46
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:12,965
Let's go!

47
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,628
[Speaking Russian]

48
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:32,204
Isn't your rock-spider pal coming?

49
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:33,840
Scared, is he?

50
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,538
He's saying...

51
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:43,254
I don't give a fuck
what apes say.

52
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,713
Translate that!

53
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,583
I'm innocent.

54
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:29,454
I know I'll be cleared eventually.

55
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:33,631
I've got to survive
in this rat-hole.

56
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:37,544
I'm called a rock-spider.
They want me dead.

57
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:43,042
I continue praying my ordeal
will come to an end.

58
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:48,297
You sure?

59
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:12,414
You get out.

60
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,960
Without making trouble.

61
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:17,002
If you don't wanna cop shit...

62
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:18,544
...then scram.

63
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,454
Don't you move.

64
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:42,623
What do you want?

65
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,251
As you don't go out,

66
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,339
we've come to
pay you a visit.

67
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:57,045
[Russian]

68
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:58,668
You hear...repeat it.

69
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,336
"Spasiba."

70
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,125
Go on...repeat it.

71
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,377
Spasiba.

72
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,997
That means thank you.
You'll repeat it.

73
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:08,247
Understood?

74
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:18,129
We'll see if the little girls
get you excited now.

75
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,086
That's enough.

76
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,958
What do you want?.

77
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,381
We better go down
before there's serious shit.

78
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,086
That's enough...stop!

79
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,291
Shut up...get out!

80
00:08:14,757 --> 00:08:16,629
You shouldn't've
got involved.

81
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:42,751
6 months more.

82
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:44,625
Because you defended him.

83
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,214
That's not what
the report says.

84
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:52,090
The employment agency's
got nothing for me.

85
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:54,000
I can't afford the nanny.

86
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:57,418
I can't afford
the speech therapist.

87
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:00,708
And we've got all
that money.

88
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:07,416
Do you realise that
this guy Franck Adrien,

89
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:10,837
went into hiding near our place
after his stick-up.

90
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,667
In Nièvre.

91
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,924
He's been put with me
to protect me.

92
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,830
I'm there to protect you.

93
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:21,792
That's true.

94
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,251
Why don't you tell me
where you've hidden it?

95
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:32,786
I'd just take what we need.

96
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,755
Trust me for once.

97
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:44,374
The reason I'm here's
because I was trusting.

98
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:48,037
I don't get to sleep.
Every other day,

99
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:50,415
they forget my medication.

100
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,466
The lawyer's going to see
what he can do.

101
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:56,255
You believe I'm going
to get out of this?

102
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,457
Of course.

103
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:02,330
Her mother said to the judge
that she'd invented everything.

104
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:05,382
He's going to question her
and she's going to crack.

105
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:07,914
You're getting out...
it's going to happen.

106
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,715
You'll give me a child.

107
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,335
You didn't need to
bring her in here.

108
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,746
This is no place for her.

109
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,294
She wanted to come.

110
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:21,377
What'd she say?

111
00:10:21,757 --> 00:10:23,167
She wanted to see her father.

112
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,500
While I'm in here
I'm not her father.

113
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:28,162
I don't want her to see me
as a convict.

114
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,420
I'm sorry, Franck.

115
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:35,965
We miss you so.

116
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:39,540
I miss both of you, too.

117
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:08,547
Amélie, you'll fall over.

118
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:10,998
Careful!

119
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,954
What a cutie!

120
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,748
What's your name?

121
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:20,416
She can't reply.

122
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,422
She has speaking problems.

123
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:25,296
She's going to
learn to speak.

124
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:27,416
It'll take time.

125
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:32,289
She may be right
to take her time.

126
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,121
Say goodbye.

127
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,753
'Bye, Amélie.

128
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,540
You make a move
and you're a vegetable.

129
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:18,876
You wanna kill me, Novick?

130
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:21,206
Don't you wanna get your dough?

131
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:24,712
Exactly...the Russki won't miss you.

132
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:26,916
I wanna know
where the cash's stashed.

133
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:33,040
So my buddies
can take care of it.

134
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,420
Look, they're not far away.

135
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:43,540
You've got nothing to say?

136
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,960
Go fuck yourself.

137
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:46,128
Cough up!

138
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,630
You know Marco's hideout

139
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:53,664
I'm listening.

140
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:55,791
It is under the false floor.

141
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:54,329
G'day, Franck.

142
00:13:57,674 --> 00:13:59,629
How long've I been here?

143
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,044
4 days.

144
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,922
And Novick?

145
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:05,048
In solitary.

146
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,420
He only got a week.

147
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:12,298
So he get's out in 3 days...
gotta get outta here quick.

148
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:17,880
You're worried
about your cash?

149
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:21,162
Whadda you talking about?

150
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,671
The reason you're in here.

151
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,335
Novick want's to pinch it.

152
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,422
Do you want any help?

153
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:34,920
How?

154
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:37,338
I'm getting out!

155
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:39,667
The girl's retracted her story.

156
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,288
She made it all up
from A to Z.

157
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,872
There won't even
be a new trial.

158
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:50,087
I want to give you
my phone number.

159
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:51,715
Call when you get out.

160
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:54,003
This is not
a good idea.

161
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:55,667
Why?

162
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:57,666
I won't forget
what you did.

163
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,912
Let me help you.
I don't owe you anything.

164
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,918
Yes, that's quite right.

165
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:05,122
You're right.

166
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:08,875
OK.

167
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,381
Cheers.

168
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:14,541
Call me.

169
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:17,215
There's something
you could do.

170
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:18,834
it's...

171
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,503
call my wife.

172
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,878
Tell her I'm well and that
Novick's watching her.

173
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,422
And then also,

174
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:36,506
she should see my father,
he'll help her.

175
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,041
Could you do that for me?

176
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:50,338
Sure,
you can trust me.

177
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,955
Nothing's changed.
We even tidied your cell.

178
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:37,495
Novick's out?

179
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:42,082
He said you wanted
to take his share.

180
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:43,502
He wanted to kill you.

181
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:46,708
He's been transferred to Fresnes.
Happy?

182
00:16:56,757 --> 00:17:00,087
Cigarettes?
I been waiting 3 days.

183
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:09,833

185
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,630
You can feel the evil in here.

186
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:42,505
The colour-scheme
doesn't help.

187
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:45,624
Nobody made you come.

188
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,746
Manuel Carrega,
constabulary captain.

189
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,423
Has something
happened to Anna?

190
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,624
Anna?

191
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:01,673
I've got questions regarding
Jean-Louis Maurel.

192
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,079
Maurel?.

193
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,290
He shared your cell.

194
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,169
You know he was accused of raping
a little girl?

195
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:11,590
Everyone knew about it.
He's been found innocent.

196
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:16,792
What did he tell you
about his life?

197
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,047
I wasn't interested.

198
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,581
He told me he was from Nevers,
I've lived there and we talked a bit about it.

199
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,668
He mention any places,
people?

200
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,422
What are you on about?

201
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:33,123
I'm not on about him...
but I am about his next victims.

202
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,125
Wasn't he the victim?

203
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:38,500
Legally, yes.

204
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:43,749
Do I trust
what he's capable of?

205
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:46,455
Didn't the girl
retract her story?

206
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:53,794
Maurel's wife
managed to get to her.

207
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:55,965
You haven't charged her?

208
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,711
I'm looking for proof.

209
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,501
I need your testimony.

210
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:02,752
What have you seen

211
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,372
or heard while you
were with him?

212
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:06,746
He seemed quite normal.

213
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:08,294
He's a manipulator.

214
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:09,455
He's cunning.

215
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:12,129
He's fooled more than one person.

216
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:14,794
He hasn't fooled me.

217
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:19,208
20 years ago I came to France
for a woman.

218
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,421
She'd left a guy
who beat her up.

219
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:25,787
I warned that her ex
was dangerous.

220
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:27,999
For nothing.

221
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:30,662
He set fire to
where we lived.

222
00:19:30,924 --> 00:19:32,879
She's dead.

223
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,502
I've survived.

224
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:41,250
I've escaped death

225
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:43,006
to help save others.

226
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:53,455
If anything else

227
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:54,586
comes back to you.

228
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,214
And if you'd just come
from the asylum?

229
00:19:56,591 --> 00:20:00,798
Believe me...
I'm not the mad one.

230
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:13,380
The answering machine contains
too many messages.

231
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:16,998
Please try again later.
Goodbye.

232
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:26,663
Come on.

233
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:50,751
I'm taking you to the meeting.

234
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,794
He had to come
Were are you going?

235
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,631
Not far.
He'll pay double.

236
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:10,751
Cinderella following Big Sister, out.

237
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,547
Waiting for Prince Charming.

238
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,672
We'll follow and join up.

239
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,921
OK

240
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:37,204
Is it far?
It's here.

241
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:53,666
You want to stay?

242
00:21:53,924 --> 00:21:55,547
It's him who says what
he wants.

243
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:58,502
She's perfect.

244
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,423
You can leave us.

245
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:13,621
Will I move?

246
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:15,548
We don't know if it's him.

247
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:18,960
What's she doing?

248
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:20,917
She's confirming.

249
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,704
Let me do it.

250
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,714
You start undressing first.

251
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:35,460
Your turn.

252
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,545
I'm thirsty.

253
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:45,961
Could I get a glass
of water?

254
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:47,412
It's Costa, go!

255
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:51,045
We've got him, boys!

256
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:04,878
Don't move!
Go, go!

257
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:08,584
Turn over, you fuck!

258
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:12,203
I wanna see your hands!

259
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:16,330
Move it!

260
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:18,957
Move it!

261
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:24,713
All OK?
He's in the bag.

262
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:30,332
The Corsican was right.

263
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,795
You were perfect.

264
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:24,423
Come on,
get a move on.

265
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:25,787
You stay there.

266
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,372
Nico,

267
00:25:28,757 --> 00:25:29,954
a bit of privacy.

268
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:10,997
[Russian]

269
00:26:12,924 --> 00:26:14,630
I'm not translating.

270
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:56,836
You are 3!

271
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:45,042
Franck.

272
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,500
I can fix everything.

273
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:01,295
Nico!

274
00:28:01,674 --> 00:28:03,546
Let me out!

275
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:04,954
They're going to kill me!

276
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,461
Let me out!

277
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:12,006
Nico, open the door!

278
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:14,587
I'll kill you, you fucker!

279
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:17,003
Nico!
Shit.

280
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:20,423
Okay, Chief?.

281
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:46,085
2 more.

282
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:48,752
The Costas'll spend Christmas
in the clink.

283
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:49,788
Hang on...

284
00:29:50,174 --> 00:29:52,129
René's more cunning.

285
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:54,414
We'll need to be more cunning
to catch him..

286
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,498
Exactly.

287
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,543
Has The Holy Ghost
finished with your cover?

288
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:04,456
He wants Claire downstairs.

289
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:06,789
And whadda YOU want?

290
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,880
Couldn't ask for more.

291
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:10,252
The prisoner

292
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,670
who got out
dressed as a guard.

293
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:16,458
Franck Adrien, in
for the bank

294
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:17,545
stickup.

295
00:30:17,924 --> 00:30:19,251
I know.

296
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:20,378
So?

297
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:24,082
He had 2 months to go.
He's not ready.

298
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,173
He's going to make
the usual mistakes

299
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,125
getting back the hidden loot.

300
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,999
Anyone can catch him.
I'm staying on the Costas.

301
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:34,958
The boss wants the best.

302
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:38,000
The troop that's just had
3 major convictions...

303
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:39,958
you and your team.

304
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,294
If it's so simple,

305
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,629
you'll be back with the Costas
in no time.

306
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:01,127
Thank you, monsieur.

307
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:03,663
That's OK.

308
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:08,126
Would you know
where to find the eggs?

309
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:10,545
They're at the end, through there.

310
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:14,382
Would it be too much to ask
to come with me?

311
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:18,756
I always get lost
with all these aisles.

312
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:21,623
Yes, follow me.
- Melissa!

313
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,127
I'm waiting for you.

314
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,960
Sorry, gotta go.

315
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,836
Doesn't matter,
I'll find them myself.

316
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:45,622
The man thwarted the security checks.

317
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:48,496
Franck Adrien, convicted
for the holdup of the Savings Bank

318
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:52,129
didn't have more than 8 months of prison left.

319
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:56,287
He may be armed and
is considered dangerous.

320
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:03,000
Got it...
au revoir, monsieur.

321
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:17,707
D'you think
he'll understand?

322
00:32:18,257 --> 00:32:20,746
Nothing to worry about.
The police have good info, now.

323
00:32:23,632 --> 00:32:24,662
Christine,

324
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:27,537
we knew he'd get out
one day.

325
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:29,878
i've got everything worked out.

326
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,957
He doesn't know what's waiting for him.
Trust me.

327
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,664
Nobody's going to take our
happiness away.

328
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:41,798
She's sleeping?

329
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:44,454
She looks so adorable
like that.

330
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:47,455
Thanks for giving her to me.

331
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,748
He's got very few connections.

332
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:52,247
He avoids his relations.

333
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:53,829
His wife?
Yeah.

334
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:56,918
Anna Martens.
She used to visit him.

335
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,336
She's unemployed,
takes care of the kid.

336
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,249
The address she gave

337
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:02,959
is phony.

338
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,708
And his accomplices?

339
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,088
Guests of the state.

340
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,497
Jérôme Novick
was at Mérancourt.

341
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:10,954
It wasn't a great  love affair.

342
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,710
He attacked Adrien
with a screwdriver.

343
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:14,878
Nice boy.

344
00:33:15,257 --> 00:33:16,584
I'm going to question him.

345
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:18,745
How much did they get?

346
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:19,997
2 million.

347
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:21,128
2 million!

348
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:24,043
We've only got back pocket money.

349
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:27,620
He's going to want
to get the money back.

350
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,377
Watch the places he knows.

351
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:31,538
Houses, bars.

352
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,038
His picture's
everywhere.

353
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:36,663
I've asked for
his visiting room videos.

354
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:39,252
Thats what?

355
00:33:39,632 --> 00:33:42,299
Those who could've seen him
in their area.

356
00:33:42,924 --> 00:33:43,670
100 calls.

357
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:46,495
Dobbing-in's a national sport.

358
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,338
Has the media spoken to Anna?

359
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,163
No.

360
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,837
We got an address for Anna
in the suburbs.

361
00:34:14,757 --> 00:34:16,250
Who's he?

362
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,083
Anna?.

363
00:35:11,257 --> 00:35:13,746
Hey, watch where you're going!

364
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:16,875
What's going on?

365
00:35:17,257 --> 00:35:18,371
Turn them out!

366
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:34,041
Nobody leaves.

367
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,544
Are you staying here?

368
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:37,464
No, I'm covering you.

369
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,583
Police, step aside.

370
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:05,377
Out of the way!

371
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:07,290
That's it.

372
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:11,998
Police, open up!

373
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:37,798
No one!

374
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:40,712
Come here.

375
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:46,208
Look.

376
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,121
We just missed him.

377
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:06,082
Marco!
Coming!

378
00:37:13,424 --> 00:37:14,170
He's not far away.

379
00:37:14,424 --> 00:37:17,375
We need reinforcements,
He's in the area.

380
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:20,127
With luck, we'll be back
in an hour.

381
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:23,339
With luck, in an hour, we got back.

382
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:55,036
Don't move!

383
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:56,454
Don't you move.

384
00:37:58,424 --> 00:37:59,585
Let me past.

385
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:01,915
Of course!
Anything else?

386
00:38:02,882 --> 00:38:05,833
I can't go back to prison
now.

387
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,169
Don't move!

388
00:38:11,632 --> 00:38:12,378
I've learnt something

389
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:13,871
very important.

390
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:16,669
You can't shoot,
I'm not threatening you

391
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:19,791
You can see
I'm unarmed

392
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:36,128
Adrien is on the street.
Warn everyone!

393
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:42,875
There he is!
Stop him!

394
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:33,121
You OK?

395
00:41:33,382 --> 00:41:35,669
Close the next station!

396
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:38,963
If the train stops
he'll get off.

397
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:18,048
Is he crazy?

398
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,958
Divide up the zone
and set up road blocks.

399
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:58,417
I know,
good...thanks.

400
00:42:58,674 --> 00:43:01,209
He's probably already far away.
Here...

401
00:43:01,674 --> 00:43:03,001
...yours?

402
00:43:06,424 --> 00:43:07,253
He's crazy.

403
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:11,163
Something's driving him.
Something really strong.

404
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:17,299
"Anna, wherever you are,
I'll find you."

405
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:19,463
She's cleared off
with the cash.

406
00:43:20,507 --> 00:43:21,704
Two for the price of one?

407
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,670
Yeah, that'll make
The Holy Ghost happy.

408
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:04,168
Yes?

409
00:46:06,132 --> 00:46:07,874
Why did you do it?

410
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:11,214
Franck, I knew
you'd call.

411
00:46:11,465 --> 00:46:12,330
How are you?

412
00:46:13,049 --> 00:46:15,881
Tell me,
why did you do it?

413
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:20,873
Why did you kill her?

414
00:46:21,132 --> 00:46:22,957
It was all her fault.

415
00:46:23,757 --> 00:46:27,881
Thank God...
I know how to read people.

416
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:30,585
Your wife was unreliable.

417
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:33,715
She would have
given you problems.

418
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:39,006
I chose to save you
from all that.

419
00:46:39,757 --> 00:46:41,878
What've you done
with Amélie?

420
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:46,078
What've you done with
my little daughter?

421
00:46:46,507 --> 00:46:48,048
Where is she, Maurel?

422
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,083
Have you killed her?

423
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,920
She's a lovely little thing.
I love her very much.

424
00:46:54,174 --> 00:46:56,081
I shan't do her
any harm at all.

425
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,422
Unless you try
to find me.

426
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,170
What is it?

427
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:41,872
He wants us to grab Adrien
on his return.

428
00:47:42,132 --> 00:47:43,210
He's in Corsica.

429
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,166
I'd love to go down
to Corsica.

430
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:46,627
Anna's scrap of paper?

431
00:47:47,007 --> 00:47:48,464
Amélie  drawings.

432
00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:51,002
Naïve style endowed with a certain potential.

433
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,870
Letters for her guy

434
00:47:54,257 --> 00:47:55,536
that she hadn't sent.

435
00:47:55,924 --> 00:47:57,749
Love letters.

436
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:02,162
"I understand your gesture.
It's a proof of love."

437
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:03,413
The stickup.

438
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:06,962
Why hadn't she posted
this deathless prose?

439
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:09,748
To be read in prison?

440
00:48:10,132 --> 00:48:10,796
Not on.

441
00:48:11,174 --> 00:48:11,837
They aren't the words

442
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:16,079
of a woman stabbing
someone in the back.

443
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:17,164
And Novick?

444
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:19,580
A heap of new insults.

445
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:22,418
It's a put-up job between
Adrien and his chick.

446
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:25,962
We know the addresses
he's given,

447
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,122
except for this one.

448
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:30,247
Le Pré-sur-Lamure?

449
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:32,457
What's that?
Their hide-out

450
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,084
after the bank job.

451
00:48:49,257 --> 00:48:51,627
Martin, go round!

452
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,913
What's this?

453
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:13,423
What's this bullshit?

454
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:31,628
[Russian]

455
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:33,997
No thanks.

456
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:06,296
Are your reinforcements coming?
They're coming.

457
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:08,166
The policeman's refrain.

458
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:09,746
Are we gonna find the loot?

459
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,085
If it's not already gone.

460
00:50:13,382 --> 00:50:14,958
What's that?

461
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:20,588
Why've you come?

462
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,957
It's nothing to do with your daughter.
What would you know?

463
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,750
Best you go home.

464
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,584
We should be Corsican.

465
00:50:28,965 --> 00:50:30,292
There's something here!

466
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,161
Captain, come here.
Stay there.

467
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:43,627
Look.

468
00:50:50,132 --> 00:50:51,755
Robert, no!
Pull him back!

469
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,711
Nobody touch anything.

470
00:51:12,715 --> 00:51:15,085
It was his daughter?
Yeah. Julie.

471
00:51:15,465 --> 00:51:18,214
Disappeared. He'd been hoping
she was just a runaway.

472
00:51:22,715 --> 00:51:25,251
The guy who did that
is a monster.

473
00:51:28,465 --> 00:51:30,788
Is it one of Adrien's victims?

474
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:33,584
No way that it fits Adrien's profile.

475
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,838
He has a wife
and a disabled child.

476
00:51:37,215 --> 00:51:38,673
That doesn't fit with a killer

477
00:51:38,924 --> 00:51:41,247
There are always exceptions.

478
00:51:42,465 --> 00:51:44,207
There are some connections.

479
00:51:44,465 --> 00:51:47,250
He was living in the area when
Julie disappeared.

480
00:51:47,507 --> 00:51:50,837
We found his DNA
on the map and the jacket.

481
00:51:51,382 --> 00:51:53,586
That's not all.
What else?

482
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,456
There are 2 other maps
of areas way up in the mountains.

483
00:51:57,757 --> 00:51:59,629
Maybe we'll find
other bodies.

484
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:01,797
We're not going to get
carried away

485
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:04,833
If it's a serial killer,
they'll want to bring in the Feds.

486
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,666
They'd want the file.

487
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:08,921
We have to get him now.

488
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:10,708
Listen, Claire.

489
00:52:10,965 --> 00:52:13,584
They don't teach this
at police school,

490
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,253
but next time, this guy
doesn't get to get away.

491
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,583
Understood?

492
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,037
Quite understood.

493
00:52:21,299 --> 00:52:23,005
Have a good day.

494
00:52:48,174 --> 00:52:49,501
I don't want to hurt  you.

495
00:52:49,757 --> 00:52:51,748
What the fuck
are you doing here?

496
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:54,460
You're going to help me
find Maurel.

497
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,206
Where are your guns?

498
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,709
I don't have any.

499
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:01,999
Don't take me for an idiot,
where are they?

500
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:04,213
They're there.

501
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:06,539
In the cupboard.

502
00:53:14,049 --> 00:53:15,246
Go.

503
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:19,371
He always lived
in the area.

504
00:53:19,757 --> 00:53:22,790
I met him 5 years ago.

505
00:53:23,049 --> 00:53:27,291
I questioned him about
a girl from Dijon.

506
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:37,167
Sylvie Desmée.

507
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:39,918
He'd been seen
talking to her.

508
00:53:40,299 --> 00:53:41,839
I smelled a rat.

509
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,661
Maurel raised
too many questions.

510
00:53:45,132 --> 00:53:47,537
He lied about details.

511
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:51,289
I sensed that he was
playing with me.

512
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:53,207
He was a bad one.

513
00:53:55,382 --> 00:53:58,795
The girl was never found...
no body, no proof.

514
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:02,331
There were the other
disappearances.

515
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:11,921
The resemblance is striking.

516
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:13,791
It's been admitted
that it was a serial killer.

517
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:18,499
But a cop investigates facts,
not potential suspects.

518
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,624
You've gone ahead anyway?

519
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:24,338
Quietly. Got nowhere for a long time.

520
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,297
He was invisible.

521
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:30,922
No record, town hall official, liked by all.

522
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:33,870
He was never far away
when the disappearances occurred.

523
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:35,372
Finally,

524
00:54:35,757 --> 00:54:38,459
2 bodies were found
a month apart.

525
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,127
I brought Maurel in,

526
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:44,546
but his DNA didn't match.

527
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:45,996
For the second time,

528
00:54:46,382 --> 00:54:47,709
he trapped us.

529
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:52,001
His sperm sample was at the station,

530
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:55,629
Next day it'd disappeared.
I was suspected.

531
00:54:56,757 --> 00:54:57,954
At the same time,

532
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,042
he brought a complaint against me
for harassment.

533
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,250
I was dismissed.

534
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:06,121
I'm not allowed
to live near him.

535
00:55:06,382 --> 00:55:07,496
You're no longer
in the constabulary?

536
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:11,333
No, I lied to you.

537
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:13,249
I investigate privately.

538
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:16,914
Bugger! I was hoping
you'd be able to help me.

539
00:55:18,257 --> 00:55:19,631
The little girl's 5.

540
00:55:19,882 --> 00:55:21,956
She doesn't look like these girls...

541
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:23,459
Could he harm her?

542
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,463
She's not his normal victim type.

543
00:55:26,715 --> 00:55:30,247
If he wanted to have a good time,
he wouldn't hesitate.

544
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:32,371
I've got the phone number.

545
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:33,871
An old constabulary captain's

546
00:55:34,257 --> 00:55:35,584
maybe got some contacts?

547
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,543
Want a snort?

548
00:55:45,465 --> 00:55:46,839
[Russian] - Thanks!

549
00:55:50,674 --> 00:55:52,499
It's good stuff.

550
00:55:56,965 --> 00:55:57,913
The paper?

551
00:56:01,174 --> 00:56:02,714
You know him?

552
00:56:02,965 --> 00:56:03,878
The constabulary have

553
00:56:04,257 --> 00:56:06,580
found 2 more bodies.

554
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,213
Sylvie Desmée and Karine
Garcia, reported missing.

555
00:56:11,465 --> 00:56:14,036
This is a serial killer for sure!

556
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:21,876
Thanks , I'm on it.

557
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:26,256
A truck driver dropped Adrien
at Luzon, in Nièvre.

558
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,173
You coming?

559
00:56:28,424 --> 00:56:30,663
Yeah, coming.

560
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:37,078
I've come to see Bourgoin.

561
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,959
You got a serial killer for 'I'm?

562
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:11,286
Bourgoin,
Luzon Constabulary office.

563
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:14,416
I need information
on a suspect's number.

564
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,421
It's me.
You got something?

565
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:49,422
The line's been dead
for 48 hours.

566
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,836
He used it 12 times.

567
00:57:52,215 --> 00:57:54,751
The last time was to
Pré-sur-Lamure.

568
00:57:55,007 --> 00:57:57,542
One of my hideouts.
What else?

569
00:57:57,924 --> 00:57:59,298
Several calls

570
00:57:59,674 --> 00:58:00,871
to the Alpes-Maritimes region.

571
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:02,798
Where in Alpes-Maritimes?

572
00:58:03,174 --> 00:58:06,207
There's an area of 40 k's
around a  village.

573
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:07,752
Chasseignes.

574
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:10,087
That's maybe where he's living.

575
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,171
He takes a medication,
Xyrex.

576
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,042
He was jumpy
when he didn't get it.

577
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:19,206
Is there a pharmacy
in Chasseignes?

578
00:58:32,674 --> 00:58:35,956
There are the cops everywhere.
You reported me?

579
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,667
No I didn't.

580
00:58:38,049 --> 00:58:40,086
Where's your gun?

581
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:43,416
A gun's against regu...
Stuff your regulations.

582
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,955
I wouldn't need
to depend on you.

583
01:00:07,882 --> 01:00:09,789
Carrega?.

584
01:00:10,965 --> 01:00:13,454
How come you're here?
I was looking for Bourgoin.

585
01:00:13,715 --> 01:00:15,872
He's directing the search.
The search?

586
01:00:16,257 --> 01:00:19,125
The fugitive's been reported
in the area.

587
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:20,377
He may have killed

588
01:00:20,757 --> 01:00:21,538
3 young girls.

589
01:00:21,799 --> 01:00:22,580
What do you mean?

590
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:24,755
Including Sylvie Desmée.

591
01:00:25,424 --> 01:00:26,798
You remember her.

592
01:00:27,049 --> 01:00:29,004
I'm going to give you a hand.

593
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:33,460
Carrega... you forgotten
you don't work here any more?

594
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,665
Take the lane.

595
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,547
We're taking the lane
with the tall hedges.

596
01:01:24,007 --> 01:01:26,330
Your guns,
over the hedge.

597
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:28,747
Hurry up!

598
01:01:29,382 --> 01:01:30,081
Go on!

599
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,919
On the ground!

600
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,881
On the ground!

601
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,213
Stay down or...

602
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:41,126
Or you'll strangle me
like the others?

603
01:01:41,382 --> 01:01:43,088
What are you talking about?

604
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:47,464
Sylvie Desmée, Karine Garcia,
they ring a bell?

605
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:52,209
What are you talking about?
Your DNA on the maps

606
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,422
in your old hideout.

607
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,999
HQ to Bravo 2.
Put me on to Captain Linée.

608
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:02,291
Bugger!

609
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:06,748
He's fucked you
like he's fucked me.

610
01:02:10,049 --> 01:02:11,044
Stop!

611
01:02:11,424 --> 01:02:12,667
All units!

612
01:02:12,924 --> 01:02:13,788
Stop!

613
01:02:22,674 --> 01:02:23,871
Stop him!

614
01:02:37,882 --> 01:02:38,877
Get in!

615
01:02:42,382 --> 01:02:43,544
Bugger, there he is!

616
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:46,247
Stop!

617
01:02:56,299 --> 01:02:57,412
You OK?

618
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,714
They believe
it's you...

619
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,839
I know.
Who do YOU think it is?

620
01:03:07,215 --> 01:03:10,048
Maurel, as I've always known.

621
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:13,045
Chasseignes's 600 km.

622
01:03:13,299 --> 01:03:15,254
There's one pharmacy.

623
01:03:15,549 --> 01:03:17,421
There's the address.

624
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,832
Bugger!
They've been warned.

625
01:03:25,215 --> 01:03:25,961
Hang on!

626
01:03:54,424 --> 01:03:55,668
Stop!

627
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:57,838
Jump out!

628
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:00,793
Don't worry,
he's gotta be stopped!

629
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:03,579
Think about your daughter,
jump!

630
01:04:36,632 --> 01:04:40,377
The injured man is in intensive care
at Auxerre hospital.

631
01:04:40,632 --> 01:04:43,002
Condition serious.

632
01:04:44,132 --> 01:04:48,375
They used to think he was crazy.
Now they're upset.

633
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:49,871
Not my problem.

634
01:04:50,132 --> 01:04:53,498
Got Adrien?
No. On and on it goes.

635
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:54,503
Tell me,

636
01:04:55,549 --> 01:04:58,416
how did he make Carrega
smash through a road-block?

637
01:04:58,674 --> 01:05:00,795
Believe me,
he's very persuasive.

638
01:05:08,632 --> 01:05:10,125
For you, eh?

639
01:05:16,507 --> 01:05:20,252
All looks very nice and expensive.
This isn't a parade!

640
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:21,627
You had him!

641
01:05:21,882 --> 01:05:24,252
It's just a matter of time.
There's no time left!

642
01:05:24,632 --> 01:05:26,041
The constabulary's furious.

643
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:27,875
We've allowed a killer

644
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:28,921
to escape.

645
01:05:29,174 --> 01:05:30,287
I'm responsible.

646
01:05:30,674 --> 01:05:31,622
I'm in charge.

647
01:05:32,715 --> 01:05:35,832
A bit of criminal analysis
'd do you good.

648
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:36,836
Commander...

649
01:05:37,215 --> 01:05:39,123
Why did you spare him?

650
01:05:39,924 --> 01:05:41,831
I'm not sure he's the one
who killed them.

651
01:05:42,215 --> 01:05:45,166
I beg your pardon?
He could have shot me.

652
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:46,833
It doesn't add up.

653
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:50,246
You put in a report
based on woman's intuition.

654
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,212
I'm going to try and get Adrien...

655
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,332
...and not miss him.

656
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:56,871
Cut off between D981
and D18 in the Beuch forest.

657
01:06:57,132 --> 01:06:59,004
Received, Delta 3.

658
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,673
Block off the intersection
of Rue de l'étang

659
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:03,997
and D981...

660
01:07:04,257 --> 01:07:06,047
On D18...

661
01:07:06,299 --> 01:07:08,538
No sign of suspect.

662
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,291
Suspect has escaped area.

663
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:26,839
Christine,

664
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:28,958
I've never been so happy.

665
01:11:29,215 --> 01:11:30,625
Me too.

666
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:33,999
It's hard for me to stop
thinking about that guy.

667
01:11:34,799 --> 01:11:36,540
His face is plastered everywhere.

668
01:11:36,799 --> 01:11:39,370
The police'll get him.

669
01:11:39,632 --> 01:11:40,959
Look.

670
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,461
France's Most Wanted.

671
01:11:55,757 --> 01:11:58,755
Come on.
I'm going to buy you a dress.

672
01:12:05,465 --> 01:12:07,456
Here's a beautiful dress!

673
01:12:07,882 --> 01:12:10,453
You like it?
You'll try it on?

674
01:12:11,049 --> 01:12:13,963
You'll be a real princess.

675
01:12:14,424 --> 01:12:17,540
My goodness, you're so beautiful!
Jean-Louis!

676
01:12:17,924 --> 01:12:19,665
Isn't she beautiful with this?

677
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,417
Jean-Louis?.

678
01:12:34,674 --> 01:12:36,380
No, Jean-Louis.

679
01:12:38,215 --> 01:12:40,123
I told you, Christine.

680
01:12:40,507 --> 01:12:42,048
I gave you the little girl.

681
01:12:42,299 --> 01:12:43,792
It's too risky.

682
01:12:44,174 --> 01:12:45,204
The little girl is too.

683
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:48,458
You saw how she was
looking at the newspapers?

684
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:54,293
You got nothing new,
whatta you stuffing 'round with?

685
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:56,830
I'm matching Adrien's movements

686
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,287
with his supposed crimes.

687
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:00,131
Supposed?

688
01:13:00,382 --> 01:13:03,415
You think that we're
pinning these murders on him?

689
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:07,088
He thinks so.
He said: "He's fucked me."

690
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:08,211
Who was he talking about?

691
01:13:09,257 --> 01:13:12,670
I know it's someone
we should be looking for.

692
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:17,501
Can you help me?

693
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:23,625
I should be out on the job.

694
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:25,496
Please!

695
01:13:26,757 --> 01:13:29,376
Alright..No!
Don't wanna know about it!

696
01:13:29,632 --> 01:13:32,037
You're a pain in the neck.
Go back to Paris. Shit!

697
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,746
Excuse me.
Can you help me?

698
01:13:51,132 --> 01:13:51,997
We're looking for

699
01:13:53,215 --> 01:13:54,210
a doctor....

700
01:13:54,465 --> 01:13:55,709
Our daughter's sick.

701
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:57,085
She has a stomach ache.

702
01:13:58,299 --> 01:13:59,756
There's Dr Berlot.

703
01:14:00,132 --> 01:14:01,922
He's further on, in Verneuil.

704
01:14:02,174 --> 01:14:04,413
You need to keep to the right and...

705
01:14:04,799 --> 01:14:06,789
Could you show us perhaps?

706
01:14:08,507 --> 01:14:09,621
I have to get back.

707
01:14:10,174 --> 01:14:13,374
We'll take you home
afterwards.

708
01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:15,290
You'd be a great help.

709
01:14:16,049 --> 01:14:16,913
Hullo.

710
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:20,332
My wife's worried
it could be serious.

711
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,963
Alright then.

712
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:25,997
Get in the front.

713
01:14:26,382 --> 01:14:27,412
It's easier.

714
01:14:27,924 --> 01:14:28,705
Let me take that.

715
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:31,959
I'll mind it.
Thanks.

716
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:36,371
We all belt up
in my car.

717
01:14:58,715 --> 01:15:00,753
This is very nice of you.

718
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:02,955
How old are you?

719
01:15:04,715 --> 01:15:06,338
That's it then.

720
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:10,042
At 16,
girls are still very nice.

721
01:15:16,049 --> 01:15:17,791
Do you have a boyfriend?

722
01:15:19,924 --> 01:15:22,708
No.
It's there on the right.

723
01:15:25,757 --> 01:15:27,131
No, we'd rather

724
01:15:27,507 --> 01:15:29,048
keep going to the right.

725
01:15:29,716 --> 01:15:30,829
That doesn't bother you?

726
01:15:35,549 --> 01:15:36,295
I was talking about,

727
01:15:36,674 --> 01:15:37,953
whether you had a boyfriend?

728
01:15:38,216 --> 01:15:38,796
Yes.

729
01:15:39,174 --> 01:15:40,916
What's that got
to do with anything?

730
01:15:42,757 --> 01:15:43,835
It doesn't concern you.

731
01:15:47,674 --> 01:15:49,629
I want to get out.

732
01:15:55,549 --> 01:15:57,172
What are you doing?

733
01:15:57,757 --> 01:15:58,871
Leave me alone!

734
01:16:37,507 --> 01:16:39,332
Help!

735
01:16:59,424 --> 01:17:00,833
What are you up to?

736
01:18:03,216 --> 01:18:04,128
I love you.

737
01:18:07,132 --> 01:18:09,917
Will they let us do it again?

738
01:18:25,632 --> 01:18:26,959
An envelope for you.

739
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:28,668
From Paris.

740
01:18:28,924 --> 01:18:30,168
Thanks
I was waiting for it.

741
01:18:59,591 --> 01:19:01,131
It's him.
What about it?

742
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:04,661
He's been to see Adrien
in prison.

743
01:19:04,924 --> 01:19:06,121
Are you saying that...

744
01:19:06,632 --> 01:19:07,959
They'd already met.

745
01:19:08,507 --> 01:19:09,621
Hadn't you realised that?

746
01:19:10,007 --> 01:19:12,330
They've taken ages
to send this stuff.

747
01:19:12,591 --> 01:19:15,339
Carrega used an alias
to see Adrien.

748
01:19:15,591 --> 01:19:16,669
Olivier Desmée.

749
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:18,381
One of Adrien's victims was

750
01:19:18,757 --> 01:19:20,961
Sylvie Desmée.

751
01:19:21,216 --> 01:19:23,420
Carrega was obsessed with
the case.

752
01:19:23,674 --> 01:19:26,458
He claimed to know
the identity of the killer.

753
01:19:27,132 --> 01:19:29,419
Adrien?
So, some miserable wretch...

754
01:19:31,216 --> 01:19:32,838
Named what?

755
01:19:33,216 --> 01:19:36,130
He was questioned.
What was his name again...?

756
01:19:38,299 --> 01:19:39,045
Yeah... Maurel!

757
01:19:39,424 --> 01:19:42,173
That's it,
Jean-Louis Maurel.

758
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:21,081
Here we are!

759
01:20:21,966 --> 01:20:25,876
Had some work done here...

760
01:20:26,507 --> 01:20:27,585
And there

761
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:28,788
Careful.

762
01:20:29,174 --> 01:20:30,086
Attention.

763
01:20:30,341 --> 01:20:31,668
Ideal for a family.

764
01:20:32,257 --> 01:20:34,331
Rent's not high.

765
01:20:34,591 --> 01:20:36,416
The owner's keen.

766
01:20:36,674 --> 01:20:38,997
All this'll be removed.

767
01:21:16,632 --> 01:21:18,788
An address?
You aren't on the job.

768
01:21:19,299 --> 01:21:20,626
If Lucciani finds out...

769
01:21:21,007 --> 01:21:22,879
Give me the address.

770
01:21:23,882 --> 01:21:26,963
Maurel rented a house
in the Alpes-Maritimes

771
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,673
2 weeks after he got out.

772
01:21:29,049 --> 01:21:31,288
He pays through a Swiss bank

773
01:21:31,674 --> 01:21:32,622
in Lausanne

774
01:21:33,007 --> 01:21:35,460
Are you going to give me
the address?

775
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:37,547
You're not planning on
going there?

776
01:23:33,257 --> 01:23:34,880
I'm very late.

777
01:23:35,257 --> 01:23:38,042
Jean-Jacques, I know.

778
01:23:47,632 --> 01:23:50,168
I'll get the ball rolling.
Let's go!

779
01:23:51,299 --> 01:23:53,373
Everybody hungry?

780
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:28,665
I told him.
That's him for sure.

781
01:24:29,132 --> 01:24:30,294
He strangled those girls?

782
01:24:31,216 --> 01:24:32,792
A woman has a daughter

783
01:24:33,174 --> 01:24:35,923
who disappeared yesterday.
Girl aged 16.

784
01:24:39,132 --> 01:24:40,459
That's her.

785
01:24:41,216 --> 01:24:43,882
See you soon.
Next time at our place.

786
01:24:44,132 --> 01:24:45,506
Return match.

787
01:24:52,341 --> 01:24:54,047
Take care.

788
01:26:31,841 --> 01:26:32,954
Jean-Louis Maurel?

789
01:26:33,882 --> 01:26:34,877
That's me.

790
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:37,378
Claire LinnŽ,
I'm looking for Franck Adrien.

791
01:26:38,716 --> 01:26:41,832
That's someone
I'd rather forget.

792
01:26:42,757 --> 01:26:44,380
May I come in?

793
01:26:45,299 --> 01:26:47,005
Certainly.

794
01:26:48,716 --> 01:26:50,623
This is my wife,
Christine.

795
01:27:07,882 --> 01:27:09,505
My little sweetie-pie.

796
01:27:10,757 --> 01:27:12,499
It's Daddy.

797
01:27:29,924 --> 01:27:32,045
I think I've told you everything.

798
01:27:32,299 --> 01:27:34,124
He hasn't been
in touch with you?

799
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:40,330
If he had, I would've
called the police.

800
01:27:41,466 --> 01:27:45,839
I was the victim
of a judicial mistake.

801
01:27:46,091 --> 01:27:49,586
I wouldn't want to
help a criminal.

802
01:27:53,257 --> 01:27:55,248
Is it true what
was reported?

803
01:27:55,507 --> 01:27:58,126
The enquiry's underway,
madame.

804
01:28:00,049 --> 01:28:00,997
Look carefully.

805
01:28:01,382 --> 01:28:03,871
Is this the man that was at
the supermarket.

806
01:28:05,341 --> 01:28:06,086
I don't think so.

807
01:28:07,507 --> 01:28:08,455
What is it

808
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,587
I'm fed up, Alex.
Claire...

809
01:28:10,841 --> 01:28:13,543
Claire inquired about
Jean-Louis Maurel.

810
01:28:14,549 --> 01:28:16,006
Woman's intuition?

811
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:18,914
Maurel lives 20km from here.
What?

812
01:28:19,299 --> 01:28:20,922
She's gone there.

813
01:28:21,507 --> 01:28:22,253
Call her.

814
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:24,457
She's not contactable.
Should we go there?

815
01:28:44,299 --> 01:28:46,966
I wish I could've
been more help.

816
01:28:47,216 --> 01:28:49,290
Don't hesitate to call.

817
01:28:49,549 --> 01:28:52,002
Will do.

818
01:29:36,882 --> 01:29:39,335
So happy
to see you here.

819
01:29:42,924 --> 01:29:44,998
I've missed you.

820
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:50,498
How did you find
our little nest?

821
01:29:51,007 --> 01:29:52,630
It's cosy.

822
01:29:54,341 --> 01:29:56,296
Thanks to you, Franck.

823
01:29:57,007 --> 01:29:58,832
I'll never be able to
thank you enough.

824
01:29:59,716 --> 01:30:01,920
You're my guardian angel.

825
01:30:02,799 --> 01:30:03,747
He's got Amélie.

826
01:30:05,632 --> 01:30:08,168
Trust me...he'll give her
back to us.

827
01:30:22,632 --> 01:30:24,291
You know, Franck,

828
01:30:26,091 --> 01:30:28,958
nobody understands
what I'm looking for.

829
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:31,756
Nobody.

830
01:30:32,716 --> 01:30:34,256
Nobody.

831
01:30:35,674 --> 01:30:37,416
Filthy scum!

832
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:41,999
It's all over, now.

833
01:30:42,382 --> 01:30:43,626
We're all back together.

834
01:30:44,007 --> 01:30:45,169
The whole family.

835
01:30:45,424 --> 01:30:47,912
Not in front of her.
Drop your gun!

836
01:30:48,757 --> 01:30:49,456
I said

837
01:30:49,841 --> 01:30:51,168
drop your gun!

838
01:30:52,091 --> 01:30:53,880
He's here...I've got him.

839
01:30:56,632 --> 01:30:57,911
He wanted to kill us!

840
01:30:58,299 --> 01:30:59,211
Don't move!

841
01:31:02,716 --> 01:31:04,457
Jean-Louis!

842
01:31:06,466 --> 01:31:07,544
Jean-Louis!

843
01:31:27,299 --> 01:31:29,918
Get him!
he's got Amélie!

844
01:31:31,882 --> 01:31:32,664
The cop?

845
01:31:33,049 --> 01:31:34,458
I'll fix that.

846
01:33:02,257 --> 01:33:03,501
Stop here.

847
01:33:05,924 --> 01:33:07,879
You go on,
I'll take a look.

848
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:31,588
Would you like to walk on ahead, Amélie?

849
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:01,625
Don't go near the edge.
Stay close to Daddy.

850
01:34:27,924 --> 01:34:30,377
You OK, Franck?

851
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:43,085
Maurel.

852
01:34:45,882 --> 01:34:46,877
Maurel!

853
01:34:51,257 --> 01:34:52,964
Don't move.
Drop your gun!

854
01:34:54,799 --> 01:34:55,829
I've got the fugitive.

855
01:34:56,216 --> 01:34:58,088
He's down there.

856
01:35:09,674 --> 01:35:10,455
Maurel!

857
01:35:31,049 --> 01:35:32,506
Help's coming.

858
01:35:32,757 --> 01:35:33,503
Franck.

859
01:35:33,882 --> 01:35:36,003
it's all over,
Amélie's safe.

860
01:35:39,341 --> 01:35:40,881
Cry of pain

861
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,798
There's extenuating circumstances.

862
01:35:43,174 --> 01:35:44,169
Trust me.

863
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:47,954
I can't trust anyone.

864
01:35:48,549 --> 01:35:50,172
It'll be the last time.

865
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:02,411
Who fired? You bastard!

866
01:36:05,216 --> 01:36:08,498
It came from over there!
Drop it you bastard!

867
01:36:08,757 --> 01:36:11,376
Drop your gun!
Don't move!

868
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:12,580
Raise your hands.

869
01:36:12,841 --> 01:36:14,915
In the air!
Don't move!

870
01:36:18,716 --> 01:36:20,125
take it easy.

871
01:37:02,382 --> 01:37:04,005
Look along here.

872
01:37:04,382 --> 01:37:05,923
That's it, thanks.

873
01:37:06,299 --> 01:37:08,254
I'm here.

874
01:37:09,007 --> 01:37:10,417
You OK?
Yes, thanks.

875
01:37:10,799 --> 01:37:11,960
We've got Maurel.

876
01:37:13,091 --> 01:37:15,840
Adrien's body must have gone further.
We'll find it.

877
01:37:20,257 --> 01:37:21,715
You know, Claire...

878
01:37:24,716 --> 01:37:26,256
No better.

879
01:37:30,799 --> 01:37:32,589
Maurel's wife's
spilled the beans.

880
01:37:32,841 --> 01:37:35,045
He was doing all the killing
and raping.  Not Adrien.

881
01:37:37,216 --> 01:37:39,786
She's admitted 8 murders,
but there's others.

882
01:37:40,382 --> 01:37:42,254
Without Adrien,
there would have been more.

883
01:37:44,007 --> 01:37:44,920
Go and tell him.

884
01:37:46,716 --> 01:37:47,829
And say what?

885
01:37:48,507 --> 01:37:49,965
I lack your woman's
intuition.

886
01:37:53,674 --> 01:37:54,752
Thank you, Claire.

887
01:37:56,757 --> 01:37:59,044
I tried to aim
for once

888
01:38:16,753 --> 01:38:18,836
Three months later

889
01:38:38,174 --> 01:38:40,876
She's solitary,
but she's hanging in there.

890
01:38:41,591 --> 01:38:42,752
She's working better

891
01:38:43,132 --> 01:38:44,708
with the speech therapist.

892
01:38:44,966 --> 01:38:45,878
She's happy

893
01:38:46,257 --> 01:38:48,331
when you come to see her.

894
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:51,544
You told me to tell you
about any mail.

895
01:38:52,674 --> 01:38:53,539
She got a letter.

896
01:38:53,924 --> 01:38:55,796
I have a photocopy.

897
01:38:57,966 --> 01:39:00,040
From Morocco?

898
01:39:05,049 --> 01:39:06,293
Just this, no words?

899
01:39:07,507 --> 01:39:09,996
No, since she got the letter,

900
01:39:10,382 --> 01:39:13,049
she's seemed happier.

901
01:39:14,299 --> 01:39:15,875
Do you know who it's from?

902
01:39:30,299 --> 01:39:31,543
Papa.

903
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:39,125
