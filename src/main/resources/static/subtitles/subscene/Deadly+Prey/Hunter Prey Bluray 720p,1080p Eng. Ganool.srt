1
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,167
Sir?

2
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,907
Sir, can you hear me?

3
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,672
He's alive!

4
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:07,045
Get your ass back here.
Take some cover.

5
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:09,075
Don't have time
to take a nap.

6
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,483
The prisoner escaped
before we covered.

7
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,799
I think he took a rifle.
He went over there...

8
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:35,827
Rifle.

9
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:56,868
Any signs?
-Negative.

10
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,016
Starting sequence complete.

11
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,808
Clea 19, on line.
Hello, commander Karza.

12
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,390
Now, Clea, activate
system link.

13
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,979
System is link. -You got
guys on line? -Check.

14
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:30,983
Check. -Clea, patch
me in the base.

15
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:33,131
Transmitting.

16
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,341
Alpha base, this is Commander
Karza. Do you copy?

17
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:40,029
Copy, Commander.
This is Alpha base.

18
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:43,197
Prometheus is down.
I repeat, Prometheus is down.

19
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,948
We have three survivors
and need immediately instructions.

20
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,813
Without pick in up
the ship's biken.

21
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,707
Ship biken is not functional.

22
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,918
We need your coordinates.

23
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,474
I.T.A. in 10 hours.

24
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:02,267
All alive need to activate
your personal biken.

25
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:06,443
Copy that. -What is the
status of your cargo?

26
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,737
Cargo has survived
and left crash side.

27
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,972
Commander, mission
parameter is remaining.

28
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:15,400
Organism must be delivered.

29
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:18,588
And Karzo, it imperative
that you bring him alive.

30
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:21,123
Is that understood?

31
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:23,924
Commander, do you copy?

32
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:28,255
Yeah, roger that.
Karzo out.

33
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:31,644
End transmission.
-Thanks for the help.

34
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,947
What else is new?
-Enough.

35
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,567
This mission has been
joke from the start.

36
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,595
You think that is joke that
we lost our ship and our crew?

37
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,817
Your prisoner brought my
men down single handed.

38
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:43,958
And you couldn't do it
damn thing to stop it.

39
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:49,141
I don't see anything funny
about that. Do you soldier?

40
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:51,910
No, sir.
-Good.

41
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:54,779
Now, Clea, speak with
the Lieutenant.

42
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:58,169
Hello, Centauri 7.
Oh, you are hurt.

43
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,031
Yeah, give me diagnostic.

44
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:05,436
Serious some stenches trauma
to your left shoulder.

45
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:09,298
No broken bones.
Heart beat is elevated.

46
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:12,420
Otherwise you should be
in excellent condition.

47
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,447
Clea, skip
trace improvement.

48
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,018
Activating tracking system.

49
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,297
Redirecting cells to repairing
nerve and tissue damage.

50
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,458
Increasing endorphins
to counter pain.

51
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,740
Better.

52
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:34,131
The subject is 250 meters
southeast from your position

53
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:36,132
and moving away
as steady range.

54
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,669
Are you sure
he's moving away?

55
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:40,977
Yes, Commander.
-We on the move and set out.

56
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:42,806
We need supplies.

57
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,513
How much left?
-We'll take Logan's pack.

58
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:54,013
Clea, any idea
where we are?

59
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,036
Planet is on charged.

60
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:59,735
Computer shows you on
unknown set of coordinates.

61
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,751
Gravity to that
planet is the rest.

62
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:03,873
Give us the status.

63
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,464
Atmosphere is tin.

64
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,386
Likely surrenders have
been unconscious.

65
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,653
My advice, keeping
your helmets on it

66
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:11,251
to until I finished
activating your bodies.

67
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:14,774
Surface's temperature
is 116 degrees. -Nice.

68
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:17,197
Going cells are
in 72 percent,

69
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,930
which can last just
about 100 hours.

70
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,566
Anything else?

71
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,507
Calculating the
position of the sun.

72
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:26,791
I estimated 34
hours of day light

73
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,928
with 5 hours of night.

74
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:31,306
Sound like a paradise.
Maybe I'll move here.

75
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,081
I can't wait on that.

76
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:38,575
I'm sure you could, sir.

77
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:53,096
According to Clea, it will be
mess to get this thing.

78
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:56,143
Let's move out.

79
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:14,753
Clea, give me a torch.

80
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:23,571
What you'll gonna do?

81
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:26,953
Weld it act together?

82
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:45,634
He's on the move
again. Let's go.

83
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:48,607
On your feet.

84
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,552
This is brutal.

85
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,416
I don't understand
how those thing

86
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,979
can move so fast
on this heat. -Simple.

87
00:08:57,086 --> 00:09:00,305
If he wants to live,
pure survival instinct.

88
00:09:00,443 --> 00:09:03,223
What's the rush?
He gets no food, no water.

89
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,982
We can track every
move he makes.

90
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,938
Let him die first.

91
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,581
There no be a
needs to recovery.

92
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,777
You heard them.
They want it alive.

93
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:15,606
Why? -Is not your place to
question orders, Lieutenant.

94
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,814
It is when accosting me
the lifes of my men.

95
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,821
This should be a simple
transport mission.

96
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:23,671
Are you done crying, soldier?

97
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:26,615
Get lost.

98
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:33,115
May it up and move out.

99
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,934
Both of you.

100
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:02,794
Closing in on subject.
Sublimate press air increasing.

101
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:05,898
There!

102
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,422
Where is it?

103
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:19,247
Up on the ridge.
8 o'clock.

104
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:26,274
Look like we can get up
on a north side.

105
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,470
Grab his rifle.
I will cover you.

106
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:32,396
Go!

107
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:44,870
I see it.
-Shut him.

108
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,660
It won't alive.

109
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,381
I'm in command now.
Take it down.

110
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:55,468
Target lock.
-Take the shoot.

111
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,315
Down.

112
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,583
Hold the position.

113
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:03,725
It's secure.
I got it.

114
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,899
I said hold position.
I coming up.

115
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,614
It's nothing here
but his cloak.

116
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:20,305
Fall back!
Fall back!

117
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:45,453
Clea?

118
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,807
Clea?

119
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:21,232
I thought you are dead.
-You are not that lucky.

120
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:23,519
Where is my rifle?

121
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,446
Ask Tursai.

122
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,844
Night is falling.

123
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,115
Let's the place
to set up camp.

124
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:33,521
Hard to take the ground.
Only to access points.

125
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,253
I still can catch him.

126
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:37,333
If you need the rest,
you stay here and I'll...

127
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:39,114
Why do you think
that I want to hear

128
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:42,252
your opinion soldier?
I don't.

129
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:47,360
He was to green. He would
never set in any unit.

130
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,318
He wasn't the one
who rush us into the ambush.

131
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:54,215
The situation that determine
outcome, Lieutenant.

132
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:56,203
Components
and the skill do.

133
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:59,516
Unfortunately, your team
wasn't good enough for those trick.

134
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:02,009
Now, make
yourself useful

135
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:05,938
and set up parameter
around those rocks over there.

136
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:10,293
You have your orders.

137
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:22,623
43 degrees and dropping.

138
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:35,402
Private channel's open it.

139
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:38,070
What's the Commander's
condition?

140
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:41,011
He's suffering from a
plasma wound to his side.

141
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,856
Extreme nerve
damage has been

142
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:47,508
sustained on his
left long izenteret.

143
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,845
What meds you got him on?

144
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:54,742
500 CC sustrofin
and 250 CC for crioksen.

145
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:58,802
Don't surprise he stayed on
his feet as long as he did.

146
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,846
Reduce his medication.

147
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,039
We have a long way
to travel tomorrow

148
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:03,752
and I am not to
carry him.

149
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,381
I'm not sure if
Commander Karzo

150
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:07,356
would agree with
your assessment.

151
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,841
Keep the information on fly.

152
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,545
He doesn't need to know.

153
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:13,519
It is not in my programming
to lie, Lieutenant.

154
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,689
You want be lying,
you just not share information.

155
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,479
Can you do that?
-Of, course.

156
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:21,258
Thanks.

157
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,751
Odd.
-What's that?

158
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:26,326
You have been from all the soldier
that I have been a signed to

159
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:29,993
you are the only one
that's he ever thank me.

160
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:32,343
Do you mind it?
-No.

161
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:33,949
I quite preferred.

162
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:37,773
Isn't get tirelessness been
endless it worried about.

163
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,874
We have in
common then.

164
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:44,938
You must work compliant
with the military directed, Centauri.

165
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:47,011
So, I been told.

166
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,355
According to your record

167
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,615
some of yours
previous inseportinations

168
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:57,018
border it dangerously
close to treason. -And?

169
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:01,373
It's a question, why you
chosen to be a soldier?

170
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:05,259
It is does, doesn't it?

171
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:38,049
Atmosphere conditioning will
be completed in 10 seconds.

172
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:42,265
I advise you to keep yours
eyes more on objective

173
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:45,664
instead of me, Lieutenant.

174
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:48,299
Atmospheric adaptation
is complete.

175
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:53,003
It is now safe to
remove your helmets.

176
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,493
Why is the prisoner
not effected on tin air?

177
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,486
He doesn't
wear the life suit.

178
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:07,794
They can adapt to
almost any conditions.

179
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,462
All this was in the file.

180
00:19:12,923 --> 00:19:14,186
Permission to
speak freely, sir?

181
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:17,177
Permission?
It never stop you before.

182
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:18,940
Go ahead.

183
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:21,173
What's the special really?

184
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,548
Why is that thing
so important?

185
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:25,021
Does it matter?
-Yes, it does.

186
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:28,016
Why? -I lost my ship
and my crew.

187
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,125
I would like to know why.
-You are a soldier.

188
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,087
We both are.
We follow orders

189
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,203
without questions.

190
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,491
Tell me what you know

191
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:46,120
otherwise I go alone.

192
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,599
Disobey orders is
a treason, soldier.

193
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:51,401
Punishment by death.

194
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:10,081
All right. This thing is
the last of his kind.

195
00:20:10,204 --> 00:20:11,737
We destroyed
his home world

196
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,965
and now somehow figure
we return the favor.

197
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,455
So, we'll catch it that thing
and get it back to the base.

198
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,262
We made a world
to go home too.

199
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,364
Now you know
what's I do.

200
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,668
Is that you make
feel better, soldier?

201
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,042
Sit down and discuss when some
wild thing is around on us.

202
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:29,634
You delivery to kept
us in the dark.

203
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,395
You did need to know.
-I see.

204
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:34,904
This mission
was a hero maker.

205
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:37,513
Everything we know
was at risk.

206
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:40,777
Are you deaf
as you stupid?

207
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:42,982
What level was
this mission?

208
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:44,508
This discussion is over.

209
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,543
What level was
this mission, sir?

210
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,938
41. Nobel class.
-Highest level.

211
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:54,919
And you was so
with your ego

212
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,694
you didn't badger to tell us
how danger the creature was.

213
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:59,839
Your men were
incompetent.

214
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,890
Don't blame me
for your mistakes.

215
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:03,805
You jeopardized this mission.

216
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,648
You got my verscio.

217
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:07,989
I'm your superior officer

218
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:10,293
and you speak
to me as such.

219
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:11,905
Why?

220
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:14,064
You don't deserve it.

221
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:38,440
Let's see what
fight you got in.

222
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:42,752
You are no worth it.

223
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,660
Clea? What's the
present position?

224
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:19,836
I had no visual.

225
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:22,738
Clea?

226
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,946
Clea?

227
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:04,144
Come on.

228
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:15,217
Come on, baby.

229
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:17,528
Don't live me alone now.

230
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,924
Starting sequence complete.

231
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:24,120
Clea 19 on line.
Hello, Centauri 7.

232
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:25,296
Clea.

233
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,542
I thought I lost you there.
-You cant to get rid of

234
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:28,879
me so easily, Centauri.

235
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,878
I suffered some damage but
seems to be function in properly.

236
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:34,840
I'm quite adorable,
you know.

237
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,518
That's why keep
you out, babe.

238
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:40,248
I thought that was my
charming personality.

239
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:47,950
Clea. What's the
prison location?

240
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:51,565
78 and increasing.

241
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,077
Look likes just
you and me now.

242
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,317
I'm sorry about
Commander Karza

243
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:05,321
but if I must
say I'm pleased

244
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,163
that it was you
who survived.

245
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,364
Well, that makes two of us.

246
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:23,706
Keep trace prisoner.

247
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:26,469
200 microcliks on
your current location.

248
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:30,390
Continuing in south
eastern direction.

249
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,135
On the move again.

250
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,040
I hope you'll rot, sir.

251
00:26:03,694 --> 00:26:06,329
It's been moving on a
steady pace for hours.

252
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:09,423
Hopefully the damn
things collapse it.

253
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:12,844
Without the water source it could
be coming to dehydration.

254
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:15,719
Exactly.

255
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:21,168
Still...

256
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:23,578
I'm going in.

257
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:28,425
Report me any movement.
-Of course.

258
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:32,565
Be careful, Centauri.

259
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:49,651
I get it.

260
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,008
Clea, my grid?

261
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,049
What is it, Centauri?

262
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,128
It's the tracking device.

263
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:02,873
Tear out from it's
own throat.

264
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:05,189
Very clever.

265
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,297
He can't go far.

266
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,534
He cannot brag.

267
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:11,616
Do you hear me?

268
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:17,120
I bringing you in.

269
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,435
Dead or alive.

270
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:39,452
Centauri?
Are you all right?

271
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,772
Centauri 7?
Please answer.

272
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:15,721
Clea?

273
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,718
Which the time would be?

274
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,531
How long I have been out?

275
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:24,496
Clea?

276
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:23,634
The head.

277
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:28,641
I had to kick the head.

278
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:18,409
Pull on that.

279
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,487
Hello?

280
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:41,703
Unknown user,
please identify.

281
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,391
Repeat, identify.

282
00:37:45,924 --> 00:37:48,222
Identify.

283
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:50,049
Horn Jericho.

284
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:54,433
Un authorized user.
Terminating access.

285
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:31,223
Private channel,
open it. -Clea?

286
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:34,884
Where are you?
-I'm not sure.

287
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:38,821
I'm in the possession
un authorized user.

288
00:38:41,296 --> 00:38:45,885
Can you give me a signal
of his location? -Of course.

289
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,367
Got it.

290
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:54,964
He tried to access me

291
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,405
but I terminated
the communication.

292
00:38:57,508 --> 00:38:59,586
It's spoke to you?
-Yes.

293
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:01,580
And it's understood you.
-Yes.

294
00:39:01,662 --> 00:39:03,752
This damn thing is more
smart then I thought.

295
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,637
Keep that signal going.
Still on the private channel.

296
00:39:05,715 --> 00:39:07,871
I'm on my way.

297
00:40:01,884 --> 00:40:04,025
Clea?

298
00:40:04,578 --> 00:40:06,336
Clea?

299
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:08,854
She won't be helping
you anymore.

300
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:14,950
We can't get out from
this planet without her.

301
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:20,714
How I do use her?
-You can't.

302
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,344
And if you have her

303
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:27,437
you still be stuck on this
flooring rock as well.

304
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:29,044
You get no way to go.

305
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:32,570
Maybe I not
plan on go anywhere.

306
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:36,370
If you want a die

307
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:40,010
kill yourself now and
save me the trouble.

308
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:42,852
What if I want to
take you with me?

309
00:40:44,413 --> 00:40:47,315
You do then done already.

310
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:50,936
You are not dumb
as you look.

311
00:40:51,955 --> 00:40:54,117
What's it you want?

312
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:04,716
I know you
can still hear me.

313
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,768
You are playing games?

314
00:41:07,888 --> 00:41:10,426
Well, here is mine.

315
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:13,305
I know why they
want you brought in.

316
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:16,749
And I don't care.

317
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:21,081
I'm gonna hunt you down
and I wanna kill you.

318
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:24,565
That's my game.

319
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,580
Give up, Sedonian.

320
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:19,672
You will never catch me.

321
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:25,329
You been out smart
enough to run.

322
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:33,867
Go home.

323
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,099
Why you still got a
home to go back to.

324
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,265
I know something new
I hate about your race.

325
00:47:51,697 --> 00:47:55,123
You packed not enough water.

326
00:47:56,762 --> 00:47:59,450
Because that's more
human thing.

327
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,608
Always be prepare it.

328
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:08,662
I'm actually surprise you
last as long you have.

329
00:48:08,894 --> 00:48:12,409
Seem how incompetent you are.

330
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,771
Now I know why they put
that helmet mask on you.

331
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:19,123
You talk too much.

332
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,184
They you want to know
if I can speak your language.

333
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:24,369
You are right.

334
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:26,557
It's a good for
somebody like you

335
00:48:26,622 --> 00:48:28,185
to speak the language
of the stars.

336
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:30,999
Something we pick it
up from the Draks.

337
00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:37,514
Draks are noble race.

338
00:48:37,637 --> 00:48:39,201
You don't know
anything about that.

339
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:40,332
Nobel?

340
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:43,769
They are disease on a
galaxy, filthy creatures.

341
00:48:43,915 --> 00:48:45,671
That's funny.

342
00:48:45,747 --> 00:48:48,387
They say the same
thing about you.

343
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:51,649
Lying bugs.

344
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:53,962
I tell you this

345
00:48:54,048 --> 00:48:56,608
no one miss you guys
when you gone.

346
00:48:56,893 --> 00:49:00,112
Your the race is in extinct,
human, not mine.

347
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,765
Not so long.

348
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:04,084
Is that so?
-Yap.

349
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:06,626
I taken yours to hell.

350
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,147
I hold your fenecy, human.

351
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,359
Been that you
last of your kind

352
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,614
how do you hope to
accomplish this remarkable fit?

353
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:16,941
Don't you know why?
-I don't care.

354
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,903
That's why.

355
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:21,112
You want this war
on your advent

356
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:22,880
and lost your home world.

357
00:49:22,952 --> 00:49:25,717
Those the consequence.
-We didn't enter this war.

358
00:49:25,836 --> 00:49:26,964
You attacked us.

359
00:49:27,014 --> 00:49:29,664
You were harboring Draks fugitives.
-You mean refugees.

360
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:32,251
Big difference.
They need our help.

361
00:49:32,357 --> 00:49:34,557
You choose the wrong side.

362
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:36,645
No.

363
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:39,431
It's cost us everything
but we chose the right side.

364
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:43,507
Now, it's gonna cost
you everything.

365
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:47,634
We all die.
That's your solution.

366
00:49:47,788 --> 00:49:50,228
How can you
been so naive?

367
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,527
Another pack will
ride on our place.

368
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,329
An endless cycle.

369
00:49:54,403 --> 00:49:56,405
The only way to brake it

370
00:49:56,491 --> 00:49:59,021
is to take control from
those with power

371
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:02,253
to rule them instead.

372
00:50:03,325 --> 00:50:05,683
You thought about this?
-No.

373
00:50:05,784 --> 00:50:08,924
It's the way it is.

374
00:50:11,173 --> 00:50:13,092
Maybe you are right.

375
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,056
Human.

376
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:19,925
You have two options.

377
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:22,106
You can come with
me and survive

378
00:50:22,197 --> 00:50:25,300
or you can join to the rest
of your race in oblivion.

379
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:27,582
It's your decision.

380
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:29,947
I'd choose option
number three.

381
00:50:30,045 --> 00:50:32,258
What is what?

382
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:03,913
Clea?

383
00:52:04,274 --> 00:52:06,309
Clea? Are you there?

384
00:52:06,396 --> 00:52:09,132
Centauri 7?
-Yeah, it's me.

385
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,267
Has the human
then recaptured? -No.

386
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:14,932
Then have you
do retrieve me?

387
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:17,367
Radio sit it
on the skeleton.

388
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,505
Why he live it behind?

389
00:52:19,593 --> 00:52:23,811
Odd, that creature
is kind it dangerously so.

390
00:52:23,992 --> 00:52:25,734
Like he figured something else.

391
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,458
But what is he doing?

392
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:30,730
I missing something.

393
00:52:30,823 --> 00:52:33,607
I wonder...
-Wonder what?

394
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,627
Clea?

395
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:38,667
Centauri, I may know
what the human is doing.

396
00:52:38,795 --> 00:52:40,380
Great, tell me.

397
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,656
It would be better
if I didn't. -Why is that?

398
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:47,257
If you know it might
influence your actions.

399
00:52:47,406 --> 00:52:48,887
I don't...
What?

400
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:52,529
Do you trust me, Centauri?
-With my life.

401
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:55,869
And here I do
need you to do.

402
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:07,833
We may have
another problem.

403
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:11,070
What now?
-I think my forward

404
00:53:11,205 --> 00:53:13,254
Commander Karza did more
damage to my entire circle

405
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:15,469
then I first thought.

406
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:17,915
What you mean?
-My battery isn't holding

407
00:53:18,017 --> 00:53:19,932
the power cells
charge very well.

408
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:21,987
I'm not going to be able
to conserve enough power

409
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,943
to activate your biken when the
rescue mission will arrive.

410
00:53:25,066 --> 00:53:27,641
Shut down the other system
restraining power.

411
00:53:27,752 --> 00:53:31,062
I have but two main resources
left from my system痴 memory

412
00:53:31,204 --> 00:53:34,251
and your medical unit I'm
afraid you have to shutting down

413
00:53:34,382 --> 00:53:36,315
to until you'll
need me, Centauri.

414
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:38,026
That's not happened.

415
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,660
Cut my meds.

416
00:53:40,048 --> 00:53:42,723
I don't think that
is a good idea.

417
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:44,341
Cut them.

418
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:47,814
Meds unit is shutting down.

419
00:53:50,313 --> 00:53:52,196
Your pain receptor
the spank in

420
00:53:52,278 --> 00:53:55,786
and your heart break
is increasing. -I'm good.

421
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:58,082
Meds should give
us enough power

422
00:53:58,175 --> 00:54:00,992
provided when will ship
arrived for designated time.

423
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:04,358
With little luck
I'll get on him.

424
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,290
I picking a communications
from orbit. -Our pick up?

425
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,792
No, this is art
military channel

426
00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:50,710
and unknown craft
is approaching.

427
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,195
They could come
down here? -Yes.

428
00:54:53,299 --> 00:54:55,481
But my system can
track it.

429
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:58,741
Try raise them.

430
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:01,916
No respond.

431
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:04,250
They got it to
the radio silence.

432
00:55:04,712 --> 00:55:06,954
It can't be good.

433
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,552
Maybe some randeu
wous with the human.

434
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,445
Maybe is not the last one.

435
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,075
Or they could be Draks.

436
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:39,085
Great.

437
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:03,559
Hey!

438
00:59:09,689 --> 00:59:11,754
What?

439
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,038
What?

440
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:27,484
Money?

441
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,541
Sadonians?

442
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:32,062
They are paying you.

443
00:59:32,124 --> 00:59:34,497
You are bounty hunter.

444
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:38,058
That is such an ugly word.

445
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,531
Soldier of fortune
more like it.

446
00:59:43,141 --> 00:59:46,590
They want you been alive, ha?

447
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:52,313
Just as I thought.
Slyeck.

448
00:59:52,653 --> 00:59:54,574
What would the Slyeck
be doing here?

449
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,086
Bounty hunter.

450
00:59:56,148 --> 00:59:58,605
Alpha base must he send
him like a back up.

451
00:59:58,711 --> 00:59:59,569
It is.

452
00:59:59,755 --> 01:00:02,830
Alpha base or
the Slyeck? -Both.

453
01:00:02,962 --> 01:00:04,345
What you going to do?

454
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,288
He's got my weapons
and my prisoner.

455
01:00:06,371 --> 01:00:09,216
I gonna go get them back.

456
01:00:15,098 --> 01:00:18,428
True your kind will
world wound?

457
01:00:19,306 --> 01:00:21,015
Maybe.

458
01:00:22,093 --> 01:00:25,168
True or lie?

459
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,720
True.

460
01:00:29,279 --> 01:00:31,071
Deserve it they do.

461
01:00:31,149 --> 01:00:34,287
Scare them good you do, a?

462
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:39,121
You like Sadonians?
-No one like Sadonians.

463
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:43,704
The way where we
planet make slaves.

464
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,150
There way or no way.

465
01:00:56,687 --> 01:01:02,106
If I kill you
they all die.

466
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:07,154
No more Sadonians.
-Wait. Remember?

467
01:01:07,361 --> 01:01:08,361
I'm money.

468
01:01:08,404 --> 01:01:11,474
You kill me, no money.

469
01:01:14,102 --> 01:01:16,910
Maybe I'll take you
to the ship first.

470
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:20,073
Talk with elders.

471
01:01:20,204 --> 01:01:23,432
Good idea.
Smart.

472
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:27,681
No! Fuck that money.
I'll be hero.

473
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:30,746
No more Sadonians.
-No, wait.

474
01:01:54,903 --> 01:01:57,497
You have your
business here, Slyeck?

475
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,663
That human is my prisoner.

476
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:11,494
He's mine.

477
01:02:38,143 --> 01:02:40,629
I don't think so.

478
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:06,742
Now what?

479
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:08,299
We wait.

480
01:04:09,602 --> 01:04:11,089
On what?

481
01:04:11,193 --> 01:04:13,547
Extraction.

482
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:15,782
Ship should be here soon.

483
01:04:21,928 --> 01:04:24,078
What did they
call you, human?

484
01:04:24,255 --> 01:04:26,312
What is your name?

485
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,400
Jericho.

486
01:04:27,444 --> 01:04:28,862
Lieutenant Orn Jericho.

487
01:04:28,924 --> 01:04:29,924
Lieutenant?

488
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,670
We are the same right.

489
01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:34,701
I'm Centauri 7.

490
01:04:34,769 --> 01:04:37,093
I didn't ask.

491
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,523
Not wise to upset me

492
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:41,488
consider on your
position, human.

493
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:43,972
No wonder your
kind didn't make it.

494
01:04:44,076 --> 01:04:46,416
No common sense.
-Was that a reason?

495
01:04:46,517 --> 01:04:49,121
I thought was you
genocide war to did it.

496
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:51,942
War is war.
You lost.

497
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:53,994
As long I'm still alive

498
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:56,384
the war ain't over.

499
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,741
You never did answer
to my question.

500
01:05:02,179 --> 01:05:04,594
How were you going to
destroy my planet?

501
01:05:04,698 --> 01:05:05,698
Are. -What?

502
01:05:05,742 --> 01:05:08,413
You said were.
Past tense.

503
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:09,529
It's are.

504
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:13,361
All right. How are you going
to destroy my planet?

505
01:05:13,524 --> 01:05:15,490
We sent as ship
towards your planet

506
01:05:15,575 --> 01:05:18,359
feel the capacity
with the filmpejlo.

507
01:05:18,342 --> 01:05:19,830
When's the impact

508
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:22,678
your world is
blowing to dust.

509
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,744
How long range will detective
harbor before reaches...

510
01:05:27,854 --> 01:05:29,430
Is clocked.

511
01:05:29,499 --> 01:05:31,336
You will never see it coming.

512
01:05:33,002 --> 01:05:37,297
Another trick we pick
it up from the Draks.

513
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:43,767
So, that's why they
want you alive.

514
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:48,182
They want to get the ship
coordinates out of you. -They'll try.

515
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:51,095
But you'll die first.

516
01:05:51,195 --> 01:05:53,157
That's right.

517
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,731
Well, no then is no
reason to keep you alive.

518
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:59,450
I can kill you right now.
-You could.

519
01:05:59,605 --> 01:06:01,461
But?
-Come on.

520
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,608
Everybody wants
to be a hero.

521
01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:05,295
It's a one glimmer hope

522
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:07,905
that you might be
a savior world.

523
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:09,946
I told you, I don't care.

524
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:11,582
They can go to
the twelve hells.

525
01:06:11,649 --> 01:06:13,829
I don't believe you.

526
01:06:13,923 --> 01:06:16,752
Centauri, I have
incoming transmission.

527
01:06:16,874 --> 01:06:18,627
Patch it through.

528
01:06:18,702 --> 01:06:20,887
Commander Karzo,
this is battle ship Aurora.

529
01:06:20,982 --> 01:06:23,384
Do you copy?
-Copy that Aurora.

530
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:24,849
Karzo is dead.

531
01:06:24,908 --> 01:06:27,681
This is Lieutenant Centauri 7
as acting commander.

532
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:29,263
Copy that, Lieutenant.

533
01:06:29,326 --> 01:06:31,040
We'll arrived in the
last known signal point

534
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:33,510
from Prometheus
before you went down.

535
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,022
We waiting on bipen location.

536
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:38,903
Clea, activate personal biken.

537
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:43,450
Signal ineshiated.
-Aurora, you have it?

538
01:06:43,595 --> 01:06:47,229
Affirmative. It's weak
but we should be able to find.

539
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:51,342
ITA in 15 minutes.
-Roger that.

540
01:06:51,477 --> 01:06:53,769
Centauri 7 out.

541
01:06:58,082 --> 01:07:00,943
When we get back to Sedonia

542
01:07:01,066 --> 01:07:03,576
they gonna torture you.

543
01:07:03,684 --> 01:07:06,304
They will get the
information they want.

544
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:08,926
You won't last.

545
01:07:09,034 --> 01:07:13,695
The plan we won't be there
by the time we arrived. -That soon?

546
01:07:14,523 --> 01:07:16,587
And all this?

547
01:07:16,676 --> 01:07:19,302
The wild chase to give ship
the time you need it?

548
01:07:19,415 --> 01:07:21,667
Get the long
before we'll do.

549
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:25,465
Why plans full of people
they are innocent?

550
01:07:25,578 --> 01:07:26,890
They are not
responsible for the war

551
01:07:26,947 --> 01:07:28,609
or your planet
destruction?

552
01:07:28,681 --> 01:07:31,601
The high counsel is.
-You all fall of blindly.

553
01:07:31,727 --> 01:07:33,200
It's no excuse.
-It's the law.

554
01:07:33,264 --> 01:07:35,219
What's the God
that you creed?

555
01:07:35,303 --> 01:07:37,466
Your Gods would telling me
the way to entire world?

556
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,517
No, we split out on different
stars and surrounding races.

557
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,044
By slaving
and destroying now.

558
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:45,520
They don't accept our
way of life then yes.

559
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,582
You make me sick.

560
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:51,094
This from the race that couldn't
defend them self get it other.

561
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:53,071
Let lonely and
beating the army.

562
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:56,082
Only an ignorant species will
make war against own kind.

563
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:57,208
Shut up!

564
01:07:57,252 --> 01:07:59,562
You command mass murder
on a galactic scale

565
01:07:59,661 --> 01:08:01,085
and you think
it's holly crusade.

566
01:08:01,147 --> 01:08:03,138
This is a lie!

567
01:08:03,224 --> 01:08:04,723
Unless some
come as a long

568
01:08:04,788 --> 01:08:07,565
and takes away
control from you.

569
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:10,071
Your words, not mine.

570
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:12,011
That will never happened.

571
01:08:13,049 --> 01:08:15,370
I wonder why.

572
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:34,168
You are right.

573
01:08:34,252 --> 01:08:37,289
I do care
about my world.

574
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:43,514
I have wife
and child there.

575
01:08:45,348 --> 01:08:48,549
I would like to
see them again.

576
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:54,785
Our women don't fight.

577
01:08:54,896 --> 01:08:57,563
They care about
the children.

578
01:08:57,678 --> 01:09:01,974
Our soldiers
are up there.

579
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,593
As one warrior to another

580
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:09,308
I respectfully ask that you take
this war to those responsible.

581
01:09:13,778 --> 01:09:16,488
You'll just be killing
the women and children.

582
01:09:16,604 --> 01:09:21,610
Is that what you want a
legacy of your kind to be?

583
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:39,088
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

584
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,920
Is that...
-Where the ship is.

585
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:47,666
Call your people. I'll give
them the coordinates.

586
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:50,430
You better hurry.
You don't have much time.

587
01:09:50,542 --> 01:09:52,861
Clea? Patch me to
the Alpha base.

588
01:09:52,961 --> 01:09:54,857
Transmitting.

589
01:09:54,939 --> 01:09:58,194
Alpha base, this is Lieutenant
Centauri 7. Do you copy?

590
01:09:58,334 --> 01:10:00,547
Copy Lieutenant.
What is your status?

591
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:02,069
The prisoner is in custody

592
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:05,061
and willing to give
coordinates of the bomb ship.

593
01:10:05,223 --> 01:10:07,060
Lieutenant, we are ready to
get the information.

594
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:09,306
Please, sent to us
immediately.

595
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,502
What's the
coordinates? -No.

596
01:10:11,593 --> 01:10:15,320
I want to be the
one who tells them.

597
01:10:17,437 --> 01:10:20,899
The coordinates are 22...
-Non authorized user.

598
01:10:21,048 --> 01:10:23,539
Clea, authorized the human.

599
01:10:23,646 --> 01:10:26,032
Stage your name.
-Orn Jericho.

600
01:10:26,135 --> 01:10:28,757
Orn Jericho痴 now authorized.

601
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:36,323
The coordinates are 22- 9,
7-13, 0-40, 2-6-0.

602
01:10:36,642 --> 01:10:38,964
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

603
01:10:39,064 --> 01:10:42,474
It's an M-class
star frigate.

604
01:10:48,176 --> 01:10:51,332
We have confirmation
the ship does identify.

605
01:10:51,468 --> 01:10:55,720
Sending Bell ship to
intercept. -We found it.

606
01:10:56,806 --> 01:10:58,197
Well done, Lieutenant.

607
01:10:58,257 --> 01:10:59,570
We no longer
need the prisoner.

608
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:02,206
You may terminated
him at will.

609
01:11:02,318 --> 01:11:05,568
Roger that.
Centauri 7 out.

610
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,252
They want me that
terminated you.

611
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:21,762
I saved your world.
Your family.

612
01:11:23,885 --> 01:11:25,364
Not really.

613
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:27,870
I don't have any
wife and children.

614
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:34,962
That's good and you won't have
anything to worried about

615
01:11:35,085 --> 01:11:37,426
when your planet
blowing on bits.

616
01:11:38,546 --> 01:11:39,833
You didn't think
that I give you

617
01:11:39,889 --> 01:11:41,551
the real coordinates,
did you?

618
01:11:41,623 --> 01:11:43,086
We have confirmation
on the craft.

619
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:45,065
It's a decoy,
you idiot.

620
01:11:45,147 --> 01:11:50,168
No men. There is nothing
but salvage on that ship.

621
01:11:56,629 --> 01:11:58,665
You can't stop this.

622
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:00,883
It's already over.

623
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,072
Superior race, ha?

624
01:12:11,526 --> 01:12:14,052
I'm giving you
some advice, alien.

625
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:18,949
Never let your weapon forward
in the hand of your enemy.

626
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:13,880
I'm gonna let you in
our little secret.

627
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,945
We never lunch
the bomb ship.

628
01:14:16,029 --> 01:14:17,260
We couldn't.

629
01:14:17,534 --> 01:14:20,363
We've no idea
where the Sadonia was.

630
01:14:21,309 --> 01:14:23,822
But now that I'm authorized
the access you date a base

631
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:26,564
she's gonna tell me
everything I need to know.

632
01:14:26,677 --> 01:14:30,117
You think, I forced the crash
your ship by accident?

633
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,141
You want it the bomb ship?

634
01:14:32,257 --> 01:14:34,329
I let you right to it.

635
01:14:37,684 --> 01:14:40,602
Now, you gonna learn
what's feels like

636
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,404
to be a last of your kind.

637
01:15:01,516 --> 01:15:04,201
You want to know the
different between you and me?

638
01:15:04,317 --> 01:15:08,419
I did have a wife and
son back on the Earth.

639
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:22,868
Centauri 7,
this is the Aurora.

640
01:15:22,948 --> 01:15:24,884
We just clear
out the gate

641
01:15:24,968 --> 01:15:25,968
and enter into the atmosphere.

642
01:15:26,011 --> 01:15:29,602
The craft it's on it's
way down. Stand by.

643
01:15:51,533 --> 01:15:53,529
Centauri 7, this is
Commander Chane

644
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:56,285
in the Aurora.

645
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,321
We are on the ground.

646
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:01,651
What is your status?

647
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:09,926
Centauri 7, you picking
up my transmission?

648
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:14,133
Centauri 7,
do you copy?

649
01:16:32,116 --> 01:16:34,384
The only one
who made it, ha?

650
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:40,476
You look like hell.

651
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:42,268
Must a be the rough one.

652
01:16:42,342 --> 01:16:46,026
Get you to the
informative right away.

653
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:49,681
Clea, upload the
coordinates to the Sedonia

654
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,341
into the ship computer.

655
01:19:53,909 --> 01:19:55,898
Clea.

656
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:01,096
Clea, I command you
to respond.

657
01:20:14,164 --> 01:20:16,597
San of a bitch.

658
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,743
Alpha base. This is
on the craft Jewelry size.

659
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:06,044
Commander Chane is
no longer responsive.

660
01:21:14,493 --> 01:21:18,233
Starting sequence
complete. Clea 19.

661
01:21:18,759 --> 01:21:21,554
Hello, Centauri 7.
-Hello, Clea.

662
01:21:21,674 --> 01:21:23,284
It's good to have you back.

663
01:21:23,354 --> 01:21:25,649
I take you by
my new casing

664
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:27,577
that you follow
my instructions.

665
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,293
Centauri, I have incoming
transmission for Alpha base.

666
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,655
Patch it through.

667
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:41,273
Lieutenant,
this is Alpha base.

668
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,976
What's going on
now down there?

669
01:21:45,085 --> 01:21:46,635
If I were you

670
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:49,952
I'd be more concerning
what's going on up there.

671
01:21:50,092 --> 01:21:52,169
Centauri 7, you
are on the orders.

672
01:21:52,259 --> 01:21:53,704
What is the status
of the human?

673
01:21:53,766 --> 01:21:55,422
Find another one to
do your dirty work.

674
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:58,664
Centauri 7 out.
End of transmission.

675
01:22:02,563 --> 01:22:04,552
Whatever you
planning to do, Centauri

676
01:22:04,638 --> 01:22:06,234
I suggest you to
do it quickly.

677
01:22:06,303 --> 01:22:08,137
It won't be long before
the human traced

678
01:22:08,217 --> 01:22:10,873
the source of that
signal at the Sedonia.

679
01:22:12,769 --> 01:22:14,786
He already has.

680
01:22:14,873 --> 01:22:17,228
Is not that right.

681
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,432
He didn't kill you. Why?

682
01:22:21,547 --> 01:22:23,472
Same reason you
didn't kill me.

683
01:22:24,897 --> 01:22:27,583
Yeah, what's that?

684
01:22:27,937 --> 01:22:30,926
I'll tell you
when I see you.

685
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,314
Centauri, how we may suppose
to get out from here?

686
01:22:39,445 --> 01:22:41,691
Another our ship has to pass
be around here somewhere.

687
01:22:41,788 --> 01:22:44,349
You realized we would be
breaking 26 high council's laws

688
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,889
by taking this
course of action.

689
01:22:46,994 --> 01:22:49,881
Is that a problem?
-Not at all.

690
01:22:50,005 --> 01:22:53,370
Let's get to twelve
hells off this rock.
