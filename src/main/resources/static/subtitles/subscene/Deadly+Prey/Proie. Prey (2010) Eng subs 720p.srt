1
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:08,100
David!

2
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:09,433
David!

3
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:28,350
Dad!

4
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:32,058
I'm here. Come quickly.

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,725
Where are you?

6
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,100
Come here.

7
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:49,475
- I'm here, I'm here!
- Where are you, Dad? Dad!

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,933
- What happened?
- Damn, the shoulder!

9
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,100
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,600
Your damn dog woke me up.

11
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,308
He was barking like mad.

12
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:58,725
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,017
- I don't know what's got into them.
- Who? What are you talking about?

14
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,933
Do not move ...

15
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:09,767
Wait, wait ...

16
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,850
Oh, shit!

17
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:49,517
How long have you had that?

18
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:52,308
What?

19
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,767
That? That's nothing.
It's just my eczema.

20
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,475
It's been itching for a few days
but it's nothing serious.

21
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:00,183
What makes you say it's eczema?

23
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,058
Is that the tone you used
to persuade Claire to move into town?

24
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,308
Come on!

25
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,433
Oh, shit!

26
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,975
What is this?

27
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:53,892
Chemical burns!

28
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:55,683
How could I have got them?

29
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,267
That's what the tests will tell us.

30
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,142
How is my grandfather?

31
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:35,517
I think he knows
we're sleeping together.

32
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,767
He's well enough to tell me off
about taking you with me.

33
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:51,642
You should have that cleaned.

35
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,392
Don't you want to tell them
before we leave?

36
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,183
I don't want them to think
that's why I'm going.

37
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:10,683
Isn't it?

38
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:38,058
What's your father doing
in your mother's car?

39
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:43,142
Yes.

40
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:46,808
Yes, but no!

41
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,308
Tell him I don't care
if his mother is in hospital.

42
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,975
I want her at the factory
on Monday morning at eight.

43
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:53,850
Yes.

44
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,017
Marie ...

45
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:59,100
Is Claire the only one
who knows about the fertiliser?

46
00:08:59,183 --> 00:09:00,683
Do not worry, go!

47
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,058
I like your father too much
to reveal to him what you're like.

48
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,475
- Do you understand what you did?
- I will find a solution!

49
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,475
You no longer have a choice!

50
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,558
- Dad!
- Do you think that it does not concern you?

51
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,100
Well, go there!

52
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,808
Why has he brought her back here again?

53
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,892
Do not worry. She can not do anything,
as long as we stay in our land!

54
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,725
She'd better not.

55
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,808
You can't miss a beast like this one.

56
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:38,100
No, Look at this!
It must weigh at least 250kg.

57
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:39,725
And this one's for me.

58
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,308
What are we doing?
Shall we take a look at the fence?

59
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,600
No, we'll go to the cabin first.

60
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:55,017
Then we'll go and look at the lake.

61
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:58,392
I'm warning you, David.
I'm a proper hunter.

62
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,350
- Surely you're not going to use that?

63
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,767
No, thank you!

64
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,183
- Look at it. It's a beauty.

65
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,808
Nathan, fancy a hunting session
before shutting yourself away in town?

66
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:22,183
She's waiting for you if you want to go there.

67
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,600
Oh, shit!

68
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,808
It's okay, take off your phone!

69
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,475
Yeah?

70
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,142
No.

71
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,850
No, it's all sorted.

72
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:28,183
What's in that file?

73
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,558
What happened this morning, puts everything into question.

74
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,058
I do not wanna let you go hunting.

75
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:37,517
Do you think that it is in your power?

76
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:38,850
This forest belongs to us.

77
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:41,725
If you go, you'll ruin my restriction policy.

78
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:47,683
If word's got out, that is.

79
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,433
What are you doing?

80
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:56,475
I'm coming with you.

81
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,433
Why don't you stay at the factory
rather than pissing on my patch?

82
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:02,975
Until further notice.
you'll be living off that factory.

83
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,100
- Hey!
- Hey, let's calm down!

84
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:12,100
Nicolas rights.
We need all the help we can get to catch that beast.

85
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,392
And our child?

86
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,642
I just need six more months.

87
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,350
You've been needing six more months for four years.

88
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,767
Don't start!

89
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:31,725
Whenever we do anything together.
you two have to argue.

90
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,808
I do not know ...

91
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,933
What with the work at the lab...

92
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:46,308
We can always have one later on.

93
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,683
Does your father realise
what he's asking you to do?

94
00:12:56,808 --> 00:13:00,600
Does he have any idea
what it's costing us?

95
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,225
What do you want me to say?

96
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:11,767
Eric?
Your offer is still valid?

97
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:12,600
Yes!

98
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,392
What are you gonna do?

99
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,392
If you won't talk to your father.
I will.

100
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,017
I forbid you to do that.

101
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,933
Why do you think I got transferred?

102
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:22,183
I'm sick of your family

103
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:26,558
and the fertilisers and chemicals
you build your empire on.

104
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,892
I've kept quiet all these years.
letting him manipulate you.

105
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:29,975
Not this time.

106
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,142
Nathan ...

107
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:32,683
Nathan ...

108
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:35,142
Nathan!

109
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:39,475
Make your mind up.
Are you coming or not?

110
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,767
Leave him alone, David!

111
00:13:40,892 --> 00:13:43,183
I'm glad you're coming with us, Nathan.

112
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,475
OK ...

113
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:46,225
Now we need to find the others.

114
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,600
- Are you OK?

115
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,850
Not really ...

116
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:20,100
Damn ...

117
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:23,350
Well, Move!

118
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,225
Why are you bothering with that?

119
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,225
You can never get it started.

120
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,183
When it was in working order.
I could.

121
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:31,017
When did we last come here?

122
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,517
Before your mother died.

123
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,850
Nice one, little brother.

124
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:41,933
You never miss a trick, do you?

125
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:43,100
Get out of the way.

126
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,600
Asshole!

127
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,558
Damn!

128
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,017
Damn it ...

129
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:12,392
Damn! shit!

130
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:15,725
Damn it!

131
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,225
For fuck's sake!

132
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:32,017
- Want a hand, Dad?
- No, I'm fine. Leave it.

133
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:54,558
Here. The rifles seem fine.

134
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:55,892
Thank you, Dad.

135
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:02,267
Dad, we won't get far with that calibre.

136
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:06,267
It's not the calibre
that makes the hunter.

137
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:10,392
We'll leave our mobiles here.

138
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,558
We don't want any more hassle
from the factory.

139
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:35,767
You can keep yours on you...

140
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:37,183
But turn it off!

141
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:40,517
Here, put this on.

142
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:42,183
It will stop you getting shot.

143
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:50,933
I thought you wore camouflage to go hunting.

144
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,142
Not with wild boar.

145
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,475
You sniff them out.

146
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,933
Here, you'll be needing this too.

147
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,142
Push back the catch
to finish loading it.

148
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:20,433
It's not easy when you're left-handed

149
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,850
Dad, have a word with David.
He wants to shoot it on his own.

150
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,142
Dad, have a word with David.
He wants to shoot it on his own.

151
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,808
Are you okay?

152
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,308
I'm fine.

153
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,058
Just keep an eye out for tracks.

154
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:54,517
- Did she say what was in the file?
- What??

155
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,058
Claire. Did she tell you
why she wasn't coming?

156
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:58,225
Just the usual.

157
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,975
Market pressures,
a competitor stirring up trouble.

158
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,142
You're giving your daughter
six months to come up with a formula.

159
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:11,017
- It's a family thing.
- It's your heritage that's at stake.

160
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:12,600
I couldn't let her go.

161
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:17,225
It's nothing personal.
It's just...

162
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:23,100
She's pregnant!

163
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,058
We were choosing names this morning.

164
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,517
Well?

165
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,433
It's not as if you can't
have them later on.

166
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,392
Like I said, now is not the time.

167
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:41,183
Don't talk nonsense.
Business has never been better.

168
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:58,017
Is that it? Aren't things going
as well as you claim?

169
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,600
What?

170
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:00,933
Does your father know?

171
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:06,433
What have you told him
about the family business you run?

172
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,433
How can you justify Claire staying...?

173
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,017
Listen to me, you fool ...

174
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,600
Some things are beyond you.
If you say anything to my father...

175
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:17,683
Fuck off! I'll stop at nothing
to keep her with me.

176
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,600
Is that right?

177
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:22,183
Yeah?

178
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:24,392
Do you think she will forgive you?

179
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:27,600
Do not you understand?
What's your opinion - nothing against our!

180
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:29,892
Try your luck with my father
and you'll see.

181
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:32,433
Go on, then.

182
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:36,600
OK.

183
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:40,517
We're going hunting and you're going
to keep your fucking mouth shut

184
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:08,308
Is that the one?

185
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,017
Maybe!

186
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:17,433
It's nearby.

187
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:38,100
Get ready to fire.

188
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:44,017
Go.

189
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:31,058
Get down.

190
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,558
Hush ...

191
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:40,767
Be quiet, sit quietly ....

192
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:42,017
Do not question!

193
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:44,808
He listens to you!

194
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:46,267
Only you can omit it!

195
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,850
I've been tracking it all this time
so I should shoot.

196
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,933
You can not even approach him.

197
00:23:57,017 --> 00:24:00,183
You two, surround him, one on each side.

198
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:01,558
Good!

199
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,892
Pull it back. Easier said than done!

200
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:57,017
How does this thing work?

201
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,142
Damn!

202
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,308
Nathan!

203
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:23,392
Drive it, damn you!

204
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:43,058
Hell, they got me.
Hell, they got me.

205
00:25:46,392 --> 00:25:48,058
Hell, they got me.

206
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,642
Shoot, Nathan! For fuck's sake, shoot!

207
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:15,517
Damn ...

208
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:27,933
I knew we needed a higher calibre.

209
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:36,267
Why didn't you load your gun?

210
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,683
Why did you come
if you weren't going to shoot?

211
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:40,850
It's been hit.

212
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,725
There's blood pouring out everywhere.

213
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:49,475
OK.

214
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:55,892
Quiet, quiet!

215
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,308
Be careful.

216
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:06,933
We're going to have to smoke it out.

217
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:09,642
Quiet!

218
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:12,975
Quiet!

219
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:17,267
Quiet!
Nico, help me.

220
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,017
Come on!

221
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:39,933
Oh, hell!

222
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,808
Damn, this can not be ....

223
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
I don't believe it.

224
00:28:58,225 --> 00:28:59,683
Maybe it's already dead.

225
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:06,517
The smell would have been different.

226
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:10,642
- Oh, NO! No, no, no!
- What happened to him?

227
00:29:17,308 --> 00:29:18,725
Dad, wait. Be careful.

228
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:20,100
Do not come too close!

229
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:24,808
This bastard lair has two entrances.

230
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,975
- Dad ...
- Eric, okay?

231
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,017
Aa, go away!

232
00:29:46,142 --> 00:29:48,475
Dad, tell me.

233
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:57,808
- A higher calibre, eh?
- Everything will be alright, everything will be fine.

234
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:02,642
- At least I will have beaten your record!
- It's not the one we're after.

235
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:06,308
- How do you know?

236
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:08,600
This one has all its teeth.

237
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,058
Look at this.

238
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:22,183
It's been attacked, too.

239
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:24,933
It's covered in bites.

240
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:26,517
Here and here!

241
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,683
Well, what? what happened?

242
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:35,808
- Nathan, come, look, Nathan!
- What is it?

243
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:06,558
Such as?

244
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:08,975
Tell me they're not the same burns.

245
00:31:09,975 --> 00:31:13,850
It must have rubbed itself
against the tree until it bled.

246
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:15,683
It says a lot.

247
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:20,017
They rub up against trees to get rid
of any parasites from the wallow.

248
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:23,350
The wallow?

249
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:35,183
Eric, do your burns itch
before or after you shower?

250
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:36,642
After!

251
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:55,267
David ... give me your knife.

252
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,350
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

253
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,725
If it's the water,
we're about to find out.

254
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,392
Oh ... you bastard.

255
00:32:41,808 --> 00:32:42,933
Oh!

256
00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:44,642
Unbelievable!

257
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,683
Where's the lake
you mentioned earlier, Eric?

258
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,350
Tell me, Nathan ...

259
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:57,017
I have the same marks as the boar.
Does that mean I'm rotten inside too?

260
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,267
- That depends.

261
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,683
- On what?

262
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:04,892
Have you had any stomach pains recently?

263
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:11,392
Wait. Can it be cured? Well?

264
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:14,267
It's getting dark and it's raining.
We should turn back.

265
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,642
Use your torch if you're still scared of the dark.

266
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:19,892
How many water towers like yours
are there in this forest?

267
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,433
Enough to supply all the taps
in the region.

268
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:28,808
Give me your phone, Nathan!

269
00:35:29,308 --> 00:35:31,892
I'll call Marie
so she can inform the health board.

270
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:34,767
I think she already knows.

271
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,642
I think she already knows.

272
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:50,017
A health report that ended up
on your ex-wife's desk?

273
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,350
Is that why Claire has to stay
another six months?

274
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:55,683
We had no choice!

275
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,683
We?

276
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:03,475
He needed a chemist
to modify the fertiliser.

277
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:06,433
You've involved Claire in this?

278
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:09,142
I had to make the fertiliser
more competitive.

279
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:10,683
Competitive?

280
00:36:10,808 --> 00:36:14,558
Jesus, Nicolas, you've made
your bloody fertiliser so toxic.

281
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:16,725
it's got into the ground water.

282
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,308
What are you complaining about? You enjoyed it!

283
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,850
Would you rather have lost everything?

284
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:25,183
The farm, the factory, the land? ...

285
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,892
- What you left me was shit, Dad.

286
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,183
Nicolas, listen to me!

287
00:36:28,308 --> 00:36:32,058
Your factory, your formulas -
it was all shit.

288
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:36,350
If I hadn't got my ass into gear,
we'd have nothing at all.

289
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:52,183
Is that how you convinced
your daughter to help you?

290
00:36:52,308 --> 00:36:55,225
I've already told you,
she puts her family first.

291
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,767
You bastard.

292
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,975
Enough!

293
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:02,308
Dad! Dad!

294
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:04,142
Dad, come and look at this. Quickly.

295
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:05,517
Call Marie!

296
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,683
Tell her that's the end of your schemes!

297
00:37:16,892 --> 00:37:18,850
Oh God, no ...

298
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:21,558
This is unbelievable.

299
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:24,142
That one was pregnant
when she ate this shit.

300
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,808
Oh, my God!

301
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:38,017
She must have been breast-feeding
for a while.

302
00:38:38,142 --> 00:38:40,808
Her tits are still swollen.

303
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:57,600
She still has traces of our products
in her mouth.

304
00:38:59,683 --> 00:39:01,642
Oh, my God!

305
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,183
It's okay, Eric?

306
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:15,475
All right, thank you!

307
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:33,558
What is this?

308
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:41,392
- It's what chased the stags from the forest.
- What?

309
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:47,100
The rest of the pack.

310
00:39:49,142 --> 00:39:50,475
Damn.

311
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:10,225
Prepare to shoot.

312
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,183
Switch that fucking thing off.

313
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:34,850
Dad!

314
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:37,475
- Dad!
- Shoot!

315
00:41:39,808 --> 00:41:40,683
Damn!

316
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:42,058
Kill him, kill him!

317
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:50,225
- Do not be!

318
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,850
Nicolas!

319
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:29,183
Nicolas!

320
00:42:32,308 --> 00:42:34,017
Nicolas!

321
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,392
Everything will be fine.

322
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,767
Nicolas!

323
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:45,350
Dad!

324
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:48,892
Do not go there! Stay on the spot!

325
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:50,808
- Let me go!
- No!

326
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:58,767
- Go!
- Leave me alone, I say the same!

327
00:42:58,892 --> 00:43:01,350
- Too late!
- Let me go!

328
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:25,350
Go to the trees!

329
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:27,808
Nicolas!

330
00:43:34,058 --> 00:43:35,975
Nicolas!

331
00:43:45,225 --> 00:43:46,850
Faster, faster!

332
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:58,392
Hurry, they're coming.

333
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:09,058
Give me your hand!

334
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:20,767
I'm sorry, David.
I panicked!

335
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,058
David, I did not want.
Drool Stop, stop!

336
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:27,392
David, no.

337
00:44:27,517 --> 00:44:30,308
Did you think you'd just run away, you bastard?
You're going to pay for this.

338
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:33,725
I'm going to kill you.

339
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,642
- Stop messing about.
- Don't you dare pull a gun on me

340
00:44:35,767 --> 00:44:37,600
I'll kill you, you dirty bastard!

341
00:44:37,683 --> 00:44:38,642
David, stop!

342
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:40,642
David, stop!

343
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:41,808
Hell, David, stop!

344
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:51,558
David, that's enough!

345
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:53,100
Stop it!

346
00:44:53,183 --> 00:44:54,683
Damn it, stop!

347
00:44:58,392 --> 00:45:00,350
Please, David, stop!

348
00:45:00,475 --> 00:45:01,642
Stop it!

349
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,558
David, stop!

350
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:16,475
Stop it, David, stop!

351
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:20,808
No!

352
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,767
No, no!

353
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:36,058
David, David!

354
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,933
David, David!

355
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:51,767
David ...

356
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,683
David ...

357
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:15,433
Oh, shit!

358
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,725
My brother?

359
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,308
He's dead.

360
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:48,933
- The fall broke his neck.
- I'm sorry, Nathan.

361
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:55,433
That should stop the haemorrhaging.

362
00:46:57,225 --> 00:47:00,517
That's your mobile.
It's still in my jacket pocket.

363
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,017
I'm sure it's Claire.

364
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,183
She called earlier.

365
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:09,642
Damn!

366
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,350
She mustn't come here.

367
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,767
What are you doing?

368
00:47:22,892 --> 00:47:24,850
Do Claire and Marie know this forest?

369
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,350
Yes, Claire came here with us when she was a girl.

370
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:28,600
Why?

371
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,933
What are you doing?

372
00:47:35,058 --> 00:47:36,100
Nathan!

373
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:39,975
I'm making sure they don't get eaten too.

374
00:50:56,767 --> 00:51:00,558
Nathan! Nathan!
They are coming!

375
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,517
Hello, this is Nathan Fabre.

376
00:52:18,642 --> 00:52:22,058
I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message.

377
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:23,725
Nothing.

378
00:55:05,975 --> 00:55:07,975
Come down!
We have to go to the cabin!

379
00:55:15,308 --> 00:55:16,392
Follow me!

380
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:18,225
Rather, let him come after me!

381
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:42,475
They're giving up.

382
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:46,600
Come on! Hurry up!

383
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:08,058
I'll hand you your mobile.
Call Claire first, then the cops.

384
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:20,225
Call her!

385
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:02,933
- Give me your lighter!
- Why?

386
00:57:03,058 --> 00:57:04,392
Give me a cigarette lighter!

387
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,100
Call her now.

388
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:12,517
Pass me a gun.

389
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:14,767
Give me a gun!

390
00:57:15,392 --> 00:57:17,475
Give me a gun!

391
00:57:31,808 --> 00:57:32,850
Give it to me.

392
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:37,058
Call her now.

393
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:54,058
Wait, wait!
Where are you?

394
00:58:00,392 --> 00:58:02,933
- Hello?
- Clare, Clare?

395
00:58:03,058 --> 00:58:04,142
- What the hell's going on?

396
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:05,808
We've been trying to call you for hours.

397
00:58:07,683 --> 00:58:08,850
Did you think...

398
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:11,350
...we'd just wait
patiently for you to call?

399
00:58:11,475 --> 00:58:13,267
It's Daddy!

400
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,392
- We're coming to join you.
- No! Turn back!

401
00:58:16,517 --> 00:58:17,642
Why not?

402
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:20,892
Immediately, turn back!
Immediately!

403
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,058
Say, for God's sake, what happened?

404
00:58:26,142 --> 00:58:28,183
- Nicolas, this is Marie!
- Listen, Marie!

405
00:58:28,267 --> 00:58:30,683
Animals gone mad!
They are attacking us!

406
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,308
- David and dad are dead.
- What?

407
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:35,517
- It's the fertiliser.
- It got into the ground water.

408
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:37,433
That's why the animals are like this.

409
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,017
Nicolas, hurry up!

410
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:40,725
- Watch the traps.
- Don't tell anyone and get the hell out of here.

411
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,308
- Is Nathan with you? Is he OK?
- Just do as I say.

412
00:58:42,433 --> 00:58:44,433
- Get out of here and tell no one.

413
00:58:44,558 --> 00:58:46,933
- Dad!

414
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:48,767
Nicolas!

415
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,892
Hurry. Get back.

416
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,642
They haven't bitten through it.

418
01:00:48,308 --> 01:00:49,517
What are you doing?

419
01:00:51,767 --> 01:00:53,058
I'm giving them some bait.

420
01:01:47,392 --> 01:01:49,725
Not now, Nathan. Wait till we've gone!

421
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:13,433
Shit, I can't do it.

422
01:02:15,308 --> 01:02:16,850
We're going to die.

423
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,517
I can't fucking do it.

424
01:02:18,642 --> 01:02:19,683
For fuck's sake!

425
01:02:31,892 --> 01:02:33,308
Shit!

426
01:02:34,142 --> 01:02:35,642
Knock stronger!

427
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:39,683
Nathan, We Die!

428
01:02:52,558 --> 01:02:54,142
Get out!

429
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,350
Come on, come on!

430
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:21,308
Leave it!

431
01:04:21,392 --> 01:04:22,392
Leave it!

432
01:04:28,558 --> 01:04:32,808
Are you relying on your ex-wife
to sort this mess out for you?

433
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:34,892
I don't think I'll be needing her
to sort you out.

434
01:04:38,392 --> 01:04:41,725
After what you've seen,
after what happened with my brother.

435
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:45,100
you didn't think I'd let you leave this forest.

436
01:04:45,225 --> 01:04:46,767
No, I didn't.

437
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,392
OK.

438
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:01,183
After what I've seen, did you think
I was going to hand you a loaded gun?

439
01:05:10,683 --> 01:05:12,892
And what are you gonna do?

440
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,808
Report me to the police?

441
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:23,683
Do you think my daughter will forgive you?

442
01:05:23,808 --> 01:05:25,100
We'll see.

443
01:05:32,225 --> 01:05:33,683
No.

444
01:07:49,808 --> 01:07:51,183
Claire, no, wait!

445
01:07:59,517 --> 01:08:01,058
- Nathan!
- Claire!

446
01:08:01,183 --> 01:08:02,933
Claire!

447
01:08:03,058 --> 01:08:05,017
Nathan, damn it, what happens?

448
01:08:05,142 --> 01:08:08,142
No time!
Get in the car!

449
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:12,517
What is happening?

450
01:08:12,642 --> 01:08:13,975
Get in the car!

451
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:16,308
Where is Nicolas?

452
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:20,225
Where is he?

453
01:08:21,808 --> 01:08:23,142
Where is my husband?

454
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:24,933
He's dead!

455
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,017
Mom?

456
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,725
Mom?

457
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:37,933
Claire ...

458
01:08:38,017 --> 01:08:40,808
- Neeee!

459
01:08:40,933 --> 01:08:42,017
No, do not open!

460
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,975
Do not open!

461
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:50,058
Claire!

462
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:54,558
Nathan! ... Nathan!

463
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:57,892
Claire!

464
01:09:57,975 --> 01:09:59,850
Claire ...

465
01:10:00,517 --> 01:10:02,142
Claire!

466
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:18,933
Nathan! ...

467
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,517
Nathan ...

468
01:10:32,725 --> 01:10:33,642
Nathan ...

469
01:10:35,308 --> 01:10:37,642
O, damn!

470
01:10:39,475 --> 01:10:41,642
Wait, wait, do not move.

471
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:47,475
Wait, I'll get you out of here.

472
01:10:50,475 --> 01:10:53,600
Damn it! Shit!

473
01:10:54,392 --> 01:10:55,308
Wait a minute ...

474
01:10:56,517 --> 01:11:00,642
Aa, Nathan!

475
01:11:05,017 --> 01:11:06,017
Nathan!

476
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:12,100
Nathan!

477
01:11:12,225 --> 01:11:13,558
Nathan!

478
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:19,392
Nathan, hurry up! Nathan!

479
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:31,267
Nathan!

480
01:11:31,392 --> 01:11:32,600
Look out!

481
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:40,225
AAA! Nathan!

482
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,683
Nathan?

483
01:12:25,725 --> 01:12:26,725
Nathan ...

484
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:30,725
Nathan!

485
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,058
Nathan!

486
01:12:57,725 --> 01:13:00,017
Nathan ...

487
01:13:02,017 --> 01:13:04,558
No, no! I'll lose too much blood.

488
01:13:04,683 --> 01:13:07,100
- Call the emergency services.
- You're already losing blood.

489
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:08,850
Call the emergency services.

490
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:13,975
Everything will be fine ...

491
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,267
Everything will be fine ...

492
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,183

Everything will be fine ...

496
01:13:27,558 --> 01:13:28,683
Damn ...

497
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:29,642
Damn ...
