1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,036
DEADLY RUN

2
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,994
Brussels, late summer.

3
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,116
No, Madeleine.
This time I'm warm.

4
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,156
I think I know which one she is.
I'm sure of it.

5
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,115
You listening?

6
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,036
Hurry, my bath's running.

7
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,234
She's the one with the sad look.

8
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,229
Upper left.

9
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,196
Marie had that look.

10
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,232
She was a cheerful child,
but often seemed sad.

11
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,152
- The opposite of me.
- In all respects.

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,993
- Did I guess right?
- Wrong.

13
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,075
Wait.

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,192
She's the third from the right,

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,189
with the barrette .

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,115
She has your nose.

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,195
Your nose exactly.

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,031
Madeleine, answer me!

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,155
- I can't.
- Why not?

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,230
You know you only get one guess.

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,071
No second chance?

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,031
Sure. Next year.

23
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,031
OK, Madeleine.

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,116
While I've got you...

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,076
"Abundance of bread"...

26
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,029
...in 8 letters.

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,195
Opulence?

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,997
It fits. You're a genius!

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,115
When you put your mind to it.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,991
How is she?

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,194
That's going too far!

32
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,151
Bitch!

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,156
And I almost jumped
out a window for her!

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,189
It was November...

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,156
bitter cold...

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,038
Madeleine stopped me.

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,031
Whereas that idiot Taruchi...

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,072
I saw his hammer just in time...
He saw nothing.

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,037
Really dumb.

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,191
I fired through my pocket.

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,998
So now I've missed
two perfect chances to die...

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,109
Some day...

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,230
I'll die of sorrow in bed...

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,991
like all fathers.

45
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,195
Opulence...

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,072
Marie was born in 1953,
the year Stalin died.

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,150
I'd married Madeleine in 1952...

48
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,116
The year of the "H" bomb.

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,078
The "H" atoll. 6 letters: Bikini.

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,234
They left me in 1954...

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,996
the year of the cold war.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,073
I got the photo in 1961.

53
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,155
Nothing happened that year.

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,037
Except the photo...

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,038
At first, I picked the girl
with the barrette...

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,036
"You're wrong," Madeleine said.

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,109
Then I decided, she was
the little imp smiling at the camera.

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,076
"Wrong again," said Madeleine.

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,074
Now I love them all...
They're all my little Marie.

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,152
I dread disappointing them.

61
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,156
Because I will...

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,112
the day I open the door,
and enter the photo...

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,031
and Marie comes to me...

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,149
Be patient, Marie.

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,149
Wait for me...

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,195
Where were you?

67
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,029
Doing crosswords?

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,113
No, sewing, Madame Schmidt-Boulanger.
A loose button.

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,037
"The Eye!"

70
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,076
My best agent.

71
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,154
The underworld
nicknamed him "The Eye. "

72
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,997
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo.

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,073
The name mean anything to you?

74
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,149
I should hope so.

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,998
The celebrated boot makers.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,070
Established in Brussels since...?

77
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,235
Since forever!

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,993
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo have a son...

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,110
- Paul.
- Let's be brief.

80
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,156
It seems Paul has a girlfriend.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,111
A French girl.

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,240
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo would like
some information about her.

83
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,997
You follow me?

84
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,035
What?

85
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,072
She phoned the house
several times...

86
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,072
Or we wouldn't have known
the young lady existed.

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,111
How do you know she's young?

88
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,076
Hugo Jr. is 23.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,072
We'll have no trouble
finding out who she is.

90
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,993
The Hugos want a quick report.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,194
- Can you do that?
- Sure.

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,078
Can we meet tomorrow,
same time?

93
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,036
- I'll see you out.
- No need.

94
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,196
- I insist...
- We're really grateful.

95
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,156
The cashier is down the hall
to the left.

96
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,031
See you tomorrow.

97
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,033
To the left! The cashier's office...

98
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,150
I hope you got the picture.

99
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,230
Absolutely, madam.

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,075
College boy meets hooker,
parents panic, fat fees for you!

101
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,075
Simple, no?

102
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,071
Keep it that way.

103
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,195
Where will you begin?

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,038
By sewing on my button.

105
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,038
That's a woman's job.

106
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,115
I dare you!

107
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,033
The Taruchi case was simple
until you complicated it.

108
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,072
Taruchi was a
small-time blackmailer...

109
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,036
a petty crook.

110
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,077
A crook with a hammer
in his hand isn't petty!

111
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,192
That hammer was found
in Taruchi's pocket...

112
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,191
so don't try to snow me.

113
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,152
You wanted it in my skull?

114
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,230
You disappoint me!

115
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,236
I expected a little gratitude.

116
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,117
I got you off the blacklist.

117
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,078
Now I'm giving you a new case...

118
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,111
restoring your dignity!

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,235
I'm generous!

120
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,071
Very.

121
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,072
I warn you...

122
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,195
One more foul-up...

123
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,988
and you'll sweep floors
till you retire.

124
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,032
When I'm 65, Marie will be 39.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,991
Too late for celebrations.

126
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,031
Have I really put on weight?

127
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,236
Around the ass...
and even so... not much.

128
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,151
But you'll always have
pretty hands.

129
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,038
You'll always have a pretty face...

130
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,110
a pretty fur coat...

131
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,071
and a pretty blue car.

132
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,036
What's my car got to do with it?

133
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,035
Just talking.

134
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,032
Hugo And Co. Founded 1802...

135
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,993
Like the great French writer,
in 4 letters.

136
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,189
The illustrious shoemakers...

137
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,156
Outlets on 5th Avenue,
Via Venetto.

138
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,158
Exclusive suppliers to the
national jumping team.

139
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,155
M. Paul will sell everything.

140
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,111
Absolutely everything,
to the last shoehorn.

141
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,118
In order to take wenches sailing
on expensive waters.

142
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,189
The Adriatic sea, for instance.

143
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,198
The Adriatic is an extremely
fashionable sea.

144
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,118
His open collar and his cashmere sweater
are to his credit.

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,231
Rather handsome and easy going.

146
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,189
If he gets off the highway
in Morteau, I'll kill him.

147
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,150
70... 80...

148
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,071
90...

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,189
100...

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,156
A tidy sum.

151
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,151
We'll walk in parks
as we used to, Marie.

152
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,116
Botanical gardens...

153
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,032
I'll teach you the
Latin names of roses.

154
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,229
Shit!

155
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,152
Who has the right
to separate a man and his daughter?

156
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,037
You like talking to yourself?

157
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,075
Not really.

158
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,076
I'm waiting for my dad.

159
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,229
Looking for your son?

160
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,235
My little girl.

161
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,234
My dad's an engineer.

162
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,118
When I'm big,
I want to own a dodgem.

163
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,234
Who decides of the kids' fate ?

164
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,189
Who says: You'll compose
a symphony ?

165
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,119
You'll be a typist ?
And you a fighter pilot?

166
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,155
You a son of a bitch ?

167
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,191
What about you ?
What will you be later ?

168
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,196
I'll be a private detective.

169
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,195
Want to take a picture?

170
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,155
OK.

171
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,237
At last!
Who gave you that?

172
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,118
- That man.
- Give it right back to him!

173
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,069
Well, bye-bye!

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,159
Lucie!

175
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,070
Sorry!

176
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,117
Lucie Brentano...

177
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,078
born Sept. 22, 1962.

178
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,029
Student...

179
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,110
no distinguishing traits.

180
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,192
Address:
33 rue Champollion, Paris...

181
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,077
September 22...

182
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,155
Virgo...

183
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,196
The sign of gentleness.

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,115
"Dear Schmidt-Boulanger...

185
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,072
"The lady is named
Lucie Brentano.

186
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,032
"She likes peace and quiet.

187
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,196
"Smokes 'Senior Service'...

188
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,156
"and screws singing 'La Paloma. "'

189
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,075
Capricorn...

190
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,071
symbol of winter...

191
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,111
Lucie Brentano, student...

192
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,195
blue eyes...

193
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,111
Straight nose...

194
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,997
Distinguishing trait:

195
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,070
Killed a man last night.

196
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,076
- Have a good trip?
- Excellent.

197
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,196
- Put it in the safe.
- Certainly.

198
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,069
Hello, Voragine.

199
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,111
So you're out of the closet.

200
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,037
To kill whom this time?

201
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,110
Know the brunette
at the front desk?

202
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,069
Eve Granger...

203
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,071
model. You see her occasionally:

204
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,991
Not much baggage, no men.

205
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,155
How's Schmidt-Boulanger?

206
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,236
- Spreading out?
- It's prosperity.

207
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,150
Can you get me
on a flight to Nice this evening?

208
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,234
The 6:45 would suit me.

209
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,993
Flight 417 to Nice.
Of course, miss.

210
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,196
"Paul Hugo's fish bait,
Madame Schmidt-Boulanger..."

211
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,113
No, If I tell her that,
she'll call the cops.

212
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,071
So I'll say...

213
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,110
Paul and Lucie
went to Reno to marry.

214
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,070
That's no good either.

215
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,031
Paul left alone...

216
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,997
By plane, alone..

217
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,189
Montreal...

218
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,196
Air Canada...

219
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,118
His tramp ditched him.

220
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,999
Not if he just took
all his cash out of the bank.

221
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,076
Very well. So get moving.

222
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,198
Get me a ticket to Montreal
with an open return. It's for "The Eye. "

223
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,997
- What?
- Money, money.

224
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,115
Get 400 francs ready.

225
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,149
800...

226
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,078
450! And get a receipt!

227
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,236
Hooker or no,
Why'd he dump her?

228
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,231
- Jealous.
- A rival?

229
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,151
Let's just say, another man.

230
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,997
A father.

231
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,034
As I understand it,
the girl's mother was a nothing.

232
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,113
She was raised by her father,
a superior type of man.

233
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,038
She's always bragging about him.

234
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,038
Paul must have felt
unable to compete.

235
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,189
So he fled.

236
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,236
How'd you learn all this?

237
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,993
Use a mike?

238
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,152
No my dear, I haven't always
been called "The Eye. "

239
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,197
They used to call me "The Ear. "

240
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,988
Your dumb daughter is here.
Try to recognize her. Good luck.

241
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,190
She has lilac eyes...

242
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,156
she killed a man,
she looks like a kid...

243
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,189
and she eats pears.

244
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,031
Beg pardon?

245
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,991
"To blind," in 6 letters.

246
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,111
- Dazzle?
- Too easy.

247
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,989
Departure of Flight 417 for Nice.
Boarding now...

248
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,116
Capricorns, luck is still with you.

249
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,192
If you plan to travel,
now would be a good time.

250
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,199
Michel ! Michel, darling !
I thought you didn't wait for me !

251
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,195
I was scared!

252
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,993
Scared?
- More sorry than scared.

253
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,991
I thought you'd forgotten me.

254
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,032
80 people expect you
in Monte Carlo, Dorothy.

255
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,112
Dorothy! It's crazy!
Dorothy who?

256
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,109
Beg pardon?

257
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,118
"To blind," in 6 letters.
It's not "dazzle. "

258
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,195
"Betray. "

259
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,156
You're all golden. Sunbathing?

260
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,189
I've been sailing.

261
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,999
I wonder what Felix
will give his future daughter-in-law.

262
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,192
- I'm the aunt from Vittel.
- I'm the Paris cousin.

263
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,111
Cousin on the girl's side,
of course.

264
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,072
The last of the Ortiz ?
- Himself.

265
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,072
Dorothy, in the name of the family...

266
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,150
and of all the Meyerganzes...

267
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,196
allow me to present you with this.

268
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,196
They're only emeralds.

269
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,230
Sanseveria... Asplenium Nidus...

270
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,117
Asparagus plumosis...

271
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,191
- and one mink coat!
- Mink!

272
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,077
Emeralds!

273
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,150
You're nice to be with, Michel.

274
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,994
Now that you're warm,
are you hungry?

275
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,069
I want to screw.

276
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,071
Can't think of everything.

277
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,115
Dorothy Ortiz,

278
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,078
just about to indulge in
an imperial engagement night.

279
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,032
But Lucie Brentano gets her
kicks in the shoe business.

280
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,074
Problem. Splash.
No more problem.

281
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,112
We're clearing away.
Would you like something?

282
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,155
No, thank you.

283
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,116
No problem, right?

284
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,031
We all have problems.

285
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,075
More or less.

286
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,077
Dorothy! Michel!
Where are you?

287
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,997
Have you seen the kids ?

288
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,155
I was looking for them.

289
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,116
If you ask me they must have...
how to put it ?

290
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,109
Eloped!

291
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,229
They're young enough for that.

292
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,998
- Is Miss Granger back?
- Miss Granger?

293
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,116
I mean, Miss Orthiz.

294
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,192
Yes, she is back.
Would you care to call her?

295
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,033
No, she may be sleeping.

296
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,071
Thanks.

297
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,029
I'm sure it's her.

298
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,997
Her name is Doris Fleming.

299
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,075
She stole a boyfriend
from me once.

300
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,152
They went to Morocco
and he never was heard of again.

301
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,195
Come in!

302
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,190
She could have put on a robe,
don't you think?

303
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,198
We are flying at an altitude
of 25,000 feet.

304
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,997
And on our right,
we can see The Black Forest.

305
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,189
She's killed 2 men...

306
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,236
eats pears, reads Shakespeare:

307
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,028
Active, voracious, cultivated.

308
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,231
Don't get excited, boss.

309
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,074
It's long-distance
and you're paying for it, so listen.

310
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,078
- Where are you? Montreal?
- Marrakesh.

311
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,035
What!

312
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,150
I don't set the itinerary.

313
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,152
Paul Hugo is the kind of guy
who flirts incessantly.

314
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,078
First Montreal, now Morocco.

315
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,151
- And tomorrow?
- Home!

316
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,039
Bring that clown back
before his parents call in the cops.

317
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,235
My darling little daughter.

318
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,997
I put a cross so you'll know
where your Daddy lives.

319
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,118
I do think a lot about you.

320
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,149
Are you writing to Marie ?

321
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,159
Yes. The little one can barely
take our separations,

322
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,033
but then, her mother has
to see her sometimes.

323
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,998
You should send them a picture
of you in your djellaba.

324
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,110
It really suits you.
- Yes, yes, thank you.

325
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,236
Have you read the horoscope ?
It's excellent.

326
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,152
As you can see,
I'm taking up your bad habits.

327
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,231
Capricorns:
avoid useless agitation;

328
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,038
things are coming to meet you.

329
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,991
You'll meet new people

330
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,079
and become really popular.
Love, love, love...

331
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,072
P.S. Beware!

332
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,038
The forces of evil
crawl like spiders towards you.

333
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,117
See you tonight, my friend.

334
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,109
Stop following me!

335
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,149
I'm not!

336
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,110
We always seem to go
the same way.

337
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,233
Hey, Ariane!

338
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,192
We have a date tonight.
Don't forget.

339
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,072
Bet 200 francs
you'll sleep with one of those idiots.

340
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,155
Not likely.

341
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,158
When you get horny,
come sleep with me.

342
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,998
My name is Cora. I'm in 317.

343
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,109
I'd like to change rooms.

344
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,031
I'm just next door to
a couple of newlyweds

345
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,075
who wail like wild animals,

346
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,115
and I can't sleep a wink.

347
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,111
Don't you have anything
around the number 300 ?

348
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,038
Number 308 is free
and 320 soon will be too.

349
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,031
What about 316 ?

350
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,149
We never offer it.

351
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,196
It's an emergency room,
with a mere shower.

352
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,078
I love them. I love showers.

353
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,116
My father is an anthropologist.

354
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,997
He even went up the Nile...

355
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,991
God knows how far.

356
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,150
Another time he went
to the North Cape.

357
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,998
He sent me a postcard
from the Lofoten Islands.

358
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,032
I wonder where he is now.

359
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,071
What are you talking about?

360
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,033
- About my father.
- Who cares about him?

361
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,192
- You mustn't be home much.
- Unfortunately.

362
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,074
My wife always wanted me
to take a sedentary job...

363
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,196
Teacher, or some such.

364
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,231
But when the Nile obsesses you...

365
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,073
We had some painful scenes.

366
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,072
Just before a voyage
to the North Cape...

367
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,150
Madeleine threatened to jump
out of a window..

368
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,073
- "Go ahead, do it," I said.
- My God!

369
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,149
Blackmail.

370
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,155
Excuse me now...

371
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,072
it's time to take the waters.
See you tonight.

372
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,155
What a farce!

373
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,037
You were amoral.
Now you're boring, Jerry.

374
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,072
- I'm not answerable to anyone.
- Of course not.

375
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,117
I'm simply warning you:

376
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,235
Cora's a bitch.

377
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,152
Lays girls, but hates 'em.

378
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,077
When she's through with you...

379
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,229
she'll dump you.

380
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,073
You talk about her
as if she were a guy.

381
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,155
- Talking of me?
- Yes.

382
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,072
- Was it amusing?
- Rather.

383
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,155
What'd he say?

384
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,072
That I'm a nympho?
Paranoid? Manic-something?

385
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,075
A bitch!

386
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,193
Funny: Roman whores took milk baths.
Today's use Clorox.

387
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,157
No wonder the streams are polluted.

388
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,996
Don't touch that! Makes me nervous.

389
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,110
Stop biting your nails. It's tacky.

390
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,038
Here's your ticket to Brussels,
Miss Chevallier.

391
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,110
A single with dining car.

392
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,112
- Your taxi will be here at 8:00 p.m.
- Thank you.

393
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,149
Please get my bill ready.

394
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,231
So ? This is the big night !

395
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,157
You're going to pick up
Marie at the station ?

396
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,151
Yes. At 11:57 p.m.
- Here.

397
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,195
You'll give this to her.

398
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,118
It's nothing, really.
I did it to pass the time.

399
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,997
I hope she'll like it.

400
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,114
Thank you.
It's... It's pretty.

401
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,151
Do you know what ?
Somebody stole my necklace !

402
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,151
Stole, stole !

403
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,150
You probably lost them
at the Roman Baths.

404
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,991
Or in the shower.

405
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,110
You're always flaunting
those rocks of yours.

406
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,111
Stop it ! Can't you see
I'm really upset ?

407
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,151
Don't get upset. We're going.

408
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,996
Really, this is...
You've got a heart,

409
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,149
well done.

410
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,073
Things could have
been different, Jerry.

411
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,071
I mean: a little better.

412
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,078
Too late, unfortunately:
I'm going back to Bruxelles.

413
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,195
I'm going back to Bruxelles.

414
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,117
Excuse me, my cab is waiting.

415
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,997
Let him wait,
your luggage is in my car.

416
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,155
What ?

417
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,076
Can't he mind his own business ?
What a sod !

418
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,190
You were right after all:
she's a monster.

419
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,156
She dumped me just like that.

420
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,235
Hello, madam,
did you have a nice trip?

421
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,118
- Excellent.
- Keeping your room for the week?

422
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,109
Probably.

423
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,072
Could you give me the envelope
I put in the safe?

424
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,069
I'll come with you.

425
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,037
Hello "The Eye!"

426
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,075
Still on her tail?

427
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,235
She just arrived.

428
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,149
I heard you were in Montreal.

429
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,229
In Marrakesh.

430
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,157
I was in Marrakesh.

431
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,993
- Is it nice there?
- Ask Flatfoot.

432
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,109
You've had many calls.

433
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,031
One person came by twice.

434
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,031
I've thought about it.
I don't want my room.

435
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,109
Very well, madam.

436
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,236
She's really got you running.

437
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,117
No time to put your bag down.

438
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,031
I'll put it down one day, Voragine.

439
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,076
That day, I'll push
the classroom door...

440
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,109
Let me go!

441
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,031
Let me go,
or I'll break your arm!

442
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,189
Keep the change.

443
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,231
Change? You must be mistaken.

444
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,236
You've given me 100.

445
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,078
Scumbag. It's 1,000.

446
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,118
Pardon me.
It must be my mistake.

447
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,235
That's all right. Keep it anyway.

448
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,038
This happens all the time,
but it doesn't really matter.

449
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,149
It's deplorable.

450
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,034
It's quite deplorable,
but it doesn't really matter.

451
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,195
What's the book?

452
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,031
I heard you turning pages.

453
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,149
Hamlet.

454
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,152
It's hard to make actors say:

455
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,196
"To be or not to be. "

456
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,073
Or... "Murder...

457
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,150
"though it have no tongue...

458
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,197
"will speak with most
miraculous organ. "

459
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,150
Do you know the
recording of "La Paloma"

460
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,192
by Hans Albert, in the 30s ?

461
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,078
- No.
- That's too bad.

462
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,037
What time is it?

463
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,110
I can hear pages,
but not the hands on a watch.

464
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,149
11:50 p.m.

465
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,038
The Rome train
leaves in 15 minutes.

466
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,189
I'm going to Rome, too.

467
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,989
Capricorns. If you intend to travel,
jump on the opportunity.

468
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,235
Now is the time.

469
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,076
Train suits you better than plane.

470
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,991
Have a nice trip.

471
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,236
What if I said I was brunette,
had black eyes...

472
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,038
and smoked "Marlboros?"

473
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,110
Fine, but I wouldn't believe you.

474
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,151
You're blond, blue eyed...

475
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,230
and smoke "Players. "

476
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,149
"Senior Service. "

477
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,118
And you won't take off your coat.

478
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,071
Been thinking about my coat?

479
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,195
Constantly.

480
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,031
My antenna tells me everything.

481
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,031
That's why I don't need
a white cane.

482
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,038
I can foretell storms, hurricanes...

483
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,031
earthquakes...

484
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,229
In my youth...

485
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,038
it saved my mother's life.

486
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,077
We were on holiday in Sicily.

487
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,078
Suddenly, I smelled a snake
under the stones...

488
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,195
A foul smell.

489
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,235
You're "The Eye?"

490
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,071
You phoned?

491
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,196
I'm Mme. Comolli. Come on up.

492
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,116
His name is Forbes.

493
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,037
He's Swiss.

494
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,990
Very wealthy, very shrewd,
speaks 8 languages and loves art.

495
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,190
Has one of the finest homes
on the coast.

496
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,078
Here's the address and phone.

497
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,036
- What does one say?
- Thank you.

498
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,152
No, I meant what does
one say to your boss?

499
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,149
She telexes daily.

500
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,156
She's sick of chasing you!

501
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,158
Everybody's running after
someone else, little lady.

502
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,190
One day she'll show you the door!

503
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,069
When I'm shown the door,

504
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,150
you'll only have to push it,
Madame Comolli.

505
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,236
There will be a blackboard,
and little girls.

506
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,234
Marie will say: "Here I am I"
and all the little girls will applaud.

507
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,033
Hamlet.
A tragedy in five acts.

508
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,031
The castle of Ellsinore.

509
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,196
A terrace, battlements...

510
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,155
I've been waiting for you.

511
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,198
Good news:
Schlosser's paintings are coming.

512
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,112
One is specially fine.

513
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,116
I'm sure you'll love it, too.

514
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,116
The Traveller.

515
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,156
When you touch it...

516
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,073
it's as smooth, as exquisite,
as a Latour.

517
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,071
You're exquisite, too, Charlotte.

518
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,116
You're exquisite, Charlotte.

519
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,156
Charlotte who?

520
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,234
Look where you're going!

521
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,037
I don't believe it.

522
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,115
Come on.

523
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,115
Come on, move it.

524
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,231
Bastard smokes in bed!

525
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,071
Why do you let him?

526
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,189
Why does he have the right?

527
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,189
Because he's blind?

528
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,031
Or because he's rich?

529
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,116
We spent our vacations...

530
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,115
in Denmark...

531
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,993
I smelled a snake under the stones...

532
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,991
A foul smell...

533
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,031
I can stink, too.

534
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,077
Bump into furniture. Play dumb.

535
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,031
Looking for something?

536
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,031
My granddaughter's ball...

537
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,110
a sort of round red ball.

538
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,116
A red ball.

539
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,190
It must've come over the wall.

540
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,232
Wait, Marie.

541
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,069
I'm coming.

542
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,037
Goddamn blind man!

543
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,229
But, Mme. Schmidt-Boulanger...

544
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,237
- Hugo's flying out tonight.
- Where to?

545
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,196
If I knew, I'd tell you.

546
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:21,115
Anyway, Mme. Comolli will give me
some expense money.

547
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,073
Screw Paul Hugo and Mme. Comolli.
- Oh shit!

548
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,076
Those fingerprints did it:

549
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,117
she was born Dec. 20, 1962...

550
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,197
Did some time in jail.

551
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,189
2 years ago.

552
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,158
The French police
have nothing on her since.

553
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,111
Catherine Leiris.

554
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,077
There's no warrant out?

555
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,076
You expected Bonnie Parker?

556
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,071
No no..

557
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,158
Won't you ask me,
any news of your blind man.

558
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,997
Because I've got some.

559
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,190
Alright. Wait,
I'll translate them for you.

560
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,079
Art and business will soon
be happily married.

561
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:12,074
"The marriage is announced
of Miss Charlotte Vincent...

562
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,117
"whose current exhibit is a big hit...

563
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,196
"and Mr. Ralph Forbes...

564
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,078
"the well-known Swiss architect. "

565
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,033
What's come over you?

566
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,029
Nothing.

567
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,071
Happy birthday, my love.

568
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,992
Happy birthday!

569
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,194
Congratulations!

570
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,118
The exhibit is marvelous.

571
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,031
Congratulate Mr. Forbes.

572
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,109
It was his idea.

573
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,151
Sorry, I'm out of cigarettes.

574
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,195
Happy birthday, Marie.

575
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,075
Go on...

576
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,031
Go on, she's all alone.

577
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,189
Go on.

578
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,235
Happy birthday, Catherine.

579
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,038
You must be mistaken.

580
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,993
Just pulling names out of my hat.

581
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,156
Like: Catherine Leiris...

582
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,115
Lucie Brentano...

583
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,075
Lucie Orthiz...

584
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,236
Did you bring this trash?

585
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,151
I'm out for myself.

586
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,031
Aren't you?

587
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,155
No comment?

588
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,236
"Murder, though it have no tongue...

589
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,118
"will speak with most
miraculous organ... "

590
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,155
You talking to me?

591
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,031
Just pulling words out of my hat.

592
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,190
I could also whip out my. 38...

593
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,038
and splatter the walls with ketchup.

594
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,230
Louis, there's a maniac here.

595
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,993
- What?
- There's a maniac!

596
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,194
Is .38 a big calibre?

597
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,229
That's what he's got.

598
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,149
I've got to talk to you.

599
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,071
Now ?
- Yes. Come.

600
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,115
Excuse me.

601
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,118
The last time someone told me
"Happy birthday," I was 11.

602
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,150
That year, I wanted
a majorette costume.

603
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,231
But it was much too expensive.

604
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,229
Daddy kept saying,

605
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,118
"Everything will be better,
once we have a little money. "

606
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,156
It's just that there was
never any money.

607
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,149
Nothing ever got better.

608
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,115
Wait.

609
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,078
Charlotte,
did you see something?

610
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,159
No, nothing. It's strange.
It's like what I wanted to tell you.

611
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,152
It's a man wearing a uniform
with big buttons...

612
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,071
and a shiny cap.

613
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,196
His wife probably left him
a long time ago.

614
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,149
Maybe she's dead.

615
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,038
The girls at school knew
the shiny cap.

616
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,109
The teachers, too.

617
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,230
Everybody made fun of them...

618
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,198
because her dad's job
was opening taxi doors.

619
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,151
Even he knew
he was incompetent.

620
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,115
He got fired.

621
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,157
He became a washroom attendant
in a grand hotel.

622
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,031
Mr Pee Pee

623
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,038
When he comes home at night,
he still reeks of ammonia.

624
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,156
The 22nd of December
is his daughter's birthday.

625
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,109
She's eleven.

626
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,071
An old neighbour gave her
some pears.

627
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,031
That's all they have for dinner.

628
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,035
It's very cold.

629
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,230
They went into a department store
in order to get warm.

630
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,119
There was music playing: "La Paloma".
It was beautiful.

631
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,158
The father said: Wait a second,
I'll go and fetch something for you.

632
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,038
He tried to steal a sweater
but he got caught.

633
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,191
I waited for him all night at home.

634
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,157
The next day, two fucking inspectors
came and told me he was dead.

635
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,231
9221319?

636
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,037
"Hello Mr. Forbes...

637
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,118
"I'm sorry, I can't let you
marry Charlotte. "

638
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,073
No..
"9221319? Hello, Forbes?

639
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,196
"Catherine Leiris stole a car.

640
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,231
"A Swiss can't marry a thief.

641
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,117
"She's also slightly lesbian... "

642
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,998
"9221319? Hello, Binky?

643
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,110
"She's killed lots of guys.

644
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,076
"She'll kill you, too.

645
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,031
"You don't stand a chance...

646
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,076
"so give her back to me. "

647
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,191
"9221319...

648
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,111
"Catherine, I love you. "

649
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,038
Can you help me across?

650
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,189
Talking to yourself?

651
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,158
- I was phoning you.
- Oh yes, what about?

652
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,031
About Marie...

653
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,109
I mean Charlotte.

654
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,235
You can't marry her.

655
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,111
I'm against the marriage.

656
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,111
I beg your pardon, but...

657
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,196
I'm her father, if you must know.

658
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,112
She surely spoke of me.
She always does.

659
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,236
The man in the shiny cap:
"Mr. Pee Pee. "

660
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,151
A ridiculous figure.

661
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,112
Ridiculous, that's it.

662
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,111
She spoke of you...

663
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,031
her time in jail...

664
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,149
the car she stole...

665
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,151
As if she wanted to put me off.

666
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,038
She could have said anything...

667
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,230
I don't scare easily.

668
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,191
The blind have priority, Mr. Forbes.

669
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,031
You don't stand in line for movies...

670
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,996
you get seats on buses...

671
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,234
But you can't run red lights...

672
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,151
or steal people's kids.

673
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,115
You won't get my daughter.

674
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,111
What have you ever done for her?

675
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,189
I lugged Meyerganz...

676
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,117
through the sewers of Monte Carlo...

677
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:40,033
and hid Jerry's bags in the ferns.

678
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,109
What did you do?

679
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,196
You just spouted a lot of crap...

680
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,151
Your intuitions... Hamlet...

681
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,078
The snake under the stones
and the cigars in bed...

682
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,038
I'm not denying you my daughter
because you're a cripple...

683
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,155
but because...

684
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,033
You're a phoney.

685
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,155
We can cross now.

686
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,038
What's going on?
What's going on?

687
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,189
Capricorn:

688
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,988
"Now is the winter of our discontent... "

689
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,036
All the planets are hostile.

690
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,036
Change surroundings.

691
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,118
Hello, miss.
Your passport, please.

692
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,076
Thank you.

693
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,235
Oh no,shit!

694
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,993
Don't fool with hitchhikers.

695
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,189
Thanks... You're real nice.

696
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,031
I'm going to Biarritz.

697
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,028
That's great. So am I.

698
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,111
You might ask me my name.

699
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,069
What's your name?

700
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,069
Betty.

701
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,071
You could say, "It's a nice name. "

702
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,110
And offer me a smoke.

703
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,155
Help yourself.

704
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:04,079
Last night a truck driver
tried to ball me.

705
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,150
That idiot is at the hospital.

706
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,111
For a long time.

707
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,156
You don't look that strong.

708
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,031
No, but I've got what it takes.

709
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,196
You're driving too fast.
Why so fast?

710
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,234
If it's to show off to that dog...

711
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,191
you'll have an accident,
like Forbes...

712
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,071
We can stop here if you want.

713
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,189
Now what?

714
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,989
Get out.

715
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,031
I've got what it takes, too.

716
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,075
Throw out the penknife.

717
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,038
For some reason,
I don't feel like killing you.

718
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,033
I loved a man, he's dead,
and I'm tired.

719
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,115
No more Biarritz?

720
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,071
If you promise to be good.

721
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,036
I promise. I swear.

722
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,038
Do you want me to tell you
about the brothel in Miramas ?

723
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,076
What fun I had there !

724
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,997
It was near Marseille.

725
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,116
I was something like,
eight or nine.

726
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,190
There was a room filled with toys.

727
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:26,200
Lots of things: there were dolls,
plush Mickey Mouse's,

728
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,030
and... what was there again ?

729
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,190
There was... what's the name ?

730
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,116
A circuit with miniature cars.

731
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,236
I used to love it !

732
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,994
I spent all my afternoons
in that room.

733
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,112
Before she locked me in, Mom forced
me to take my clothes off,

734
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,116
and then I could play.

735
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,075
And one day...

736
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,230
I noticed the holes in the wall.

737
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,116
There were guys
next door watching me.

738
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,116
I was part of the show...

739
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,038
There are holes in the
walls here, too.

740
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,110
Someone's watching us.

741
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,156
Hey, go easy on the brandy.

742
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,076
I swear someone's watching us.

743
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,151
Let me tell you something.

744
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,153
People who make holes in walls
only exist if you think they do.

745
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,111
Still there, old man?

746
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,991
I'm here, Marie.

747
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,111
Forbes died accidentally.

748
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,077
It said so in the papers.

749
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,032
Accidentally.

750
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,031
Hey! That's my car!

751
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,998
There's not room
for both of us in this deal.

752
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,151
Looks like my gun, too.

753
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,151
There are things in the trunk...

754
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,191
I care about them.

755
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,078
Always hang on to things
you care about.

756
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,192
There are also some cookies
on the back seat.

757
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,037
Give him his cookies.

758
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,191
Thanks.

759
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,189
Have a good trip!

760
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,196
I'm always losing you, Marie.
It won't do.

761
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,118
I hope you don't get
into any trouble.

762
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,230
Wait for me, my sweet,
I'm coming.

763
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,109
Xerox !

764
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,075
Seal it !

765
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,116
Here. There was another
of those yellow letters.

766
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,031
Won't you open it?

767
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,189
What for ?
I know what's inside.

768
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,231
Cut-off point: today, 10 AM.

769
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,076
I've been looking for you all over.

770
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,035
I haven't!

771
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,031
I thought I'd see you sooner.

772
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,117
What kept you?

773
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,115
Where's lover-boy?

774
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,115
Pension Hortensias.

775
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,118
I've had enough of that place.
I'm going home to Paris.

776
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,031
14 rue de Ia Butte aux Cailles.

777
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,196
Will you buy me a drink?

778
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,192
- Take the lady's order.
- A Fernet...

779
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,111
No...

780
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,195
a Pernod...

781
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,038
No! A shandy.

782
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,191
Why not mix all three?

783
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,117
Get her a black coffee.

784
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,189
Am I bothering you?

785
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,037
You were sketching?

786
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,151
Looked like schoolgirls...

787
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,118
What a stupid thing to say.
Schoolgirls?

788
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,118
Are you zonked, or what?

789
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,072
So lover-boy threw you out?

790
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,195
Tell me all about it.

791
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,111
There's nothing to say.

792
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,149
Nothing, really.

793
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,237
I banged on the door all night.

794
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,994
I even used my head... See?

795
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,195
He wouldn't open.

796
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:40,152
He told me to get lost.
And worse.

797
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,116
He said:
"You're old, you stink... "

798
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,031
He even called me ugly.

799
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:45,995
It's true...

800
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,112
you're extremely ugly.

801
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,156
Let's talk about the girls.

802
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,116
How are they?
Where are they staying?

803
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,111
You mean Princess Eugenie.

804
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,195
In a suite.

805
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:05,074
And she throws away hundreds
and thousands at the casino.

806
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,117
If it goes on like this,
your model won't get a cent.

807
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,993
Maybe it will bring back his civility.

808
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,113
Oh, no ! You're not going to joke
about my appearance again ?

809
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,118
Maybe it would be less atrocious
with bangs.

810
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,079
Give it a try. Down to there...

811
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:44,233
There it is.

812
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,077
Lost something, Super sleuth?

813
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,036
You bet.

814
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,998
You took my car,
my gun and some photos.

815
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,070
The car's been recovered.
I want the rest.

816
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,235
You can forget the gun.

817
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,038
50,000 will buy back the photos.

818
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,229
You're a bastard.

819
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,196
What can you do
with my mementos?

820
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,115
Invest them.

821
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,996
The Hugo case...

822
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,031
The Meyerganz case...

823
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,076
The Pallenberg case, today...

824
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,196
Right now she's at the bank.

825
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,116
Once she shows up here
with the money...

826
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,196
the blackmailer will disappear.

827
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,189
The little girls...

828
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,229
The photos of those schoolgirls?

829
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,992
Censored.

830
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,075
Destroyed!

831
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,151
Shame on you, dirty old man.

832
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,078
- My shoes?
- They're tacky as hell.

833
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,111
Taruchi wore them, too.

834
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,075
Who's Taruchi?

835
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,996
An extremely tacky guy.

836
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,115
A jerk like you...

837
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,149
who thought he was smart.

838
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,115
Good day, sir.

839
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,151
Hold it, smart-ass.

840
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,109
Your turn to answer.

841
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,116
Who gave you my address?

842
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,035
Which one?

843
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,189
Pension Hortensias?

844
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,151
Or the one Rue de Ia Butte aux Cailles ?

845
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:11,028
Hey, that's below the belt.
- Yes..

846
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,029
Let me guess...

847
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,236
- Not Madame Ugly?
- Right...

848
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,031
A sugarless coffee,

849
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,156
a few quickly dried tears,
then the swoon.

850
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,991
Love at first sight.

851
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,038
He said "love at first sight"
Like that ?

852
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,075
Like that ?

853
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,234
It's not a question of money anymore,

854
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,191
it's a love story, my poor Germaine.

855
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,997
You wouldn't even recognize him.

856
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,078
He wears incredible shoes,

857
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,115
light ties...

858
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,229
silk shirts.

859
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,997
What's she like?

860
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,031
He spoke vaguely of her.

861
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,075
White yacht...

862
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,031
Parasols... delicacies...

863
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,036
What about me ?
Did he tell you about me ?

864
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,234
Four lettered words!

865
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,071
The bastard.

866
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,156
After all the things I did for him !

867
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,192
I even walked the street for him,
yes sir, in Barcelona.

868
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,156
On the Ramblas, in 1958.

869
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,069
I don't look the part, do I ?

870
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,031
Do I look like a detective?

871
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,156
In the Barrio Chino,
they called me "Castagnet"...

872
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,988
That's why I felt funny when you
advised me to wear bangs.

873
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,192
Well, of course I didn't know,
when I said "bangs"...

874
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,235
She's not that hot, after all.

875
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,994
Don't you think I would
be prettier as a brunette ?

876
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,072
- Do you know what I'm going to do ?
- Don't be reckless, kid !

877
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:51,112
Since the bastard is
indulging in a passion,

878
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,998
I'm going to offer him
a crime of passion.

879
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,036
- Come, come, be reasonable !
- Like hell.

880
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,031
Don't be reckless, I said.

881
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,996
Take a shower, while you're at it.

882
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,991
I'm coming.

883
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,195
This bags heavy!

884
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,229
No mistakes, I hope?

885
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,118
No, all in 50's and 100's.

886
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,149
Why are you here?

887
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,078
To please you, my liege.

888
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,115
“My liege. "

889
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,071
The detective was right.

890
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,194
You got your pimp shoes on.

891
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,069
Where you headed?

892
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,190
What did he tell you?

893
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,989
Looking for the sun?

894
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,032
With that cow, under her parasol?

895
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,038
Listen, Germaine...
Don't do anything silly.

896
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,190
Germaine can't listen.
She's deaf.

897
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,998
Dead!

898
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,195
Goodbye, Castagnet.

899
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,116
So, tell me: how was it?

900
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,032
Crazy. Totally sexual.

901
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,031
Good for you.

902
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,234
But what with all that,
we're going without a penny.

903
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,076
I don't get it: you're saying you've
got bank accounts everywhere.

904
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,196
You're talking about Dreyfuss,
the Pommier Bank, the Credit Lyonnais.

905
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,993
Where I've got an account,
they've got my picture.

906
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,110
Hey, let's go where you
don't have an account.

907
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:14,038
Marie ! I'm getting angry,
Come back home !

908
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,116
Come back home now !

909
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,076
They threw a paving stone !

910
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,235
Two girls, with masks on.

911
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,073
Masks ? What kind of masks ?
- Pinocchio !

912
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,189
Don't you ever do things
like that again, Marie.

913
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,196
You'll end up breaking my heart.

914
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,998
From that day on,
the day Catherine lost Betty...

915
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,190
the detective realized dark forces...

916
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,111
would always pursue the girl.

917
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,111
Slowly, inexorably...

918
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,031
like a glacier on the move.

919
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:42,032
She could only
elude them by moving on...

920
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,115
anywhere...

921
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,155
ceaselessly.

922
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,031
A deadly whirl...

923
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,116
but that's how it had to be.

924
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,149
Up north...

925
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,230
they crashed a police roadblock.

926
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,118
For the detective,
it was a new

927
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,196
and exhilarating experience.

928
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,111
We're now putting
Herve Claude on the air

929
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:18,116
so he can give us all
the latest information

930
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,191
about the accomplice
of Betty Shapira,

931
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,236
who was killed yesterday
during the deadly hold-up

932
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,151
of the Credit
Commercial bank in Melun.

933
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,115
Over to you, Claude

934
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,988
We just learned from a reliable
source that the said accomplice

935
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,191
is supposed to be already wanted
for several other murders,

936
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:38,034
including Paul Hugo's,
whose body was just discovered

937
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,150
by the police in a pond,
in the Bruxelles area.

938
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,197
According to commissioner Cervin,

939
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:48,030
there could be a connexion
between this case

940
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,110
and the strange disappearance
of Michel Meyerganz,

941
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,156
in Monte-Carlo last year.

942
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,193
The double murder in the
Black Forest is also remembered

943
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:00,193
Cora Pallenberg and Jerry Beaufil
were killed the same night,

944
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,158
September the 26th of last year.

945
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,237
The police incline to think
that the perpetrator

946
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:10,233
of all those murders is
the same person

947
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:14,074
Catherine Leiris,
born on December the 22nd, 1962,

948
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,116
convicted of robbery in 1979

949
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:20,193
and incarcerated in the
Fleury-Merogis prison from 1979 to...

950
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,112
So they drove for a long time,
going north by northeast,

951
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,116
to a city that Catherine
might have known,

952
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:58,033
but the existence of which had never
even been dreamed by the detective.

953
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,116
But it really was called Charleville.

954
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,999
The next month, Catherine
checked in the Hotel du Canal,

955
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:27,033
where she lived cloistered,
but for a short walk in the evenings.

956
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,032
How to find again the unfathomable
grace of Lucie Brentano,

957
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,036
the radiance of Dorothee Ortiz,

958
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,156
the beauty of Ariane Chevalier

959
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,112
In this sad and idle passer-by ?

960
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,149
Enough to make one believe
that this girl

961
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,111
seemed interested in nothing...

962
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,109
including herself.

963
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,111
It's incredible.

964
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:22,034
One day, the detective thought that
spiders were crawling up the walls,

965
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,230
that the junkies jumped
in the gutters again.

966
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,037
False alarm.

967
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,076
It was the 22nd of December.

968
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,031
Since nobody else thought about it,

969
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,071
Catherine was celebrating
her own birthday.

970
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,118
Her dress was too loose fitting,
its flounces ludicrous,

971
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,156
its pattern extravagant.

972
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,038
My God !
Already one year since Rome !

973
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:45,198
Mused the detective, who thought
the whole thing was delicious.

974
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:50,198
Just think, two days ago
I was still in Vegas.

975
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,031
At the "Flamingo. "

976
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,111
It's better than here, you know.

977
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,109
I know.

978
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,116
No kidding, sweetheart.
You know Vegas?

979
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,031
My father had an office there.

980
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,031
A whole floor to himself,
on the Strip.

981
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,155
Buy me a Pimm's?

982
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,156
It's my birthday today.

983
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,195
Julien!

984
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,151
A Pimm's for the lady.

985
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,111
2.50 francs, plus the olives,
makes 3 francs.

986
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,235
I didn't order olives.

987
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,191
She should go before she
makes a fool of herself,

988
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,229
don't you think?

989
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,991
Run away, quick.

990
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,150
Who?

991
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,189
The young girl at the bar.

992
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,073
Anyway, there are
only young girls here.

993
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,076
He died the evening
of my birthday.

994
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,038
Over 1,000 people
came to the funeral.

995
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,229
Whose funeral?

996
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,071
My father's.

997
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,196
I'm sure nobody went
to Betty's funeral.

998
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,076
It was probably very sad.

999
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,991
What did those assholes
do with the mask?

1000
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,195
Who put this here?

1001
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,196
That odd man at the back.

1002
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,117
He left right after.

1003
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,031
He left you a note.

1004
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,116
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARIE

1005
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,234
At this critical point
in their relationship...

1006
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,198
the ogre decided to
talk to the little girl.

1007
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,033
He asked,
"What are you going to do now?"

1008
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,117
I'm going home.

1009
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,156
But what does that mean,
"home?"

1010
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,195
Her home.

1011
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:59,074
Catherine Nieris,
born on Dec. 22, 1962...

1012
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,035
in Bobigny...

1013
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,069
Seine St. Denis.

1014
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,236
How can she go back
to the cockroaches...

1015
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,151
the rotting walls...

1016
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,191
back to the slums?

1017
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,196
Server wanted -
Interesting salary - Tips

1018
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,029
No. Never seen her.

1019
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,116
I'll leave the photos,
you get back to me.

1020
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,229
Hello, reception.

1021
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,069
Let's go.

1022
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,036
That money's not mine.

1023
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,110
I'm not doing it for
myself, either.

1024
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,190
I'll scream, I'll shout for help!

1025
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:03,028
I've shouted for help for 20 years.
No one ever answered.

1026
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:36,233
Come in.

1027
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,077
Ignore the mess.

1028
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,111
I can't offer you much.

1029
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,115
A Coke? Beer?

1030
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,151
Brandy?

1031
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,031
Make yourself at home.

1032
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,991
Perhaps you'd like a shower?

1033
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,189
A shower?

1034
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,231
That's a dumb thing to suggest!

1035
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,109
We'll see...

1036
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:16,073
She goes into the bathroom...
I go to the window.

1037
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,115
I live alone.

1038
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,991
My wife left me.

1039
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,037
Left with my daughter.

1040
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,031
I never saw them again.

1041
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,038
At first, it was very painful...
Now it's better.

1042
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,116
Don't fool with that.
It's loaded.

1043
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,228
Don't... It's loaded...

1044
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,189
What time you through?

1045
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,237
No!
What are your hours, miss?

1046
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,151
When do you get off?

1047
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,993
When does your shift end?

1048
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,031
Pardon?

1049
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,997
What would you like ?

1050
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,993
Turkey in supreme
sauce, please.

1051
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,991
We don't have any left.
- Oh ?

1052
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,075
When do you get off?

1053
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,997
2:00 a m.

1054
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,996
Mind meeting me for a drink?

1055
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,109
No..

1056
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:57,155
That looks better.

1057
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:00,072
You're right.
More appetizing than ours.

1058
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,076
Very well presented.

1059
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,992
I forgot...

1060
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,109
Don't wait in front.

1061
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:09,190
The staff leaves by the stage door.

1062
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,069
At the rear.

1063
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:12,235
How will I know it?

1064
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:15,198
The trash cans are yellow,
I'll be in blue.

1065
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,072
Say !
<i>'</i> Beg VOW pardon ?

1066
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:05,112
You're drinking my beer, sir.
- Excuse me, I...

1067
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,151
It's no big deal.
You may finish it.

1068
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:11,193
What time is it?

1069
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:14,073
1:55.

1070
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,998
My girlfriend smoked those.

1071
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,195
Does the smell of
tobacco bother you ?

1072
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:19,156
No. My own smell is bothering me.

1073
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,196
The smell of French fries:
it permeates everything.

1074
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,149
Where do you want us to go ?

1075
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:30,149
Maybe you've got an idea ?
To a club ? Your place ? Mine ?

1076
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:33,118
- I live in a hotel.
- So do I.

1077
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,071
Let's make it your place.

1078
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,997
My name's Catherine...

1079
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,235
Catherine Leiris.

1080
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,994
When you asked what time I got off,
I thought I knew you.

1081
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,071
I've never been in the "Miami. "

1082
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,076
I didn't mean there.

1083
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,197
People think they know me:
I'm so ordinary looking.

1084
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:00,189
I look like everybody.

1085
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,037
When I grow a beard...

1086
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,116
I'm like any bearded guy.

1087
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,037
Ignore the mess.

1088
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,229
Sit down.

1089
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,156
What would you like?

1090
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,076
I have a nice little white wine.

1091
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,069
A Coke?

1092
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,150
A drop of brandy? No, a Coke...

1093
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:56,069
Brandy.

1094
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,997
Won't you take off your jacket?

1095
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,109
I'll take it off.

1096
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,071
I didn't mean...

1097
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,992
Then let's change the subject.

1098
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:23,109
Just talk.

1099
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,229
About you?

1100
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,155
OK...

1101
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:32,189
Let's go.

1102
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:38,076
I wasn't always a waitress.

1103
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,195
I've been waited on.

1104
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,156
My father was
an international thief.

1105
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:47,156
Police everywhere
chased him for years.

1106
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,229
On my birthday...

1107
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,998
he collapsed,
his pockets full of diamonds.

1108
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:56,031
He said: "Happy birthday,"
and died.

1109
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,069
You loved him?

1110
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:01,990
Yes.

1111
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,195
That's all crap.

1112
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:11,198
My father was a famous doctor...
a blind pianist...

1113
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,029
A brilliant architect...

1114
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,189
My father was,
what else was he?

1115
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,031
But I really loved him.

1116
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,235
I'm terribly sorry...

1117
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:28,992
maybe you wanted cookies?

1118
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,189
No thanks, I'm fine.

1119
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,151
If you feel like resting...

1120
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,997
go right ahead.

1121
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,996
Unless you'd like a shower?

1122
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,997
The French fries?

1123
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,156
Not at all... I...

1124
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,069
It's a good idea.

1125
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:02,079
I'm in a luxury hotel...
but there's no shower.

1126
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,149
There's a clean washcloth.

1127
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,071
And a mitten for rub-downs.

1128
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,196
Careful... The hot and cold knobs
have been reversed.

1129
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,038
Red is cold, blue's hot.

1130
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:16,996
Never fails!

1131
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:39,117
You married?

1132
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,997
Yes...

1133
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,237
I mean, no... I was.

1134
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,035
My wife left me...

1135
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,155
a long time ago.

1136
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,235
She left with my daughter...

1137
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,035
Marie...

1138
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,071
Back in 1958.

1139
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:14,076
Marie died in 1962.

1140
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,997
It must have been painful.

1141
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:18,990
Yes.

1142
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:25,071
You got over it?

1143
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:26,195
No.

1144
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,111
I lost the only photo I had of her.

1145
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,036
It was taken in 1962...

1146
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:42,197
Just before the vacation,
a school picture...

1147
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:46,112
She had her arms crossed,
like a sad clown?

1148
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:47,109
Not at all.

1149
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,156
Marie was very cheerful.

1150
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,117
Look what I found...

1151
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,196
Don't fool with it.
It's loaded.

1152
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,069
Calm down.

1153
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,189
Calm down, troubled soul...

1154
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,031
Stop, Marie, please...

1155
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,069
I know where I saw you...

1156
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,235
You're the photographer.

1157
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:08,996
Yes...

1158
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,115
In the park, in Brussels.

1159
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:14,229
By the carousel...

1160
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,196
The Hugo case...

1161
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:59,033
I didn't hear any news.
I phoned.

1162
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:05,078
Mme. Schmidt-Boulanger told me
you didn't work for her anymore.

1163
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,075
L'oeil...

1164
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:13,992
Yes, Madeleine?

1165
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:17,155
What happened?

1166
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,076
I lost the photo of Marie.

1167
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,117
I'm telling you this for us.

1168
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,235
If you've lost the photo...

1169
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:33,151
maybe we should stop
phoning each other?

1170
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,037
Maybe you're right.

1171
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,235
What'll you do now?

1172
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:39,992
Nothing.

1173
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,234
Wait.

1174
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:51,071
He waited less than 3 years.

1175
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:55,153
He knew it was his last night on earth
when he finally saw the door.

1176
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,031
Marie!

1177
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,069
Catherine!

1178
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:09,038
Careful... It's him.

1179
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,189
He opened the door

1180
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,191
and went into the photo.

1181
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:14,071
Here he comes.

1182
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:17,078
Subtitles from the cut version
completely re-timed and expanded.

1183
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:22,108
Extra scenes translated by
Goupil66, re-timed by McDuck.
