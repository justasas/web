1
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:23,726
DEADLY RUN

2
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:28,165
Brussels, late summer...

3
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:35,495
No, Madeleine... This time I'm warm.

4
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,067
I think I know which one she is...
I'm sure of it.

5
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,789
You listening?

6
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,290
Hurry, my bath's running.

7
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:44,896
She's the one with the sad look.

8
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:46,330
Upper left.

9
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,258
Marie had that look.

10
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:50,960
She was a cheerful child,
but often seemed sad.

11
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:54,423
-The opposite of me.
-In all respects.

12
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,967
-Did I guess right?
-Wrong.

13
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:59,260
Wait...

14
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,529
She's the third from the right...

15
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,896
with the barrette.

16
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,031
She has your nose.

17
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,056
Your nose exactly...

18
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:08,859
Answer me!

19
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,557
-I can't.
-Why not?

20
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:13,099
You know you only get one guess.

21
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,293
No second chance?

22
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,157
Sure. Next year.

23
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:19,456
OK, Madeleine.

24
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,289
While I've got you...

25
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:24,396
"Abundance of bread"...

26
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:26,430
...in 8 letters.

27
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:27,693
Opulence?

28
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,132
It fits. You're a genius!

29
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:31,823
When you put your mind to it.

30
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:36,024
How is she?

31
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:38,460
That's going too far!

32
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:44,124
Bitch!

33
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,626
And I almost jumped out a window for her!

34
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,030
It was November...

35
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:52,324
bitter cold...

36
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,096
Madeleine stopped me.

37
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:57,427
Whereas that idiot Taruchi...

38
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:01,324
I saw his hammer just in time...
He saw nothing.

39
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,362
Really dumb.

40
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:08,791
I fired through my pocket.

41
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,934
So now I've missed
two perfect chances to die...

42
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,361
Some day...

43
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:18,633
I'll die of sorrow in bed...

44
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,863
Iike all fathers.

45
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:23,794
Opulence...

46
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:33,400
Marie was born in 1953, the year Stalin died.

47
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,631
I'd married Madeleine in 1952...

48
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,466
The year of the "H" bomb.

49
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,124
The "H" atoll. 6 letters: Bikini.

50
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,763
They left me in 1954...

51
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:47,693
the year of the cold war.

52
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:51,356
I got the photo in 1961.

53
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,229
Nothing happened that year.

54
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,965
Except the photo...

55
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:59,296
At first, I picked the girl with the barrette...

56
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,164
"You're wrong," Madeleine said.

57
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:08,164
Then I decided
she was the little imp smiling at the camera.

58
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,960
"Wrong again," said Madeleine.

59
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:16,030
Now I love them all...
They're all my little Marie.

60
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:19,256
I dread disappointing them.

61
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:22,228
Because I will...

62
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:25,264
the day I open the door,
and enter the photo...

63
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,357
and Marie comes to me...

64
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:29,532
Be patient, Marie.

65
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:31,726
Wait for me...

66
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:38,694
Where were you?

67
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:40,825
Doing crosswords?

68
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,727
No, sewing, Mrs. Schmidt-Boulanger...
A loose button.

69
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:46,721
"The Eye!"

70
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:48,896
My best agent.

71
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:54,231
The underworld nicknamed him "The Eye."

72
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:56,760
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo.

73
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,998
The name mean anything to you?

74
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,396
I should hope so.

75
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:04,025
The celebrated bootmakers.

76
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,226
Established in Brussels since...?

77
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:07,357
Since forever!

78
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,694
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo have a son...

79
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:12,096
-Paul.
-Let's be brief.

80
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,161
It seems Paul has a girlfriend.

81
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:15,789
A French girl.

82
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:21,369
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo would like
some information about her.

83
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,632
You follow me?

84
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:29,956
What?

85
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:32,966
She phoned the house several times...

86
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,863
Or we wouldn't have known
the young lady existed.

87
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,094
How do you know she's young?

88
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:41,962
Hugo Jr. is 23.

89
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:45,767
We'll have no trouble
finding out who she is.

90
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,298
The Hugos want a quick report.

91
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,266
-Can you do that?
-Sure.

92
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:54,123
Can we meet tomorrow, same time?

93
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,993
-I'll see you out.
-No need.

94
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,863
-I insist...
-We're really grateful.

95
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:02,557
The cashier is down the hall to the left.

96
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,865
See you tomorrow.

97
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,967
To the left! The cashier's office...

98
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,958
I hope you got the picture.

99
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:14,462
Absolutely, madam.

100
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:18,791
College boy meets hooker,
parents panic, fat fees for you!

101
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:20,025
Simple, no?

102
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:21,996
Keep it that way.

103
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:23,828
Where will you begin?

104
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:25,957
By sewing on my button.

105
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,225
That's a woman's job.

106
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,754
I dare you!

107
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:38,928
The Taruchi case was simple
until you complicated it.

108
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,798
Taruchi was a small-time blackmailer...

109
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,628
a petty crook.

110
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:46,559
A crook with a hammer
in his hand isn't petty!

111
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:50,158
That hammer was found
in Taruchi's pocket...

112
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,434
so don't try to snow me.

113
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,860
You wanted it in my skull?

114
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,062
You disappoint me!

115
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:00,495
I expected a little gratitude.

116
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,500
I got you off the blacklist.

117
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,966
Now I'm giving you a new case...

118
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:06,897
restoring your dignity!

119
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:08,523
I'm generous!

120
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:09,754
Very.

121
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,689
I warn you...

122
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,196
One more foul-up...

123
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:17,428
and you'll sweep floors till you retire.

124
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:22,660
When I'm 65, Marie will be 39.

125
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:26,790
Too late for celebrations.

126
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:34,923
Have I really put on weight?

127
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:38,660
Around the ass...and even so...not much.

128
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:42,957
But you'll always have pretty hands.

129
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,793
You'll always have a pretty face...

130
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,996
a pretty fur coat...

131
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:49,994
and a pretty blue car.

132
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:51,965
What's my car got to do with it?

133
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:54,789
Just talking.

134
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:15,156
Hugo & Co., founded 1802...

135
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:19,490
Young Paul will blow it all,
down to the shoehorns...

136
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,298
to take some tart to an exotic beach!

137
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:25,998
His casual air speaks well for him.

138
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,630
Quite handsome...appealing...

139
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:37,459
If he pulls a hammer, I'll kill him!

140
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,890
70...80...

141
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:42,694
90...

142
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,092
100...

143
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:46,091
A tidy sum.

144
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:32,263
We'll walk in parks as we used to, Marie.

145
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:35,726
Botanical gardens...

146
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:38,596
I'll teach you the Latin names of roses.

147
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,163
Shit!

148
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:44,326
Who has the right
to separate a man and his daughter?

149
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,160
You like talking to yourself?

150
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:51,858
Not really.

151
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,731
I'm waiting for my dad.

152
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,095
Looking for your son?

153
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:57,427
My little girl.

154
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:19,233
My dad's an engineer.

155
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:23,595
When I'm big, I want to own a dodgem.

156
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,796
What'll you do when you're big?

157
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,924
I'll be a detective.

158
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:39,663
Want to take a picture?

159
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:41,687
OK.

160
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:48,957
At last! Who gave you that?

161
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,590
-That man.
-Give it right back to him!

162
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:54,356
Well, bye-bye!

163
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:00,620
Lucie!

164
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:02,454
Sorry!

165
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,264
Lucie Brentano...

166
00:11:57,898 --> 00:12:00,093
born Sept. 22, 1962.

167
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:02,923
Student...

168
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,992
no distinguishing traits.

169
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:08,532
Address: 33 rue Champollion, Paris...

170
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:11,996
September 22...

171
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,593
Virgo...

172
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:18,756
The sign of gentleness.

173
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,694
"Dear Schmidt-Boulanger...

174
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,399
"The lady is named Lucie Brentano.

175
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,990
"She likes peace and quiet.

176
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:18,727
"Smokes 'Senior Service'...

177
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,561
"and screws singing 'La Paloma."'

178
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,323
Capricorn...

179
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,189
symbol of winter...

180
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,255
Lucie Brentano, student...

181
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:42,623
blue eyes...

182
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:44,190
Straight nose...

183
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,764
Distinguishing trait:

184
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:48,955
Killed a man last night.

185
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,925
-Have a good trip?
-Excellent.

186
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:09,289
-Put it in the safe.
-Certainly.

187
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:18,359
Hello, Voragine.

188
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:21,262
So you're out of the closet.

189
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:23,057
To kill whom this time?

190
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,265
Know the brunette at the front desk?

191
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:30,087
Eve Granger...

192
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:32,262
model. You see her occasionally:

193
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:33,855
Not much baggage, no men.

194
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,531
How's Schmidt-Boulanger?

195
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,463
-Spreading out?
-It's prosperity.

196
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,323
Can you get me
on a flight to Nice this evening?

197
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,660
The 6:45 would suit me.

198
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:45,757
Flight 417 to Nice. Of course, miss.

199
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:52,494
"Paul Hugo's fish bait,
Mrs. Schmidt-Boulanger..."

200
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:57,264
If I tell her that, she'll call the cops.

201
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,798
So I'll say...

202
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:02,197
Paul and Lucie went to Reno to marry.

203
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:03,595
That's no good either.

204
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:05,098
Paul left alone...

205
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:07,826
By plane...

206
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:09,487
Montreal...

207
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:11,798
Air Canada...

208
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,129
His tramp ditched him.

209
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:19,722
Not if he just took
all his cash out of the bank.

210
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:21,925
Very well. So get moving.

211
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:25,195
Get me a ticket to Montreal
with an open return. It's for "The Eye."

212
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:26,561
-What?
-Money, money.

213
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:28,222
Get $400 ready.

214
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:29,298
$800...

215
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:31,959
$450! And get a receipt!

216
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,695
Hooker or no, why'd he dump her?

217
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,630
-Jealous.
-A rival?

218
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:38,488
Let's just say, another man.

219
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:39,959
A father.

220
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:43,589
As I understand it,
the girl's mother was a nothing.

221
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:48,134
She was raised by her father,
a superior type of man.

222
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:51,760
She's always bragging about him.

223
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,233
Paul must have felt unable to compete.

224
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:58,332
So he fled.

225
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:00,833
How'd you learn all this?

226
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:02,564
Use a mike?

227
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:07,199
I haven't always been called "The Eye."

228
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:10,262
They used to call me "The Ear."

229
00:18:57,164 --> 00:18:58,461
She has lilac eyes...

230
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,762
she killed a man, she looks like a kid...

231
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:03,923
and she eats pears.

232
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:05,460
Beg pardon?

233
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:08,126
"To blind," in 6 letters.

234
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:10,929
-Dazzle?
-Too easy.

235
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:14,731
Departure of Flight 417 for Nice.
Boarding now...

236
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:22,559
Darling, I thought you'd left without me!
I was scared!

237
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:24,895
Scared? More sorry than scared.

238
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,659
I thought you'd forgotten me.

239
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,360
80 people expect you
in Monte Carlo, Dorothy.

240
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:32,960
Dorothy! It's crazy! Dorothy who?

241
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,454
Beg pardon?

242
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:39,327
"To blind," in 6 letters. It's not "dazzle."

243
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:41,657
"Betray."

244
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,259
You're all golden. Sunbathing?

245
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:46,524
I've been sailing.

246
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:19,625
I wonder what Felix
will give his future daughter-in-law.

247
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:23,596
-I'm the aunt from Vittel.
-I'm the Paris cousin.

248
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:26,956
Dorothy, in the name of the family...

249
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:29,491
and of all the Meyerganzes...

250
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:31,828
allow me to present you with this.

251
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:35,556
They're only emeralds.

252
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,698
Sanseveria... Asplenium Nidus...

253
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,594
Asparagus plumosis...

254
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:19,498
-...and one mink coat!
-Mink!

255
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:21,228
Emeralds!

256
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:23,628
You're nice to be with, Michel.

257
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:26,592
Now that you're warm, are you hungry?

258
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,459
I want to screw.

259
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:30,964
Can't think of everything.

260
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:05,291
We're clearing away.
Would you like something?

261
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,654
No, thank you.

262
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:08,928
No problem, right?

263
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:11,298
We all have problems.

264
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,358
More or less.

265
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:02,033
Dorothy! Michel! Where are you?

266
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,326
-ls Miss Granger back?
-Miss Granger?

267
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,931
I mean, Miss Orthiz.

268
00:23:57,264 --> 00:24:00,165
Yes, she is back.
Would you care to call her?

269
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,825
No, she may be sleeping.

270
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:04,192
Thanks.

271
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:18,520
Come in!

272
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:58,455
She could have put on a robe,
don't you think?

273
00:25:25,497 --> 00:25:28,227
We are flying at an altitude of 25,000 feet.

274
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:33,301
The Black Forest can be seen on the right.

275
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,621
She's killed 2 men...

276
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:52,824
eats pears, reads Shakespeare:

277
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,765
Active, voracious, cultivated.

278
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:18,488
Don't get excited, boss.

279
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:22,056
It's long-distance
and you're paying for it, so listen.

280
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,826
-Where are you? Montreal?
-Marrakesh.

281
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:25,864
What!

282
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:28,122
I don't set the itinerary.

283
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:31,096
Paul Hugo is the kind of guy
who flirts incessantly.

284
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,723
First Montreal, now Morocco.

285
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:39,132
-And tomorrow?
-Home!

286
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,497
Bring that clown back
before his parents call in the cops.

287
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,395
My darling...

288
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:41,957
I've marked in a cross
to show you where your daddy lives.

289
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:46,923
He thinks of you always.

290
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:54,622
P.S.: Beware!

291
00:27:55,497 --> 00:27:57,761
The forces of Evil stalk you like spiders.

292
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:15,755
Stop following me!

293
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,727
I'm not!

294
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,321
We always seem to go the same way.

295
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,419
Hey, Ariane!

296
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:28,929
We have a date tonight. Don't forget.

297
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,190
Bet $200
you'll sleep with one of those idiots.

298
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,059
Not likely.

299
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:40,598
When you get horny, come sleep with me.

300
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:43,124
My name is Cora. I'm in 317.

301
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,161
My father is an anthropologist.

302
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:28,789
He even went up the Nile...

303
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,795
God knows how far.

304
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:34,322
Another time he went to the North Cape.

305
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:38,731
He sent me a postcard
from the Lofoten lslands.

306
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,597
I wonder where he is now.

307
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:48,927
What are you talking about?

308
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:52,530
-About my father.
-Who cares about him?

309
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:33,330
-You mustn't be home much.
-Unfortunately.

310
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:37,027
My wife always wanted me
to take a sedentary job...

311
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:39,225
Teacher, or some such.

312
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:41,890
But when the Nile obsesses you...

313
00:30:42,364 --> 00:30:44,594
We had some painful scenes.

314
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:47,857
Just before a voyage to the North Cape...

315
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,161
Madeleine threatened suicide...

316
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:51,992
if I left.

317
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:54,123
-"Go ahead, do it," I said.
-My God!

318
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:55,457
Blackmail.

319
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:58,154
Excuse me now...

320
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,021
it's time to take the waters. See you tonight.

321
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,895
What a farce!

322
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:19,690
You were amoral. Now you're boring, Jerry.

323
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:23,894
-I'm not answerable to anyone.
-Of course not.

324
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:26,192
I'm simply warning you:

325
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,753
Cora's a bitch.

326
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:30,197
Lays girls, but hates 'em.

327
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,988
When she's through with you...

328
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,656
she'll dump you.

329
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,225
You talk about her as if she were a guy.

330
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:43,256
-Talking of me?
-Yes.

331
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,662
-Was it amusing?
-Rather.

332
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:47,460
What'd he say?

333
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,998
That I'm a nympho?
Paranoid? Manic-something?

334
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:51,053
A bitch!

335
00:31:52,464 --> 00:31:56,298
Funny: Roman whores took milk baths.
Today's use Clorox.

336
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,258
No wonder the streams are polluted.

337
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:03,722
Don't touch that! Makes me nervous.

338
00:32:03,998 --> 00:32:05,932
Stop biting your nails. It's tacky.

339
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,565
Here's your ticket to Brussels,
Miss Chevallier.

340
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:16,660
A single with dining car.

341
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:19,588
-Your taxi will be here at 8:00 p.m.
-Thank you.

342
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,025
Please get my bill ready.

343
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,661
My necklace has been swiped.

344
00:32:36,097 --> 00:32:37,587
Swiped?

345
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,589
You probably lost them at the Roman Baths.

346
00:32:40,964 --> 00:32:42,022
Or in the shower.

347
00:32:42,731 --> 00:32:44,528
You're always flashing them.

348
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:46,562
You see I'm upset.

349
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,427
Don't get upset. Let's go.

350
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,194
Hello, madam, did you have a nice trip?

351
00:33:54,263 --> 00:33:56,493
-Excellent.
-Keeping your room for the week?

352
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:57,553
Probably.

353
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,326
Could you give me the envelope
I put in the safe?

354
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:01,421
I'll come with you.

355
00:34:19,297 --> 00:34:20,821
Still on her tail?

356
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:22,194
She just arrived.

357
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,924
I heard you were in Montreal.

358
00:34:27,163 --> 00:34:28,152
In Marrakesh.

359
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:29,930
I was in Marrakesh.

360
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:32,224
-ls it nice there?
-Ask Flatfoot.

361
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:33,558
You've had many calls.

362
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,291
One person came by twice.

363
00:34:39,364 --> 00:34:41,525
I've thought about it. I don't want my room.

364
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:42,859
Very well, madam.

365
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,954
She's really got you running.

366
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,497
No time to put your bag down.

367
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:53,327
I'll put it down one day, Voragine.

368
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:55,661
That day, I'll push the classroom door...

369
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:56,720
Let me go!

370
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,560
Let me go, or I'll break your arm!

371
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:23,096
Keep the change.

372
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,256
Change? You must be mistaken.

373
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,957
You've given me 100.

374
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:33,959
Scumbag. It's 1,000.

375
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:37,395
Pardon me. It must be my mistake.

376
00:35:37,464 --> 00:35:39,295
That's all right. Keep it anyway.

377
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,297
This happens all the time,
but it doesn't really matter.

378
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,892
It's deplorable.

379
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:53,562
It's quite deplorable,
but it doesn't really matter.

380
00:35:54,764 --> 00:35:55,856
What's the book?

381
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,259
I heard you turning pages.

382
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,519
Hamlet.

383
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:05,631
It's hard to make actors say:

384
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,522
"To be or not to be."

385
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:10,064
Or..."Murder...

386
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:12,796
"though it have no tongue...

387
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,625
"will speak with most miraculous organ."

388
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,497
What time is it?

389
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,729
I can hear pages,
but not the hands on a watch.

390
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:26,586
1 1:50 p.m.

391
00:36:26,863 --> 00:36:29,297
The Rome train leaves in 15 minutes.

392
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:31,095
I'm going to Rome, too.

393
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,090
What if I said I was brunette,
had black eyes...

394
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,154
and smoked "Marlboros?"

395
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:51,423
Fine, but I wouldn't believe you.

396
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,657
You're blond, blue eyed...

397
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:56,031
and smoke "Players."

398
00:36:57,364 --> 00:36:58,888
"Senior Service."

399
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:03,256
And you won't take off your coat.

400
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,026
Been thinking about my coat?

401
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,654
Constantly.

402
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:24,261
My antenna tells me everything.

403
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,423
That's why I don't need a white cane.

404
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,258
I can foretell storms, hurricanes...

405
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,054
earthquakes...

406
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,130
In my youth...

407
00:37:33,263 --> 00:37:34,924
it saved my mother's life.

408
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,530
We were on holiday in Sicily.

409
00:37:37,597 --> 00:37:39,929
Suddenly, I smelled a snake
under the stones...

410
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,597
A foul smell.

411
00:37:57,097 --> 00:37:58,189
You're "The Eye?"

412
00:37:58,263 --> 00:37:59,628
You phoned?

413
00:37:59,796 --> 00:38:02,196
I'm Mrs. Comolli. Come on up.

414
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:05,995
His name is Forbes.

415
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,529
He's Swiss.

416
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:12,229
Very wealthy, very shrewd,
speaks 8 languages and loves art.

417
00:38:12,397 --> 00:38:15,025
Has one of the finest homes on the coast.

418
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:17,197
Here's the address and phone.

419
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,858
-What does one say?
-Thank you.

420
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,592
No, I meant what does
one say to your boss?

421
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:25,029
She telexes daily.

422
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,860
She's sick of chasing you!

423
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:29,629
Everybody chases somebody.

424
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,964
One day she'll show you the door!

425
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:51,696
I've been waiting for you.

426
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:55,725
Good news:
Schlosser's paintings are coming.

427
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:58,457
One is specially fine.

428
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,455
I'm sure you'll love it, too.

429
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,119
The Traveller.

430
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,759
When you touch it...

431
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:07,531
it's as smooth, as exquisite, as a Latour.

432
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:28,494
You're exquisite, too, Charlotte.

433
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,661
You're exquisite, Charlotte.

434
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,488
Charlotte who?

435
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:52,888
Look where you're going!

436
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:54,323
I don't believe it.

437
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:03,690
Come on.

438
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,661
Come on, move it.

439
00:41:48,997 --> 00:41:50,658
Bastard smokes in bed!

440
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,392
Why do you let him?

441
00:41:53,297 --> 00:41:54,764
Why does he have the right?

442
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:57,161
Because he's blind?

443
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,520
Or because he's rich?

444
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:04,455
We spent our vacations...

445
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:06,723
in Denmark...

446
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:10,424
I smelled a snake under the stones...

447
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,029
A foul smell...

448
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:16,193
I can stink, too.

449
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,125
Bump into furniture. Play dumb.

450
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:57,295
Looking for something?

451
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,454
My granddaughter's ball...

452
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:12,363
a sort of round red ball.

453
00:43:12,663 --> 00:43:14,324
A red ball.

454
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,893
It must've come over the wall.

455
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,196
Wait, Marie.

456
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,389
I'm coming.

457
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:36,257
Goddamn blind man!

458
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,127
But, Mrs. Schmidt-Boulanger...

459
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:46,930
-Hugo's flying out tonight.
-Where to?

460
00:43:47,163 --> 00:43:48,824
If I knew, I'd tell you.

461
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:53,289
Anyway, Mrs. Comolli will give me
some expense money.

462
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:56,731
Screw Paul Hugo and Mrs. Comolli.

463
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:00,260
Those fingerprints did it:

464
00:44:00,696 --> 00:44:03,597
she was born Dec. 20, 1962...

465
00:44:03,696 --> 00:44:06,324
Did some time in jail.

466
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,761
2 years ago.

467
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,731
The French police
have nothing on her since.

468
00:44:11,197 --> 00:44:12,494
Catherine Leiris.

469
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,229
There's no warrant out?

470
00:44:16,563 --> 00:44:18,428
You expected Bonnie Parker?

471
00:44:24,997 --> 00:44:28,933
Don't you want to know
about your blind man?

472
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,896
I'll translate:

473
00:44:35,796 --> 00:44:38,959
"Art and finance to be happily united.

474
00:44:39,563 --> 00:44:44,125
"The marriage is announced
of Miss Charlotte Vincent...

475
00:44:44,263 --> 00:44:47,391
"whose current exhibit is a big hit...

476
00:44:47,663 --> 00:44:49,858
"and Mr. Ralph Forbes...

477
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:52,363
"the well-known Swiss architect."

478
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,161
What's come over you?

479
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:00,359
Nothing.

480
00:45:36,596 --> 00:45:38,291
Happy birthday, my love.

481
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:41,093
Happy birthday!

482
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:42,787
Congratulations!

483
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,455
The exhibit is marvelous.

484
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:48,065
Congratulate Mr. Forbes.

485
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,861
It was his idea.

486
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,588
Sorry, I'm out of cigarettes.

487
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:06,624
Happy birthday, Marie.

488
00:46:16,197 --> 00:46:17,186
Go on...

489
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:24,157
Go on, she's all alone.

490
00:46:24,696 --> 00:46:25,663
Go on.

491
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:39,795
Happy birthday, Catherine.

492
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:47,827
You must be mistaken.

493
00:46:49,696 --> 00:46:51,561
Just pulling names out of my hat.

494
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:54,693
Like: Catherine Leiris...

495
00:46:57,963 --> 00:46:59,328
Lucie Brentano...

496
00:47:01,063 --> 00:47:02,223
Lucie Orthiz...

497
00:47:05,529 --> 00:47:07,326
Did you bring this trash?

498
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:09,227
I'm out for myself.

499
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:10,952
Aren't you?

500
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:16,725
No comment?

501
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:19,590
"Murder, though it have no tongue...

502
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,563
"will speak with most miraculous organ..."

503
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:25,594
You talking to me?

504
00:47:26,363 --> 00:47:28,228
Just pulling words out of my hat.

505
00:47:28,496 --> 00:47:30,691
I could also whip out my.38...

506
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:33,228
and splatter the walls with ketchup.

507
00:47:35,097 --> 00:47:37,497
Louis, there's a maniac here.

508
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:39,721
-What?
-There's a maniac!

509
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,923
Is.38 a big caliber?

510
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:43,928
That's what he's got.

511
00:48:04,997 --> 00:48:08,057
The last time someone told me
"Happy birthday," I was 1 1.

512
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:10,929
That year, I wanted a majorette costume.

513
00:48:11,229 --> 00:48:12,958
But it was much too expensive.

514
00:48:13,896 --> 00:48:18,265
Daddy kept saying, "Everything
will be better once we have a little money."

515
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:20,924
It's just that there was never any money.

516
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:22,854
Nothing ever got better.

517
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,954
Wait.

518
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:33,956
Did you see something?

519
00:48:34,229 --> 00:48:37,721
No, nothing. It's strange.
It's like what I wanted to tell you.

520
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,765
It's a man wearing a uniform
with big buttons...

521
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,491
and a shiny cap.

522
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:49,995
His wife probably left him a long time ago.

523
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,095
Maybe she's dead.

524
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,528
The girls at school knew the shiny cap.

525
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:03,861
The teachers, too.

526
00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:06,087
Everybody made fun of them...

527
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,695
because her dad's job
was opening taxi doors.

528
00:49:11,196 --> 00:49:13,824
Even he knew he was incompetent.

529
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,827
He got fired.

530
00:49:19,096 --> 00:49:21,758
He became a washroom attendant
in a grand hotel.

531
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:23,323
Mr. John.

532
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:01,862
922 1319?

533
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:03,990
"Mr. Forbes...

534
00:50:04,596 --> 00:50:07,156
"I'm sorry, I can't let you marry Charlotte. "

535
00:50:08,963 --> 00:50:10,954
"922 1319? Hello, Forbes?

536
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:13,330
"Catherine Leiris stole a car.

537
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,627
"A Swiss can't marry a thief.

538
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,425
"She's also slightly lesbian... "

539
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,554
"922 1319? Hello, Binky?

540
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:21,958
"She's killed lots of guys.

541
00:50:22,563 --> 00:50:23,996
"She'll kill you, too.

542
00:50:24,162 --> 00:50:25,823
"You don't stand a chance...

543
00:50:25,963 --> 00:50:27,794
"so give her back to me. "

544
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:31,191
"922 1319...

545
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,062
"Catherine, I love you."

546
00:50:35,162 --> 00:50:37,653
Can you help me across?

547
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:42,296
Talking to yourself?

548
00:50:42,563 --> 00:50:45,088
-I was phoning you.
-What about?

549
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:46,653
About Marie...

550
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,095
I mean Charlotte.

551
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:49,457
You can't marry her.

552
00:50:50,062 --> 00:50:51,825
I'm against the marriage.

553
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:54,129
I beg your pardon, but...

554
00:50:54,262 --> 00:50:56,457
I'm her father, if you must know.

555
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,729
She surely spoke of me. She always does.

556
00:51:00,062 --> 00:51:02,428
The man in the shiny cap: "Mr. John."

557
00:51:02,996 --> 00:51:04,293
A ridiculous figure.

558
00:51:04,663 --> 00:51:06,893
Ridiculous, that's it.

559
00:51:07,363 --> 00:51:09,058
She spoke of you...

560
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:10,691
her time in jail...

561
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,158
the car she stole...

562
00:51:12,363 --> 00:51:14,263
As if she wanted to put me off.

563
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,592
She could have said anything...

564
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:19,160
I don't scare easily.

565
00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:23,322
The blind have priority, Mr. Forbes.

566
00:51:23,962 --> 00:51:25,987
You don't stand in line for movies...

567
00:51:26,763 --> 00:51:28,458
you get seats on buses...

568
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:30,463
But you can't run red lights...

569
00:51:30,663 --> 00:51:32,255
or steal people's kids.

570
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:34,491
You won't get my daughter.

571
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:37,463
What have you ever done for her?

572
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:39,525
I lugged Meyerganz...

573
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,461
through the sewers of Monte Carlo...

574
00:51:41,563 --> 00:51:44,828
and hid Jerry's bags in the ferns.

575
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,027
What did you do?

576
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,198
You just spouted a lot of crap...

577
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,058
Your intuitions... Hamlet...

578
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:59,620
The snake under the stones
and the cigars in bed...

579
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:02,824
I'm not denying you my daughter
because you're a cripple...

580
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:04,557
but because...

581
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:06,560
you're a phoney.

582
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:08,195
We can cross now.

583
00:52:28,663 --> 00:52:30,153
What's going on?

584
00:53:03,162 --> 00:53:04,220
Capricorn:

585
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:07,387
"Now is the winter of our discontent... "

586
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,593
All the planets are hostile.

587
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:11,257
Change surroundings.

588
00:53:47,696 --> 00:53:50,062
Hello, miss. Your passport, please.

589
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:01,552
Thank you.

590
00:54:28,062 --> 00:54:29,029
Shit.

591
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:31,524
Don't fool with hitchhikers.

592
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:37,087
Thanks... You're real nice.

593
00:54:38,363 --> 00:54:39,694
I'm going to Biarritz.

594
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:43,230
That's great. So am l.

595
00:54:45,996 --> 00:54:47,861
You might ask me my name.

596
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:49,823
What's your name?

597
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:51,385
Betty.

598
00:54:53,129 --> 00:54:54,926
You could say, "It's a nice name."

599
00:54:55,396 --> 00:54:57,830
And offer me a smoke.

600
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,687
Help yourself.

601
00:55:04,895 --> 00:55:08,194
Last night a truck driver tried to ball me.

602
00:55:09,529 --> 00:55:11,622
That idiot is at the hospital.

603
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:13,694
For a long time.

604
00:55:14,162 --> 00:55:15,959
You don't look that strong.

605
00:55:17,596 --> 00:55:19,257
No, but I've got what it takes.

606
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:24,097
You're driving too fast.

607
00:55:24,463 --> 00:55:26,363
If it's to show off to that dog...

608
00:55:26,895 --> 00:55:29,295
you'll have an accident. Like Forbes.

609
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,026
We can stop here if you want.

610
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:49,024
Now what?

611
00:55:51,196 --> 00:55:52,356
Get out.

612
00:55:56,296 --> 00:55:58,161
I've got what it takes, too.

613
00:56:01,262 --> 00:56:02,695
Throw out the penknife.

614
00:56:13,795 --> 00:56:16,127
For some reason,
I don't feel like killing you.

615
00:56:18,096 --> 00:56:20,155
I loved a man, he's dead, and I'm tired.

616
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,729
No more Biarritz?

617
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:27,489
If you promise to be good.

618
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:29,155
I promise. I swear.

619
00:57:08,129 --> 00:57:09,153
One day...

620
00:57:09,962 --> 00:57:11,896
I noticed the holes in the wall.

621
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:15,389
There were guys next door watching me.

622
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:19,329
I was part of the show...

623
00:57:23,862 --> 00:57:25,989
There are holes in the walls here, too.

624
00:57:26,895 --> 00:57:28,453
Someone's watching us.

625
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:32,454
Hey, go easy on the brandy.

626
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:36,058
I swear someone's watching us.

627
00:57:38,862 --> 00:57:40,420
Let me tell you something.

628
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:45,426
People who make holes in walls
only exist if you think they do.

629
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:50,393
Still there, old man?

630
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:53,926
I'm here, Marie.

631
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:47,626
Forbes died accidentally.

632
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,553
It said so in the papers.

633
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:44,396
Hey! That's my car!

634
00:59:44,862 --> 00:59:47,387
There's not room for both of us in this deal.

635
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:49,763
Looks like my gun, too.

636
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:52,891
There are things in the trunk...

637
00:59:53,528 --> 00:59:54,893
I care about them.

638
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:57,590
Always hang on to things you care about.

639
00:59:57,929 --> 01:00:01,092
There are also some cookies
on the back seat.

640
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:02,626
Give him his cookies.

641
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:07,018
Thanks.

642
01:00:09,895 --> 01:00:11,089
Have a good trip!

643
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:47,723
I'm always losing you, Marie. It won't do.

644
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,656
I hope you don't get into any trouble.

645
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:55,191
Wait for me, my sweet, I'm coming.

646
01:01:29,862 --> 01:01:31,625
I've been looking for you all over.

647
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:32,889
I haven't!

648
01:01:33,062 --> 01:01:34,825
I thought I'd see you sooner.

649
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,228
What kept you?

650
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:39,157
Where's lover-boy?

651
01:01:40,528 --> 01:01:42,018
Pension Hortensias.

652
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:45,798
I've had enough of that place.
I'm going home to Paris.

653
01:01:46,096 --> 01:01:47,563
14 rue de la Butte aux Cailles.

654
01:01:49,262 --> 01:01:51,253
Will you buy me a drink?

655
01:01:51,662 --> 01:01:54,358
-Take the lady's order.
-A Fernet...

656
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:55,987
No...

657
01:01:57,196 --> 01:01:58,424
a Pernod...

658
01:01:58,528 --> 01:02:00,462
No! A shandy.

659
01:02:00,795 --> 01:02:03,195
Why not mix all three?

660
01:02:03,562 --> 01:02:04,961
Get her a black coffee.

661
01:02:08,029 --> 01:02:09,587
Am I bothering you?

662
01:02:11,196 --> 01:02:12,993
You were sketching?

663
01:02:14,229 --> 01:02:15,924
Looked like schoolgirls...

664
01:02:16,196 --> 01:02:19,029
What a stupid thing to say. Schoolgirls?

665
01:02:20,662 --> 01:02:22,596
Are you zonked, or what?

666
01:02:27,296 --> 01:02:29,787
So lover-boy threw you out?

667
01:02:31,862 --> 01:02:33,193
Tell me all about it.

668
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,985
There's nothing to say.

669
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,054
Nothing, really.

670
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:41,762
I banged on the door all night.

671
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:44,354
I even used my head... See?

672
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:47,428
He wouldn't open.

673
01:02:47,962 --> 01:02:50,192
He told me to get lost. And worse.

674
01:02:50,262 --> 01:02:52,162
He said: "You're old, you stink..."

675
01:02:53,029 --> 01:02:54,360
He even called me ugly.

676
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,551
It's true...

677
01:02:56,562 --> 01:02:58,826
you're extremely ugly.

678
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:04,058
Let's talk about the girls.

679
01:03:04,695 --> 01:03:06,663
How are they? Where are they staying?

680
01:03:07,129 --> 01:03:08,892
At the Princess Hotel...

681
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:11,255
In a suite.

682
01:03:11,895 --> 01:03:14,363
They're gambling away a fortune.

683
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:25,363
Don't start about my looks again.

684
01:03:30,895 --> 01:03:33,125
You might be less hideous with bangs.

685
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:38,922
Give it a try. Down to there...

686
01:03:46,962 --> 01:03:47,951
There it is.

687
01:04:17,162 --> 01:04:18,925
Lost something, Supersleuth?

688
01:04:19,295 --> 01:04:20,523
You bet.

689
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:24,491
You took my car, my gun and some photos.

690
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,163
The car's been recovered. I want the rest.

691
01:04:28,996 --> 01:04:30,520
You can forget the gun.

692
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:33,723
$50,000 will buy back the photos.

693
01:04:34,862 --> 01:04:36,454
You're a bastard.

694
01:04:36,962 --> 01:04:39,328
What can you do with my mementos?

695
01:04:40,096 --> 01:04:41,222
Invest them.

696
01:04:43,428 --> 01:04:44,827
The Hugo case...

697
01:04:46,395 --> 01:04:48,022
The Meyerganz case...

698
01:04:50,162 --> 01:04:51,823
The Pallenberg case, today...

699
01:04:52,862 --> 01:04:55,626
Right now she's at the bank.

700
01:04:56,428 --> 01:04:58,419
Once she shows up here with the money...

701
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:00,290
the blackmailer will disappear.

702
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:06,293
The little girls...

703
01:05:07,762 --> 01:05:09,525
The photos of those schoolgirls?

704
01:05:09,729 --> 01:05:10,718
Censored.

705
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:12,150
Destroyed!

706
01:05:21,096 --> 01:05:23,030
Shame on you, dirty old man.

707
01:05:34,295 --> 01:05:36,820
-My shoes?
-They're tacky as hell.

708
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:39,751
Taruchi wore them, too.

709
01:05:40,862 --> 01:05:41,920
Who's Taruchi?

710
01:05:43,729 --> 01:05:45,356
An extremely tacky guy.

711
01:05:49,495 --> 01:05:50,860
A jerk like you...

712
01:05:51,695 --> 01:05:53,162
who thought he was smart.

713
01:05:54,962 --> 01:05:56,190
Good day, sir.

714
01:05:56,295 --> 01:05:58,024
Hold it, smart-ass.

715
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,190
Your turn to answer.

716
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:02,224
Who gave you my address?

717
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:05,519
Which one?

718
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:06,823
Here?

719
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:09,257
Or in Paris?

720
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:12,752
That's a low blow.

721
01:06:14,495 --> 01:06:15,894
Let me guess...

722
01:06:18,295 --> 01:06:20,263
-Not Madame Ugly?
-Right...

723
01:06:21,095 --> 01:06:22,790
All it took was a black coffee...

724
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:25,160
A few brief tears...a swoon...

725
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:26,819
The words: "sudden passion."

726
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:36,588
He called it "sudden passion?"

727
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:37,918
He did.

728
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,553
It's not about money now...

729
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:43,022
It's become a love story.

730
01:06:44,996 --> 01:06:46,964
You wouldn't recognize him.

731
01:06:47,195 --> 01:06:49,459
He wears fabulous shoes...

732
01:06:49,628 --> 01:06:50,925
Iight ties...

733
01:06:50,996 --> 01:06:52,361
silk shirts.

734
01:06:53,195 --> 01:06:54,287
What's she like?

735
01:06:54,996 --> 01:06:56,793
He spoke vaguely of her.

736
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,021
White yacht...

737
01:06:58,295 --> 01:06:59,762
Parasols...delicacies...

738
01:06:59,962 --> 01:07:01,452
Did he talk about me?

739
01:07:01,762 --> 01:07:02,751
Unkindly!

740
01:07:03,762 --> 01:07:04,786
The bastard.

741
01:07:06,029 --> 01:07:08,088
After all I did for him.

742
01:07:08,628 --> 01:07:11,256
I even walked the streets for him.
In Barcelona!

743
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:13,125
On the Ramblas, in 1958.

744
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:17,525
I don't look it.

745
01:07:17,595 --> 01:07:19,563
Do I look like a detective?

746
01:07:21,061 --> 01:07:23,393
In the old town,
I was known as "Castagnet"...

747
01:07:23,462 --> 01:07:26,158
And you advised me to wear bangs.

748
01:07:26,996 --> 01:07:29,931
I didn't realize what it meant to you.

749
01:07:40,862 --> 01:07:42,329
Should I dye them brown?

750
01:07:42,395 --> 01:07:44,886
-Know what I'm going to do?
-Don't be reckless.

751
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:47,660
Since that asshole's into passion...

752
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:50,493
I'll give him a crime of passion.

753
01:07:50,562 --> 01:07:52,621
-Be reasonable.
-Like hell.

754
01:07:59,795 --> 01:08:01,353
I said don't be reckless...

755
01:08:06,362 --> 01:08:08,227
Take a shower, while you're at it.

756
01:08:08,995 --> 01:08:10,519
I'm coming.

757
01:08:15,729 --> 01:08:17,287
This bag's heavy!

758
01:08:17,995 --> 01:08:19,292
No mistakes, I hope?

759
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:21,728
No, all in 50's and 100's.

760
01:08:25,961 --> 01:08:27,087
Why are you here?

761
01:08:27,161 --> 01:08:29,686
To please you, my liege.

762
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:30,851
"My liege."

763
01:08:34,829 --> 01:08:36,421
The detective was right.

764
01:08:38,328 --> 01:08:40,193
You got your pimp shoes on.

765
01:08:41,428 --> 01:08:42,486
Where you headed?

766
01:08:43,061 --> 01:08:44,892
What did he tell you?

767
01:08:46,228 --> 01:08:47,627
Looking for the sun?

768
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:50,162
With that cow, under her parasol?

769
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:57,391
Listen, Germaine... Don't do anything silly.

770
01:08:57,729 --> 01:09:00,323
Germaine can't listen. She's deaf.

771
01:09:00,462 --> 01:09:02,362
Dead!

772
01:09:48,462 --> 01:09:49,827
Goodbye, Castagnet.

773
01:11:58,362 --> 01:12:01,422
From that day on,
the day Catherine lost Betty...

774
01:12:01,562 --> 01:12:03,962
the detective realized dark forces...

775
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,791
would always pursue the girl.

776
01:12:05,928 --> 01:12:07,759
Slowly, inexorably...

777
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:09,625
Iike a glacier on the move.

778
01:12:09,828 --> 01:12:12,388
She could only elude them by moving on...

779
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,756
anywhere...

780
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:15,090
ceaselessly.

781
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:18,795
A deadly whirl...

782
01:12:19,095 --> 01:12:20,687
but that's how it had to be.

783
01:12:27,462 --> 01:12:28,793
Up north...

784
01:12:29,362 --> 01:12:31,227
they crashed a police roadblock.

785
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:35,788
For the detective,
it was a new and exhilarating experience.

786
01:13:42,195 --> 01:13:44,857
Then their trail led north-east...

787
01:13:45,028 --> 01:13:48,759
till they reached a town known,
perhaps, to Catherine.

788
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:52,761
The detective knew nothing of it.
But it had a name: Charleville.

789
01:14:05,061 --> 01:14:07,154
Catherine moved into the "Canal Hotel."

790
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:10,959
She only left her room once a day,
for a short walk.

791
01:14:13,462 --> 01:14:16,431
She seemed interested in nothing...

792
01:14:17,928 --> 01:14:19,293
including herself.

793
01:14:48,128 --> 01:14:49,595
It's incredible.

794
01:14:50,061 --> 01:14:52,723
Just think, two days ago I was still in Vegas.

795
01:14:53,761 --> 01:14:54,887
At the "Flamingo."

796
01:14:57,128 --> 01:14:59,096
It's better than here, you know.

797
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:00,351
I know.

798
01:15:01,995 --> 01:15:03,860
No kidding, sweetheart. You know Vegas?

799
01:15:05,161 --> 01:15:06,856
My father had an office there.

800
01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:09,129
A whole floor to himself on the Strip.

801
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:12,523
Buy me a Pimm's?

802
01:15:13,495 --> 01:15:15,087
It's my birthday today.

803
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:16,583
Julien!

804
01:15:17,228 --> 01:15:18,991
A Pimm's for the lady.

805
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:22,396
$2.50, plus the olives, makes $3.

806
01:15:22,462 --> 01:15:23,793
I didn't order olives.

807
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:27,891
She should go before she
makes a fool of herself, don't you think?

808
01:15:28,328 --> 01:15:29,625
Run away, quick.

809
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:31,583
Who?

810
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,586
The young girl at the bar.

811
01:15:34,594 --> 01:15:36,687
Anyway, there are only young girls here.

812
01:15:42,028 --> 01:15:43,928
He died the evening of my birthday.

813
01:15:45,594 --> 01:15:47,585
Over 1,000 people came to the funeral.

814
01:15:49,228 --> 01:15:50,559
Whose funeral?

815
01:15:51,061 --> 01:15:52,050
My father's.

816
01:15:56,095 --> 01:15:58,325
I'm sure nobody went to Betty's funeral.

817
01:16:00,228 --> 01:16:01,456
It was probably very sad.

818
01:16:03,761 --> 01:16:05,956
What did those assholes do with the mask?

819
01:16:11,828 --> 01:16:13,420
Who put this here?

820
01:16:14,561 --> 01:16:16,256
That odd man at the back.

821
01:16:16,428 --> 01:16:18,055
He left right after.

822
01:16:18,328 --> 01:16:19,818
He left you a note.

823
01:16:28,161 --> 01:16:31,460
HAPPY BlRTHDAY MARlE

824
01:16:37,728 --> 01:16:39,593
At this critical point in their relationship...

825
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,457
the ogre decided to talk to the little girl.

826
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,821
He asked,
"What are you going to do now?"

827
01:16:45,794 --> 01:16:46,783
I'm going home.

828
01:16:51,328 --> 01:16:53,262
But what does that mean, "home?"

829
01:16:53,961 --> 01:16:55,485
Her home.

830
01:16:57,527 --> 01:17:00,690
Catherine Nieris, born on Dec. 22, 1962...

831
01:17:00,861 --> 01:17:01,885
in Bobigny...

832
01:17:02,728 --> 01:17:03,990
Seine St. Denis.

833
01:17:05,395 --> 01:17:07,522
How can she go back to the cockroaches...

834
01:17:07,694 --> 01:17:09,286
the rotting walls...

835
01:17:09,995 --> 01:17:11,690
back to the slums?

836
01:17:29,861 --> 01:17:33,092
Server wanted - lnteresting salary - Tips

837
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:47,519
No. Never seen her.

838
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:50,323
I'll leave the photos, you get back to me.

839
01:17:57,594 --> 01:17:59,255
Hello, reception.

840
01:18:50,295 --> 01:18:51,284
Let's go.

841
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:53,289
That money's not mine.

842
01:18:53,594 --> 01:18:55,562
I'm not doing it for myself, either.

843
01:18:58,461 --> 01:19:00,929
I'll scream, I'll shout for help!

844
01:19:00,995 --> 01:19:04,158
I've shouted for help for 20 years.
No one ever answered.

845
01:19:37,161 --> 01:19:38,150
Come in.

846
01:19:42,627 --> 01:19:44,254
Ignore the mess.

847
01:19:47,861 --> 01:19:49,453
I can't offer you much.

848
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:51,689
A Coke? Beer?

849
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:53,889
Brandy?

850
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,292
Make yourself at home.

851
01:20:04,028 --> 01:20:06,258
Perhaps you'd like a shower?

852
01:20:06,961 --> 01:20:08,087
A shower?

853
01:20:08,228 --> 01:20:09,991
That's a dumb thing to suggest!

854
01:20:11,594 --> 01:20:12,618
We'll see...

855
01:20:13,761 --> 01:20:17,197
She goes into the bathroom...
I go to the window.

856
01:20:27,427 --> 01:20:28,587
I live alone.

857
01:20:29,794 --> 01:20:31,125
My wife left me.

858
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,152
Left with my daughter.

859
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,921
I never saw them again.

860
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,854
At first, it was very painful... Now it's better.

861
01:20:49,828 --> 01:20:51,796
Don't fool with that. It's loaded.

862
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,922
Don't... It's loaded...

863
01:21:10,828 --> 01:21:12,227
What time you through?

864
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:14,628
What are your hours, miss?

865
01:21:15,327 --> 01:21:16,658
When do you get off?

866
01:21:17,327 --> 01:21:19,192
When does your shift end?

867
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:21,855
2:00 a.m.

868
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:25,026
Mind meeting me for a drink?

869
01:21:36,227 --> 01:21:37,592
That looks better.

870
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:40,459
You're right. More appetizing than ours.

871
01:21:40,828 --> 01:21:42,261
Very well presented.

872
01:21:44,694 --> 01:21:46,184
I forgot...

873
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:47,454
Don't wait in front.

874
01:21:47,561 --> 01:21:49,722
The staff leaves by the stage door.

875
01:21:49,995 --> 01:21:51,326
At the rear.

876
01:21:51,527 --> 01:21:52,858
How will I know it?

877
01:21:53,327 --> 01:21:55,693
The trash cans are yellow, I'll be in blue.

878
01:22:15,894 --> 01:22:17,418
What time is it?

879
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,820
1:55.

880
01:23:08,661 --> 01:23:10,652
My girlfriend smoked those.

881
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:19,818
-I live in a hotel.
-So do l.

882
01:23:21,661 --> 01:23:23,060
My name's Catherine...

883
01:23:23,728 --> 01:23:24,990
Catherine Leiris.

884
01:23:31,594 --> 01:23:34,722
When you asked what time I got off,
I thought I knew you.

885
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,122
I've never been in the "Miami."

886
01:23:37,728 --> 01:23:39,161
I didn't mean there.

887
01:23:39,794 --> 01:23:42,661
People think they know me:
I'm so ordinary looking.

888
01:23:44,127 --> 01:23:45,788
I look like everybody.

889
01:23:47,427 --> 01:23:49,258
When I grow a beard...

890
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:52,222
I'm like any bearded guy.

891
01:24:08,394 --> 01:24:09,986
Ignore the mess.

892
01:24:24,761 --> 01:24:26,092
Sit down.

893
01:24:29,494 --> 01:24:31,257
What would you like?

894
01:24:32,728 --> 01:24:35,060
I have a nice little white wine.

895
01:24:35,427 --> 01:24:36,621
A Coke?

896
01:24:36,995 --> 01:24:39,463
A drop of brandy? No, a Coke...

897
01:24:40,094 --> 01:24:41,288
Brandy.

898
01:24:57,227 --> 01:24:58,922
Won't you take off your jacket?

899
01:25:00,294 --> 01:25:01,454
I'll take it off.

900
01:25:01,728 --> 01:25:03,093
I didn't mean...

901
01:25:03,327 --> 01:25:05,727
Then let's change the subject.

902
01:25:07,294 --> 01:25:08,556
Just talk.

903
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:10,621
About you?

904
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:15,653
OK...

905
01:25:16,828 --> 01:25:18,090
Let's go.

906
01:25:21,194 --> 01:25:23,253
I wasn't always a waitress.

907
01:25:24,127 --> 01:25:25,719
I've been waited on.

908
01:25:27,194 --> 01:25:29,628
My father was an international thief.

909
01:25:30,194 --> 01:25:32,560
Police everywhere chased him for years.

910
01:25:34,127 --> 01:25:35,651
On my birthday...

911
01:25:36,627 --> 01:25:38,788
he collapsed, his pockets full of diamonds.

912
01:25:38,861 --> 01:25:40,954
He said: "Happy birthday," and died.

913
01:25:43,194 --> 01:25:44,218
You loved him?

914
01:25:46,094 --> 01:25:47,220
Yes.

915
01:25:51,327 --> 01:25:52,794
That's all crap.

916
01:25:53,794 --> 01:25:56,592
My father was a famous doctor...
a blind pianist...

917
01:25:56,661 --> 01:25:58,993
A brilliant architect...

918
01:25:59,127 --> 01:26:00,492
What else was he?

919
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:07,829
But I really loved him.

920
01:26:10,661 --> 01:26:12,253
I'm terribly sorry...

921
01:26:12,327 --> 01:26:13,794
maybe you wanted cookies?

922
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,492
No thanks, I'm fine.

923
01:26:16,728 --> 01:26:18,559
If you feel like resting...

924
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,557
go right ahead.

925
01:26:26,694 --> 01:26:28,821
Unless you'd like a shower?

926
01:26:33,594 --> 01:26:34,788
The French fries?

927
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,492
Not at all... I...

928
01:26:37,694 --> 01:26:39,093
It's a good idea.

929
01:26:43,427 --> 01:26:46,828
I'm in a luxury hotel...
but there's no shower.

930
01:26:51,194 --> 01:26:52,661
There's a clean washcloth.

931
01:26:52,828 --> 01:26:54,420
And a mitten for rub-downs.

932
01:26:54,828 --> 01:26:57,558
Careful... The hot and cold knobs
have been reversed.

933
01:26:58,127 --> 01:27:00,095
Red is cold, blue's hot.

934
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,422
Never fails!

935
01:27:05,427 --> 01:27:06,826
I'll leave you to it!

936
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:09,058
See you later.

937
01:27:22,694 --> 01:27:23,922
You married?

938
01:27:24,227 --> 01:27:25,216
Yes...

939
01:27:26,594 --> 01:27:29,324
I mean, no... I was.

940
01:27:30,661 --> 01:27:32,060
My wife left me...

941
01:27:33,761 --> 01:27:35,092
a long time ago.

942
01:27:42,194 --> 01:27:43,786
She left with my daughter...

943
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,049
Marie...

944
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,887
Back in 1958.

945
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,789
Marie died in 1962.

946
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:01,760
It must have been painful.

947
01:28:02,827 --> 01:28:03,816
Yes.

948
01:28:08,661 --> 01:28:10,288
You got over it?

949
01:28:10,761 --> 01:28:11,750
No.

950
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:20,154
I lost the only photo I had of her.

951
01:28:21,627 --> 01:28:23,652
It was taken in 1962...

952
01:28:24,127 --> 01:28:27,153
Just before the vacation, a school picture...

953
01:28:28,394 --> 01:28:31,192
She had her arms crossed, like a sad clown?

954
01:28:31,427 --> 01:28:32,792
Not at all.

955
01:28:33,394 --> 01:28:35,362
Marie was very cheerful.

956
01:28:44,594 --> 01:28:46,061
Look what I found...

957
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:56,256
Don't fool with it. It's loaded.

958
01:29:49,194 --> 01:29:50,718
Calm down.

959
01:29:51,327 --> 01:29:52,919
Calm down, troubled soul...

960
01:30:21,827 --> 01:30:24,022
Stop, Marie, please...

961
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,487
I know where I saw you...

962
01:31:39,626 --> 01:31:41,059
You're the photographer.

963
01:31:41,893 --> 01:31:42,882
Yes...

964
01:31:43,793 --> 01:31:45,454
In the park, in Brussels.

965
01:31:48,427 --> 01:31:49,792
By the carousel...

966
01:31:50,427 --> 01:31:51,758
The Hugo case...

967
01:32:09,294 --> 01:32:10,283
Louis...

968
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,088
Yes, Madeleine?

969
01:32:14,327 --> 01:32:15,726
What happened?

970
01:32:17,294 --> 01:32:19,228
I lost the photo of Marie.

971
01:32:24,793 --> 01:32:26,522
I'm telling you this for us.

972
01:32:27,027 --> 01:32:28,688
If you've lost the photo...

973
01:32:29,327 --> 01:32:31,386
maybe we should stop phoning each other?

974
01:32:31,994 --> 01:32:33,256
Maybe you're right.

975
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:36,925
What'll you do now?

976
01:32:36,994 --> 01:32:37,983
Nothing.

977
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:39,952
Wait.

978
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,319
He waited less than 3 years.

979
01:32:49,494 --> 01:32:53,487
He knew it was his last night on earth
when he finally saw the door...

980
01:32:58,760 --> 01:32:59,920
Marie!

981
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,084
Catherine!

982
01:33:04,727 --> 01:33:06,752
Careful... It's him.

983
01:33:06,827 --> 01:33:08,522
He opened the door...

984
01:33:09,294 --> 01:33:10,761
and went into the photo...

985
01:33:10,827 --> 01:33:11,953
Here he comes.
