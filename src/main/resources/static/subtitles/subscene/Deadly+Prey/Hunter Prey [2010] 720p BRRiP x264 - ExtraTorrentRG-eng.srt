1
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,461
Sir?

2
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,256
Sir, can you hear me?

3
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,010
He's alive!

4
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,387
Get your ass back 
here. Get some cover.

5
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,389
We don't have time
to take a nap.

6
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,808
The prisoner escaped
before we recovered.

7
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,187
We think he took a rifle.
He headed off in that...

8
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,166
Rifle.

9
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:06,371
Lost target! Any signs?
-Negative.

10
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,532
Start-up sequence complete.

11
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:31,211
Clea 19, series Gamma, on-line. 
Hello, commander Karza.

12
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,755
Now, Clea, activate system link.

13
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,384
System is linked. 
-You guys got her on-line? 
-Check.

14
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,588
-Check. 
-Clea, patch me into base.

15
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,473
Transmitting.

16
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,728
Alpha base, this is Commander Karza 
<i>(notched helmet comb)</i>. Do you copy?

17
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,397
Copy, Commander.
This is Alpha base.

18
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,567
Prometheus is down. I repeat, 
Prometheus is down. Inrepairable.

19
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,363
We have three survivors and 
in need of immediate extraction.

20
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,115
We're not picking up
your ship's beacon.

21
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,076
Ships beacon is non-functional.

22
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,288
We're diverting close ships to 
your last known coordinates

23
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,875
E.T.A. in 100 hours.

24
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,110
Upon their arrival you'll need to

25
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,628
activate your personal beacon.

26
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:16,440
Copy that. 
-What is the status of your cargo?

27
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,136
Cargo has survived
and fled crash site.

28
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,305
Commander, mission
parameters remaining.

29
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,389
The organism must be

30
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,724
contained and delivered.

31
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,977
And Karza, it's imperative
that you bring him in alive.

32
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,480
Is that understood?

33
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,274
Commander, do you copy?

34
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,612
Yeah, roger that.
Karza out.

35
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,032
End transmission.
-Thanks for the help.

36
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,284
What else is new?
-Enough.

37
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,786
This mission has been
a joke from the start.

38
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,956
You think that it's a joke that
we lost our ship and our crew?

39
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,166
Your prisoner brought my
men down single handed.

40
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,336
And you couldn't do a
damn thing to stop it.

41
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:59,508
I don't see anything funny
about that. Do you soldier?

42
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,261
No, sir.
-Good.

43
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,138
Now, Clea, see to
the Lieutenant.

44
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,559
Hello, Lt Centauri 7 <i>(smooth helmet comb)</i>.
Oh, you are hurt.

45
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,395
Yeah, give me a diagnostic.

46
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,816
There is substantial trauma
to your left shoulder.

47
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,653
A plasma wound. No broken 
bones. Heart beat is elevated.

48
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,781
Otherwise you appear to be
in excellent condition.

49
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,783
Clea, skiptrace prisoner.

50
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,369
Activating tracking system.
-Patch me up Clea. 

51
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,665
Redirecting cells to repairing
nerve and tissue damage.

52
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:36,392
Increasing endorphins to counter pain.
Administering strophine to wounded area.

53
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,048
Better.

54
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,511
Sensors show the subject is 250 micro-
clicks south-east from your position

55
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,471
and moving away
at a steady rate.

56
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,973
Are you sure
it's moving away?

57
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,351
Yes, Commander.
-Get on the move, let's head out.

58
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,145
We'll need supplies.

59
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,899
Not much left.
-We'll take Logan's pack.

60
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,406
Clea, any idea
where we are?

61
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,366
Planet is uncharted.

62
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,120
Log shows you dropped out of warp 
at an unknown set of coordinates.

63
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,123
Gravity at the nearest
planet did the rest.

64
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,166
Give us the stats.

65
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,792
Atmosphere is thin.

66
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,711
Likely to render
you unconscious.

67
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,605
I advise, keeping
your helmets on

68
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:21,548
until I finished
acclimating your bodies.

69
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,177
Surface's temperature is 116 degrees F (47C). 
-Nice.

70
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,554
Power cells are
at 72 percent,

71
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,307
which can last
just about 100 hours.

72
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,892
Anything else?

73
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,852
Calculating the
position of the sun.

74
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,189
I estimate the days here
are 33 hours of daylight

75
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,232
with 5 hours of night.

76
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,693
Sound like paradise.
Maybe I'll move here.

77
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,489
I can arrange that.

78
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,951
I'm sure you could, sir.

79
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,465
According to Clea, we've got less 
than three days to get this thing.

80
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,510
Let's move out.

81
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,153
Croyer (no helmet comb),
give me a torch.

82
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,871
What're you gonna do?

83
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:37,332
Weld it back together?

84
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,994
He's on the move 
again. Let's go.

85
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,997
On your feet.

86
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,276
This is brutal.

87
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,753
I don't understand
how this thing

88
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,339
can move so fast in this heat. 
-Simple.

89
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,576
It wants to live,
pure survival instinct.

90
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:13,595
What's the rush? It's 
got no food, no water.

91
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,305
We can track every
move it makes.

92
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,266
Let it die of thirst.

93
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,892
Then there won't be a
need to recover it.

94
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,145
You heard them.
They want it alive.

95
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,024
Why? 
-It's not your place to question orders, Lieutenant.

96
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,194
It is when it's costing 
me the lives of my men.

97
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,154
This was a simple
transport mission.

98
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,032
Are you done crying, soldier?

99
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,952
fuck off.

100
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,500
May it up and move out.

101
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,295
Both of you.

102
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:13,238
Closing in on subject.
78 clicks and increasing.

103
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,200
There!
-See it!

104
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,767
Where is it?

105
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,648
Up on the ridge.
8 o'clock.

106
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,613
Look like we can get 
up on the north side.

107
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,867
Croyer, Grab Karza's 
rifle. I'll cover you.

108
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,703
Go!

109
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,275
I see it.
-Shoot it.

110
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,985
They want it alive.

111
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,781
I'm in command now.
Take it down.

112
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,869
Target locked.
-Take the shot.

113
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,624
Down.

114
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,917
Hold the position.

115
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,086
It's secure.
I got it.

116
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,255
I said hold position.
I coming up.

117
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,975
There's nothing here
but his cloak.

118
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,686
Fall back!
Fall back!

119
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:55,335
Croyer?

120
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:56,962
Croyer?

121
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,455
I thought you were dead.
-You are not that lucky.

122
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,874
Where is my rifle?

123
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,835
Ask the prisoner.

124
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,171
Night's falling.

125
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,339
That's a good place
to set up camp.

126
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,926
Hard to take the ground.
Only two access points.

127
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,594
I can still catch him.

128
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,679
If you need to rest,
stay here and I'll...

129
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,431
You seem to think
I want to hear

130
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,643
your opinion soldier?
I don't.

131
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,731
Kid was too green. Never should have 
been in any unit. Blew our chance.

132
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,693
He wasn't the one who 
rushed us into an ambush.

133
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,613
The situation doesn't determine
the outcome, Lieutenant.

134
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,532
Confidence and skill do.

135
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,910
Unfortunately, your team was 
in short abundance of those traits.

136
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,371
Now, make
yourself useful

137
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:16,375
and set a parameter around 
those rocks over there.

138
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,712
You have your orders.

139
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:33,035
34 degrees F (0C) and dropping.

140
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,756
Private channel opened.

141
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,467
What's the Commander's
condition?

142
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,386
He's suffering from a
plasma wound to his side.

143
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,180
Extreme nerve
damage has been

144
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,976
sustained and his
left lung is teared.

145
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,187
What meds you got him on?

146
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:05,234
500 cc Strophine and 
250 cc of Cryoxin.

147
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:09,238
I'm surprised he stayed on
his feet as long as he did.

148
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,198
Reduce his medication.

149
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,366
We have a long way
to travel tomorrow

150
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,076
and I am not 
gonna carry him.

151
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,702
I'm not sure if
Commander Karza

152
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,704
would agree with
your assessment.

153
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,164
Keep the information off line.

154
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,874
He doesn't need to know.

155
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,919
It is not in my programming
to lie, Lieutenant.

156
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,005
You won't be lying, you just 
won't be volunteering any information.

157
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,842
Can you do that?
-Of, course.

158
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,593
Thanks.

159
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,137
Odd.
-What's that?

160
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,682
Of all the soldiers that 
I've been assigned to,

161
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:40,435
you are the only one
that has ever thanked me.

162
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,688
Do you mind it?
-No.

163
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,273
I quite prefer it.

164
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:48,193
It can get tiresome being
endlessly ordered about.

165
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,196
We have that in
common then.

166
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:55,367
Your words conflict with 
the military directive, Centauri.

167
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,369
So, I've been told.

168
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,706
According to your record

169
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,958
some of your previous 
insubordinations

170
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:07,462
border dangerously close to treason. 
-And?

171
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,800
It bodes a question, for why you
have chosen to be a soldier?

172
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,679
Yes it does, doesn't it?

173
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:48,545
Atmospheric conditioning will
be complete in T minus 10 seconds.

174
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,633
I advise you to keep your
eyes on our objective

175
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:56,094
instead of me, Lieutenant.

176
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,680
Atmospheric adaptation
is complete.

177
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,477
It is now safe to
remove your helmets.

178
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,862
Why isn't the prisoner
affected by the thin air?

179
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,822
He doesn't have 
a life suit.

180
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,158
They can adapt to
almost any conditions.

181
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,827
All this was in the file.

182
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,498
Permission to
speak freely, sir?

183
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,584
Permission? It has 
never stopped you before.

184
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,294
Go ahead.

185
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,547
What's this mission really about?

186
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,881
Why is this thing
so important?

187
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,384
Does it matter?
-Yes, it does.

188
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,428
Why? 
-I lost my ship and my crew.

189
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,472
I would like to know why.
-You're a soldier.

190
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:43,475
We both are.
We follow orders.

191
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,603
Without questions.

192
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:53,819
Tell me what you know

193
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,488
otherwise, I go alone.

194
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,991
Disobeying orders is
treason, soldier.

195
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,785
Punishable by death.

196
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,470
All right. This thing is
the last of it's kind.

197
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,097
We destroyed
it's home world,

198
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,349
and somehow it's figured
a way to return the favour.

199
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,852
So, we'll catch the damn thing
and get it back to base,

200
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,646
or we may not have a
world to go home too.

201
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,732
Now you know
as much as I do.

202
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,026
Does that you make
feel better, soldier?

203
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:37,446
Or let's sit down and discuss some more 
when this thing is gaining ground on us.

204
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,032
You deliberately 
kept us in the dark.

205
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,784
You didn't need to know.
-I see.

206
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,287
This mission
was a hero maker.

207
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,873
Everything we know
was at risk.

208
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:51,168
Are you deaf as 
well as stupid?

209
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,337
What level was
this mission?

210
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,838
This discussion is over.

211
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:59,009
What level was
this mission, sir?

212
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:03,347
Prio one. Nova class.
-Highest level.

213
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,265
And you was so caught up in your ego

214
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,101
you didn't bother to tell us
how dangerous this creature was.

215
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,187
Your men were incompetent.

216
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,231
Don't blame me
for your mistakes.

217
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,149
You jeopardized this mission.

218
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,984
You got my men killed.

219
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,362
I'm your superior officer

220
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,656
and you will speak
to me as such.

221
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,241
Why?

222
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,409
You don't deserve it.

223
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,892
Come on. Let's see how much
fight you got in you.

224
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:53,188
You're not worth it.

225
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,056
Clea? What's the
prisoners position?

226
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,184
I have no visual.

227
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,103
Clea?

228
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,315
Clea?

229
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,520
Come on.

230
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,572
Come on, baby.

231
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,908
Don't leave me out here alone now.

232
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:30,285
Start-up sequence complete.

233
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:34,581
Clea 19 series gamma on-line.
Hello, Centauri 7.

234
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,624
Clea.

235
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,918
I thought I lost you there.
-You can't get rid of me

236
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,211
that easily, Centauri.

237
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:42,297
I've suffered some damage but
seem to be functioning properly.

238
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,259
 I'm an early model,
 and quite durable.

239
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,885
That's why I keep
you around, babe.

240
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:50,681
I thought it was my
charming personality.

241
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,355
Clea. What's the prisoner's 
current location?

242
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,984
78 clicks and increasing.

243
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,451
Look likes it's just
you and me again.

244
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,704
I'm sorry about
Commander Karza

245
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,664
but if I must
say I'm pleased

246
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,541
that it was you
who survived.

247
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,751
Well, that makes two of us.

248
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,057
Skiptrace prisoner.

249
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,852
200 micro-clicks on
your current location.

250
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:40,856
Continuing in south-
eastern direction.

251
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:43,525
On the move again.

252
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:55,454
I hope you rot in the 
bellies of twelve gods, sir.

253
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,330
Prisoner has stopped moving.

254
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,743
It's been moving at a
steady pace for hours.

255
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,830
Hopefully the damn
thing's collapsed.

256
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,292
Without the water source it could
be succumbing to dehydration.

257
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:26,128
Exactly.

258
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,550
Still...

259
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,969
I'm going in.

260
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,849
Report me any movement.
-Of course.

261
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,978
Be careful, Centauri.

262
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:54,037
Can you give me a tracer signal?

263
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,637
Got it.

264
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,395
Clear my grid.

265
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,438
What is it, Centauri?

266
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,482
It's the tracking device.

267
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,277
Torn out of it's
own throat.

268
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,571
Very clever.

269
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,656
It can't have gone far.

270
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,908
You can't hide forever!

271
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,994
Do you hear me?

272
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,541
I bringing you in.

273
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,793
Dead or alive.

274
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:49,897
Centauri?
Are you all right?

275
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,237
Centauri 7?
Please answer.

276
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,071
Clea?

277
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,115
It's been toying with me?

278
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,909
How long have I been out?

279
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,913
Clea?

280
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:34,009
The head.

281
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:39,139
I had to kick the head.

282
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,832
Hold on to that.

283
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,852
Hello?

284
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:52,147
Unknown user,
please identify.

285
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:55,859
Repeat, identify.

286
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,612
Identify.

287
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,447
Orin Jericho.

288
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:04,910
Unauthorized user.
Terminating access.

289
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:41,655
Private channel, opened. 
-Clea?

290
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,284
Where are you?
-I'm not sure.

291
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:49,288
I'm in the possession
of an unauthorized user.

292
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:56,378
Can you give me a signal of the location? 
-Of course.

293
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:03,719
Got it.

294
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,345
He tried to access me,

295
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,806
but I terminated
the communication.

296
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,975
It spoke to you?
-Yes.

297
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:11,977
And it understood you.
-Yes.

298
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,146
The damn thing is
smarter than I thought.

299
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:15,939
Keep that signal going.
Still on the private channel.

300
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,275
I'm on my way.

301
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:14,414
Clea?

302
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,708
Clea?

303
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,253
She won't be helping
you any more.

304
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,384
We can't get off
this planet without her.

305
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:31,181
How do I use her?
-You can't.

306
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,726
And if you harm her,

307
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,855
you'll be stuck on this
floating rock as well.

308
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,439
You've got nowhere to go.

309
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:43,026
Maybe I don't
plan on going anywhere.

310
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,780
If you wanna die

311
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,492
kill yourself now and
save me the trouble.

312
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,287
What if I want to
take you with me?

313
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:57,749
Nah. You'd have done that already.

314
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:01,378
You aren't as dumb
as you look.

315
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:04,506
What's it that you want?

316
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:15,142
I know you
can still hear me.

317
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,187
You like playing games?

318
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:20,856
Well, here's mine.

319
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:23,734
I know why they
want you brought in.

320
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:27,196
And I don't care.

321
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:31,575
I'm gonna hunt you down
and I'm gonna you.

322
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:34,995
That's my game.

323
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:27,000
Give up, Cydonian.

324
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:30,087
You will never catch me.

325
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,801
You've been out-smarted
and out-runned.

326
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:44,309
Go home.

327
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:48,564
While you've still got 
a home to go back to.

328
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,757
I know something new
I hate about your race.

329
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:05,594
You don't pack enough water.

330
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:09,890
Guess it's more
of a human thing.

331
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:13,060
Always be prepared.

332
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:19,149
I'm actually surprised you Cydonians
have lasted as long as you have.

333
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:22,903
Seeing how incompetent you all are.

334
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,198
Now I know why they put
that inhibitor mask on you.

335
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:29,576
You talk too much.

336
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:32,621
They didn't want anyone to know
I can speak your language.

337
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,390
They were right. 

338
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:36,875
It's offensive for a
creature like you to

339
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,585
speak the language
of the stars.

340
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:44,380
Something we picked up from the Drax
-Insects teaching the Apes. It's repugnant.

341
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:47,470
Drax are noble race.

342
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,596
You wouldn't know
anything about that.

343
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:50,722
Noble?

344
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:54,226
They're disease of the galaxy, filthy creatures.

345
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:55,561
That's funny.

346
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:58,514
They say the same
thing about you.

347
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:01,809
Lying bugs.

348
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:04,361
I tell you this

349
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:07,030
no one's gonna miss you 
guys when you're gone.

350
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,576
Your the race that's extinct,
human, not mine.

351
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:12,160
Not for long.

352
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,496
Is that so?
-Yap.

353
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:17,082
I taking you all to hell.

354
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,586
All right, I'll entertain your fantasy, human.

355
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:22,796
Being that you're the
last of your kind

356
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,048
how do you hope to accomplish 
this remarkable feat?

357
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:27,384
Don't you wanna know why?
-I don't care.

358
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,303
Hah. That's why.

359
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:31,555
You entered this war
on your own, earthman,

360
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,265
and lost your home world.

361
00:49:33,265 --> 00:49:36,185
Those are the consequences.
-We didn't enter this war.

362
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:37,352
You attacked us.

363
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:40,105
You were harbouring Draxian fugitives.
-You mean refugees.

364
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:42,691
Big difference.
They needed our help.

365
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,785
You chose the wrong side.

366
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:47,070
No.

367
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,865
It's cost us everything
but we chose the right side.

368
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:53,994
Now, it's gonna cost
you everything.

369
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:57,823
We all die.
That's your solution.

370
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:00,567
How can you be so naive?

371
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,911
Another faction will
rise up in our place.

372
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,705
An endless cycle.

373
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:06,740
The only way to break it

374
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,418
is to take control from
those in power,

375
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:12,421
to rule in their stead.

376
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,099
You've thought about this?
-No.

377
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:19,094
It's just the way it is.

378
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:23,024
Maybe you are right.

379
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,887
Human.

380
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,322
You have two options.

381
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:32,533
You can come with
me and survive

382
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:35,786
or you can join the rest
of your race in oblivion.

383
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:37,996
It's your decision.

384
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,374
I choose option
number three.

385
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,368
Which is what?

386
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,343
Clea?

387
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:16,720
Clea? You there?

388
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,598
Centauri 7?
-Yeah, it's me.

389
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:22,726
Has the human been recaptured? 
-No.

390
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:25,395
Then how did you
retrieve me?

391
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,814
Found you sitting
on the skeleton.

392
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,942
Why he leave you behind?

393
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:34,321
Odd, that creature is 
cunning, dangerously so.

394
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:36,156
Like he figured something out.

395
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,909
What the twelve hells is he doing?

396
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:41,161
I'm missing something.

397
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:44,081
I wonder...
-Wonder what?

398
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:46,041
Clea?

399
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:49,127
Centauri, I may know
what the human is doing.

400
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:50,796
Great, tell me.

401
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:54,132
It would be better if I didn't. 
-Why is that?

402
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:57,761
If you know it might
influence your actions.

403
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:59,304
I don't... What?

404
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:03,016
Do you trust me, Centauri?
-With my life.

405
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:06,353
Then here's what I
need you to do.

406
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:18,282
We may have
another problem.

407
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:21,535
What now?
-I think my former Commander Karza

408
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,579
did more damage to my internal circuits

409
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:25,914
than I first thought.

410
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,375
What do you mean?
-My battery isn't holding

411
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,335
the power cells charge
very well.

412
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:32,421
I'm not going to be able
to conserve enough power

413
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:35,424
to activate your beacon when the
rescue ship arrives.

414
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:38,093
Shut down the other 
systems, draining power.

415
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:41,555
I have, but two main sources
left for my system's memory

416
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:44,725
and your medical unit. I'm
afraid you'll have to shut me down

417
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:46,727
until you need me, Centauri.

418
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:48,437
That's not happening.

419
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,063
Cut my meds.

420
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:53,192
I don't think 
that's a good idea.

421
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:54,735
Cut them.

422
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:58,280
Meds unit shutting down.

423
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:02,618
Your pain receptors
are spiking

424
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:06,288
and your heart rate is increasing. 
-I'm good.

425
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:08,498
That should give
us enough power

426
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:11,460
provided the ship
arrives at the designated time.

427
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,838
With our luck, I 
wouldn't count on it.

428
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,797
I picking ир communications from orbit. 
-Our pick up?

429
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:59,216
No, these aren't military channels.

430
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:01,134
An unknown craft is approaching.

431
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:03,637
Coming down here?
-Yes.

432
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:05,931
However my system can'ф
track it.

433
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:09,184
Try to reach them.

434
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:12,312
No response.

435
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:14,690
They've gone into
radio silence.

436
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:17,401
That can't be good.

437
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:19,987
Maybe some rendezvous
for the human.

438
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,864
Maybe he's not the last one.

439
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:25,576
Or they could be Draxians.

440
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:49,530
Great.

441
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:13,012
Hey!

442
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:21,587
What?

443
00:59:22,772 --> 00:59:29,244
What?

444
00:59:29,246 --> 00:59:36,911
Money?

445
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:40,998
Cydonians?
-Ha.

446
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:42,457
They're paying you.

447
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:44,960
You are bounty hunter.

448
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:48,547
That is such an ugly word.

449
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:53,051
Soldier of fortune
more like it.

450
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:57,097
Shame they want you be alive, ha!

451
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:02,769
Just as I thought.
Slyak.

452
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,022
What would a Slyak
be doing here?

453
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:06,481
Bounty hunter.

454
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:09,067
Alpha base must have 
sent him as back up.

455
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:09,735
Idiots.

456
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,322
Alpha base or the Slyaks? 
-Both.

457
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:14,740
What you going to do?

458
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,742
He's got my weapons
and my prisoner.

459
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:19,703
I'm gonna go get them back.

460
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:28,621
True your kind 
build world bomb?

461
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,423
Maybe.

462
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:35,636
True or lie?

463
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:39,139
True.

464
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,517
Deserve it they do.

465
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:44,770
Scare them good you do, ha?

466
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:49,650
You don't like Cydonians?
-No one like Cydonians.

467
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:53,838
Invade every planet, 
make slaves.

468
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:57,658
Their way or no way.

469
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:12,673
If I kill you,
they all die.

470
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:17,719
No more Cydonians.
-Wait. Remember?

471
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,762
I'm money.

472
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:21,974
You kill me, no money.

473
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:27,396
Maybe I take you
to ship first.

474
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:30,266
Talk with elders.

475
01:01:30,566 --> 01:01:33,944
Good idea.
Smart.

476
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:38,198
No! This bigger than 
money. I be hero.

477
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:41,243
No more Cydonians.
-No, wait.

478
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:07,978
You have no business 
here, Slyak!

479
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:14,109
That human is my prisoner.

480
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:21,950
He's mine.

481
01:02:48,919 --> 01:02:51,104
I don't think so.

482
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:16,491
Now what?

483
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:18,734
We wait.

484
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:21,428
For what?

485
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,789
Extraction.

486
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:26,241
Ship should be here soon.

487
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:34,541
What do they
call you, human?

488
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,752
What is your name?

489
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:37,794
Jericho.

490
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:39,296
Lieutenant Orin Jericho.

491
01:04:39,296 --> 01:04:40,339
Lieutenant?

492
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:43,133
We are the same rank.

493
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:45,135
I'm Centauri 7.

494
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:47,554
Didn't ask.

495
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:49,973
Not wise to upset me

496
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,934
considering your
position, human.

497
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:54,436
No wonder your
kind didn't make it.

498
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:56,897
No common sense.
-Oh is that the reason?

499
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:59,608
I thought it was your
genocidal war that did it.

500
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:02,402
War is war.
You lost.

501
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,446
As long I'm still alive,

502
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,865
the war ain't over.

503
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:11,203
You never did answer
my question.

504
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:15,040
How were you going to
destroy my planet?

505
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,083
Are.
-What?

506
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:18,877
You said were.
Past tense.

507
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:19,920
It's are.

508
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,882
All right. How are you 
going to destroy my planet?

509
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:25,926
We sent a ship
towards your planet.

510
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:28,637
Filled to capacity
with nuclear payload.

511
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,264
Once it impacts,

512
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:33,141
your world is
blown to dust.

513
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,146
Our long range scanners will detect
it far before reaches our atmos...

514
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,857
It's cloacked.

515
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:41,775
You'll never see it coming.

516
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:47,823
Another trick we picked
up from the Drax.

517
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:54,288
So, that's why they
want you alive.

518
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:58,709
They want to get the ships coordinates out of you. 
-They'll try.

519
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:01,545
But you'll die first.

520
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:03,589
That's right.

521
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:06,216
Well, then there's no
reason to keep you alive.

522
01:06:06,216 --> 01:06:09,970
I could kill you right now.
-You could.

523
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,889
But?
-Come on.

524
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:14,057
Everybody wants
to be a hero.

525
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,726
There's that one glimmer of hope

526
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:18,395
that you might be able 
to save your world.

527
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:20,397
I told you, I don't care.

528
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:22,024
They can go to
the twelve hells.

529
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:24,276
I don't believe you.

530
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:27,237
Centauri, I have an
incoming transmission.

531
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:29,072
Patch it through.

532
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,366
Commander Karza,
this is battle ship Aurora.

533
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:33,869
Do you copy?
-Copy that Aurora.

534
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,287
Commander Karza is dead.

535
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:38,165
This is Lieutenant Centauri 7
as acting commander.

536
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:39,708
Copy that, Lieutenant.

537
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,376
We have arrived at the
last known signal point

538
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,962
from Prometheus
before you went down.

539
01:06:43,962 --> 01:06:46,507
Awaiting beacon location.

540
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:49,384
Clea, activate personal beacon.

541
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:53,972
Signal initiated.
-Aurora, do you have it?

542
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:57,200
Affirmative. It's weak but we 
should be able to home in on it.

543
01:06:57,302 --> 01:07:01,855
We are now enroute. ETA in 15 minutes. 
-Roger that.

544
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:04,233
Centauri 7 out.

545
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:11,448
When we get back to Cydonia,

546
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:14,034
they're gonna torture you.

547
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:16,787
They'll get the
information they want.

548
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:19,414
You won't last.

549
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:24,253
The planet won't even be there
by the time we arrive. -That soon?

550
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:27,047
And all this?

551
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:29,800
Just a wild chase to give the 
ship the time it needed?

552
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,135
It'll get there long
before we do.

553
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,931
My planet's full of people
that are innocent.

554
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,224
They are not responsible 
for the war

555
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:39,059
or your planet's
destruction.

556
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:42,104
Our High Council is.
-You all follow blindly.

557
01:07:42,104 --> 01:07:43,647
It's no excuse.
-It's the law.

558
01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:45,649
What's the Gods
have decreed.

559
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:47,943
Your Gods are telling you
to wipe out entire worlds?

560
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:51,029
No, we spread our knowledge to 
the stars. To surrounding races.

561
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:52,489
By enslaving and 
destroying them?

562
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:56,034
They don't accept our
way of life, then yes.

563
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:58,036
You make me sick.

564
01:07:58,036 --> 01:08:01,623
This from a race that couldn't even 
defend themselves against each other.

565
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:03,500
Let alone an invading army.

566
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,587
Only an ignorant species would
war against it's own kind.

567
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:07,629
Shut up!

568
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:10,048
You command mass murder
on a galactic scale

569
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:11,508
and you think
it's holy crusade.

570
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:13,594
It is our way!

571
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:15,137
Unless someone
comes along

572
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:18,056
and takes control
away from them.

573
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:20,559
Your words, not mine.

574
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:22,477
That will never happen.

575
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:25,856
I wonder why.

576
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,625
You are right.

577
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,794
I do care
about my world.

578
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:54,009
I have wife and 
child there.

579
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:59,056
I would like to
see them again.

580
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:05,270
Our women don't fight.

581
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:08,065
They nurture
the children.

582
01:09:08,065 --> 01:09:12,528
Our soldiers
are up there.

583
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:15,072
As one warrior to another

584
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:19,868
I respectfully ask that you take
this war to those responsible.

585
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:26,959
You'll just be killing
women and children.

586
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:32,214
Is that what you want the
legacy of your kind to be?

587
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:49,565
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

588
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:54,403
Is that...
-It's where the ship is.

589
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:58,198
Call your people. I'll give
them the coordinates.

590
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:00,909
You better hurry. You 
don't have much time.

591
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:03,328
Clea? Patch me 
through to Alpha base.

592
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:05,330
Transmitting.

593
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,709
Alpha base, this is Lieutenant
Centauri 7. Do you copy?

594
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:11,003
Copy Lieutenant.
What is your status?

595
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:12,504
Prisoner is in custody and

596
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:15,549
willing to give the
coordinates of the bomb ship.

597
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,426
Lieutenant, we are ready for
the prisoners information.

598
01:10:17,509 --> 01:10:19,761
Please, relay 
it immediately.

599
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:21,972
What's the coordinates? 
-No.

600
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:25,851
I want to be the
one who tells them.

601
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:31,398
The coordinates are 22...
-Unauthorized user.

602
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,026
Clea, authorize the human.

603
01:10:34,026 --> 01:10:36,486
State your name.
-Orin Jericho.

604
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:39,239
Orin Jericho is now authorized.

605
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:46,997
The coordinates are 
229, 713, 040 bearing 2-6-0.

606
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:49,416
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

607
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:53,003
It's an M-class
star freighter.

608
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:01,845
We have confirmation.
Craft has been identified.

609
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:06,266
Sending battle ships to intercept. 
-We found it.

610
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:08,644
Well done, Lieutenant.

611
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:09,937
We no longer have
need of the prisoner.

612
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,689
You may terminate
at will.

613
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:16,068
Roger that.
Centauri 7 out.

614
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:27,704
They want me to
terminate you.

615
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:32,334
I saved your world.
Your family.

616
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:35,796
Not really.

617
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:38,340
I don't have any
wife and children.

618
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:45,472
That's good. Then you won't 
have anything to worry about

619
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:47,891
when your planet is
blown to bits.

620
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:50,269
You didn't think
I'd give you

621
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:51,979
the real coordinates,
did you?

622
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:53,522
But we have confirmation
on the craft.

623
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:55,524
It's a decoy,
you idiot.

624
01:11:55,524 --> 01:12:00,737
Unmanned. There is nothing
but salvage on that ship.

625
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:09,121
You can't stop this.

626
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:11,331
It's already over.

627
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:21,550
Superior race, huh?

628
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:24,553
Let me give you
some advice, alien.

629
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:29,474
Never let your weapon fall
into the hand of your enemy.

630
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:24,381
I'm gonna let you know
a little secret.

631
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:26,425
We never launched
the bomb ship.

632
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:27,676
We couldn't.

633
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:30,846
We had no idea
where Cydonia was.

634
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,308
But now that I'm authorized
to access you database,

635
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:37,060
she's gonna tell me
everything I need to know.

636
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:40,647
You think I forced us to crash
down here by accident?

637
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:42,608
You wanted the bomb ship?

638
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:44,818
I led you right to it.

639
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:51,116
Now, you're gonna learn
what it feels like

640
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:53,911
to be the last of your kind.

641
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:14,681
You want to know the
difference between you and me?

642
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:18,977
I did have a wife and
son back on the Earth.

643
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:33,325
Centauri 7, this 
is the Aurora.

644
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:35,369
We have just cleared 
the way

645
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:36,328
and entered the atmosphere.

646
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:40,123
Shuttle craft it's on it's
way down. Stand by.

647
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:03,981
Centauri 7, this is
Commander Chane

648
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:06,775
of the Aurora
landing party.

649
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:09,820
We're on the ground.

650
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:12,114
What is your status?

651
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:20,455
Centauri 7, are you picking
up my transmission?

652
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:24,626
Centauri 7,
do you copy?

653
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:44,855
The only one
that made it, ha?

654
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:50,944
You look like hell.

655
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:52,738
Must have been a rough one.

656
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:56,575
We'll get you to the
infirmary right away.

657
01:19:57,297 --> 01:20:00,175
Clea, upload the
coordinates to Cydonia

658
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:02,845
to the ship's nav computer.

659
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:06,390
Clea.

660
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:11,645
Clea, I command 
you to respond.

661
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:27,077
Son of a bitch.

662
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:14,249
Alpha base. This is
Omicron series 5.

663
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:16,543
Commander Chane is
no longer responsive.

664
01:21:24,885 --> 01:21:28,805
Start-up sequence complete.
Clea 19 series gamma on-line.

665
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:32,059
Hello, Centauri 7.
-Hello, Clea.

666
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:33,727
It's good to have you back.

667
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:36,146
I take it by
my new casing

668
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:38,065
that you followed
my instructions.

669
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:40,734
Well played. It 
was you he was after.

670
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:45,864
Centauri, I have an incoming
transmission from Alpha base.

671
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:48,158
Patch it through.

672
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:51,787
Lieutenant, this 
is Alpha base.

673
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:55,499
What the twelve hells
is going on down there?

674
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:57,084
If I were you,

675
01:21:57,084 --> 01:22:00,504
I'd be more concerned about 
what's going on up there.

676
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:02,673
Centauri 7, you
are under orders.

677
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:04,174
What is the status
of the human?

678
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:05,884
Find another grunt to
do your dirty work.

679
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:09,179
Centauri 7 out.
End of transmission.

680
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:15,018
Whatever you're planning 
to do, Centauri,

681
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:16,687
I suggest you to
do it quickly.

682
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:18,605
It won't be long before
the human traces

683
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:21,400
the source of that
signal back to Cydonia.

684
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:25,279
He already has.

685
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:27,739
Isn't that right, earthman?

686
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:31,952
You didn't shoot. Why?

687
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:33,954
Same reason you
didn't kill me.

688
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:38,083
Yeah, what's that?

689
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:41,461
I'll tell you
when I see you.

690
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:49,845
And just how are we supposed
to get out of here?

691
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:52,181
Bounty hunter ship has to
be around here somewhere.

692
01:22:52,181 --> 01:22:54,850
You realize we'll be breaking
26 High Council's laws

693
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,394
by taking this
course of action.

694
01:22:57,394 --> 01:23:00,397
Is that a problem?
-Not at all.

695
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:03,901
Let's get the twelve
hells off this rock.
