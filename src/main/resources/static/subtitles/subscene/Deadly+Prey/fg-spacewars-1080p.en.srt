1
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,167
Sir?

2
00:02:08,206 --> 00:02:10,907
Sir, can you hear me?

3
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:14,672
He's alive!

4
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,045
Get your ass back here.
Take some cover.

5
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,075
Don't have time
to take a nap.

6
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,483
The prisoner escaped
before we covered.

7
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,799
I think he took a rifle.
He went over there...

8
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,827
Rifle.

9
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:06,868
Any signs?
-Negative.

10
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:27,016
Starting sequence complete.

11
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:30,808
Clea 19, on line.
Hello, commander Karza.

12
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,390
Now, Clea, activate
system link.

13
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:36,979
System is link. -You got
guys on line? -Check.

14
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,983
Check. -Clea, patch
me in the base.

15
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:43,131
Transmitting.

16
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:47,341
Alpha base, this is Commander
Karza. Do you copy?

17
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,029
Copy, Commander.
This is Alpha base.

18
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:53,197
Prometheus is down.
I repeat, Prometheus is down.

19
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,948
We have three survivors
and need immediately instructions.

20
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,813
Without pick in up
the ship's biken.

21
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:02,707
Ship biken is not functional.

22
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:05,918
We need your coordinates.

23
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:09,474
I.T.A. in 10 hours.

24
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:12,267
All alive need to activate
your personal biken.

25
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:16,443
Copy that. -What is the
status of your cargo?

26
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,737
Cargo has survived
and left crash side.

27
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:22,972
Commander, mission
parameter is remaining.

28
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,400
Organism must be delivered.

29
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:28,588
And Karzo, it imperative
that you bring him alive.

30
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,123
Is that understood?

31
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:33,924
Commander, do you copy?

32
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:38,255
Yeah, roger that.
Karzo out.

33
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:41,644
End transmission.
-Thanks for the help.

34
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:43,947
What else is new?
-Enough.

35
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,567
This mission has been
joke from the start.

36
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:48,595
You think that is joke that
we lost our ship and our crew?

37
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,817
Your prisoner brought my
men down single handed.

38
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,958
And you couldn't do it
damn thing to stop it.

39
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:59,141
I don't see anything funny
about that. Do you soldier?

40
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:01,910
No, sir.
-Good.

41
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:04,779
Now, Clea, speak with
the Lieutenant.

42
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:08,169
Hello, Centauri 7.
Oh, you are hurt.

43
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,031
Yeah, give me diagnostic.

44
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:15,436
Serious some stenches trauma
to your left shoulder.

45
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:19,298
No broken bones.
Heart beat is elevated.

46
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:22,420
Otherwise you should be
in excellent condition.

47
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:24,447
Clea, skip
trace improvement.

48
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,018
Activating tracking system.

49
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,297
Redirecting cells to repairing
nerve and tissue damage.

50
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,458
Increasing endorphins
to counter pain.

51
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,740
Better.

52
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:44,131
The subject is 250 meters
southeast from your position

53
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:46,132
and moving away
as steady range.

54
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,669
Are you sure
he's moving away?

55
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:50,977
Yes, Commander.
-We on the move and set out.

56
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,806
We need supplies.

57
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,513
How much left?
-We'll take Logan's pack.

58
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:04,013
Clea, any idea
where we are?

59
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,036
Planet is on charged.

60
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:09,735
Computer shows you on
unknown set of coordinates.

61
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:12,751
Gravity to that
planet is the rest.

62
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,873
Give us the status.

63
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,464
Atmosphere is tin.

64
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,386
Likely surrenders have
been unconscious.

65
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,653
My advice, keeping
your helmets on it

66
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,251
to until I finished
activating your bodies.

67
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:24,774
Surface's temperature
is 116 degrees. -Nice.

68
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:27,197
Going cells are
in 72 percent,

69
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:29,930
which can last just
about 100 hours.

70
00:06:30,044 --> 00:06:31,566
Anything else?

71
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,507
Calculating the
position of the sun.

72
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:36,791
I estimated 34
hours of day light

73
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:37,928
with 5 hours of night.

74
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:41,306
Sound like a paradise.
Maybe I'll move here.

75
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,081
I can't wait on that.

76
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:48,575
I'm sure you could, sir.

77
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:03,096
According to Clea, it will be
mess to get this thing.

78
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,143
Let's move out.

79
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:24,753
Clea, give me a torch.

80
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,571
What you'll gonna do?

81
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:36,953
Weld it act together?

82
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:55,634
He's on the move
again. Let's go.

83
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:58,607
On your feet.

84
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:02,552
This is brutal.

85
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,416
I don't understand
how those thing

86
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:06,979
can move so fast
on this heat. -Simple.

87
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:10,305
If he wants to live,
pure survival instinct.

88
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,223
What's the rush?
He gets no food, no water.

89
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:14,982
We can track every
move he makes.

90
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:16,938
Let him die first.

91
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,581
There no be a
needs to recovery.

92
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,777
You heard them.
They want it alive.

93
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:25,606
Why? -Is not your place to
question orders, Lieutenant.

94
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:28,814
It is when accosting me
the lifes of my men.

95
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:30,821
This should be a simple
transport mission.

96
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,671
Are you done crying, soldier?

97
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,615
Get lost.

98
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,115
May it up and move out.

99
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:45,934
Both of you.

100
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:12,794
Closing in on subject.
Sublimate press air increasing.

101
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,898
There!

102
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,422
Where is it?

103
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:29,247
Up on the ridge.
8 o'clock.

104
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:36,274
Look like we can get up
on a north side.

105
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:39,470
Grab his rifle.
I will cover you.

106
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:42,396
Go!

107
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,870
I see it.
-Shut him.

108
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,660
It won't alive.

109
00:12:56,724 --> 00:13:00,381
I'm in command now.
Take it down.

110
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:05,468
Target lock.
-Take the shoot.

111
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,315
Down.

112
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,583
Hold the position.

113
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:13,725
It's secure.
I got it.

114
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:15,899
I said hold position.
I coming up.

115
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,614
It's nothing here
but his cloak.

116
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:30,305
Fall back!
Fall back!

117
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:55,453
Clea?

118
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:58,807
Clea?

119
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:31,232
I thought you are dead.
-You are not that lucky.

120
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,519
Where is my rifle?

121
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:36,446
Ask Tursai.

122
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,844
Night is falling.

123
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,115
Let's the place
to set up camp.

124
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,521
Hard to take the ground.
Only to access points.

125
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,253
I still can catch him.

126
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:47,333
If you need the rest,
you stay here and I'll...

127
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,114
Why do you think
that I want to hear

128
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:52,252
your opinion soldier?
I don't.

129
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:57,360
He was to green. He would
never set in any unit.

130
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,318
He wasn't the one
who rush us into the ambush.

131
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,215
The situation that determine
outcome, Lieutenant.

132
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,203
Components
and the skill do.

133
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:09,516
Unfortunately, your team
wasn't good enough for those trick.

134
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:12,009
Now, make
yourself useful

135
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,938
and set up parameter
around those rocks over there.

136
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:20,293
You have your orders.

137
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:32,623
43 degrees and dropping.

138
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:45,402
Private channel's open it.

139
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,070
What's the Commander's
condition?

140
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:51,011
He's suffering from a
plasma wound to his side.

141
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,856
Extreme nerve
damage has been

142
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:57,508
sustained on his
left long izenteret.

143
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,845
What meds you got him on?

144
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:04,742
500 CC sustrofin
and 250 CC for crioksen.

145
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,802
Don't surprise he stayed on
his feet as long as he did.

146
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:10,846
Reduce his medication.

147
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:12,039
We have a long way
to travel tomorrow

148
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:13,752
and I am not to
carry him.

149
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,381
I'm not sure if
Commander Karzo

150
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,356
would agree with
your assessment.

151
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,841
Keep the information on fly.

152
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,545
He doesn't need to know.

153
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:23,519
It is not in my programming
to lie, Lieutenant.

154
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:26,689
You want be lying,
you just not share information.

155
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,479
Can you do that?
-Of, course.

156
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,258
Thanks.

157
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,751
Odd.
-What's that?

158
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:36,326
You have been from all the soldier
that I have been a signed to

159
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:39,993
you are the only one
that's he ever thank me.

160
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:42,343
Do you mind it?
-No.

161
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,949
I quite preferred.

162
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:47,773
Isn't get tirelessness been
endless it worried about.

163
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,874
We have in
common then.

164
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:54,938
You must work compliant
with the military directed, Centauri.

165
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,011
So, I been told.

166
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:00,355
According to your record

167
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:02,615
some of yours
previous inseportinations

168
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:07,018
border it dangerously
close to treason. -And?

169
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:11,373
It's a question, why you
chosen to be a soldier?

170
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:15,259
It is does, doesn't it?

171
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:48,049
Atmosphere conditioning will
be completed in 10 seconds.

172
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:52,265
I advise you to keep yours
eyes more on objective

173
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:55,664
instead of me, Lieutenant.

174
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:58,299
Atmospheric adaptation
is complete.

175
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:03,003
It is now safe to
remove your helmets.

176
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:13,493
Why is the prisoner
not effected on tin air?

177
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,486
He doesn't
wear the life suit.

178
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:17,794
They can adapt to
almost any conditions.

179
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,462
All this was in the file.

180
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:24,186
Permission to
speak freely, sir?

181
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:27,177
Permission?
It never stop you before.

182
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:28,940
Go ahead.

183
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:31,173
What's the special really?

184
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:32,548
Why is that thing
so important?

185
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:35,021
Does it matter?
-Yes, it does.

186
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:38,016
Why? -I lost my ship
and my crew.

187
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,125
I would like to know why.
-You are a soldier.

188
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:43,087
We both are.
We follow orders

189
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,203
without questions.

190
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:53,491
Tell me what you know

191
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:56,120
otherwise I go alone.

192
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:58,599
Disobey orders is
a treason, soldier.

193
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:01,401
Punishment by death.

194
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:20,081
All right. This thing is
the last of his kind.

195
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,737
We destroyed
his home world

196
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,965
and now somehow figure
we return the favor.

197
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,455
So, we'll catch it that thing
and get it back to the base.

198
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,262
We made a world
to go home too.

199
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:31,364
Now you know
what's I do.

200
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,668
Is that you make
feel better, soldier?

201
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:37,042
Sit down and discuss when some
wild thing is around on us.

202
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:39,634
You delivery to kept
us in the dark.

203
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,395
You did need to know.
-I see.

204
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,904
This mission
was a hero maker.

205
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,513
Everything we know
was at risk.

206
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:50,777
Are you deaf
as you stupid?

207
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,982
What level was
this mission?

208
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:54,508
This discussion is over.

209
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,543
What level was
this mission, sir?

210
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,938
41. Nobel class.
-Highest level.

211
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:04,919
And you was so
with your ego

212
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:07,694
you didn't badger to tell us
how danger the creature was.

213
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:09,839
Your men were
incompetent.

214
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:11,890
Don't blame me
for your mistakes.

215
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:13,805
You jeopardized this mission.

216
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:15,648
You got my verscio.

217
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,989
I'm your superior officer

218
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:20,293
and you speak
to me as such.

219
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:21,905
Why?

220
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,064
You don't deserve it.

221
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:48,440
Let's see what
fight you got in.

222
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:52,752
You are no worth it.

223
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:27,660
Clea? What's the
present position?

224
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:29,836
I had no visual.

225
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,738
Clea?

226
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:35,946
Clea?

227
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,144
Come on.

228
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:25,217
Come on, baby.

229
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:27,528
Don't live me alone now.

230
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,924
Starting sequence complete.

231
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:34,120
Clea 19 on line.
Hello, Centauri 7.

232
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:35,296
Clea.

233
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:37,542
I thought I lost you there.
-You cant to get rid of

234
00:23:37,637 --> 00:23:38,879
me so easily, Centauri.

235
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,878
I suffered some damage but
seems to be function in properly.

236
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm quite adorable,
you know.

237
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:46,518
That's why keep
you out, babe.

238
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:50,248
I thought that was my
charming personality.

239
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:57,950
Clea. What's the
prison location?

240
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:01,565
78 and increasing.

241
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,077
Look likes just
you and me now.

242
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,317
I'm sorry about
Commander Karza

243
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,321
but if I must
say I'm pleased

244
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,163
that it was you
who survived.

245
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:19,364
Well, that makes two of us.

246
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:33,706
Keep trace prisoner.

247
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:36,469
200 microcliks on
your current location.

248
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:40,390
Continuing in south
eastern direction.

249
00:24:40,553 --> 00:24:43,135
On the move again.

250
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,040
I hope you'll rot, sir.

251
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:16,329
It's been moving on a
steady pace for hours.

252
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:19,423
Hopefully the damn
things collapse it.

253
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:22,844
Without the water source it could
be coming to dehydration.

254
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:25,719
Exactly.

255
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:31,168
Still...

256
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,578
I'm going in.

257
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:38,425
Report me any movement.
-Of course.

258
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:42,565
Be careful, Centauri.

259
00:26:57,518 --> 00:26:59,651
I get it.

260
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,008
Clea, my grid?

261
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:08,049
What is it, Centauri?

262
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:10,128
It's the tracking device.

263
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:12,873
Tear out from it's
own throat.

264
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:15,189
Very clever.

265
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,297
He can't go far.

266
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:19,534
He cannot brag.

267
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:21,616
Do you hear me?

268
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,120
I bringing you in.

269
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:29,435
Dead or alive.

270
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:49,452
Centauri?
Are you all right?

271
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,772
Centauri 7?
Please answer.

272
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:25,721
Clea?

273
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,718
Which the time would be?

274
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:30,531
How long I have been out?

275
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,496
Clea?

276
00:35:31,918 --> 00:35:33,634
The head.

277
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:38,641
I had to kick the head.

278
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:28,409
Pull on that.

279
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,487
Hello?

280
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:51,703
Unknown user,
please identify.

281
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,391
Repeat, identify.

282
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:58,222
Identify.

283
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:00,049
Horn Jericho.

284
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:04,433
Un authorized user.
Terminating access.

285
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:41,223
Private channel,
open it. -Clea?

286
00:38:42,876 --> 00:38:44,884
Where are you?
-I'm not sure.

287
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:48,821
I'm in the possession
un authorized user.

288
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:55,885
Can you give me a signal
of his location? -Of course.

289
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:03,367
Got it.

290
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:04,964
He tried to access me

291
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,405
but I terminated
the communication.

292
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:09,586
It's spoke to you?
-Yes.

293
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:11,580
And it's understood you.
-Yes.

294
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:13,752
This damn thing is more
smart then I thought.

295
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:15,637
Keep that signal going.
Still on the private channel.

296
00:39:15,715 --> 00:39:17,871
I'm on my way.

297
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:14,025
Clea?

298
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,336
Clea?

299
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:18,854
She won't be helping
you anymore.

300
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:24,950
We can't get out from
this planet without her.

301
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:30,714
How I do use her?
-You can't.

302
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:34,344
And if you have her

303
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,437
you still be stuck on this
flooring rock as well.

304
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:39,044
You get no way to go.

305
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:42,570
Maybe I not
plan on go anywhere.

306
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:46,370
If you want a die

307
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:50,010
kill yourself now and
save me the trouble.

308
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:52,852
What if I want to
take you with me?

309
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:57,315
You do then done already.

310
00:40:57,513 --> 00:41:00,936
You are not dumb
as you look.

311
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:04,117
What's it you want?

312
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:14,716
I know you
can still hear me.

313
00:41:14,996 --> 00:41:17,768
You are playing games?

314
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:20,426
Well, here is mine.

315
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:23,305
I know why they
want you brought in.

316
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:26,749
And I don't care.

317
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:31,081
I'm gonna hunt you down
and I wanna kill you.

318
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:34,565
That's my game.

319
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:26,580
Give up, Sedonian.

320
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:29,672
You will never catch me.

321
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:35,329
You been out smart
enough to run.

322
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,867
Go home.

323
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,099
Why you still got a
home to go back to.

324
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,265
I know something new
I hate about your race.

325
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:05,123
You packed not enough water.

326
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:09,450
Because that's more
human thing.

327
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,608
Always be prepare it.

328
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:18,662
I'm actually surprise you
last as long you have.

329
00:48:18,894 --> 00:48:22,409
Seem how incompetent you are.

330
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,771
Now I know why they put
that helmet mask on you.

331
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:29,123
You talk too much.

332
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:32,184
They you want to know
if I can speak your language.

333
00:48:32,302 --> 00:48:34,369
You are right.

334
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:36,557
It's a good for
somebody like you

335
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,185
to speak the language
of the stars.

336
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:40,999
Something we pick it
up from the Draks.

337
00:48:44,668 --> 00:48:47,514
Draks are noble race.

338
00:48:47,637 --> 00:48:49,201
You don't know
anything about that.

339
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:50,332
Nobel?

340
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:53,769
They are disease on a
galaxy, filthy creatures.

341
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:55,671
That's funny.

342
00:48:55,747 --> 00:48:58,387
They say the same
thing about you.

343
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:01,649
Lying bugs.

344
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:03,962
I tell you this

345
00:49:04,048 --> 00:49:06,608
no one miss you guys
when you gone.

346
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:10,112
Your the race is in extinct,
human, not mine.

347
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,765
Not so long.

348
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:14,084
Is that so?
-Yap.

349
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:16,626
I taken yours to hell.

350
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:20,147
I hold your fenecy, human.

351
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,359
Been that you
last of your kind

352
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,614
how do you hope to
accomplish this remarkable fit?

353
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:26,941
Don't you know why?
-I don't care.

354
00:49:27,037 --> 00:49:28,903
That's why.

355
00:49:28,984 --> 00:49:31,112
You want this war
on your advent

356
00:49:31,204 --> 00:49:32,880
and lost your home world.

357
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:35,717
Those the consequence.
-We didn't enter this war.

358
00:49:35,836 --> 00:49:36,964
You attacked us.

359
00:49:37,014 --> 00:49:39,664
You were harboring Draks fugitives.
-You mean refugees.

360
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:42,251
Big difference.
They need our help.

361
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:44,557
You choose the wrong side.

362
00:49:44,652 --> 00:49:46,645
No.

363
00:49:46,731 --> 00:49:49,431
It's cost us everything
but we chose the right side.

364
00:49:49,548 --> 00:49:53,507
Now, it's gonna cost
you everything.

365
00:49:54,047 --> 00:49:57,634
We all die.
That's your solution.

366
00:49:57,788 --> 00:50:00,228
How can you
been so naive?

367
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,527
Another pack will
ride on our place.

368
00:50:02,622 --> 00:50:04,329
An endless cycle.

369
00:50:04,403 --> 00:50:06,405
The only way to brake it

370
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:09,021
is to take control from
those with power

371
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,253
to rule them instead.

372
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:15,683
You thought about this?
-No.

373
00:50:15,784 --> 00:50:18,924
It's the way it is.

374
00:50:21,173 --> 00:50:23,092
Maybe you are right.

375
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,056
Human.

376
00:50:28,143 --> 00:50:29,925
You have two options.

377
00:50:30,002 --> 00:50:32,106
You can come with
me and survive

378
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:35,300
or you can join to the rest
of your race in oblivion.

379
00:50:35,434 --> 00:50:37,582
It's your decision.

380
00:50:37,674 --> 00:50:39,947
I'd choose option
number three.

381
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:42,258
What is what?

382
00:52:12,182 --> 00:52:13,913
Clea?

383
00:52:14,274 --> 00:52:16,309
Clea? Are you there?

384
00:52:16,396 --> 00:52:19,132
Centauri 7?
-Yeah, it's me.

385
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,267
Has the human
then recaptured? -No.

386
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:24,932
Then have you
do retrieve me?

387
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,367
Radio sit it
on the skeleton.

388
00:52:27,468 --> 00:52:29,505
Why he live it behind?

389
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:33,811
Odd, that creature
is kind it dangerously so.

390
00:52:33,992 --> 00:52:35,734
Like he figured something else.

391
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:38,458
But what is he doing?

392
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,730
I missing something.

393
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:43,607
I wonder...
-Wonder what?

394
00:52:44,317 --> 00:52:45,627
Clea?

395
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:48,667
Centauri, I may know
what the human is doing.

396
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:50,380
Great, tell me.

397
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:53,656
It would be better
if I didn't. -Why is that?

398
00:52:53,794 --> 00:52:57,257
If you know it might
influence your actions.

399
00:52:57,406 --> 00:52:58,887
I don't...
What?

400
00:52:58,951 --> 00:53:02,529
Do you trust me, Centauri?
-With my life.

401
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:05,869
And here I do
need you to do.

402
00:53:15,511 --> 00:53:17,833
We may have
another problem.

403
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:21,070
What now?
-I think my forward

404
00:53:21,205 --> 00:53:23,254
Commander Karza did more
damage to my entire circle

405
00:53:23,342 --> 00:53:25,469
then I first thought.

406
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:27,915
What you mean?
-My battery isn't holding

407
00:53:28,017 --> 00:53:29,932
the power cells
charge very well.

408
00:53:30,014 --> 00:53:31,987
I'm not going to be able
to conserve enough power

409
00:53:32,073 --> 00:53:34,943
to activate your biken when the
rescue mission will arrive.

410
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:37,641
Shut down the other system
restraining power.

411
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:41,062
I have but two main resources
left from my system’s memory

412
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:44,251
and your medical unit I'm
afraid you have to shutting down

413
00:53:44,382 --> 00:53:46,315
to until you'll
need me, Centauri.

414
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:48,026
That's not happened.

415
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:49,660
Cut my meds.

416
00:53:50,048 --> 00:53:52,723
I don't think that
is a good idea.

417
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:54,341
Cut them.

418
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:57,814
Meds unit is shutting down.

419
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:02,196
Your pain receptor
the spank in

420
00:54:02,278 --> 00:54:05,786
and your heart break
is increasing. -I'm good.

421
00:54:05,936 --> 00:54:08,082
Meds should give
us enough power

422
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:10,992
provided when will ship
arrived for designated time.

423
00:54:11,113 --> 00:54:14,358
With little luck
I'll get on him.

424
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,290
I picking a communications
from orbit. -Our pick up?

425
00:54:56,449 --> 00:54:58,792
No, this is art
military channel

426
00:54:58,893 --> 00:55:00,710
and unknown craft
is approaching.

427
00:55:00,788 --> 00:55:03,195
They could come
down here? -Yes.

428
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,481
But my system can
track it.

429
00:55:06,717 --> 00:55:08,741
Try raise them.

430
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:11,916
No respond.

431
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:14,250
They got it to
the radio silence.

432
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:16,954
It can't be good.

433
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,552
Maybe some randeu
wous with the human.

434
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,445
Maybe is not the last one.

435
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,075
Or they could be Draks.

436
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:49,085
Great.

437
00:59:11,317 --> 00:59:13,559
Hey!

438
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,754
What?

439
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,038
What?

440
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:37,484
Money?

441
00:59:38,383 --> 00:59:40,541
Sadonians?

442
00:59:40,634 --> 00:59:42,062
They are paying you.

443
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:44,497
You are bounty hunter.

444
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:48,058
That is such an ugly word.

445
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,531
Soldier of fortune
more like it.

446
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:56,590
They want you been alive, ha?

447
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:02,313
Just as I thought.
Slyeck.

448
01:00:02,653 --> 01:00:04,574
What would the Slyeck
be doing here?

449
01:00:04,657 --> 01:00:06,086
Bounty hunter.

450
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:08,605
Alpha base must he send
him like a back up.

451
01:00:08,711 --> 01:00:09,569
It is.

452
01:00:09,755 --> 01:00:12,830
Alpha base or
the Slyeck? -Both.

453
01:00:12,962 --> 01:00:14,345
What you going to do?

454
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:16,288
He's got my weapons
and my prisoner.

455
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:19,216
I gonna go get them back.

456
01:00:25,098 --> 01:00:28,428
True your kind will
world wound?

457
01:00:29,306 --> 01:00:31,015
Maybe.

458
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:35,168
True or lie?

459
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,720
True.

460
01:00:39,279 --> 01:00:41,071
Deserve it they do.

461
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:44,287
Scare them good you do, a?

462
01:00:44,587 --> 01:00:49,121
You like Sadonians?
-No one like Sadonians.

463
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:53,704
The way where we
planet make slaves.

464
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:57,150
There way or no way.

465
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,106
If I kill you
they all die.

466
01:01:12,338 --> 01:01:17,154
No more Sadonians.
-Wait. Remember?

467
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:18,361
I'm money.

468
01:01:18,404 --> 01:01:21,474
You kill me, no money.

469
01:01:24,102 --> 01:01:26,910
Maybe I'll take you
to the ship first.

470
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,073
Talk with elders.

471
01:01:30,204 --> 01:01:33,432
Good idea.
Smart.

472
01:01:33,663 --> 01:01:37,681
No! Fuck that money.
I'll be hero.

473
01:01:37,853 --> 01:01:40,746
No more Sadonians.
-No, wait.

474
01:02:04,903 --> 01:02:07,497
You have your
business here, Slyeck?

475
01:02:11,634 --> 01:02:13,663
That human is my prisoner.

476
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,494
He's mine.

477
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:50,629
I don't think so.

478
01:04:14,672 --> 01:04:16,742
Now what?

479
01:04:16,832 --> 01:04:18,299
We wait.

480
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:21,089
On what?

481
01:04:21,193 --> 01:04:23,547
Extraction.

482
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,782
Ship should be here soon.

483
01:04:31,928 --> 01:04:34,078
What did they
call you, human?

484
01:04:34,255 --> 01:04:36,312
What is your name?

485
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,400
Jericho.

486
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:38,862
Lieutenant Orn Jericho.

487
01:04:38,924 --> 01:04:39,924
Lieutenant?

488
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:42,670
We are the same right.

489
01:04:43,122 --> 01:04:44,701
I'm Centauri 7.

490
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:47,093
I didn't ask.

491
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,523
Not wise to upset me

492
01:04:49,607 --> 01:04:51,488
consider on your
position, human.

493
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:53,972
No wonder your
kind didn't make it.

494
01:04:54,076 --> 01:04:56,416
No common sense.
-Was that a reason?

495
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:59,121
I thought was you
genocide war to did it.

496
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:01,942
War is war.
You lost.

497
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:03,994
As long I'm still alive

498
01:05:04,077 --> 01:05:06,384
the war ain't over.

499
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,741
You never did answer
to my question.

500
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,594
How were you going to
destroy my planet?

501
01:05:14,698 --> 01:05:15,698
Are. -What?

502
01:05:15,742 --> 01:05:18,413
You said were.
Past tense.

503
01:05:18,529 --> 01:05:19,529
It's are.

504
01:05:19,572 --> 01:05:23,361
All right. How are you going
to destroy my planet?

505
01:05:23,524 --> 01:05:25,490
We sent as ship
towards your planet

506
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:28,359
feel the capacity
with the filmpejlo.

507
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,830
When's the impact

508
01:05:29,895 --> 01:05:32,678
your world is
blowing to dust.

509
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:37,744
How long range will detective
harbor before reaches...

510
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:39,430
Is clocked.

511
01:05:39,499 --> 01:05:41,336
You will never see it coming.

512
01:05:43,002 --> 01:05:47,297
Another trick we pick
it up from the Draks.

513
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:53,767
So, that's why they
want you alive.

514
01:05:54,531 --> 01:05:58,182
They want to get the ship
coordinates out of you. -They'll try.

515
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:01,095
But you'll die first.

516
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:03,157
That's right.

517
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:05,731
Well, no then is no
reason to keep you alive.

518
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:09,450
I can kill you right now.
-You could.

519
01:06:09,605 --> 01:06:11,461
But?
-Come on.

520
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:13,608
Everybody wants
to be a hero.

521
01:06:13,697 --> 01:06:15,295
It's a one glimmer hope

522
01:06:15,365 --> 01:06:17,905
that you might be
a savior world.

523
01:06:18,014 --> 01:06:19,946
I told you, I don't care.

524
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:21,582
They can go to
the twelve hells.

525
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:23,829
I don't believe you.

526
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:26,752
Centauri, I have
incoming transmission.

527
01:06:26,874 --> 01:06:28,627
Patch it through.

528
01:06:28,702 --> 01:06:30,887
Commander Karzo,
this is battle ship Aurora.

529
01:06:30,982 --> 01:06:33,384
Do you copy?
-Copy that Aurora.

530
01:06:33,487 --> 01:06:34,849
Karzo is dead.

531
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,681
This is Lieutenant Centauri 7
as acting commander.

532
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:39,263
Copy that, Lieutenant.

533
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:41,040
We'll arrived in the
last known signal point

534
01:06:41,114 --> 01:06:43,510
from Prometheus
before you went down.

535
01:06:43,614 --> 01:06:46,022
We waiting on bipen location.

536
01:06:46,126 --> 01:06:48,903
Clea, activate personal biken.

537
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:53,450
Signal ineshiated.
-Aurora, you have it?

538
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:57,229
Affirmative. It's weak
but we should be able to find.

539
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:01,342
ITA in 15 minutes.
-Roger that.

540
01:07:01,477 --> 01:07:03,769
Centauri 7 out.

541
01:07:08,082 --> 01:07:10,943
When we get back to Sedonia

542
01:07:11,066 --> 01:07:13,576
they gonna torture you.

543
01:07:13,684 --> 01:07:16,304
They will get the
information they want.

544
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:18,926
You won't last.

545
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:23,695
The plan we won't be there
by the time we arrived. -That soon?

546
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:26,587
And all this?

547
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:29,302
The wild chase to give ship
the time you need it?

548
01:07:29,415 --> 01:07:31,667
Get the long
before we'll do.

549
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:35,465
Why plans full of people
they are innocent?

550
01:07:35,578 --> 01:07:36,890
They are not
responsible for the war

551
01:07:36,947 --> 01:07:38,609
or your planet
destruction?

552
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:41,601
The high counsel is.
-You all fall of blindly.

553
01:07:41,727 --> 01:07:43,200
It's no excuse.
-It's the law.

554
01:07:43,264 --> 01:07:45,219
What's the God
that you creed?

555
01:07:45,303 --> 01:07:47,466
Your Gods would telling me
the way to entire world?

556
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,517
No, we split out on different
stars and surrounding races.

557
01:07:50,644 --> 01:07:52,044
By slaving
and destroying now.

558
01:07:52,105 --> 01:07:55,520
They don't accept our
way of life then yes.

559
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:57,582
You make me sick.

560
01:07:57,664 --> 01:08:01,094
This from the race that couldn't
defend them self get it other.

561
01:08:01,242 --> 01:08:03,071
Let lonely and
beating the army.

562
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,082
Only an ignorant species will
make war against own kind.

563
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,208
Shut up!

564
01:08:07,252 --> 01:08:09,562
You command mass murder
on a galactic scale

565
01:08:09,661 --> 01:08:11,085
and you think
it's holly crusade.

566
01:08:11,147 --> 01:08:13,138
This is a lie!

567
01:08:13,224 --> 01:08:14,723
Unless some
come as a long

568
01:08:14,788 --> 01:08:17,565
and takes away
control from you.

569
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:20,071
Your words, not mine.

570
01:08:20,173 --> 01:08:22,011
That will never happened.

571
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:25,370
I wonder why.

572
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:44,168
You are right.

573
01:08:44,252 --> 01:08:47,289
I do care
about my world.

574
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:53,514
I have wife
and child there.

575
01:08:55,348 --> 01:08:58,549
I would like to
see them again.

576
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:04,785
Our women don't fight.

577
01:09:04,896 --> 01:09:07,563
They care about
the children.

578
01:09:07,678 --> 01:09:11,974
Our soldiers
are up there.

579
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,593
As one warrior to another

580
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:19,308
I respectfully ask that you take
this war to those responsible.

581
01:09:23,778 --> 01:09:26,488
You'll just be killing
the women and children.

582
01:09:26,604 --> 01:09:31,610
Is that what you want a
legacy of your kind to be?

583
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:49,088
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

584
01:09:50,976 --> 01:09:53,920
Is that...
-Where the ship is.

585
01:09:54,046 --> 01:09:57,666
Call your people. I'll give
them the coordinates.

586
01:09:57,822 --> 01:10:00,430
You better hurry.
You don't have much time.

587
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:02,861
Clea? Patch me to
the Alpha base.

588
01:10:02,961 --> 01:10:04,857
Transmitting.

589
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:08,194
Alpha base, this is Lieutenant
Centauri 7. Do you copy?

590
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:10,547
Copy Lieutenant.
What is your status?

591
01:10:10,643 --> 01:10:12,069
The prisoner is in custody

592
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:15,061
and willing to give
coordinates of the bomb ship.

593
01:10:15,223 --> 01:10:17,060
Lieutenant, we are ready to
get the information.

594
01:10:17,139 --> 01:10:19,306
Please, sent to us
immediately.

595
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,502
What's the
coordinates? -No.

596
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:25,320
I want to be the
one who tells them.

597
01:10:27,437 --> 01:10:30,899
The coordinates are 22...
-Non authorized user.

598
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:33,539
Clea, authorized the human.

599
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,032
Stage your name.
-Orn Jericho.

600
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:38,757
Orn Jericho’s now authorized.

601
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:46,323
The coordinates are 22- 9,
7-13, 0-40, 2-6-0.

602
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,964
Vega sector, gamma quadrant.

603
01:10:49,064 --> 01:10:52,474
It's an M-class
star frigate.

604
01:10:58,176 --> 01:11:01,332
We have confirmation
the ship does identify.

605
01:11:01,468 --> 01:11:05,720
Sending Bell ship to
intercept. -We found it.

606
01:11:06,806 --> 01:11:08,197
Well done, Lieutenant.

607
01:11:08,257 --> 01:11:09,570
We no longer
need the prisoner.

608
01:11:09,627 --> 01:11:12,206
You may terminated
him at will.

609
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:15,568
Roger that.
Centauri 7 out.

610
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,252
They want me that
terminated you.

611
01:11:27,343 --> 01:11:31,762
I saved your world.
Your family.

612
01:11:33,885 --> 01:11:35,364
Not really.

613
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:37,870
I don't have any
wife and children.

614
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:44,962
That's good and you won't have
anything to worried about

615
01:11:45,085 --> 01:11:47,426
when your planet
blowing on bits.

616
01:11:48,546 --> 01:11:49,833
You didn't think
that I give you

617
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,551
the real coordinates,
did you?

618
01:11:51,623 --> 01:11:53,086
We have confirmation
on the craft.

619
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,065
It's a decoy,
you idiot.

620
01:11:55,147 --> 01:12:00,168
No men. There is nothing
but salvage on that ship.

621
01:12:06,629 --> 01:12:08,665
You can't stop this.

622
01:12:08,753 --> 01:12:10,883
It's already over.

623
01:12:18,724 --> 01:12:21,072
Superior race, ha?

624
01:12:21,526 --> 01:12:24,052
I'm giving you
some advice, alien.

625
01:12:25,624 --> 01:12:28,949
Never let your weapon forward
in the hand of your enemy.

626
01:14:21,314 --> 01:14:23,880
I'm gonna let you in
our little secret.

627
01:14:23,991 --> 01:14:25,945
We never lunch
the bomb ship.

628
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:27,260
We couldn't.

629
01:14:27,534 --> 01:14:30,363
We've no idea
where the Sadonia was.

630
01:14:31,309 --> 01:14:33,822
But now that I'm authorized
the access you date a base

631
01:14:33,931 --> 01:14:36,564
she's gonna tell me
everything I need to know.

632
01:14:36,677 --> 01:14:40,117
You think, I forced the crash
your ship by accident?

633
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:42,141
You want it the bomb ship?

634
01:14:42,257 --> 01:14:44,329
I let you right to it.

635
01:14:47,684 --> 01:14:50,602
Now, you gonna learn
what's feels like

636
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:53,404
to be a last of your kind.

637
01:15:11,516 --> 01:15:14,201
You want to know the
different between you and me?

638
01:15:14,317 --> 01:15:18,419
I did have a wife and
son back on the Earth.

639
01:15:31,015 --> 01:15:32,868
Centauri 7,
this is the Aurora.

640
01:15:32,948 --> 01:15:34,884
We just clear
out the gate

641
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:35,968
and enter into the atmosphere.

642
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:39,602
The craft it's on it's
way down. Stand by.

643
01:16:01,533 --> 01:16:03,529
Centauri 7, this is
Commander Chane

644
01:16:03,615 --> 01:16:06,285
in the Aurora.

645
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,321
We are on the ground.

646
01:16:09,447 --> 01:16:11,651
What is your status?

647
01:16:16,936 --> 01:16:19,926
Centauri 7, you picking
up my transmission?

648
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:24,133
Centauri 7,
do you copy?

649
01:16:42,116 --> 01:16:44,384
The only one
who made it, ha?

650
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,476
You look like hell.

651
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:52,268
Must a be the rough one.

652
01:16:52,342 --> 01:16:56,026
Get you to the
informative right away.

653
01:19:56,915 --> 01:19:59,681
Clea, upload the
coordinates to the Sedonia

654
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,341
into the ship computer.

655
01:20:03,909 --> 01:20:05,898
Clea.

656
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:11,096
Clea, I command you
to respond.

657
01:20:24,164 --> 01:20:26,597
San of a bitch.

658
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,743
Alpha base. This is
on the craft Jewelry size.

659
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:16,044
Commander Chane is
no longer responsive.

660
01:21:24,493 --> 01:21:28,233
Starting sequence
complete. Clea 19.

661
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:31,554
Hello, Centauri 7.
-Hello, Clea.

662
01:21:31,674 --> 01:21:33,284
It's good to have you back.

663
01:21:33,354 --> 01:21:35,649
I take you by
my new casing

664
01:21:35,748 --> 01:21:37,577
that you follow
my instructions.

665
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:45,293
Centauri, I have incoming
transmission for Alpha base.

666
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,655
Patch it through.

667
01:21:48,645 --> 01:21:51,273
Lieutenant,
this is Alpha base.

668
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:54,976
What's going on
now down there?

669
01:21:55,085 --> 01:21:56,635
If I were you

670
01:21:56,702 --> 01:21:59,952
I'd be more concerning
what's going on up there.

671
01:22:00,092 --> 01:22:02,169
Centauri 7, you
are on the orders.

672
01:22:02,259 --> 01:22:03,704
What is the status
of the human?

673
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:05,422
Find another one to
do your dirty work.

674
01:22:05,494 --> 01:22:08,664
Centauri 7 out.
End of transmission.

675
01:22:12,563 --> 01:22:14,552
Whatever you
planning to do, Centauri

676
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,234
I suggest you to
do it quickly.

677
01:22:16,303 --> 01:22:18,137
It won't be long before
the human traced

678
01:22:18,217 --> 01:22:20,873
the source of that
signal at the Sedonia.

679
01:22:22,769 --> 01:22:24,786
He already has.

680
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:27,228
Is not that right.

681
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:31,432
He didn't kill you. Why?

682
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:33,472
Same reason you
didn't kill me.

683
01:22:34,897 --> 01:22:37,583
Yeah, what's that?

684
01:22:37,937 --> 01:22:40,926
I'll tell you
when I see you.

685
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,314
Centauri, how we may suppose
to get out from here?

686
01:22:49,445 --> 01:22:51,691
Another our ship has to pass
be around here somewhere.

687
01:22:51,788 --> 01:22:54,349
You realized we would be
breaking 26 high council's laws

688
01:22:54,459 --> 01:22:56,889
by taking this
course of action.

689
01:22:56,994 --> 01:22:59,881
Is that a problem?
-Not at all.

690
01:23:00,005 --> 01:23:03,370
Let's get to twelve
hells off this rock.
