1
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:46,625
You were lucky. You just have
mild hypothermia and some frostbite.

2
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,461
What were you doing out in the cold?

3
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,173
I couldn't find the toilet.

4
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,513
If you can't find the
toilet, Marie, just ask me.

5
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:25,205
- How's the old lady?
- She just gets a little frostbitten.

6
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,420
It looks nice.

7
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:37,301
Are you with the closure committee?
Celebrating that we're being shut down?

8
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:43,682
No. Not everyone's a
bitter old man, Hermann.

9
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:50,272
- I'm celebrating our time together.
- Some of us might want out.

10
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,985
What a fuss.

11
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,990
Hey, Camilla. Do you think Ole
would want some of this scrap?

12
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,410
No, just throw it out.
We have a garage full of stuff.

13
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,287
Okay.

14
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,790
OTTA HOSPITAL

15
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,716
Hi.

16
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,931
You're being friendly.
How come?

17
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,309
<i>Ole, are you there?</i>

18
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,269
Ole here.

19
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:35,442
<i>I've got a message about an
abandoned car near Stehøtinn.</i>

20
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,736
I'll check it out.

21
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,661
Where were we?
Heard anything more about the job?

22
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:52,417
I got an offer at Ullevål,
and I said yes.

23
00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:00,467
I know we haven't finished talking
about it, but it just slipped out.

24
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:09,643
- Say something, please.
- It's best I check on that car.

25
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,076
Thanks.

26
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:14,500
Two to three days, judging by the snow.
Has anyone been reported missing?

27
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,962
No, there aren't any
cabins around here.

28
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:24,384
At least you have the
license number. Bye.

29
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,467
Damn!

30
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,019
I wrote to him yesterday.

31
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:01,815
His mother called and asked
if he could stay the night.

32
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,281
- How is it?
- It itches.

33
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:14,161
Itches? That's good.
That means it's healing.

34
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,297
Trouble with Ole?

35
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:31,803
You know, Ole. He thrives
in an igloo in the mountains.

36
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,765
I'm more for two rooms
and a kitchen in the city.

37
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,769
There's snow and trees in Oslo, too.

38
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,690
Have you tried to tell him that?

39
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,776
It's Ole.

40
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,863
Hi.

41
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:04,711
I don't see any external injuries,
but there's a lot of blood.

42
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,422
It's not mine.

43
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,378
Right.

44
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,672
Exactly.

45
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,093
You say that you and four friends
were on a snowboarding trip?

46
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,138
A broken leg.

47
00:09:56,305 --> 00:10:01,602
So you broke into an abandoned
hotel to find shelter.

48
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:06,064
And at the hotel your
friends were killed.

49
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,698
And he that did it was a kind of ...

50
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:21,538
... abominable snowman
who lived in the basement.

51
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:27,336
And now he and your friends
are at the bottom of a deep crevasse.

52
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,885
Why did you bring this?

53
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,264
In case he came back, I thought.

54
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,738
What do you think?

55
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:00,911
- Is she sane?
- It's a bit early to say.

56
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,540
We'll go up and check, in any case.

57
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:10,170
Kim, get the snowmobile and climbing
equipment. Arne, get the snowcat.

58
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,006
- Sverre, stay here and keep watch.
- Keep watch?

59
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:18,053
Keep an eye on her until we
know what this is all about.

60
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,431
Ole, will you help?

61
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,686
- Sure.
- Good.

62
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,650
Bye.

63
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,580
See you at the garage.

64
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:50,669
That's ok. I'll heat
it up in the microwave.

65
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:55,591
Ragnhild, will you record
"Around Norway" for me?

66
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,227
Is it true, you think?

67
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,442
We'll soon find out.

68
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:18,071
Could you have a chat with her?
She needs someone to talk to.

69
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:23,535
- Shouldn't we call someone?
- I called, and they're coming tomorrow.

70
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:29,416
Until then, I think you're
the best option, Camilla.

71
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:18,173
Sorry. I just thought
I'd take your temperature.

72
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,094
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

73
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,357
It's getting better.

74
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,571
I brought you some soup.

75
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:44,116
I made it myself.

76
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:48,620
I know how hospital food tastes.

77
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,706
Yes.

78
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,087
- Please let us know if ...
- Yes.

79
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,663
- Hi.
- Hi.

80
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,667
Well ...

81
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:44,676
<i>- I couldn't find the toilet.
- Let me help you.</i>

82
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,712
Kim?

83
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,716
<i>How much more time do you need?</i>

84
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:31,723
<i>The wind's starting to blow.</i>

85
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,894
I'm done now.

86
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,657
Are you very sick?

87
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,705
No, not really.

88
00:15:54,872 --> 00:16:00,878
Neither am I. I just have to
wait for Mom to come and get me.

89
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:11,514
- Did you break your arm?
- Yep.

90
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:16,102
- Did it hurt a lot?
- Yes, but I didn't cry.

91
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:31,951
- Want to try my cool fighting game?
- No, thanks ...

92
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:34,662
I'm a little tired right now.

93
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:37,957
Ok.

94
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:45,965
Hey...?
What's your name?

95
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:47,717
Daniel.

96
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:54,098
I'm Jannicke. Maybe we can play
a little tomorrow, if you want to.

97
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:12,951
That was the last.
Let's pack up and go back.

98
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:18,748
You and Johan stay here.
We have to seal off this area.

99
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:21,125
Here?

100
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:24,212
That's what the crime lab
people would want, you know?

101
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:30,385
And when you're done with that,
check out the hotel. I'm sorry.

102
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:32,846
Sorry.

103
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:50,572
<i>- Criminal police, this is security.
- This is Einar Stølen, the sheriff.</i>

104
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:57,078
We need some help. We've found five
bodies in a deep crevasse. Suspected murder.

105
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:01,666
<i>- Did you track the culprit?
- Yes. He's as dead as the others.</i>

106
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:06,087
<i>It's a bit too late now, but we
can be there tomorrow morning.</i>

107
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:09,132
<i>Until then, you're on your own.</i>

108
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,719
I can probably handle five bodies.

109
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,951
Is that a black eye he has?

110
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:25,625
It looks more like a birthmark, I think.

111
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:39,597
What's happening? Should I continue
looking after her, Einar? Einar?

112
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:54,195
Someone ought to tell her
that we found her friends.

113
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:09,544
Here. Put the clothes and
jewelry in these bags, -

114
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:13,464
- and then remember to
mark them properly, Audhild.

115
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:17,927
- I should do it by myself?
- I'll be right back.

116
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:46,080
Missing Persons
Unsolved Cases

117
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:17,237
"No trace of lost boy"

118
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:02,115
Hello?

119
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,540
- Sorry. Am I disturbing you?
- No, not at all.

120
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,721
Oh, damn...!

121
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:29,434
It's not exactly the average
Norwegian Easter tourist.

122
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:33,897
Looks more like a Dane who
took the "Rule of 5" literally.

123
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:37,901
Yes. "Be prepared against bad
weather even on short trips."

124
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:41,029
You know the rules.
Do you like mountain climbing?

125
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:46,034
No, but an idiot tried to convince me -

126
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:52,332
- that number four was: "Stay
with experienced mountaineers."

127
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:01,341
Did you want something specific?

128
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:06,221
No, I'm just out to
reconnoiter ...

129
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:14,103
Not reconnoiter. I'm just checking
that everything's in order.

130
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,482
Maybe I'll see you later. Bye.

131
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:36,960
"Your friends are down in the morgue."
How am I supposed to say that?

132
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:43,883
It'll work out.
You're good with people.

133
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:49,931
No. Why do you say that?
I'm not even good with you.

134
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:57,647
Come here, Camilla.

135
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:44,319
- I thought you were sleeping.
- No.

136
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:56,372
They've come down from the mountains.
They brought your friends.

137
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:10,261
Would you like to see them?

138
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:31,407
- Would people stop doing that?
- Excuse me.

139
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:36,663
- Did you come to help?
- I brought someone with me.

140
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:01,748
He's ice cold.

141
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:44,833
You bastard! I hate you!

142
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,919
Damn. Is that blood?

143
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:49,981
<i>- Kim, come in.
- Sverre.</i>

144
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:55,445
- Where are you?
- We just entered the hotel.

145
00:28:55,612 --> 00:28:58,948
<i>- You have to go back to the crevasse.
- Damn ...</i>

146
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:03,453
<i>I think there may be
something else there.</i>

147
00:29:04,537 --> 00:29:06,831
Understood.

148
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:27,352
"Skiers disappear"
"Without a trace"

149
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,193
"Young people
lost in the mountains"

150
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,585
You ...

151
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:56,339
- I ...
- It's okay.

152
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:58,508
Thanks.

153
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:05,974
May I speak with you, Camilla?

154
00:30:07,684 --> 00:30:10,895
- I'll be right back, ok?
- Yes.

155
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:29,998
What the hell were you doing, Camilla?
Sightseeing in the morgue?

156
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:35,670
- I think it helped her.
- Tell her these are vitamins.

157
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:42,010
- You want to drug her?
- She attacked a corpse, Camilla.

158
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:45,430
- Hermann ...
- Do as I say.

159
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,270
<i>Johan?</i>

160
00:31:35,064 --> 00:31:36,690
Find anything?

161
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:45,574
<i>What is it, Johan?</i>

162
00:31:46,784 --> 00:31:49,453
I have a bad fuckin' feeling.

163
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:32,121
Yikes.

164
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:34,665
What happened here?

165
00:33:10,242 --> 00:33:12,411
<i>Audhild!</i>

166
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:35,017
- Ok, come on.
- It's stuck.

167
00:33:35,184 --> 00:33:38,312
Stuck?
What the hell do you mean?

168
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:41,899
Get back.

169
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:45,778
On the skin.
Clear, clear, clear.

170
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:57,493
It's happened before. Hypothermia can
prevent cellular breakdown.

171
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:04,333
There are cases where the heart rate
was down to 10-20 beats per minute.

172
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,004
- And when it comes to the wounds ...
- But he was dead.

173
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:20,641
Now, who's going to take care of this?

174
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:36,198
There.

175
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:38,534
- Yuk.
- The blood?

176
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:45,166
I thought that all nurses loved ...
Why did you become a nurse?

177
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:50,129
Because of the uniform.
Guys like nurses.

178
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:57,553
- That's why I became a policeman.
- You attract many guys in uniform?

179
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,889
No, no.

180
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:03,100
I'm just kidding.

181
00:37:04,518 --> 00:37:08,564
You look very good in it.
Haven't you heard that before?

182
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:13,777
Yes, once.
It was my mother who said it.

183
00:37:15,696 --> 00:37:18,240
Hey ...

184
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:26,582
You look pretty good
in your uniform, too.

185
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:31,378
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

186
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:36,091
- Bye.
- Bye.

187
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,290
- I thought you quit.
- I did.

188
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:57,214
She seemed very alert for someone
given 60mg of tranquilizers.

189
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:04,680
I understand that you're not
happy with me today, Hermann.

190
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:09,810
I'm sure you'll be a
fantastic doctor, Camilla.

191
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:13,165
Hello?

192
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:19,380
Sverre?

193
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:26,947
No!

194
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:50,554
So I didn't know ...

195
00:41:57,394 --> 00:42:00,105
But it wasn't like that.

196
00:42:13,118 --> 00:42:15,496
Ok ...

197
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:23,003
Shouldn't the emergency
lights have come on?

198
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:35,850
<i>He went out to play, like usual.</i>

199
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:40,437
<i>And then didn't come back.</i>

200
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:44,733
<i>- Has he ever done that before?
- No.</i>

201
00:42:49,488 --> 00:42:52,324
<i>He went out to play, like usual.</i>

202
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:57,538
<i>And then didn't come back.</i>

203
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:04,587
<i>He went out to play, like usual.</i>

204
00:43:05,504 --> 00:43:08,257
<i>... to play, like usual.</i>

205
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:15,806
"Skinned dog
found on mountain"

206
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:20,519
"Grazing sheep massacred
animal grave in the mountains"

207
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:24,773
"Grotesque incidents
threaten hotel operations"

208
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:33,699
"Survived the fire
in abandoned mountain hotel"

209
00:43:36,118 --> 00:43:40,206
"He was hanging on by a hair
says medical officer Haldor Mækland."

210
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:50,674
<i>This is Haldor.</i>

211
00:43:56,972 --> 00:44:01,810
- It must local. The streetlights are lit.
- I'll turn on the generator.

212
00:44:01,977 --> 00:44:04,688
See to the patients.

213
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,002
Hello?

214
00:47:31,854 --> 00:47:34,482
Oh, God.

215
00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:48,204
What?

216
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:55,545
Did they...?

217
00:48:39,464 --> 00:48:41,216
Audhild?

218
00:48:55,147 --> 00:48:57,440
Audhild?

219
00:49:12,873 --> 00:49:15,625
What the hell?

220
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:43,922
Stay away.

221
00:50:48,301 --> 00:50:50,971
You stay away from me!

222
00:52:24,856 --> 00:52:28,985
We'd been searching for the family
for five days without result.

223
00:52:29,152 --> 00:52:32,447
Everyone was tired
and wanted to go home.

224
00:52:32,614 --> 00:52:38,829
Most had already been
looking for the boy for weeks.

225
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:44,626
So you were alone at the
hotel when the fire broke out?

226
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:48,129
Yes, as far as I know.

227
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:52,926
Another beer, Haldor?
We're closing now.

228
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:58,014
The police report concluded
that they died in an avalanche -

229
00:52:58,181 --> 00:53:00,642
- while looking for their son.

230
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:04,396
That was at least the
official explanation.

231
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:11,194
The boy was never completely normal.

232
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:19,661
You didn't know?
He was stillborn.

233
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:27,043
In my 40 years as a physician, I've
never experienced anything like it.

234
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:33,717
He was officially dead for four hours.
A death certificate was written.

235
00:53:34,885 --> 00:53:39,556
Then suddenly his heart
began to beat again.

236
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:49,524
He didn't cry once when he
woke up. He just lay there.

237
00:53:49,691 --> 00:53:52,360
Quiet as a mouse.

238
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:27,395
- Is the power out?
- Hi, Daniel. Can you help me?

239
00:54:27,562 --> 00:54:30,565
Help me out of these.

240
00:54:30,732 --> 00:54:33,652
Look in the closet for
a sharp pair of scissors.

241
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:40,826
- Why did they tie you down?
- Quiet. Try to find some scissors.

242
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,915
There.

243
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,298
But if the doctor has done it,
maybe you should stay there.

244
00:54:55,465 --> 00:55:01,888
It's not necessary any longer.
I was just a little restless when I slept.

245
00:55:02,055 --> 00:55:04,933
Go and get the scissors. Come on.

246
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:10,272
There. Great.
Just cut here.

247
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:12,899
There.

248
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,784
Daniel, is the rest of the
hospital dark like it is here?

249
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:25,412
Yes.

250
00:55:26,413 --> 00:55:30,917
Now we're going to go on a little
tour, but you must keep very quiet, ok?

251
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:56,943
- Hey ...
- I'm alright.

252
00:55:59,196 --> 00:56:01,072
Come on.

253
00:56:32,354 --> 00:56:34,856
What is it?

254
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,531
- Hey ...
- Was there someone there?

255
00:56:42,697 --> 00:56:43,990
No.

256
00:56:49,371 --> 00:56:50,705
Come on.

257
00:57:08,932 --> 00:57:11,226
But ...

258
00:57:31,955 --> 00:57:35,083
Sit there in the corner. There.

259
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:41,423
Listen, I have to go out into
the corridor and try to ...

260
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,135
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

261
00:57:45,302 --> 00:57:49,681
Just wait here a bit and
I'll be back to get you.

262
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:55,020
It's almost like playing hide and
seek. Do you like to play that?

263
00:57:55,187 --> 00:57:59,524
Be quiet.
Good. Bye.

264
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:06,818
Do you think it will snow tonight?

265
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:20,332
<i>Hey, you've reached Ole and
Camilla. Leave a message.</i>

266
01:00:20,499 --> 01:00:23,502
Ole? Ole, where are you?

267
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:27,547
Things have gone to hell here.
People have been killed.

268
01:00:27,714 --> 01:00:32,928
You have to get help.
You have to get help, ok?

269
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:57,994
- Jannicke.
- Stay completely still.

270
01:01:08,713 --> 01:01:12,551
It's alright. Nothing came out.

271
01:01:12,717 --> 01:01:15,136
It's alright.

272
01:01:18,515 --> 01:01:20,392
The telephone ...

273
01:01:41,621 --> 01:01:43,999
Hello?

274
01:01:51,798 --> 01:01:55,510
- How many are here?
- Besides us, there are five.

275
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:59,222
- A little boy.
- Daniel?

276
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:02,100
An old lady, and Audhild.

277
01:02:04,102 --> 01:02:07,355
No, there's only four.

278
01:02:08,982 --> 01:02:13,695
- Did you count the policeman?
- Three.

279
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:19,242
- And the doctor?
- He went to turn the power on.

280
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:24,080
Ok. We'll get Daniel first,
and then the old lady. Ok?

281
01:02:25,957 --> 01:02:27,918
Ok.

282
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:51,191
- Come on.
-I have to look for Hermann.

283
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,236
- Come on.
- No.

284
01:05:32,311 --> 01:05:34,856
Come on!

285
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:42,280
What are you doing?

286
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,491
Hi.

287
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:48,911
Come on.

288
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,834
Come on.

289
01:06:04,468 --> 01:06:10,099
- We've locked him in the basement.
- Who else is in there?

290
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:22,653
You can't do that. Kim!

291
01:06:24,322 --> 01:06:28,284
- Now you calm down.
- You have no idea what's in there!

292
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:32,246
I know more than you think.

293
01:06:33,247 --> 01:06:38,711
- There are people alive in there.
- Calm down and get in the car.

294
01:06:38,878 --> 01:06:41,380
She just saved my life in there.

295
01:06:41,547 --> 01:06:47,678
We can't give weapons to civilians.
Tell me what happened.

296
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:52,535
Does it fit properly? Good.

297
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:55,997
Ole, what are you doing?

298
01:07:56,164 --> 01:07:59,458
Ole, don't go in there.

299
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:03,921
It's going to be alright, ok?
Trust me.

300
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:07,717
I'll be alright.

301
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:29,614
Don't contact me before you hear something,
so you don't give away our position.

302
01:08:48,132 --> 01:08:49,967
Clear.

303
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:54,305
Ole, cover me.

304
01:09:53,072 --> 01:09:56,284
- What do we do now?
- We pull out.

305
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:58,870
What about the civilians?
And Sverre?

306
01:09:59,036 --> 01:10:02,874
I hear what you're saying, but
that door tells me something else.

307
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,211
We pull out and wait
for reinforcements.

308
01:10:08,462 --> 01:10:11,007
<i>- We're coming out.
- Roger.</i>

309
01:10:15,219 --> 01:10:19,515
- Did you get him?
- No, he wasn't in the basement.

310
01:10:22,226 --> 01:10:24,395
<i>Roger.</i>

311
01:10:25,938 --> 01:10:28,608
<i>- Repeat last message.
- Ok.</i>

312
01:10:31,068 --> 01:10:33,863
<i>Roger.</i>

313
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:43,456
Cover the front.
Ole, cover the rear.

314
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:57,136
Fuck.

315
01:10:57,303 --> 01:11:00,515
- It's Sverre.
- Kim, wait!

316
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:04,143
Ole, behind me!

317
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:34,340
Kim!

318
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,010
Kim!

319
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,888
Einar!

320
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:58,781
Ole, watch out!

321
01:12:23,931 --> 01:12:26,476
Einar?
Einar, come in.

322
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:34,484
Einar, come in.
Einar, can you give me a report?

323
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,320
<i>Come in, Einar.</i>

324
01:12:39,071 --> 01:12:41,824
<i>Einar?</i>

325
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:45,077
Einar, damn it, come in.

326
01:12:46,787 --> 01:12:51,417
Let me out and we'll go in together, ok?

327
01:13:14,273 --> 01:13:16,609
I was in the bathroom.

328
01:13:23,115 --> 01:13:25,701
Ok. Ok.

329
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:28,079
Let's go in.

330
01:13:40,466 --> 01:13:42,009
Shit!

331
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:48,975
Camilla, get the gun!
On the floor!

332
01:13:55,148 --> 01:13:58,025
Camilla, you have to get the gun!

333
01:13:58,192 --> 01:13:59,694
Come on.

334
01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:08,244
Come on!

335
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:14,584
No!

336
01:14:41,194 --> 01:14:43,488
Ole!

337
01:14:44,489 --> 01:14:46,157
Hi ...

338
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,477
Shit! Damn it!

339
01:15:57,979 --> 01:16:01,649
Come on, then, you fucking bastard!

340
01:17:26,692 --> 01:17:29,195
Are you crazy?

341
01:17:29,362 --> 01:17:31,906
You're going to die, Jannicke.

01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:39,909

01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:24,454

Fuck.

346
01:23:16,668 --> 01:23:18,837
What?

347
01:23:20,672 --> 01:23:22,841
Camilla.

348
01:25:10,365 --> 01:25:12,701
