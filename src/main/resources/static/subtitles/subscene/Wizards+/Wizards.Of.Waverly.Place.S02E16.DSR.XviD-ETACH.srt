1
00:00:02,042 --> 00:00:04,929
- This is awesome!
- Is it, Max?

2
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:07,337
Is this really what you
wanted for your birthday?

3
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:12,434
If we live, I am so
taking my gift card back.

4
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:16,716
Guys, paddle faster!

5
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:20,827
We're not gonna make it.
We're burning up!

6
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:24,978
I know. Before we see this volcano blow,
turn this lava into snow!

7
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:40,425
So then it went from lava to snow.
How insane is that?

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,332
So, after we got off
the ski slope...

9
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:45,644
You went into the lodge and drank
hot chocolate with a polar bear.

10
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:49,151
Did I already tell you this story? Oh,
my goodness, I'm turning into Grandma.

11
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:53,697
No, I read that exact story
in the new H.J. Darling book,

12
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:56,738
Charmed and Dangerous:
The Story of the Lost Wand.

13
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:59,744
- Hm. I don't know those books.
- Everyone knows those books.

14
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:02,715
How could you not know?
They're about wizards like you guys.

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,186
Here's how... I don't read.

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,426
Not even menus. She points
at the pictures. - Mm-hmm.

17
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:14,738
Oh, Alex. That's so sad.
I could teach you.

18
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:18,780
Like I taught you how to make a bird feeder
out of a pine cone, peanut butter and
raisins.

19
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:21,549
Yeah, my dad ate that.

20
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,320
I know how to read, Harper.
I just choose not to.

21
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:27,459
You should read Charmed and Dangerous,
'cause a lot of stuff in the books

22
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:28,662
seems to happen to you.

23
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:31,868
Wait. Her stories are
things that happen to us?

24
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:34,606
How's that possible? You're the
only person I tell them to.

25
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:38,512
Oh, no. I told a few
stories to my lizard once.

26
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:40,313
Then he ran away.

27
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:45,483
Max, you're lizard
didn't run away... - Shh!

28
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:50,058
He ran away.

29
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,797
OK, hang on. Maybe this
is all a coincidence.

30
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:57,501
Harper, how many Charmed and
Dangerous books are there? - Seven.

31
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,404
Fine, go get them.
I'll read 'em by morning.

32
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,575
I'll skip flossing to save up time.

33
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,148
"Don't eat corn."

34
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:10,752
* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

35
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:12,654
* And the end will no doubt,
justify the means *

36
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,924
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

37
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,760
* Yes please *

38
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,764
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

39
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:20,934
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

40
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:23,238
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

41
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:24,707
* That's what I said *

42
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:28,246
* Everything is not what it seems *

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,785
* When you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

44
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,557
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

45
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:39,494
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

46
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:43,265
* Everything is not what it seems *

47
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,570
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

48
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:51,007
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

49
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:55,279
* Because everything is not... *

50
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:57,316
* What it seems *

51
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:02,317

52
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:05,224
- Did she steal our stories?
- Wait.

53
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:09,163
- Did she steal our stories?
- Wait.

54
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,433
She stole our stories!

55
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,036
I knew it.

56
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,972
Our stories are making this
lady rich. - And famous.

57
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,508
And famous! There's a
crazy ten-minute sale,

58
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:23,345
the kids get stuck in a movie,
the brother turns invisible,

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,615
and they pour orange
soda into a genie's lamp.

60
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,954
All right, so we've got our evidence.
Angry mob, assemble!

61
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:32,791
I figured I'd be the one to make
a living writing wizard stories

62
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,426
based on our adventures.

63
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,561
Except my character's
name would be Serge.

64
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:40,132
He'd walk with a bejeweled
cane and wear an eye-patch.

65
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:43,068
What, no British accent?

66
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:47,305
Why, that's a smashing idea.
Thanks, love!

67
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:50,008
Hot.

68
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:56,015
Guys, how do you think she
knows all this stuff about us?

69
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,987
I'll bet this place is bugged.
Everybody talk in code.

70
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,622
Peanuts.

71
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,190
- Nobody knows your code, Max.
- Then we're safe.

72
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,560
We've got to find her
and tell her to stop.

73
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:15,664
Oh! I know where she lives. An abandoned
Paint Your Dish warehouse in upstate New
York.

74
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,601
Whoa. How do you know she lives in an
abandoned Paint Your Dish warehouse?

75
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,070
I had my mom's private investigator
track her down. - How's the case going?

76
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:26,240
Everything's fine. Turns out my
dad was just sleeping in the car.

77
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,811
Quick! To the Inter-Wizard People-Porter!
Or, as Dad calls it, the I.P.P.

78
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:35,314
I pee pee.

79
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:42,620
What is that?

80
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:45,856
The I.P.P.

81
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,258
Cut it out, Justin.
My stomach hurts!

82
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:51,461
This tube will take us
wherever we want to go.

83
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:53,429
Here, mortal. Put this on.

84
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,899
Thanks for the helmet,
but I can't go.

85
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,201
I'm teaching scrapbooking
to at-risk youths.

86
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:03,238
At risk of what?
Making a scrapbook? Come on.

87
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:06,107
I can't. Call me when
you get back. Goodbye!

88
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:09,177
Not goodbye-goodbye, 'cause I'll
see you when you get back. But...

89
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:13,113
Goodbye for now. Oh, darn.
I ruined a perfectly good goodbye.

90
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,316
I.P.P. on.

91
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,885
On what?

92
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:24,824
Peter's Pies... Paint Your
Dish Factory Outlet...

93
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,425
Paint Your Dish Customer
Service... Here we go.

94
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,994
Paint Your Dish Warehouse
comma Abandoned.

95
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,629
This thing is so cool.

96
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:43,940
Wait! Don't tell our dad. We're not
supposed to use it without permission.

97
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:47,009
- Tick-a-lock.
- What does that mean?

98
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:49,978
It means my lips are sealed.
I use it when people tell me a secret,

99
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:52,680
or there's something I shouldn't
tell... - Tick-a-lock.

100
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,848
Bend your knees, guys.
Bend your knees.

101
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:57,350
Ow! My ankle.

102
00:05:57,385 --> 00:06:02,388
I'm OK. No, I'm not.

103
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:04,490
Can we paint a plate
while we're here?

104
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:07,325
- Max, I twisted my ankle.
- Will you two focus?

105
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,063
We're on a mission to find H.
J. Darling.

106
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:12,965
OK, Ricky. Good scrapbooking.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,568
Uh, nice use of vinegar to
make the paper look old.

108
00:06:15,603 --> 00:06:18,537
Stay off the streets. Good kid.

109
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:20,905
Oh, I hope he makes it.

110
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,875
Alex, Max, Justin... I mean,
who are you people?

111
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,443
No, the question is, who are you?

112
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,112
And if the answer is H.J.
Darling, then my new question

113
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:35,314
is why are you
stealing our stories?

114
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:39,119
That's an excellent new question.

115
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:42,221
Um... Look. Why don't we
sit down and talk about it?

116
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:46,592
Uh... I'll make snacks. - Do you
have sugar cubes drenched in honey?

117
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:49,161
- "Boy salad?"
- That's what I call it.

118
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:53,732
OK. Enough with the snacks.
What are you, a wizard?

119
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:56,434
Or just someone who
likes to wear aquariums?

120
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:59,169
Or, maybe that fish
on her head was a spy.

121
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:02,005
I'll see if it knows the spy code.

122
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,242
Peanuts.

123
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,244
Nope. The fish isn't talking.

124
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,480
You're in the middle of one
of your stories right now.

125
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:16,750
My cornea!

126
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:22,055
Bread, eggs, milk...

127
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,491
This is the worst
story ever. - Oh...

128
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:27,126
What is going on? Why are
you writing about our lives?

129
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:34,366
This broke on it's own.

130
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:39,737
Look, uh, sit down. I'm gonna make
some snickerdoodles with Red Hots,

131
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,440
- and I'll explain everything.
- Hey...

132
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:45,543
Harper makes snickerdoodles
with Red Hots.

133
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:49,642
You're stealing more than just our stories.
You're stealing recipes!

134
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:54,478
No, wait. Paint-a-plate, scrapbooking,
snickerdoodles with Red Hots...

135
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:56,313
She's stealing Harper's life, too.

136
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:59,148
I'm not stealing her life.
I have her life.

137
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:02,984
I don't mean, like, I've taken it from her,
like she's gone, like it's separate...

138
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:06,388
She still exists. What I'm
trying to say is... I am Harper.

139
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:09,857
Oh, I've ruined a perfectly
good dramatic moment!

140
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:14,160
Oh, my gosh, you are Harper.

141
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:17,163
But we just left Harper, and you're
an adult. How is that possible?

142
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,965
I'm Harper, from the future.

143
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:25,264
So...

144
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:28,601
If you are Harper,
from the future...

145
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:31,370
How many fingers am I holding up?

146
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:34,472
Two. - Oh, my gosh,
You are from the future!

147
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:37,642
Um, OK. Nobody touch anything.

148
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:39,677
If we do, we could
totally disrupt things

149
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:41,845
for when we return to our own time.

150
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,784
We're in our own time.
She came back from the future. - Right.

151
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,452
I don't get it.

152
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:53,222
Guys. She's definitely
Harper from the future.

153
00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:59,827
OK, so you are Harper from the future.
What are you doing here?

154
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:02,128
Look, I really shouldn't
say a lot about the future,

155
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,731
because it could change
the future. - See?

156
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,502
I just wanted to be
right about something.

157
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:13,405
Look, if you're from the future, why did
you come back here to write about us?

158
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,374
In the future, everybody knows wizards
exist, so it's not that big a deal.

159
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:21,210
It's more interesting for people to
read about wizards in this time period.

160
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:23,312
How come people know about
wizards in the future?

161
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:26,814
Again, I have to be careful
what I say about the future.

162
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,750
But, wizards got exposed
because someone in this room

163
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:32,318
has a big, big mouth.
I'm not gonna name names.

164
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,654
Way to go.

165
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:37,556
She said she wasn't naming names.

166
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:40,759
But, I know it's me.

167
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:44,129
Hold on. If you're mortal,
how can you travel back in time?

168
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:48,531
I cannot stress enough the danger
we're in by even talking about this!

169
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,333
But, I will admit that I had help

170
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:52,935
from one of the most powerful
wizards of all time. - Me? Me?

171
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,837
Is it me? Did I win
the competition?

172
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:58,474
I have to put my foot down.
I've said too much already.

173
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:01,743
As I used to say as a young woman,
tick-a-lock.

174
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:05,046
OK, but please don't tell
young-Harper about future-Harper.

175
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:07,682
It'll freak her out and make
her really self-conscious,

176
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:09,517
and I've always
hated that about me.

177
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,819
It's why I toned down my wardrobe.

178
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,621
Really? 'Cause I've never
seen a hat you have to feed.

179
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:18,789
Thanks!

180
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,592
Hey, what's wrong
with your eye, weirdo?

181
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:25,761
I scratched my cornea when I yanked
the paper out of the typewriter.

182
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:29,664
Uh... I need an eye-flush station.

183
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,802
Eye-flush after I.P.P.

184
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:42,008
Alex, it's so great to
see you young again.

185
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:46,078
Are you saying I get old in the future?
This just gets better and better.

186
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,047
You're upset. Did Mason
break up with you already?

187
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,117
Who's Mason? - Oop.
Tick-a-lock. Tick-a-lock.

188
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,786
Do you know what I want to know?
Did I ever give you permission

189
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,689
to use my stories to become
rich and famous? - Well, no.

190
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:02,425
Then why'd you do it? - The secrets
you told me were so fascinating.

191
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,026
They were secrets.
Secrets are secrets.

192
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,894
That's why they call them secrets,
not books. - OK.

193
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:12,263
That didn't make sense. - You're Harper.
You know what I'm saying.

194
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,297
Do you want my permission
to use my stories? - Yes.

195
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:18,332
Well, I'm not gonna give it to you.
I'm outta here. - But...

196
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,700
Waverly Car Wash...

197
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:23,202
Waverly Dry Cleaning...
Waverly... Oh, geez.

198
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:25,569
- Alex, what are you doing?
- I am storming outta here.

199
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:28,736
Waverly Pet Shop... Ha, here it is.

200
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,037
Waverly Sub Station.

201
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:32,738
Goodbye.

202
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,840
Come on, Max. We better go, too.

203
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,775
Justin, wait.
You've got to convince Alex

204
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,844
to give Harper permission
to write those books

205
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:44,711
or my friendship with Alex
will be ruined forever.

206
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,646
I've always dreamed of this.
Someone has come from the future

207
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,881
to give me an assignment
in the present day.

208
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,515
I'm a Futurenaut.

209
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,918
Hot.

210
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:07,760
Alex, I called you ten times last night.
How'd it go with H.J. Darling?

211
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,728
Oh, I think you know how it went.

212
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,362
Or, maybe you don't, but you will.

213
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,329
Then you'll know why I
didn't call you back.

214
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:15,863
- You're upset with me?
- Oh, so you do know.

215
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:19,001
No. What did I do? - I can't tell you,
but it's not what you did do.

216
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:22,137
It's what you will do.
Whatever you think I'm gonna do,

217
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:25,473
I guess I'm sorry for it. - No, I don't
think you are, or you wouldn't do it.

218
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:29,876
Ha. - What's up?
Look at the two best friends

219
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,379
having a loud conversation.

220
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:35,914
What I love about you two is
you would never let anything

221
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,715
get in the way of your friendship.

222
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,185
You know what? If you're gonna be mad at
me and not tell me why you're mad at me,

223
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,953
then I'm gonna be mad at you and
not tell you why I'm mad at you.

224
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:47,156
Oh, shoot. I just told you why.
Now I'm mad at both of us!

225
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,893
Aren't you gonna
go after her? - No.

226
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:55,329
What is up with your sunglasses?

227
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:57,662
It's filtered light therapy
for my injured eye.

228
00:12:57,697 --> 00:13:01,732
It's a pair of Mom's sunglasses
with a lens knocked out.

229
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,767
Don't tell her.

230
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:06,136
Look....

231
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,537
You have to go after Harper.

232
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:10,806
It's my mission from the future.
I'm a Futurenaut.

233
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,675
Futurenaut? You just
made that word up.

234
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,343
How do you know? You don't read.

235
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,278
That's because I have all the words I need.
Including these two...

236
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:19,645
- Good. Bye.
- No!

237
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,050
Look, my mission, should I
choose to accept it, and I do...

238
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:28,221
is to get you to give permission
to Harper to write those books.

239
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:31,890
You can't give permission to someone
you can't trust, and I can't trust her

240
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:35,260
because she went ahead and wrote
the books without my permission.

241
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,494
Look, I've read the books
and they're really good.

242
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:39,129
They're not just
about us as wizards.

243
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:41,063
They're about your
friendship with Harper.

244
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:43,932
Well, I don't care about our friendship.
I told her secrets.

245
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:46,134
She betrayed me,
so our friendship's over.

246
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:48,335
All right. But you're
missing out on the part

247
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,703
where you and Harper are
getting chased by a dinosaur,

248
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:55,573
and then Harper uses her knitting skills
to repair a rope bridge, and you get away.

249
00:13:57,242 --> 00:14:02,077
Ooh. An adventure
about knitting. Pass.

250
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:04,780
Fine. Don't read any of the
stories about the great times

251
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:06,814
you and Harper have in the future.

252
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:15,155
Alex Russo has a book.

253
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,124
Oh, I can hear you!

254
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,074
Oh, my gosh.
I've turned into Serge!

255
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:42,143
Remember I said I was going to write
wizard stories based on our adventures?

256
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:43,776
No.

257
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:47,911
Well, I did. And I said
I was gonna be Serge

258
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,578
and I was gonna wear an eye-patch
and carry a bejeweled cane.

259
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:53,046
And, look. I am!

260
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:55,814
Well, Serge is a liar.

261
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:59,783
He also said this book would have
dinosaurs and knitting, and it doesn't.

262
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:04,219
So you gave the book a gander,
eh, gov'ner?

263
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:09,588
Futurenaut? Gander? Why don't you
make that eye-patch a mouth-patch?

264
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:14,359
In order to get you to read the book, I had
to lie to you about what was in the book.

265
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:17,729
Well, fine. And you know what?
You were right. It is a good book.

266
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,864
I didn't realize, now that Harper
knows the secret that I'm a wizard,

267
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:23,499
there's all these adventures
we're gonna take together.

268
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,534
Max and I are in that book,
too. - Yeah.

269
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:27,804
I skipped to the parts
with my character, Julia.

270
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,607
The rest was blah, blah, blah...

271
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:33,210
So, you should give Harper
permission to write the books,

272
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,346
so you two can stay
friends and I can say,

273
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,081
Mission accomplished, chap.

274
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:41,616
Serge has a catch phrase!
I gotta write that down.

275
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:46,119
"Mission accomplished, chap."

276
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,922
Really? Because I think Serge's
catch phrase is gonna be...

277
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:52,357
" Stop hitting me
with me own cane."

278
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:54,726
I don't want that on my...

279
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:02,631
"I've done nothing wrong. And the way
you've treated me is unforgivable.

280
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:05,633
"You're not the only person who
thinks we're not friends anymore.

281
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:10,770
"There's another person and I think you
know who that person is. But if you don't...

282
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,505
"it's me, Harper.

283
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,774
"Signed, Harper."

284
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,109
How does that sound?

285
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,177
I liked the note you had
when you used the bad words.

286
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:25,712
Bad words are a crutch.
They lead to tattoos and piercings.

287
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,881
All right.

288
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,616
Now let me ask you something.

289
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,119
Can you tell this is glued?

290
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:38,221
Oh, they're coming!

291
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:40,856
I don't want to see Alex.
She's supposed to read the note!

292
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,225
Ah! All my hard work, Harper!

293
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,127
What's the quickest way
out of here? - The I.P.P.

294
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:53,767
How do you work this thing?

295
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:56,703
Just spin the dial
and stand under it.

296
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:00,039
Oh, good job.

297
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,408
Did I hear Harper in here?
I have to talk to her.

298
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:04,276
Yeah. She left this note.

299
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,978
I'm tired of reading.
Just tell me where she went.

300
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:11,546
I don't know. Somewhere in the I.
P.P. - Dude!

301
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:13,248
- Check the dial.
- Fine.

302
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,550
I'll give it a gander.

303
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:16,885
That is how you use the word.

304
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,492
- She's going to the pyramids.
- Oh, great. I've never been to Vegas.

305
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:32,629
Bend your knees, bend your knees! -

306
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:34,797
Yes!

307
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,502
Oh...

308
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,572
Guys, where do you think Harper is?

309
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:45,374
I don't know.

310
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:48,109
Let's ask him.

311
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:50,378
- Excuse me, sir.
- Oh...

312
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:54,248
The eye-patch and bejeweled cane
tell me you're an adventurer.

313
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:58,486
Thank you. Ah, someone who gets me.

314
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,022
Have you seen a girl with long hair
and a shirt just like hers? Oh, wait!

315
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:04,490
That's her.

316
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:07,059
- Where did she go?
- Odd little girl.

317
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:10,662
She said something about
pee-pee in the Grand Canyon.

318
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:17,136
- I.P.P. in the Grand Canyon?
- You, too?

319
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,905
Strange custom. Keep it up and
your natural wonder will be gone.

320
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,974
All right. Come on, let's go.
Thanks, foreign dude.

321
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:26,376
I'm from here.
You the foreign dude.

322
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,779
Whatever.

323
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:35,417
Harper! I give you permission!

324
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:38,220
What? I can't hear you!

325
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:42,992
I give you permission!

326
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:46,396
A mission to do what?

327
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:49,468
This is impossible!

328
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:53,704
Mission Impossible?
I already saw it!

329
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:57,441
- Meet me back at the house.
- OK.

330
00:18:57,476 --> 00:19:00,010
Oh, so you hear that?

331
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,857
I'm really sorry I was mean to you.

332
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:13,959
- Why were you doing that?
- It's complicated.

333
00:19:13,994 --> 00:19:18,530
I just want you to know that I
read a book... - You read a book?

334
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:21,366
Oh, no wonder you
were so irritable.

335
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,869
No, I actually liked it.

336
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:28,105
And it got me thinking that,
if you ever want to write stories

337
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:30,974
about my life and publish them,
I give you permission.

338
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:34,175
Why would I want to do that? I already
know what I'm gonna do in the future.

339
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,810
I'm gonna run a very successful
paint-a-plate business.

340
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,680
Oh. Paint-a-plate business?
That's a good idea.

341
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:42,849
But you know what else
you'd be really good at?

342
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,119
Writing stories about
our wizard adventures.

343
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:49,723
I will need something to do while
myork is in the kiln. - Ah!

344
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:53,093
See? I even have a great
title for your first story.

345
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:58,196
- Gander of the Futurenauts.
- Yeah...

346
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,865
I'll think of something.

347
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,269
So, we're not mad at
each other anymore?

348
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:08,273
No. I just hope that we're gonna
be friends for a really long time.

349
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,842
Alex, is that what you'r afid of?
That we're wouldn't be friends?

350
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,345
Well, I was afraid of that,
but not anymore.

351
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,714
I'm pretty sure we're going
to be friends forever.

352
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:43,074
You know, you should practice mouthing
words so people can understand them.

353
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,543
I am pretty bad at that.

354
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,246
Oh, my gosh.

355
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:55,185
That's the greatest hat
I've ever seen! Excuse me...

356
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,420
I just love that hat.
Where can I get one?

357
00:20:57,454 --> 00:21:02,124
- Here, you can have this one.
- I can't take this from you.

358
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:04,426
Consider it a loan.

359
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,395
Well, how will I
get it back to you?

360
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:11,899
- Um... I'll get it back to her.
- You know her?

361
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:15,102
Yeah. She's an old friend of mine.

362
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,580
Oh. Hi, I'm Selena Gomez.

363
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,316
In this episode, my character starts
out not liking reading very much,

364
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,052
but by the end of the episode,
Alex learns how important reading can be.

365
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:34,857
Reading can save lives.
Like "Exit," in case of a fire.

366
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:37,859
Or, "Hey, this bottle
has poison in it."

367
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:43,530
But, probably not that, because they
usually have the skull and cross bones on
it. Anyway...

368
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:49,104
The point is, I love reading.
And so does my friend,

369
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:52,907
writer, producer,
actor and director, Rob Reiner.

370
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:54,475
Oh, hi!

371
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:56,944
I love reading, too.

372
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:02,714
Like I should've read the
expiration date on this milk.

373
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:10,621
Oh, Rob. Yes, he should have.

374
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:16,059
But, I think you
should love reading, to

375
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:19,596
Hi, I'm Selena Gomez.
In this episode, my char... Oh, wait.

376
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,332
No, I alady read this. OK.
I'm done. Let's go, Rob.

377
