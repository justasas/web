1
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:06,115
Squeeze, squeeze.

2
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:11,289
And that's how you turn
lemons into lemonade.

3
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:16,528
And what is magical about that?

4
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:19,699
Nothing, but it tastes great.

5
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:22,538
All right. Who's ready for
today's wizard lesson?

6
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:24,273
Oh, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,344
I can only learn one
new thing a week,

8
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:28,679
so I guess I'll just see
you guys next week. Great.

9
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:30,215
Ah-ah-ah.

10
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:34,420
- Uncle Kelbo!
- Hey, everybody!

11
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:38,226
You're not gonna believe this,
but I just discovered Amica.

12
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:41,330
You should have seen Columbus' face

13
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:45,136
as he sailed up, and I was waiting
there for him looking like this.

14
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,575
- I thought I heard Kelbo.
- You heard right.

15
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,778
- Nice outfit.
- Well, thank you.

16
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:55,213
Can you stand outside the
restaurant and hand out menus?

17
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:58,083
Actually, no, I cannot.

18
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:02,788
I'm spending all my time using
my magic while I still have it.

19
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:04,122
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,026
I got a letter from
the Wizard Council.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,162
There's some sort of technicality,

22
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:13,866
and we have to take
our wizard test again.

23
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,368
All of us.

24
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:18,572
You, me, and somebody else.

25
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:21,809
- All of us?
- Who's "all of us?"

26
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:24,713
- No one.
- OK, we're not four years old.

27
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:27,049
We know that "no
one" means someone.

28
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:31,687
Kelbo and I have a sister.
You guys have an aunt.

29
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:32,921
Oh, I knew it!

30
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:36,125
- I didn't know it.
- Hold on.

31
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:39,896
How come you guys never
told us we had an aunt?

32
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:43,767
When I won the wizard competition
and gave my powers to Kelbo,

33
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:47,438
she got mad and wanted nothing
to do with our family ever again.

34
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,273
- Which is fine with me.
- Not fine with me.

35
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:52,475
The wizard auditor's
gonna be here on Friday.

36
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,244
And if Meg is not here
to retake that test,

37
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:58,881
the Russos will lose
their powers forever.

38
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:02,118
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:05,822
Are you telling me that my kids
might lose their powers, too?

40
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:07,223
Hm-hmm.

41
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:10,460
Oh, no. This is... This is bad.

42
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,362
We're gonna have to find a
way to get her back here

43
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:13,930
so she can retake the test.

44
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,300
The problem is nobody
knows where she is.

45
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,702
Well, we're gonna
have to find her then.

46
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,006
I have a magnifying glass.
Will that help?

47
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:27,010
She's not tiny.

48
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:29,779
But you said she was an ant.

49
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:32,916
Dad, we've got to do something.

50
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,285
We all know that I was the
one that was gonna win.

51
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:38,956
I know. And you worked really hard, too.
You must feel terrible.

52
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:42,826
Suddenly slacker girl over here

53
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:46,430
isn't looking so
dumb anymore is she?

54
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,232
<i>* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

55
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:51,333
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

56
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:53,536
<i>* You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease *</i>

57
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,104
<i>* Yes, please *</i>

58
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,006
<i>* But you might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

59
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,808
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

60
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:01,511
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

61
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:03,079
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

62
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:06,015
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

63
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,887
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

64
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:13,625
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

65
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,229
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

66
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:21,331
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

67
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:25,701
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

68
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:29,071
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

69
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:33,372
<i>* Because everything is not *</i>

70
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,476
<i>* What it seems *</i>

71
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:37,477

<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

72
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:42,380
I can't find a Megan Russo
anywhere on the World Wide Wiz Web.

73
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:45,083
OK, well, how are you
spelling "Russo?"

74
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:49,420
Sometimes I'm in a hurry
and I don't use any "S's."

75
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:52,722
Uh, hey. Once you all
lose your powers,

76
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:57,226
we should use the Wizards' Lair
as a quiet room just for Mom.

77
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,896
- What's a quiet room?
- You'll never know.

78
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,997
Theresa, we're trying
to figure out a way

79
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:05,466
for the kids not to
lose their magic.

80
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,735
Is there anything you guys
can tell me about Aunt Megan

81
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,670
- to help me find her?
- Whoo, I know.

82
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,505
I know when your dad
first introduced me

83
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:15,408
as the girl he was giving
away his powers for,

84
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:20,646
she threw my homemade empanadas
off the terrace and hit a cop.

85
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,248
So Aunt Megan has a police record.

86
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:28,585
Found her! Found her!

87
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,455
Megan Brooke Russo.
She lives in Paris.

88
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:35,058
Paris? She sounds German.

89
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,494
Dad, don't you think
you should go apologize

90
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,162
and convince her
to take the retest?

91
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,663
Absolutely.

92
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:45,832
I'm going to go over there
and make her take that test,

93
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:48,835
or I'm going to sit on her,
look her in the eye

94
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:52,404
and dangle a loogie
right over her face.

95
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:57,575
That's how I got her to do
things when we were kids.

96
00:04:57,609 --> 00:05:00,644
Uh, it'd be better
if just you guys go.

97
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:03,580
All right, let's go.

98
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:07,417
Wait, Alex, let me do it.
I never get to do it.

99
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:09,252
All right, fine.

100
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:13,155
Let's go to our new aunt's.
Take us to Paris, Texas.

101
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,222
What?

102
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,728
See? This is why we don't
let you do the spells, Max.

103
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:31,437
Hi, uh... Are you Megan Russo?

104
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:33,372
Yeah.

105
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,241
We're Jerry Russo's kids.

106
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:41,044
Oooh. I'm not Megan Russo.

107
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:42,312
Wha...?

108
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:45,581
Well, we gave it a shot. Let's go.

109
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,517
Yes, I'm convinced,

110
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,385
since your paintings say,

111
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,455
"M. Russo" and your
smock says "Megan."

112
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:57,292
OK, I'm your aunt.

113
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:59,360
Let's do all the aunt stuff.

114
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:02,263
Wow, I haven't seen you in so long.
You're so tall.

115
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,597
When did the cast come off?

116
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:07,101
That was fun.
Have a great trip back.

117
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,902
You're kicking us out?

118
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,104
You're still that upset
with your brothers?

119
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,741
No, I'm not upset.
I've totally let it go.

120
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,211
Then, what's this?

121
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,081
Oh, it's the latest in my series,

122
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,385
called "Every Russo
for Themselves."

123
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,854
Wow. She really knows
how to hold a grudge.

124
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,555
Sounds like someone else we know.

125
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:36,292
Don't look at me like that.
I'm still mad at you

126
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:39,294
for the last time you
said I hold a grudge.

127
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:44,165
OK, great. Thanks for stopping in.
Have a great trip back.

128
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,367
I need to get back to
doing a lot of nothing.

129
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:48,637
Wow. Alex, you do a lot of nothing.

130
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:52,007
You know, she's like your weird,
older-looking twin.

131
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,675
No offense.

132
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,878
You remind me of a brother
I used to have named Kelbo.

133
00:06:57,912 --> 00:07:00,847
Really? I have an
uncle named Kelbo.

134
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:03,649
Couldn't be the same guy.
My Kelbo is an uncle,

135
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:05,217
and yours is a brother.

136
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,551
Yep. You're just like him.

137
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:12,187
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

138
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:15,723
- Thank you.
- It was an insult.

139
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,757
Thank you.

140
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:23,128
Aunt Megan, you need
to come back with us.

141
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,597
You and your brothers need
to retake the wizard exam.

142
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:29,033
It's the only way the Russo family
can save its wizarding powers.

143
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:31,570
What do I care about wizard powers?

144
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:33,472
Look, I don't know if you heard,

145
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:36,207
but I got totally jacked
in the wizard competition.

146
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:39,110
Look, we all know what happened to you,
OK? Yes, it was bad.

147
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:41,645
This can be your one chance
to win your powers back.

148
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,380
Yay, we all love power!

149
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:46,616
And we also heard how
unfairly you were treated.

150
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,784
- Yes.
- And how...

151
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,521
...my dad and uncle want to
apologize to you for that.

152
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:57,892
- Yep. That's what they said.
- Aunt Megan.

153
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,261
Would you mind
taking Max on a tour?

154
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,664
Don't let him touch anything.

155
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:05,032
Too late.

156
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,103
You can't really lean on these.

157
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:15,008
Alex! What are you doing?

158
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:18,343
Dad said he was never
going to apologize to her.

159
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:19,811
I'm winging it.

160
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:21,747
Well, what are you gonna
do if she says yes,

161
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:24,615
and comes back with us,
and then they won't apologize?

162
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,650
Then I'll wing it again.

163
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:29,151
The important thing
is not the truth,

164
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:30,318
it's getting her back.

165
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:32,787
So, how about it, Aunt Megan?

166
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:35,089
Dad and Uncle Kelbo are
ready to get on their knees

167
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:37,092
and beg for your forgiveness.

168
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:40,495
Well, I wouldn't mind seeing that.

169
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,963
Especially because I
thought I never would.

170
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,333
Winging it never fails.

171
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,775
Is this place a sandwich
shop or a subway stop?

172
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:57,577
Let me guess.
It was your dad's idea.

173
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:04,615
Megan. Wow, you're here.

174
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,016
Yep, I'm here.

175
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,785
Nice job combining two
of your favorite things:

176
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:12,220
railroad travel and eating.

177
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:14,957
Shows how much you don't know me.

178
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:16,491
My two favorite things now

179
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:19,160
are baking my own pie
crusts and knitting.

180
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:26,764
I'm just going to move this
breakable stuff out of the way.

181
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,700
You know, get it out of reach.

182
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:36,005
Wow. I never thought I'd see
the day you'd come back here.

183
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,475
When I heard what you were going to do,
how could I miss it?

184
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,111
- What?
- What do you mean "what?"

185
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:46,781
Start winging it, Captain Flappers.

186
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:49,282
Captain Flappers?

187
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:51,151
I'll think of something
better. Just go.

188
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:56,957
Uh, Daddy, Aunt Megan was really excited
to hear how much you missed her.

189
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,227
And how you feel really,
really bad about what happened.

190
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:01,961
Really?

191
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,597
'Cause that doesn't
sound like Megan at all.

192
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,899
Look, I'm just going to cut to it:

193
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,968
I was told you'd be on
your knees for this.

194
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:13,037
- She's just like you.
- No, she's not.

195
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,572
The only way I'm
getting on my knees

196
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:17,440
is if I'm sitting on you,

197
00:10:17,474 --> 00:10:20,075
dangling a loogie over your face.

198
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:24,112
Then why did I even come to your
stupid restaurant-slash-train station?

199
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,780
It's a sub shop.

200
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:31,184
- Just like you.
- I don't see it.

201
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
Hey, everybody.

202
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:35,755
Congratulate me.

203
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:40,592
I just won the Indianapolis
500 in the year 2092.

204
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:43,727
Place your bets now.
I was a longshot.

205
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:49,198
Oh, my... Megan! It's Megan.

206
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:54,569
I remember you. You're my sister.

207
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:57,005
- Wow.
- Hi, Kelbo.

208
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,807
I can't believe you got her
to come back to take the test.

209
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:04,445
- Not without an apology.
- Well, OK. Go ahead.

210
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:11,250
Um, no, Kelbo. She wants
us to apologize to her.

211
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:12,618
What for?

212
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:16,154
For giving your powers
to him instead of me.

213
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,759
OK, this is clearly between
the two of you, OK?

214
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:25,330
Who wants to go with their
uncle fishing for llamas?

215
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:27,499
Kelbo!

216
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,834
Megan, you know I had
to give him my powers

217
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,336
because he needed them more.

218
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:36,507
Kelbo's life without magic
would be a travesty.

219
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,575
A horrible travesty.

220
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:42,377
That's why I like to spend all my
time appreciating what I've got,

221
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:44,212
and going fishing for llamas!

222
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:51,118
Aunt Megan, this can be your one
chance to win your powers back.

223
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:54,020
I'm apologizing for them.

224
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:56,289
Sorry! Please retake the test.

225
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:58,992
Why should I?

226
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,794
Jerry will still win and
give his powers to Kelbo,

227
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:05,497
and all of my hard work
will be for nothing.

228
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:09,067
And I really don't like hard work.

229
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:12,402
Oh, my gosh, she is just like me.

230
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:16,239
- Kelbo, send me home.
- You got it.

231
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:22,144
Zooba, zooba, zooba, hey sister,
go sister, Paris, Texas.

232
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:27,382
- Alex, what did you do?
- She winged it, Dad.

233
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,851
And I specifically told
you not to wing it.

234
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:32,853
Hey, I got her here. If you don't
like winging it, what do you got?

235
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:35,522
I don't know, but there's
gotta be something we can do.

236
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:39,625
What if we hired a wizard lawyer?

237
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,294
Maybe he can find a loophole
so we can keep our powers.

238
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,463
I know just the guy.
He's fantastic!

239
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,733
The best fish lawyer
in the business.

240
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,403
I'm telling ya, this guy's a shark.

241
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:54,871
No offense.

242
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,608
OK. Mr. Fish...

243
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,047
We had a transfer of
power indiscretion,

244
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,749
and our aunt won't take the retest.

245
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:10,553
Is there any legal solution?

246
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,221
We're toast.

247
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:17,726
Hey, I don't want to be insensitive,
but how long do you think

248
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:20,629
it will take to get all this
wizard junk out of here?

249
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:25,200
Oh, that was insensitive, huh?

250
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:29,768
OK, looks like it's over.
I'm heading to Atlantic City.

251
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:32,770
You, my friend, get the hotel room.
I'll get the plane ticket.

252
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,075
Go ahead, Mom.
Make it your quiet room.

253
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,044
There's no need for a wizard
training area anymore,

254
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,581
because the competition is over.
Right, Alex?

255
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:52,042
I really messed up, Harper.

256
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:55,244
My family could lose our wizard
powers because of what I did.

257
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:57,446
I'm probably gonna end
up like my Aunt Megan,

258
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:59,914
with nobody in my family
wanting anything to do with me.

259
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:02,683
Then I've got this covered.
Here's what you do.

260
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,719
Get a small refrigerator
in your room,

261
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,154
and then be best friends with
someone ose family you like

262
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,723
and spend all of your
time at their house.

263
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:15,964
Alex, honey, grab your wand.
I want you to take me somewhere.

264
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:19,435
Really? You never want
anything to do with magic.

265
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:21,668
Wait a minute.

266
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:24,167
You're not dropping me off
at boarding school, are you?

267
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:26,233
I never thought it
would be you, Mom.

268
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,535
I will not let you do it,
Mrs. Russo.

269
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,270
Standing up to you is
really tough for me,

270
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,038
because this is the
only place I have to go.

271
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,673
Harper, honey, relax!

272
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,743
I'm not sending Alex away.
I just need to show her something.

273
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,714
OK... I hate traveling by wand.

274
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,683
Makes my ears pop
and my ankles swell.

275
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,185
I hate it, too.
I hear stuff and I taste metal.

276
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,253
I know.

277
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,687
Wait till they turn you invisible.

278
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:54,622
None of your clothes
fit right after that.

279
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:56,891
Really, Mom, this was
urgent a minute ago, so...

280
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:58,793
Oh, you're right. Let's go.

281
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:04,664
Oy!

282
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:12,771
- What do you want?
- Look, Megan!

283
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:16,006
I'm sorry. I can't hear
very well right now,

284
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,207
but just listen to me, OK?

285
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:20,876
I know that you don't get
along with your brothers,

286
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,677
and that's your business.

287
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:27,013
But now, it's affecting my kids,
and that's my business.

288
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:31,549
OK? Wait a minute.

289
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,984
My ears just popped.

290
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,187
Look, Theresa,
I'm not going back there.

291
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,789
There's too much bad blood
between me and my brothers.

292
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,324
There's nothing I can do forou.

293
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,795
Don't you even care
that Justin, Max, and I

294
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,163
are going to lose our powers?

295
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:52,099
You'll be OK without magic.

296
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:54,634
- I am.
- Uh, no, you're not.

297
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:56,269
You live alone on a roof.

298
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:59,972
Mom, it's in Paris. It's beautiful.
Look at the view.

299
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:02,708
Shh. It's still sad.

300
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,147
Look, Megan, you're a miserable,
bitter mortal.

301
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:10,382
You have no family.

302
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,283
You want to know why Alex
will be OK without magic?

303
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:15,351
Because she has her family.

304
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:19,987
You got schooled!

305
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,389
- Alex, watch your mouth.
- Oh, sorry.

306
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:25,158
Well, you just wasted
your time by coming here.

307
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:30,264
Wow, maybe I did.

308
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:35,434
I'm sorry I couldn't
be more help, Alex.

309
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:37,304
No, Mom. You did help.

310
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,475
I'm not gonna let
magic do this to us.

311
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:44,278
And, Aunt Megan, I have a
suggestion for your painting.

312
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:51,415
Now you're the one being
chased by a shark.

313
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,716
Buh-bye.

314
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:03,027
Guys, we gotta talk...

315
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,361
...about a lot of things.

316
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:06,662
No, we don't.
We're done talking to you.

317
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:08,864
We're packing.

318
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:11,033
Don't you see what
this is doing to us?

319
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,068
We haven't even finished
the wizard competition,

320
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:15,536
and we're already fighting like Dad,
Kelbo and Megan.

321
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:18,472
Since when have you ever cared
about the wizard competition?

322
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:20,540
Since I figured out it
was tearing us apart.

323
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:23,543
Guys, do you know
what we need to do?

324
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,711
We need to put aside our
differences, come together,

325
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,981
and show the Wizard Council that the Russos
aren't going to take this lying down.

326
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,249
Continue.

327
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,917
Sure, we annoy each other.

328
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,986
And sure, you're probably not
going to amount to anything.

329
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:41,424
Sure, I might end up along
the side of the highway,

330
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,326
wearing an orange
jumpsuit picking up trash.

331
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,361
But you know what I
like to call that?

332
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:49,332
I like to call that "family."

333
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,768
If there's one thing I've
learned about family,

334
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:56,470
it's that if we stick together,
nothing can hurt us.

335
00:17:58,006 --> 00:17:59,873
Well, we're gonna lose
our powers anyway,

336
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,508
so what else do we have to lose?

337
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,309
- Yeah! Let's do it.
- All right. OK.

338
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:04,677
Bring on the Wizard Council!

339
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:06,645
OK, guys, I'm gonna
get a bunch of rest.

340
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:10,309
It's gonna be a big, long,
emotional day tomorrow.

341
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:13,241
- Wait, tomorrow?
- Yeah.

342
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,110
So that's not today?

343
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:19,949
No, tomorrow. The day the
wizard auditor's coming.

344
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:24,592
All right, do you guys want to
meet earlier before he gets here

345
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,462
and then we can redo
this whole moment,

346
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:28,397
or we can just remember
that it happened?

347
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:30,433
Yeah, no, we're good.
All right, let's go.

348
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:34,604
I am here to administer
a retest to, uh,

349
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:37,971
Jerry, Megan and... Kelbo?

350
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:40,803
Uh, Mr. McFly? Our sister,
Megan, is not gonna be here.

351
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:42,505
Oh, then this is gonna be quick.

352
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:47,072
Where's your wizard power panel?
I need to take the fuses.

353
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,478
Um, I don't recall where that is.

354
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:56,348
- It's right here.
- Oh, this?

355
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:59,016
This is our decoy panel to,
you know...

356
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,053
Are you the wizard
competition auditor?

357
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:05,922
- Yes.
- We quit.

358
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:06,989
Time out.

359
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:13,695
- What are you doing?
- I'm winging it.

360
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:16,831
You gave a big inspirational
speech for that?

361
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,800
Well, first of all,
thank you for remembering my speech.

362
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:24,037
And second of all, you're family
and you're gonna wing it with me.

363
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:26,640
We're behind you,
General Flappers.

364
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:28,975
Would you stop saying that?
I wasn't happy with it.

365
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,543
OK, hands in.

366
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:32,845
- One, two, three...
- Russos!

367
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,384
Time in!

368
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:40,585
Ever since this re-test came up,

369
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,355
I've learned a little
something about us Russos.

370
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:45,790
We don't need powers
to make us a family,

371
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:48,325
and we're not gonna let
wizard powers break us apart.

372
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,195
And my brothers are behind me.

373
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,296
You know what? She's right.

374
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,799
I don't want to end up losing
these guys. I quit, too.

375
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,267
Alex had a great speech yesterday,

376
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:03,235
and the parts that I
remember were very moving.

377
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,673
I quit, too.

378
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,541
Yay, family!

379
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,043
I'm proud of you kids
for sticking together.

380
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,515
Well, I guess I'm gonna go
to the place where I wanna be

381
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,252
when there's no more magic.

382
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:30,226
We're done, so... here.

383
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:35,498
Man, I hate this job.

384
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:39,368
Every day, I see the wizard
competition tear families apart.

385
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:43,004
Even I haven't seen my
own sister in years.

386
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,908
You know what? I'm gonna
let you keep your powers.

387
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:52,679
That's against the rules.
I don't know if you're allowed...

388
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:54,480
Um, um, hey, look...

389
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:57,015
...you're bending the rules.

390
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,551
I'm a rule bender. He's Johnny Honest.
Forget about him.

391
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,855
Oh, look, if it comes up?

392
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,390
Mr. McFly was never here.

393
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,159
Thank you! Wow!

394
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,964
You did it. You guys did it!

395
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,499
Guys, I'm sorry I got us into
this mess in the first place.

396
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:21,002
Hmm, you're not at
all like Aunt Megan.

397
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:24,472
But, I complain,
I make fun of you guys,

398
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:27,274
and I hardly do any work.
I'm exactly like Aunt Megan.

399
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:30,610
Well, a lot of that is true.

400
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:35,414
No, you apologized. You did.

401
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:38,616
That's something Aunt Megan has
never figured out how to do.

402
00:21:40,018 --> 00:21:42,886
Hey, what do you say
we unpack these boxes?

403
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:47,489
How about we let Max do it?

404
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:50,725
Don't feel like going to Texas.

405
00:21:52,193 --> 00:21:55,495
Love on the rocks.
Unpack the box-es.

406
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:12,850
Um, excuse me,
is your refrigerator running?

407
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:15,185
Alex, I know it's you.

408
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,355
I can see Kelbo's wand
number in my caller ID.

409
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:19,656
Guys, she's on to us.

410
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:21,658
You forgot to dial pound,
horse, unicorn!

411
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:24,058
- What do we do?
- What we always do. Run!

412
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:32,559
