1
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:18,243
Alex, did you make those
brownies? - Oh, gosh.

2
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:31,022
Pfft! Ugh!

3
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:34,059
It's so not easy slaving
over a hot wand.

4
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:37,262
Cheater! You don't see me taking
out the garbage with my wand.

5
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:41,099
Give me this. Ho! Oh!

6
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,301
I told you I just
baked with that wand.

7
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,506
Hey, alex. Oh,
you made your brownies.

8
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:52,010
Oh! They're so good.

9
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:53,678
You know, I've never seen you bake.

10
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:58,550
Hey, I've got flour on my apron.

11
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:02,354
And... sweat on my brow.

12
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:04,623
What are you calling me, a liar?

13
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:08,493
No, I just came here to invite you
to the pop culture convention.

14
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,896
Hold on, I got to think of
a lie on why I can't go.

15
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:16,067
Come on, alex, we get to dress up like
characters from cool comics and movies.

16
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:18,670
Would you go if I told
you it was my birthday?

17
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,240
I... I know that.

18
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:25,910
That is why I made you these brownies.
Yay! Happy birthday!

19
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:29,347
Please, alex, I'm finally old
enough to enter the costume contest.

20
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:31,282
I want you there to
help me with my costume.

21
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:34,085
Give me a real reason why
you won't go to popcon.

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,323
Popcon's in town? Hey,
theresa, popcon's in town!

23
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:41,493
- Popcon's in town?
- Popcon is in town?

24
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:45,897
Popcorn's in town?
That doesn't make any sense.

25
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,932
Why am I so excited?

26
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:53,204
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

27
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,507
* that the end will,
no doubt justify the means *

28
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,810
* you can fix any problem with the
slightest of ease yes, please *

29
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:00,845
* but you might find out
it'll go to your head *

30
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:02,547
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

31
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:05,450
* with the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

32
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:09,988
* that's what I said everything
is not what it seems *

33
00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:13,658
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

34
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:17,562
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

35
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:22,200
* because everything
is not what it seems *

36
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:25,336
* everything is not what it seems *

37
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:29,407
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

38
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:33,044
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

39
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:37,215
* because everything is not *

40
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,384
* what it seems *

41
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:49,385

<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

42
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:52,764
Jerry, what are you doing?

43
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:55,834
Putting snacks in your purse
for later at the convention.

44
00:02:55,868 --> 00:03:00,772
I mean, who's gonna pay $6.
50 for a spicy, cheesy pretzel-dog?

45
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,108
Supersonica doesn't carry a purse.

46
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,343
Ok.

47
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:07,979
Well, then d-battery guy does.

48
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:11,015
whoa! What is that?

49
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,152
It's the alarm in the lair.
Emergency wizards are coming.

50
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:16,154
There must be a crisis
in the wizard world.

51
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,626
Get it off me! Get it off me!

52
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:39,544
Oh. What does that big one do?

53
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:43,982
Turns on my reading light.

54
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:52,791
Emergency wizards with
important wizard business.

55
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:55,627
Hang on. You guys
just walked in here?

56
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,363
Where's the usual flash of light,
puff of smoke?

57
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:00,031
Yeah, about that.

58
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,500
Someone in the department
filed a complaint,

59
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,469
So now we just walk in.

60
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:09,040
Secondhand entry smoke is
a proven health hazard.

61
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:13,778
The wizard council requires the
services of alex, max and justin russo.

62
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:17,348
- Where's alex?
- Dude, what is with the noise?

63
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:20,852
Don't you know my Saturday's
my "sleep till Sunday" day?

64
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:25,056
There's an emergency at popcon and
we need all three of you to help.

65
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,458
Ugh. I do not want to go to popcon.

66
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:29,561
That place is filled
with geeks and weirdoes.

67
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:33,264
Focus. This is important business.

68
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,633
Young wizards love popcon

69
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:39,504
Because they blend in with all the
other costumed geeks and weirdoes...

70
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:43,975
Thank you.

71
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,179
Unfortunately, these wizards use
their magic all willy-nilly,

72
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:50,215
Thus threatening to expose us all.

73
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,951
Ah! I get it. You want us to
patrol the convention room floor

74
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,086
And put a stop to these hooligans.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,355
Well, we want you
to keep an eye out,

76
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,091
But if you want to call it "patrol,
" that's fine.

77
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,429
Awesome! Sweet. I'll get us some
walkie-talkies. We'll synchronize our
watches.

78
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:07,899
Does everyone know the international
tactical hand signals?

79
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,469
Mm. I know a hand signal.

80
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:13,605
- Peace! I'm out.
- Hey.

81
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,573
You're not getting out of this.

82
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:18,409
It's part of your
required wizard training.

83
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,579
And I'll put a gold star on
your community service record.

84
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:30,622
no. I can't go on patrol at popcon.
I already told harper I wouldn't go.

85
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:33,458
Do what you always do:
Make up a reason why you're going.

86
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:37,328
I can't do that. I lie to her
about magic all the time.

87
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:40,632
I just lied to her about those stupid
brownies. And it's her birthday.

88
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,936
- I didn't feel good about it.
- Oh! Lookie there, alex has feelings.

89
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,238
I know. I'll hide from her.

90
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:49,107
Feelings gone.

91
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,310
Look, we gotta go now.
So you better change quick.

92
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:55,546
What are you gonna dress up as? - Oo,
um, I'm gonna dress up

93
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:57,248
As a super-sleepy annoyed girl.

94
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:19,270
Oh, my goodness.
I'm in the belly of a nerd beast.

95
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:23,107
Are you gonna keep that thing
on all day? - I have to.

96
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:28,079
If chico loco is unmasked,
he loses more than his strength.

97
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,847
He loses his dignity.

98
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,088
I... I am shamed.

99
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:38,690
I have no dignity.

100
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,193
But it was getting hot in there.

101
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:47,098
Oh, jerry, remember our
first popcon? - Yeah.

102
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:51,336
It was in reno, nevada and you
dressed up like calico girl.

103
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,871
That wasn't me.

104
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:56,074
I'm gonna go buy you a gift.

105
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:01,446
- Oh. Hey, there's hugh normous.
- Hey, hugh.

106
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,582
- What are you doing here?
- I listen to the emergency wizard scanner

107
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:07,151
And thought I'd help out.
Having a giant on the lookout

108
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:09,220
Will discourage any
wizard horseplay.

109
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,357
Oh, that is so cool.
When are we gonna meet the giant?

110
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,194
You just did. It's me.
Look at this tiny comic book in my hand.

111
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,230
Oh, my gosh.
You really are a giant.

112
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:24,969
Well, at least I can go right to
bed when this whole thing's over.

113
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:28,106
- I didn't bother wearing a costume.
- What are you talking about?

114
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,375
That's the best pajama
girl costume here.

115
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,978
Oh! Oh, man! There's a pajama girl?

116
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:37,215
What is with you people?

117
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,751
Come on. Let's get to the
information booth. - Ok.

118
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:43,554
All right. Let's fan out.

119
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,623
"fan out?" hold on.

120
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:47,825
I've got walkie-talkies.

121
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,596
And I made a grid of the convention room
floor and assigned everyone sectors.

122
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,831
All right. You, here,
you're in this sector.

123
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:57,468
You, hugh, you're in
this sector. - Wait.

124
00:07:57,503 --> 00:08:00,538
What's that spot back in
the corner off the grid?

125
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:02,707
That's the galactic
kettle corn stand.

126
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:05,009
Oh. Harper hates
galactic kettle corn.

127
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:08,146
- I'm gonna hide over the.
- That's not your sector, sister!

128
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:14,385
Hey, you guys! It's me,
harper, as battle diva.

129
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,822
- Hardly recognize me, right?
- Hardly.

130
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,891
Would you guys mind
holding my place in line?

131
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,560
I've been trying to get battle
diva's autograph all morning.

132
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:24,462
We kinda wanted to look around.

133
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:26,264
But it's just that
it's my birthday.

134
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,132
And I really want to
get some kettle corn.

135
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,368
I thought you hated
kettle corn. - I do,

136
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:33,871
But I'm trying to practice discipline and
force myself to eat foods I don't like.

137
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:36,574
I leave you with the
battle diva battle cry.

138
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:39,343
Battle diva, rise to the
stars where you belong!

139
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,550
Let's go, supersonica.

140
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:49,821
D-battery guy needs to recharge
with some nebula nachos.

141
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:53,825
Honey, I told harper we'd hold her spot.
It's her birthday.

142
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:58,796
Oh, sweetie, that is so nice how you
care about our children's friends.

143
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:01,732
See ya.

144
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,174
No, I can't!

145
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:24,021
A-ha! Rogue wizard.

146
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,890
Buddy, you're coming with me.

147
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:35,333
Lies, lies I need a disguise

148
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,402
But with a mask! Oh, no!

149
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:43,441
Something's not right here.

150
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:49,947
Why would a warrior who
never sleeps need pajamas?

151
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:52,950
Excuse me! This is all wrong here!

152
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:01,826
- Whew! That was close.
- Yeah, that was a close one.

153
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,429
Yeah, you're telling me.
Wait a minute. Oh, gosh!

154
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:08,866
You're in violation of the costume
quick exchange in the first degree.

155
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,301
We're taking her in. Grab her.

156
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:13,337
Wizard code violation 37294. Wait!

157
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:18,643
- No mask. 293.
- Wait. How did you see that?

158
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:21,045
I'm not gonna lie.
I've been off sector and off grid,

159
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,581
Because I suspected you all along.

160
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,616
We're gonna need that
costume for evidence.

161
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,585
it's all yours.

162
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,693
- Of course, she got away.
- It's shimmering.

163
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:38,296
- She charmed it!
- Of course she charmed it.

164
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,398
This probably has all
of battle diva's powers.

165
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,366
Even her power to make
you say things twice?

166
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,502
Even her power to make
you say things twice?

167
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:48,573
We gotta contain this.
I never understood that power.

168
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,375
- I never understood that power.
- Oh!

169
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,312
- Whoa. That was close.
- yes, it was.

170
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:58,783
Ok, justin. You got me. Oh, gosh!

171
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:04,222
Russo, you're in complete violation
of wizard conduct code 99244.

172
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:07,124
Oh, you're in pajamas. 245.

173
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,060
alex?

174
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,796
What are you doing here?

175
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,801
Surprise! Happy birthday! - What?
You're here for my birthy?

176
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:21,005
Because it looks like you're here with
this guy in the awesome monster costume.

177
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,909
- Who are you?
- I... I'm jeremy.

178
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:27,912
From... Science.

179
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:33,384
Uh, he's jeremy from science.
But I'm not with him.

180
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:37,188
Jeremy from science?
Is there even a jeremy in science?

181
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:42,326
Of course there is.
He... He has a huge crush on you.

182
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:46,664
Well, hello, jeremy from science.

183
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:49,267
Your costume doesn't
look store-bought at all.

184
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,469
Th... Uh, thank you.

185
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:55,206
Alex helped me with it.
No, she didn't. She didn't help me.

186
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,241
What? You helped jeremy
with his costume,

187
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:59,477
But refused to help me
your best friend with mine?

188
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,213
I wasn't helping him.
I didn't even mean to be here.

189
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:05,750
you obviously did.
You're dressed as pajama girl.

190
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:09,220
How could you do this to me?
I want the truth. No more lies.

191
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:12,223
I'm sorry. I can't tell you.

192
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:15,126
You never tell the truth.
Like that one time we were making

193
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,396
Bottle cap belts in sub station.
You said, "I'll be back in a minute,"

194
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,565
And then went into the food storage
locker and didn't come out for hours.

195
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,401
Do you have another
friend in there?

196
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:25,903
Harper, please. I'm sorry.

197
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:28,706
I'm sorry, too.
You ruined my birthday.

198
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,574
Thanks a lot.

199
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:34,312
By the way, your pajama girl
costume looks totally slept in.

200
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:50,909
Jerry. Jerry, come here.
I have to tell you a secret.

201
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:53,846
Come here. Closer. Closer!

202
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,348
Crouch down, honey.
I don't want anyone to hear.

203
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:59,351
Great. Now, wait for me
here till I come back. Bye!

204
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:05,224
Argh! She tricked d battery guy.

205
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,093
She's good.

206
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,397
Justin, I need to talk to you.

207
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,867
Harper thinks I'm a liar.
The only thing I can do

208
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:17,736
Is completely come clean and
finally tell her I'm a wizard.

209
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:23,108
That's the only thing you can do?

210
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:25,277
Well, it's the first
thing I thought of.

211
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:28,847
And you know me, I don't usually keep
thinking of things once I think of
something.

212
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:31,950
You can't tell her that. It's a
serious violation of the wizard code.

213
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:35,020
We may have an
exposure code yellow.

214
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:38,056
Hugh, I'm not gonna tell you again,
I'm right next to you.

215
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:41,026
No, no, justin,
harper can keep a secret.

216
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,595
- No one would ever know.
- Harper would know.

217
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:46,565
Once one mortal knows something,
let's face it, mortals are blabby.

218
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:48,634
but it's true.

219
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:51,069
You should surprise her.

220
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:53,572
Friendships are all about
surprising each other,

221
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:57,643
Because no one but your friends
really know what you like.

222
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:01,280
- Here's some cheese, justin.
- What a surprise! I really like this.

223
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:04,716
See? I know what he likes
and I surprised him.

224
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,551
Friendship.

225
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,854
Great. And um, now,
instead of fighting crime,

226
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:11,590
You can fight crackers
with your sprayable cheese.

227
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:15,527
Wait. Or you can spray
harper with cheese.

228
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:18,063
Look, just because you and
harper are in some fight,

229
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:20,565
- I'm not gonna do your dirty work.
- It's not my dirty work.

230
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,235
- You would save our friendship.
- Uh, no, I'm not.

231
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:26,838
Really? Because she's telling
everybody you guys are engaged.

232
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:29,241
That girl has no boundaries.

233
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:36,782
Mr. Russo, I just want to say goodbye,
since alex and I are no longer friends.

234
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,718
Once justin and I start dating,
I'll be around,

235
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:42,621
But until that happens,
this is goodbye.

236
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:45,824
Aw! It's gonna be...

237
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:48,360
...Ok.

238
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:50,562
battle diva!

239
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:52,597
Hi, justin.

240
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:55,901
It is I, the destroyinator,

241
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,037
- Your arch-enemy.
- Oh, my gosh!

242
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:02,307
You wanna duel? We're gonna
be a superhero couple.

243
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:04,710
First, jeremy from science.
Now, you.

244
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:06,912
I'm part of a love triangle.

245
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:08,947
We're not engaged!

246
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:18,457
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

247
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:22,194
Looks like the destroyinator
has won this battle!

248
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:26,131
Oh, this reeks like cheese!
You've ruined my costume!

249
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:30,302
Oh, no! Your costume
is totally destroyed.

250
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,971
Now, I can't even enter
the costume contest.

251
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,973
Or can you?

252
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:38,777
Surprise! Happy birthday. Again.

253
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:44,149
- Why would I accept your gift?
- Because it's an exact replica.

254
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:46,818
Why don't you give it
to jeremy from science?

255
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:50,422
Jeremy from science wants
you to have it. - He does?

256
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:53,525
Fine. I'll take it.

257
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,728
But not for you.
For jeremy from science.

258
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:59,931
I think I'll harper-ize
it /ewith this wig.

259
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:04,703
Chico loco.

260
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:06,705
I need you to hold this
place in line for me.

261
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:09,875
- Eh... No, thanks.
- Oh, I see.

262
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:13,178
Mom gave you more muscle padding so you
think you're stronger than me, huh?

263
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:17,949
Uh-huh. That's right.
More padding, more loco.

264
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:20,752
- Got a problem with that?
- I do.

265
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:24,122
- Let's wrestle and find out.
- Bring it!

266
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,590
- Ha!
- Ha!

267
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:29,961
Whoa! Put me down!

268
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:32,264
Put me down!

269
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:42,674
Ugh. That's the worst balloon
giraffe I've ever seen.

270
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,876
But you know what? It's a cute hat.

271
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,779
Next.

272
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,385
I'll give you an extra
one so that you can, uh,

273
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:57,155
Sell it and buy
yourself a real hat.

274
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,260
Oh, yeah? Well, supersonica
versus battle diva. Bring it on!

275
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:05,897
Ok. No biting. No biting.

276
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:17,876
Why is harper wearing that?

277
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:19,978
I gave it to her so
she'll forgive me.

278
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,781
When she wins the costume contest,
we'll be friends again.

279
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:26,384
That's a fully-loaded wizard-powered
costume with superhero capabilities.

280
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,888
- Is thaa problem?
- It can fly, ricochet lasers,

281
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:34,593
- Deflect bullets and shoot fire.
- Ok, so it's a problem.

282
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,330
next up, the battle divas.

283
00:17:38,364 --> 00:17:39,998
no, wait!

284
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,669
We'll be ok as long as she
doesn't say battle diva's cry.

285
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,771
That's what activates her powers.

286
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:50,876
Battle diva, rise to the
stars where you belong!

287
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:53,678
That's the one.

288
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:01,653
Whoa!

289
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:03,255
Whoa-no!

290
00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:15,800
What is going on here? - We have a
potential wizard exposure in progress.

291
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:19,037
I accidentally gave her a costume that
has powers but she doesn't know it.

292
00:18:19,071 --> 00:18:22,774
She just knows she's flying. - Everyone,
backstage before someone gets hurt.

293
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:30,882
All right. We don't have a much time
before people start asking questions.

294
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:34,186
Guys, why is harper flying around
like she has wizard powers?

295
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,221
Less time than I thought.

296
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:39,057
Goblin, can you figure out a way
to draw everyone's attention?

297
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:42,194
All right, well, I'm a goblin.
That usually does it.

298
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:44,296
Make my hair look a little crazy.

299
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,343
Ok, everybody, take a position.

300
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,615
Beep beep boop bop bop.

301
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:07,852
This is officer lamp. I have a
situation frank-cody-roger-niner.

302
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:11,089
I need authorization for
an insta-rig. Thank you.

303
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,995
Open the curtain, alex.

304
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:26,071
Hey, I can see the ropes!

305
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:34,879
Yep, those are definitely ropes.
Cannot hide these. Uh-uh.

306
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:37,916
This is by far the worst
illusion I've ever seen.

307
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,285
Ta-da!

308
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:48,760
How did the rope get there?
Whatever. That was cool!

309
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:55,066
I think we have a winner.

310
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:58,270
Harper finkle as battle diva!

311
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:06,511
Oh, my gosh, alex, now I see
what you've been doing all day!

312
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:09,080
You set this all up so I'd
have the best birthday ever.

313
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:11,249
With the rigs,
the costumes and the ropes,

314
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,019
Even introduced me to
jeremy from science.

315
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,354
well, I'm glad you liked it.

316
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:18,990
You know, I owe you an apology.
You've done all this

317
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:21,793
And all I've done is doubt
you and be a horrible friend.

318
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:26,064
Alex, you're the best friend ever.
T"nk you for telling me the truth.

319
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:32,604
Harper, there's something
I need tw tell you.

320
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:34,773
Jeremy doesn't go to our school.

321
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:38,476
I knew it was too good to be true.

322
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:42,314
Because he's a goblin.
From the wizard world.

323
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:46,985
And I would know that because...
I'm a wizard.

324
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:50,355
Hold on a second.

325
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:52,590
But he was into me, right?

326
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,894
Harper, can you forget about
that for one second please?

327
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:58,663
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm a wizard.

328
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:01,333
oh, alex. You're so funny.

329
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:04,669
Really, I am. Here. Pick a card.

330
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:07,906
Alex, that's lame.
There's no way a stupid magic trick

331
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,808
Is gonna make me think
you're a wizard.

332
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:14,713
But look at where we are.

333
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,984
We're in space!

334
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:24,155
And I have a birthday
cupcake for you.

335
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:29,561
In space!

336
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:33,365
Oh, my gosh, I'm having a
birthday cupcake in space!

337
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:36,601
With a wizard!
My best friend's a wizard!

338
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:39,637
I'm so glad I don't have to
keep it from you anymore.

339
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:44,042
Me, too! Wait, so you have powers?
Like you can fly and teleport places?

340
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:46,911
Wizards are kind of like
superheroes. - Yeah.

341
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:49,614
Except we don't do anything
for the good of society.

342
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,450
Happy birthday!

343
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:59,390
ok, so we didn't get you
anything for your big day,

344
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,792
But we wanted to show
you something instead.

345
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:04,462
They wanted to show you something.

346
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,167
I said it on the cab ride
home and I'll say it again:

347
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:13,671
Alex has violated wizard code by
revealing our secret to harper.

348
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:17,208
I know how you feel, but we all
agreed to trust alex and harper.

349
00:22:18,944 --> 00:22:21,445
Between me and you,
they're gonna blow it by Saturday.

350
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,247
We'll use mind-erase
spell on harper

351
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:25,983
And bing-bang-boom,
we're back in business.

352
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,556
What? That's just
your food storage.

353
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,259
That's what you used to think.

354
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:47,805
Whoa!

355
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,982
This is where you do inventory?

356
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:01,686
This is gonna take a
while for it to sink in.

357
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:11,687
