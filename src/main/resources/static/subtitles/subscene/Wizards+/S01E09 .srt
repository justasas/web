1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,514
- Oh, that was a great movie.
- Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:13,589
- Hey, come on, guys. One more time.
- Okay.

3
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:27,365
Oh, now, that is
what I call entertainment.

4
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:29,365
That had to be
one of the best movies ever made

5
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:31,082
about hockey-playing aardvarks.

6
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,805
It's too bad Justin wasn't here.

7
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:37,323
He would have loved
Russo Family Fun Night.

8
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,844
You know, I never thought I'd admit this,

9
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:44,016
but I'm actually jealous
of Justin right now.

10
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,338
What? I thought
you loved Family Fun Night.

11
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:50,380
I used to, but I'm 14 now.

12
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:53,542
I think I'm getting a little too old
for talking-animal movies.

13
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:57,217
Oh, I get it. It's a confusing time.

14
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,146
On one hand,
you're not a little girl anymore,

15
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,544
and yet at the same time,
you're not yet a woman, so...

16
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:05,542
Awkward.

17
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:07,353
Theresa?

18
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:11,393
I think what your father is trying to say
is that no matter how old you get, honey,

19
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:13,555
you're never too old
to spend time with your family.

20
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,870
Exactly. Just look at your mother.

21
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,362
Did you just call Mom old?

22
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:20,957
What? No.

23
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,518
What just happened?

24
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:25,678
Who wants to sing another song?

25
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:27,446
I'm not getting involved.

26
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:31,039
Jerry, may I have a word with you
in the kitchen?

27
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,241
Yes.

28
00:01:35,814 --> 00:01:37,932
Hey, I'm home. Did you guys miss me?

29
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,888
- Not really.
- What?

30
00:01:41,258 --> 00:01:43,615
I don't know if you guys heard,
but I was out all night

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,811
with a bunch
of my new friends from school.

32
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,015
I know.
You told us like ten times before you left.

33
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,976
Yeah, they're from
an upper-level math class.

34
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:55,145
Kind of an older crowd,
so we totally lost track of time.

35
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:56,748
Sorry I'm late.

36
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,859
You're not late.

37
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,426
This is exactly when you said
you'd be home.

38
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:03,625
Is it?

39
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:07,426
Well, I didn't keep track of time,
because I don't have to.

40
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:09,388
It seems to me
like someone's a little jealous

41
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:10,997
that I'm old enough for some freedom.

42
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,119
Oh, please. I'm not jealous of you.

43
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,119
You told Dad you were jealous.

44
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:20,396
No, I didn't.

45
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:22,323
But you told Mom and Dad
you were jealous of...

46
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:24,359
Okay, thank you, Max.

47
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,601
Look, I could care less
about this nerd herd

48
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,243
you're running around with these days.

49
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,045
Face it, Alex, you're mad
because I'm more mature than you.

50
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:32,288
Mature?

51
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,804
You're the only one in this family
who still takes a bath.

52
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:38,413
You try floating an aircraft carrier
in the shower.

53
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,017
For an experiment.

54
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:44,855
One of the most important skills
for a young wizard to master

55
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:50,425
is the art of spell improvisation
or "make them ups."

56
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:54,987
Now, this is the ability to create
a brand-new spell off the top of one's head

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,464
in the moment of urgent need.

58
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:59,471
For example, Max,
what do you urgently need right now?

59
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:01,506
Bagpipes.

60
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:04,388
I wasn't listening.

61
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:08,548
Alex, let's give it a try.

62
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,558
Now, let's say
you haven't eaten for days

63
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,593
and you're in desperate need
of a sandwich.

64
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:13,792
What do you do?

65
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:17,118
I walk over to our sandwich shop
and have Mom make me a sandwich.

66
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:21,279
Okay, yes. But Mom's not here.

67
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:22,484
Where's Mom?

68
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:25,882
It's not important where she is.

69
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,485
She's gone. She left the country.

70
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:29,849
She left the country?
Why? Is she okay?

71
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:33,210
Yes, she's fine.

72
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:36,809
Well, if she's fine, I don't see why
she couldn't make me a sandwich.

73
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:38,729
All right.

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,650
Here, I've already written
one down for you.

75
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,414
Just read that and concentrate.

76
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:51,263
<i>"Satisfy my empty belly
Make me a peanut butter and jelly"</i>

77
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:57,432
You see what I just did there?

78
00:04:57,553 --> 00:05:01,105
I just illustrated
the dangers of spell improv.

79
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:08,837
You have to choose your words carefully,
because in the wizard world,

80
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:10,031
they take you literally.

81
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:12,803
So when Max said,
"Make me a peanut butter and jelly,"

82
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:14,961
they made him
a peanut butter and jelly.

83
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:21,158
Oh, I get it. Let me try.

84
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,126
<i>Although I like such tasty snacks
I'd rather have my brother Max</i>

85
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,291
Hello.

86
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,697
Hey, thanks for not eating me.

87
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,177
Alex, you're a natural.

88
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,132
Thanks. That wasn't even true.

89
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:42,378
Dad, you think you could wrap this up?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

90
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:44,416
Oh, really? That's not like you, Justin.

91
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:46,617
You usually like to really marinate
in the magic.

92
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,138
I know, but my math friends
are stopping by the Sub Station.

93
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:53,145
For some stimulating conversation
about multiplying factorial equations.

94
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,543
How do you know
about factorial equations?

95
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:59,553
I don't know.
Oh, my goodness, you're contagious.

96
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,953
Guys.

97
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,161
That's them?
Where are all the math geeks?

98
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,473
Alex, we prefer
the term arithmetic buffs.

99
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,837
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some
very important things to talk to them about.

100
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,959
Things you wouldn't understand.

101
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,928
And the big ball of yarn says,
"String theory."

102
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:27,885
I'm sorry. I couldn't help noticing,

103
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:30,485
but did you just laugh
at something Justin Russo said?

104
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:32,769
Yeah, I did.
I always laugh at what Justin says.

105
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,333
He's hilarious.

106
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:37,491
Really?

107
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:40,502
And would you describe yourself
as a very boring person?

108
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:41,694
No.

109
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:44,978
I was voted "least boring" in the
school yearbook for three years in a row.

110
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:47,701
Wouldn't that be "most exciting"?

111
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,504
Oh, no, that's Shawn Cunningham.
He's very exciting.

112
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:55,146
Hey, you're kind of funny.
I'll vote for you next year.

113
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:58,029
- Excuse me. Hi, I'm Alex.
- I'm Susan.

114
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,956
Tell me you're talking about
something incredibly lame right now.

115
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:02,717
Actually, we were just making plans

116
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,233
<i>to see Nights of the Halloween
Sorority Party Disaster 2.</i>

117
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:10,475
You mean
the new Ruby Donahue movie?

118
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:13,167
Yeah. It's the first horror movie
she's ever done.

119
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,244
I love Ruby Donahue.

120
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,360
Me too. She's a role model of mine.

121
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,005
I plan to follow exactly in her footsteps.

122
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,283
I'm gonna grow up
on a ranch in Montana,

123
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,804
start my own charity for something sad,

124
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:29,010
and then create my own
price-conscious beret line.

125
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:32,450
Have you heard her new CD
of sensitive but mildly angry rock songs?

126
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,730
- And she's like...
- No...

127
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,012
Okay, Alex.

128
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:39,022
My friends and I have some
very important things to discuss over here.

129
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:40,214
Hey, Susan.

130
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:43,020
Have you ever really considered
the concept of infinity? You know?

131
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:46,420
- I was just thinking about that...
- I can lend you the Ruby Donahue CD.

132
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,631
Thanks. Justin, I really like your sister.

133
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:54,990
I like you too.
And that other "least boring" guy.

134
00:07:56,797 --> 00:07:58,754
- Oh, Zach Rosenblatt.
- Yeah, Zach.

135
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,235
We should all hang out
and call each other the Zach Pack.

136
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,553
Hey, Alex,
why don't we hang out over here?

137
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,195
Why? I'm talking to Susan.

138
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,840
You're never gonna be a member
of the Zach Pack.

139
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:11,206
Don't act like that's a real thing.
I just made that up.

140
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,568
You're my sister. You're not supposed
to be getting along with my friends.

141
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,605
I know, but I like them.
They're way more normal than I expected.

142
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,567
I'm as confused by all this as you are.

143
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,448
Just stay away from us, okay?
I mean it.

144
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:28,452
- Come on, Justin. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

145
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:31,339
Oh, hey, Mom.
My friends and I are going out for a while.

146
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,657
None of us have
legally enforceable curfews anymore,

147
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,455
so it's anyone's guess
when we'll be back.

148
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,655
Because I don't have to keep track
of time.

149
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:38,980
You'll be back before 10.

150
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:41,668
I do like to watch the local news.
They have a new weather girl.

151
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,188
Oh, she's...

152
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,379
Awkward.

153
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:51,107
There he goes. They grow up so fast.

154
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:55,467
Oh, honey. Are you all right?

155
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:59,633
Yeah. He'll be off at technical school
before we know it.

156
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,551
And Alex will be on leave
from the Air Force.

157
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,079
What?

158
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:09,925
It's just the discipline you need.
Please just read the pamphlets.

159
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,447
Oh, Maxy. Come here.

160
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,483
Give your mama a hug.

161
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:19,326
Promise me you'll never grow up
and leave me.

162
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,650
But I'm supposed
to be taking out the garbage.

163
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,847
Oh, no. You're our little baby.

164
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:25,656
Your daddy will take out
the garbage.

165
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:27,292
Me?

166
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,453
Fine.

167
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,176
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Oh, save it.

168
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,668
Oh, Susan. Hi.

169
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,828
Did you hear about
that new Ruby Donahue beret store

170
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,068
that opened in Brooklyn?

171
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:48,946
Yeah, me and Zach
were just talking about it.

172
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:50,793
Yeah, they have
a "gear for guys" section.

173
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,469
Because I was thinking
about going there later.

174
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,794
Actually, I was thinking
about doing anything,

175
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,194
because I don't have any plans.

176
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,879
What about you?
What are you guys up to?

177
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,522
Well, a bunch of us are going to see

178
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,479
<i>Night of the Halloween
Sorority Party Disaster 2.</i>

179
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,005
Do you wanna come with?

180
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:09,198
Who? Me? Really? No, I couldn't.

181
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,478
Oh, that's too bad.

182
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,328
All right, I'll be there.

183
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:17,083
Hey, guys.
How about the math homework?

184
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,490
Talk about your exponential decay,
am I right?

185
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,892
What are you doing here?

186
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,451
Nothing. I was just on my way to class

187
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:28,254
when I bumped into our friends
Susan and Zach.

188
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,735
Our friends?

189
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,936
Alex is gonna come to the movie with us.
Isn't that great news?

190
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:35,501
Yeah.

191
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,899
That's great news.
That's a totally unexpected surprise.

192
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,748
We'll see you both tonight.

193
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,070
Hey, do they make those berets in guys?

194
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:49,505
Don't we have some really nice friends?

195
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:02,161
Okay, what were you thinking?
Those are my friends.

196
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,354
It's an R-rated movie.

197
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:05,523
- You're not old enough to get in.
- Neither are you.

198
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:08,880
You don't worry about what I do
or don't do at the movies.

199
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:10,649
What's that, a fake ID?

200
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,087
Maybe.

201
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,608
- Don't give...
- No.

202
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:22,172
It's just a piece of construction paper
and a clipping of that weather girl I like.

203
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:24,649
You went in my room without asking.

204
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:28,772
Look, Justin,
why do you care if I go to the movie?

205
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:31,578
You're my sister. You're not supposed
to get along with my friends.

206
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:34,420
I know it makes you uncomfortable,
but it's out of my hands.

207
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:36,584
We don't choose our friends.

208
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,870
Yes, we do.

209
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:45,105
And for some reason,
you've chosen my friends.

210
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:46,827
Well, maybe they've chosen me.

211
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,107
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to that movie tonight.

212
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:53,675
Wasn't that a fun haircut?

213
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,951
You looked so handsome
sitting on that fire-engine chair.

214
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,602
Help me.

215
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:04,560
<i>- No.
- No.</i>

216
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:11,291
Hey, remember when you used to give
Max piggyback rides up the stairs?

217
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:13,563
That was like 50 pounds ago.

218
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:17,772
Get on my back.

219
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:26,011
Oh, Dad, Mom.

220
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:28,220
Alex is trying to hang out with me
and my friends

221
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:29,704
even though they're 17 years old.

222
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:32,739
Seventeen-year-olds? Alex, you're 14.

223
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:37,622
Listen, you'll have plenty of time
to hang out with 17-year-olds

224
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,065
when you get into an advanced math class
like your brother.

225
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:44,265
But I'll never get into Advanced Math.

226
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,749
I know that, honey.

227
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:48,790
That's why you're going
into the Air Force.

228
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,153
Okay, I'm late for a movie.

229
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:55,198
This is so not fair.

230
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:57,963
Listen, if you really wanna do
something tonight,

231
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,962
why don't you embrace
your fleeting childhood

232
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:02,601
and take Max out
for pizza and Skee-Ball?

233
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:06,003
I'm not gonna take Max out
to a bunch of dumb kid places.

234
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,202
I'm way too old...

235
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:09,641
You know what?

236
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:12,447
Pizza and Skee-Ball it is.
Let's go, little brother.

237
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,645
You're not taking me out
for pizza and Skee-Ball, are you?

238
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:17,769
No, I am not.

239
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:28,463
What are we doing here?

240
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:30,543
I'm gonna get into a movie
with Justin's friends,

241
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,579
<i>and you're gonna go see
Icevarks again.</i>

242
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,741
<i>Yeah, but I already saw Icevarks.</i>

243
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,871
Well, go crash that birthday party.

244
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:41,191
I'll bet they're giving away
the paddle with the ball attached.

245
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:43,589
I do like those.

246
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:46,866
Hey, guys. Wait up. I made it.

247
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:49,468
Oh, Alex. You're just in time. Come on.

248
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,994
Well, hold on, youngster.

249
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,680
Oh, it's okay. I'm with them.

250
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:54,475
Are you old enough to see this movie?

251
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:58,362
Oh, you flatter me.

252
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,801
Here.

253
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:06,329
You realise this says
you're 47 years old, right?

254
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:09,092
And it's made out of construction paper.

255
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:11,934
Can't you just look the other way?

256
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:15,015
No. That would go against
the usher code.

257
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:18,371
Would a jacket that fits
go against the usher code too?

258
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,092
- Yes.
- I'm sorry, Alex.

259
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,140
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll take notes

260
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,380
and give them to you afterwards
like I do for Justin.

261
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:27,258
Like you do for Justin?

262
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:28,580
Yeah.

263
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:32,507
New high score.
That's what I am talking about.

264
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,023
Alex?

265
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,427
What are you doing?
You're not in the movie?

266
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:37,986
No. I'm not old enough.

267
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:40,150
And I don't plan
on breaking the law now.

268
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:43,235
Part of being a mature adult
is knowing when to follow the rules.

269
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:45,189
Well, part of being me
is ignoring the rules

270
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,911
and doing whatever I want.

271
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,830
I'm sensing you have a devious
and poorly thought-out plan

272
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:52,238
to get into this Ruby Donahue movie.

273
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:55,038
- I'm gonna ask you to leave me out of it.
- Gladly.

274
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,282
<i>I'm old enough to hang with</i>

275
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,324
<i>Actress-model-spokeswoman,
Ruby Donahue</i>

276
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:12,771
<i>So get me into Night of the
Halloween Sorority Party Disaster 2</i>

277
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,416
Where am I?

278
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:23,099
You're at the
Zeta Theta Beta sorority house, silly.

279
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:26,338
Home to the prettiest
and most popular girls on campus.

280
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:31,821
Is that Ruby Donahue over there?

281
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,183
No, silly.
That's Bambi, the sensitive one.

282
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:38,952
Just stay in character
and scream when it's your turn.

283
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,033
<i>Oh, my goodness. I'm in the movie.</i>

284
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,878
You're just in time.

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,554
We're about to have a super-fun
Halloween pillow fight in our pyjamas.

286
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:53,759
Aren't you a little old to be in a sorority?

287
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,957
Aren't you a little young?

288
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:57,477
Fair enough.

289
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,571
What's the matter? It's just the phone.

290
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:23,217
Why did the music get all scary?

291
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:39,990
Hey, what are you guys doing?
The movie's not even over yet.

292
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:43,509
Justin, that movie is way too scary.

293
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,558
There's some things in this life
that you can never un-see.

294
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,919
Well, where's Alex? She said
she was gonna catch up with you guys.

295
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:52,365
She never did.

296
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:57,404
But weirdly enough, there's an actress
in the movie that looks just like her.

297
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,007
- Really?
- Yeah.

298
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,808
She even sounded kind of like her.

299
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:07,293
And she was wearing
the exact same outfit as her.

300
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:09,695
Weird, right?

301
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:12,572
Yeah, weird.

302
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,017
What did you get
on that deductive reasoning test?

303
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,370
A 99.

304
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:19,180
Even weirder.

305
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:23,099
Would you guys excuse me
for just one moment?

306
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,988
<i>Alex Russo has messed up
And put herself in a movie</i>

307
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:33,833
<i>Put me also in that movie</i>

308
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:37,630
That didn't even sound like a spell.

309
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:39,834
Okay, what rhymes with movie?

310
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,920
Boovie, juvie, loovie. Plant.

311
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,760
Plant.

312
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,162
This is gonna take a while.

313
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,802
Hey, you're Ruby Donahue.

314
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:01,003
- Who are you?
- I'm Alex.

315
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:04,445
Are you the evil sorority sister who's
come back from the grave to punish us

316
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:08,537
for our cute but reckless destruction
of perfectly good pillows?

317
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,138
What? No.

318
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,378
I'm just a kid. I don't even know
what I'm doing in this scary movie.

319
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,063
Me neither.
This was all my agent's idea.

320
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:23,183
Oh, there's that music again.
Where is it coming from?

321
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,910
This is the part where I run screaming
into the steam-filled showers,

322
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,991
which have been left running
for no reason at all, so...

323
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:32,271
Oh, okay.
Well, it was nice meeting you.

324
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:33,663
You too.

325
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,799
No, screaming and running
towards the masked villain

326
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,439
is probably the worst way
to stay away from the masked villain.

327
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,125
Right.

328
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:55,809
<i>... ln a groovy movie</i>

329
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:57,524
A little 1970s, but it worked.

330
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:00,168
Justin. What are you doing here?

331
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:03,333
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm saving the day.

332
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:08,693
Oh, who are they?

333
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:18,143
My hero.

334
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:29,910
<i>Oh, no, Jerry.
Hugs and Mrs. is sold out.</i>

335
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:34,235
It's supposed to be Hugh Grant's
most romantic role to date.

336
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,192
Dear?

337
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:38,276
<i>That's bunk.</i>

338
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:41,271
<i>That's bunk.</i>

339
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:43,234
That's bunk.

340
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:45,036
- Jerry.
- Yes.

341
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:48,842
<i>You know, honey, I was thinking,
we should see Icevarks again.</i>

342
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,041
I'm telling you,
there's something weird going on

343
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,766
<i>in Night of the Halloween
Sorority Party Disaster 2.</i>

344
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:58,727
I know. I've seen that film 16 times.

345
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,416
And then all of a sudden,
there are these new characters in it.

346
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,686
Maybe it's a director's cut.

347
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:06,448
Those characters of Alex and Justin
have such chemistry.

348
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,531
It's like they grew up together.

349
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,062
Oh, miss?

350
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:17,466
Two tickets for that disaster party
bingo Halloween thing, yeah.

351
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:26,388
Justin, stand up.

352
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:29,666
Forget about me, Alex. Save yourself.

353
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:32,267
Seriously, Justin. Just stand up.

354
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,036
Okay.

355
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:41,478
- Oh, Justin, do something.
- Why me?

356
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:44,278
- Because you're the older brother.
- What am I supposed to do?

357
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,875
- Improvise something.
- Right, okay.

358
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:50,646
<i>We've had enough of all this fear
So hurry up and get us out of here</i>

359
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,642
- What happened?
- We're in a basement.

360
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:55,842
Yeah.

361
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:58,250
In the basement of the sorority house
in the movie.

362
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,491
Dad wasn't kidding.

363
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:02,086
When you improv a spell,
you gotta say exactly what you mean.

364
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,493
He's still coming. Hurry!

365
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,182
Don't yell at me. I'm trying to think.

366
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:15,576
<i>I'm scared of what might happen next
So take us to the Mondoplex</i>

367
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:18,343
Are we back?

368
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,142
Yeah. It's the theatre lobby.
I think we're safe.

369
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:24,867
Sorry I got you into this. Literally.

370
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:28,193
It's all right. It was kind of fun
being in a sorority-girl movie.

371
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:30,592
Yeah, well,
it wasn't what I expected at all.

372
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:33,227
Well, maybe you were just trying
to grow up too fast.

373
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,793
I guess I was.

374
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,998
Sorry, and thanks for helping me out.

375
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,842
I won't hang out
with your friends anymore.

376
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:42,965
You won't tell anyone
I screamed like a girl?

377
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:46,046
I probably will,
but that's what little sisters do.

378
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:47,968
Oh, no, Justin. Look.

379
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,370
She's coming right for us.

380
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:52,521
Split up.

381
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,565
They can't get both of us. Go.

382
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:23,953
- It's just us.
- Psych.

383
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:25,224
Silly.
