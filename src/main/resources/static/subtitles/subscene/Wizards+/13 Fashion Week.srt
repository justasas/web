1
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:12,799
Alex, can you give me a hand?
I got one more piece left.

2
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:14,802
Whoa!

3
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,674
Ooh. You better fix that.

4
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,210
Alex! I just went through a
whole horn of unicorn glue.

5
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:26,647
Do you know how many hornless unicorns
are running around because of this lamp?

6
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:28,983
Yes, and now they're called ponies.

7
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:30,451
You remember what those were,

8
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,586
you were scared of
them until last year.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,657
I don't care what anyone says,
those things are dangerous.

10
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:38,827
I'll just fix it the way
it should've been fixed

11
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:40,195
in the first place.

12
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:41,830
Red Skies at night Fix it right!

13
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:45,764
Wait...

14
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:48,134
Alex, your wand just
shorted the system out.

15
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:52,705
Dad, did you forget to pay
the wizard power bill?

16
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:56,076
Not this time. I haven't missed
once since we can pay by wand.

17
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:59,647
The wizard world is
experiencing rolling blackouts.

18
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:02,751
- We don't have our powers?!
- Just temporarily.

19
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:05,153
Someone left the door open
at the wizard power plant.

20
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:06,421
All the dragons got out.

21
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:08,356
It's gonna be a while
till they get back.

22
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,192
More importantly,
why did you break the lamp?

23
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:18,965
Look, we could talk about
who broke the lamp,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,168
and spend all our time
on whose fault it was,

25
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:25,205
or we could just live in the moment,
where Justin fixes it.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,941
Now, I don't know about you,

27
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:29,444
but I choose to live in
the moment and move on.

28
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,913
- Who's with me?
- Yeah, nobody.

29
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,316
Justin, just fix the
lamp before Mom gets back

30
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,618
- from her spa weekend.
- Da...

31
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:40,654
Sleep with one eye open tonight.

32
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,325
Ooh, what's that, Daddy?

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,961
Spare parts for
Justin's robot wife?

34
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,898
It's a Wizinko machine.
I was going to demonstrate it,

35
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:53,934
but since powers are down
it's gonna have to wait.

36
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,302
What's it supposed to do?

37
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:56,937
It turns  two-dimensis

38
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,706
into three-dimensional copies.

39
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:02,244
Maybe it can take Justin's
two-dimensional personality

40
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:06,282
- and turn that into something.
- That didn't make any sense.

41
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:07,984
But were you hurt a little bit?

42
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,888
- A little.
- Yeah, then it made sense.

43
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:15,427
* Well, you kw everything's
gonna be a breeze *

44
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:17,530
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

45
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:19,765
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,266
* Yes please *

47
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,233
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

48
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,200
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

49
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:27,435
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

50
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:28,968
* That's what I said *

51
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,270
* Everything is not what it seems *

52
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:36,075
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

53
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:39,945
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

54
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:44,250
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

55
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:47,652
* Evething is not what it seems *

56
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:51,488
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

57
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:55,226
* Be careful t to mess with
the balance of things *

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,429
* Because everything is not *

59
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,498
* What it seems *

60
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:10,499

61
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:13,641
Dude, what is going on?!

62
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:15,276
Did the pretty bus
break down outside,

63
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:17,612
or do I have another
stye in my eye?

64
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:21,115
No, it's Fashion Week.

65
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:23,183
There's models all
over New York City.

66
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:30,855
Hey, maybe we can get a couple
of these girls to play some

67
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,691
Dungeons & Gargoyles with us.

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,127
All right, but we're
gonna need a plan.

69
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:39,563
Something better than following
the girls around for an hour,

70
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,965
and just when we're ready to
speak to them, we wimp out,

71
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,367
make up some lame excuse
like we're tying our shoes,

72
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:47,036
and th go see a movie we've
already seen four times.

73
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,071
I don't know, bro,
Robert Downey, Jr.

74
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,572
is so good in that mov.

75
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:53,840
He is so good. - You know
what I'm talking about?

76
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,076
- No, Zeke. We gotta do this.
- All right.

77
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,278
I don't want to end up

78
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,012
the male equivalent
of chicks with cats.

79
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:01,580
Hey, I have a cat.

80
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:04,847
We gotta do this now.

81
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:08,384
Alex?

82
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,956
I just scored the
gig of a lifetime,

83
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,625
working for world-famous designer,
Mr. Frenchy.

84
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:19,861
Wow. I just ate a bunch of sugar.

85
00:04:19,895 --> 00:04:21,563
I guess we're both
having good days.

86
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:25,366
Come on, this is a big deal.

87
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:27,335
I was picked out of
five thousand applicants

88
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,104
to work with him.

89
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:31,305
If I do a good job,

90
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,108
it could jump-start
my career in design.

91
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:38,043
Imagine... the whole
world dressed like me.

92
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,346
Yeah, I don't have an
imagination that big.

93
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:48,053
Mr. Frenchy is known for
his one-of-a-kind designs,

94
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,422
and he's trusted me with
this year's newest creation.

95
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,190
Wait, is he that dude that made

96
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,325
that credit card dress
you showed me st year?

97
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,960
Yeah, and the playing card
dress and the balloon dress...

98
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:59,228
Actually, the balloon
dress didn't work out,

99
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,430
'cause there was also a dress
made out of porcupine needles.

100
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:05,699
I remember that dress.

101
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,368
It is so funny when people
you don't know explode.

102
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:19,078
Mr. Frenchy doesn't want anyone

103
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:20,880
taking pictures of it be the show,

104
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:23,248
so he trusted me with it,
because no one would guess

105
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,883
his high school intern had it.

106
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,384
- Wow. Let me see.
- No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:32,922
No one sees.

108
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:35,690
I need you to use magic to lock
this up in a magic lock box,

109
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:37,158
or a magic treasure chest or...

110
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,626
Oh, how about a gic dress vault?

111
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,994
That would be perfect!

112
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:42,929
Yeah, too bad that doesn't exist.

113
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:46,798
- Plus, my powers are down.
- That stinks. Well, bye.

114
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:48,833
Harper...

115
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,235
I can still help you.

116
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,203
u can keep it in my room.
It'll be safe there.

117
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:55,105
- OK, well, bye.
- Harper?

118
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,442
Do you really want to make
me use a bunch of words

119
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:02,110
to confuse you into
letting me keep it?

120
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,777
No. Here.

121
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:06,112
Thank you. You jt saved
us a lot of time.

122
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,897
Are you trying to walk lik?

123
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,636
No. Are you trying to look
like a waiter at Fiesta Grande?

124
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,005
- What's with the tray?
- What's with the dress?

125
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,106
- I asked you first.
- A series of small snacks

126
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:37,974
is healthier than gorging
yourself at meals. Your turn.

127
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:41,044
It's an original,
one-of-a-kind Mr. Frenchy

128
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:43,645
that Harper's trusted me
with until the fashion show.

129
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,781
You think that the best
way to protect the dress

130
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,883
is by prancing around
your room wearing it?

131
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:51,420
What if someone, like me,
were to come along and go, "Whoa!"

132
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:54,322
Justin, stop! That's not funny.

133
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,924
Oh, but this is.

134
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:03,199
You're right. This is funny.

135
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,167
So funny.

136
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:06,569
But you know what's nnier?

137
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:08,970
How much I love my sister!

138
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:12,005
Justin, no! Stop! Let me down.

139
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,644
Turn the music down.

140
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:39,960
Dude! When are we going
to make our move?

141
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:41,628
We've been sitting here forever.

142
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:44,062
We're not just sitting here,
we're coming up with a plan.

143
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,529
I read that supermodels
love guys who are connected.

144
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:48,530
Oh! I'm totally connected.

145
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:51,701
I get ten percent off at t.

146
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:53,135
Why don't we hold on to that one?

147
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,670
Follow my lead.

148
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,850
Hey.

149
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,184
Hi.

150
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:11,318
So, my dad owns this place.

151
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:13,619
- Just sayin'.
- He says stuff.

152
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:16,922
Wod you like a free refill
on one of those beverages?

153
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:19,691
- Gratis.
- Sure.

154
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:23,192
You guys are kinda weird.
I like it.

155
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,527
Well, I get ten percent
off at the Puzzle Zoo.

156
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,895
I love the Puze Zoo.

157
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:40,739
- My dad owns this place.
- You already said that.

158
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:44,242
I get ten percent off
at the Puzzle Zoo.

159
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:48,010
- You already said that.
- Can you give us a moment?

160
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:49,211
[chuckle

161
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,282
It's goi great!

162
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,251
No. We need something
more to talk about.

163
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,819
All right, well, I mean...

164
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,654
One more punch and I
get a free smoothie.

165
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,022
Perfect.

166
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,194
Where'd they go? To the bathroom?

167
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,863
Yeah. Sure.

168
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:09,664
Why don't u stay here
and wait for 'em.

169
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:11,365
OK.

170
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,478
Justin lied. There's no
story about me in here.

171
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,414
Hey, Alex.

172
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:32,650
Hey, Harper...

173
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:35,152
I want the bad news first.

174
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:37,220
How did you know what
I was ing to say?

175
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:39,188
I figured out your "good news,
bad news" smile

176
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:40,656
a week after I met you.

177
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,861
OK, so I need to figure out a way

178
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:48,530
to make "I ruined the
dress" sound not so bad.

179
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:49,964
You ruined the dress?!

180
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:51,432
After you made me give it to you?

181
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,300
I got the opportunity
of a lifetime here,

182
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,967
and it's about to
blow up in my face.

183
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:58,371
Look, we could talk about
who ruined t dress...

184
00:09:58,405 --> 00:09:59,872
You did.

185
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:03,442
Or, we couldive in the moment.

186
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,710
Now, I choose to live
in the mome and move on.

187
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:08,345
- Are you with me?
- Only because I have to be,

188
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,313
because you're the one
who got us in trble.

189
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:12,848
Great, we're moving on. It's good.

190
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:18,218
Finkle. Whers my schmata?

191
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,653
Mr. Frenchy, I need
to tell you something.

192
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,021
Your tone implies it
won't be pleasant.

193
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,691
And Frenchy's ino mood to
hear anything unpleasant.

194
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,060
I just snt an hour
looking for my Bluetooth.

195
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,695
It was in my ear the whole time.

196
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,098
OK, then.

197
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,201
Tell him something pleasant, Alex.

198
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,305
We have black and
white cookies today.

199
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,908
I was hoping to hear something about
my newest one-of-a-kind dress.

200
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,677
I hope it's in a
temperature-controlled room.

201
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:52,614
The thing about your dress is...

202
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:55,716
Is... That it's totally fine.

203
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,351
She's doing such a great job.

204
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:58,918
You picked the right girl for this.

205
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:02,888
I guess I did, whoever you are.

206
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,656
I knew I could count
on you, Finkle.

207
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:06,557
Oh, excuse me.

208
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:09,260
I'm receiving communications.
Go for Frenchy.

209
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,162
Al, oh, my gosh. This is great.

210
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,364
You have a plan for what
to do about the dress?

211
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:18,900
Yeah. Like I said, my plan is
"moving on" from the dress.

212
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:21,269
Moving on? You really
think that's gonna work?

213
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:22,971
Finkle, we're in trouble.

214
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:26,740
He's on to us.
I knew this wasn't gonna work.

215
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:29,641
They double booked the
location for my fashion show.

216
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:31,376
My show is... is...

217
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,478
In situations like this,
I usually say, "hosed."

218
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:37,780
...hosed!

219
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:44,290
Mr. Frenchy, why don't you
have the fashion show here?

220
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:47,328
Here? I don't even know
what this place is.

221
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,430
Is it a subway station
or a sandwich shop?

222
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:53,432
It's one-of-a-kind, just like you.

223
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:57,835
Who else would have an amazing
high-fashion fashion show

224
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,603
at a sandwich shop?

225
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:01,772
Or we could have it at my house.

226
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,174
My mom just put plastic slip
covers in the living room,

227
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,308
so we're allowed in now.

228
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:07,042
But no shoes.

229
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:10,947
Oh, that's great. Let's have
it at the sandwich shop.

230
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,449
- Problem solved.
- Excellent.

231
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,985
One more good idea and I might
bother to learn your name.

232
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,185
It's Alex.

233
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,890
I'd prefer something like Daphne.
Chew on it.

234
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:27,131
Great, you solved that problem.
But what about the dress?

235
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,434
I know. I know.

236
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:33,669
- Moving on.
- Thank you.

237
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,504
When this place is
crawling with models

238
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,173
and his fashion show is going great

239
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,675
he'll have forgotten all
about his little dress.

240
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,777
You're telling me he's
going to forget all about

241
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:44,379
his one-of-a-kind dress that he
trusted me to ard with my life

242
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:46,046
just 'cause there's
a show going on?

243
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:50,783
Wow. Someone's not moving on.

244
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:04,540
Let's go, people.
We've only got two hours.

245
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,844
And no one's even sweating.
Except this guy.

246
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,280
Hi. I'm the owner. Look,
this place has never been busier.

247
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:15,682
I just want to thank you
for choosing my restaurant

248
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:16,816
for your fashion show.

249
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,318
Oh, so this is a sandwich shop?

250
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,486
I just ignored the big subway
car standing back there.

251
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,054
Oh, sandwiches.

252
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,322
No, don't eat these. They're bad.

253
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:28,224
I made these a couple of days ago.

254
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,525
Then I lost them,
but then I found them.

255
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,262
Excuse me while I pretend
to take a phone call.

256
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:35,796
Go for Frenchy.

257
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,665
Oh, Alex, honey, do me a favor.

258
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,933
Get rid of these sandwiches.
They're no good.

259
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:42,601
I'm all about helping.

260
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:46,472
Oh, my gosh.
This might actually work.

261
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,173
He hasn't asked me about the dress.

262
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,175
See, that's the
beauty of moving on.

263
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,810
I've got to get rid
of these sandwiches.

264
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:52,811
My dad said they weren't good.

265
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,781
Or they can get rid of them for me.

266
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,649
All right, less work for me. Good.

267
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,555
I wish we lived in a world where you could
just walk up to a model and be like,

268
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,625
"What's up? You want to play
Dungeons & Gargoyles with us?"

269
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,527
Sure, that sounds like fun.

270
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,063
Can my friends come?

271
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:16,167
You don't play
Dungeons & Gargoyles.

272
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:18,969
Oh, just because I'm beautiful,
means I can't be smart?

273
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:20,837
Or an eleventh level cleric?

274
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:23,239
- Hot.
- Hot.

275
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:25,674
When you guys are finished
with your sandwiches,

276
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,943
we'll go upstairs and play.

277
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:33,316
- Did that just happen?
- I am not sure.

278
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,684
I'm gonna put some
cologne on just in case.

279
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:37,953
Cologne.

280
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,421
My shower soap has
scent built right in.

281
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,122
- Three!
- Uh-oh!

282
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:48,191
I love this game.

283
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,159
So you're in the cavern
and you can either use

284
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,861
- your plus three sword or...
- My magic missile spell.

285
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,996
Nicely played. I forgot
you had a bag of weapons.

286
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,299
Can I just say,

287
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,036
we're playing Dungeons &
Gargoyles with models?

288
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,638
You've said that
every five minutes.

289
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:08,774
I'm gonna keep saying it until
it's proven not to be true.

290
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:09,808
Yeah!

291
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:12,611
Oh! There they are.

292
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,079
Guys, we need the girls
downstairs to get ready.

293
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,315
No, Alex. Not till we're done.

294
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,954
That's a pretty awesome
gargoyle noise.

295
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:26,223
That's not a gargoyle noise,
that's my tummy.

296
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:28,657
I don't think I'm feeling too well.

297
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:31,424
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door.

298
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:43,505
Uh-oh! Hearing people getting
sick makes me get sick.

299
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:46,640
What's wrong with them?
! Why are thy sick?!

300
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:47,908
I don't know.

301
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,110
- Did they eat something bad?
- No.

302
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:53,279
All they ate were these sandwiches
that Dad said didn't taste good.

303
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,047
Did he say they didn't taste
good or they were no good?

304
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,584
What's the difference?

305
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:05,554
Way to go. You ruined my
one shot with these girls.

306
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:08,422
I'm coming ladies. I got hair ties.

307
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,725
How are we supposed
to have a fashion show

308
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,460
to distract Mr.
Frenchy from the fact

309
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,863
that we ruined his dress,
when all the models are sick?

310
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:17,397
Hmm.

311
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:19,999
Somehow we've moved on all the
way back around to the dress.

312
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,306
I think I have an idea.
Magic's back.

313
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:29,607
Since we don't have a lot of time,

314
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:31,510
we're gonna skip the part
where I do magic badly,

315
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:32,644
and just make it all work out.

316
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:35,746
- We can skip that part?
- We'll see.

317
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:41,552
I just need to get one thing
from Justin's room to help us.

318
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,920
Why are we in your room to
get stuff from Justin's room?

319
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:46,657
Because we're getting stuff from
the box under my bed that says,

320
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:48,660
"Justin's Favorite
Things from His Room."

321
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:54,299
I steal this stuff to make up
for the times he's annoyed me.

322
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,569
Hey, a Captain Jim Bob
Sherwood lunch box.

323
00:16:57,603 --> 00:16:59,237
I took that one because the actual

324
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:00,804
Captain Jim Bob Sherwood just died,

325
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:02,572
and the price for that thing
went through the roof.

326
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,710
One poster of supermodel Bibi Rockford,
and we're good to go.

327
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,380
But how... I'm tired of fighting.

328
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:13,248
Let's just do it, whatever it is.

329
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:20,389
We're gonna make a magical
copy of Bibi Rockford.

330
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,536
Wow. She's even prettier in person.

331
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,571
Thanks for taking me off
your brother's wall.

332
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:43,172
He was always staring at me.

333
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:50,043
Why am I still holding this?

334
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:51,411
This is so great.

335
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:53,079
The only thing that'd
make it better is if

336
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,047
we had the newspaper
dress for Mr. Frenchy.

337
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,815
One step ahead of you.

338
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:59,684
Lucky for you I took a picture
of myself in the dress.

339
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:12,927
Goodness, I do look
good in that dress.

340
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:15,528
Bibi Rockford, come on,
put that dress on.

341
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:16,996
We've got a fashion show to save.

342
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,698
No. I like this dress.

343
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,501
Alex, can I talk to you
over there for a second?

344
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,037
Sure.

345
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:35,478
We brushed elbows when we were
getting sick at the same bowl.

346
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:38,580
It was hot and gross
at the same time.

347
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,655
Excuse me. Can someone
direct me to Hair and Makeup?

348
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,458
Oh, my gosh. Bibi Rockford.

349
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,126
Oh, it's you.

350
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,529
- Don't stare at me.
- Sorry.

351
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,532
Dungeons & Gargoyles?
I love this game. Can I play?

352
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,901
Do all models play
Dungeons & Gargoyles?

353
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:01,803
No, but all supermodels do.

354
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:06,375
It's a great stress reliever from being,
I don't know, super.

355
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:10,811
- Where did you come from?
- From Justin's room.

356
00:19:10,846 --> 00:19:14,781
All right, Justin!

357
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,716
My room... Sweet!

358
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,451
Alex!

359
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:22,120
Are we going to talk about
playing Dungeons & Gargoyles,

360
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:26,859
or are we going to go on this quest
for the Gold Dragon's treasure?

361
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,663
I'd be OK if the world
ended right now.

362
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,565
Well, you better be
'cause it might, OK?

363
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:40,337
Wow, you really convinced
yourself to get that dress off.

364
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:43,373
I have this pressure point in my
shoulder that only I know about.

365
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:47,676
Come on, Bibi Rockford.
We've got a fashion show to save.

366
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,878
I'm tired of modeling.

367
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:54,682
All that walking up and down,
up and down. It's boring.

368
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,786
I'd rather play
Dungeons & Gargoyles.

369
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:05,692
Wait a minute, Bibi Rockford
is playing your game.

370
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:08,460
You used magic to
turn her into a geek.

371
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:10,629
You used magic to bring
my poster to life.

372
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:12,763
Fine. I used magic.

373
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:16,000
Tell her the game is over, she has to
go downstairs to save the fashion show.

374
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:18,603
I guess I could, but aren't
you the one always saying

375
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:21,305
that when things go bad,
you should just move on?

376
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:23,407
Pull up a chair,
play some Dungeons & Gargoyles

377
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:25,174
and have a big bowl of "moving on."

378
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:28,310
- Is that what I sound like?
- Yes! Oh, sorry.

379
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:29,911
That question was for you, Justin.

380
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,681
Yes.

381
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:34,949
If I say I'm sorry for stealing
your stuff, you'll help?

382
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,584
- Yes.
- That "sorry" didn't count?

383
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,218
- Nope.
- Fine. I'm sorry. We done?

384
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:40,220
I want my Captain Jim Bob
Sherwood lunch box back.

385
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:41,553
- Fine.
- Thanks. I'm on it.

386
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:47,192
Sorry, Zeke, your cloak
of invisibility ripped,

387
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:50,227
- you've been exposed.
- Oh, my gosh, I'm blushing.

388
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,764
- Game's over, people.
- What? No way, Jose. No.

389
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:57,232
Yes way. I'm behind and
I'm a sore loser. See?

390
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:58,567
No!

391
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:02,972
You fool! What have you done? No!

392
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,774
I did what I had to do, Zeke.

393
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:09,143
OK... Come on,
Bibi Rockford, let's go.

394
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:11,513
Leave my brother and his
weird friend to themselves.

395
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:16,383
Fine, but if I'm gonna walk
the runway, so are you.

396
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:19,152
No, that's not gonna happen. No.

397
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:22,056
Right, my friend is not
gonna give up her dignity

398
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,125
for the sake of my fashion career.

399
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,161
She'd rather just move
on and live in the...

400
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,897
- Fine. We'll do it.
- Thanks! You're the best!

401
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:48,898
