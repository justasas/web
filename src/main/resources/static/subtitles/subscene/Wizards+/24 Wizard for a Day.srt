1
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:08,003
Oh, no. Please tell me that's
not a new robot you're building.

2
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:10,674
Uh, no, it's a pencil holder
I made Dad for his birthday.

3
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:14,001
This is the new robot I'm building.

4
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:17,230
A pencil holder?
It looks like an old soup can.

5
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:19,359
That's because it
was an old soup can.

6
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:21,356
Now it's a heartfelt
gift I've made for Dad

7
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,288
by removing the label and writing
a clever slogan on the side.

8
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:28,223
"Number one Dad,
number two pencil."

9
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:31,720
- [laughs]
- Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:35,387
Well, I also charmed it to
magically sharpen pencils.

11
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,885
[whirring]

12
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:43,716
Yes, because it's
so hard to do this.

13
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:47,183
I didn't get him anything.
Put my name on it.

14
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:49,782
Oh, no, you're not sharing
credit for my gift this year.

15
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,448
Fine, if that's the
way you want it.

16
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,612
ion.

17
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:56,779
I'm not scared of you, Alex.

18
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,579
Stop staring at me.

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,846
Max, you're not gonna
wrap that cat up

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,880
and give it to Dad for his
birthday again, are you?

21
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:10,380
He loves getting
this cat every year.

22
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:13,013
[chuckles] He thinks
he has a collection.

23
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:14,880
Hello, number eight.

24
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:17,980
Max, it's time you started
learning from your big bro.

25
00:01:18,014 --> 00:01:19,713
So I'm gonna let you jump on board

26
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:21,880
with my thoughtful and unique gift.

27
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,582
Wait, you'll let him put his
name on your gift but not mine?

28
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:27,950
Fine. Max,
before you agree to that,

29
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:29,551
I'm gonna let you in on my gift.

30
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:32,051
- What's your gift?
- I don't know yet.

31
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:35,286
But you can be sure it's not
gonna look like something

32
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,554
you could find in a
kindergarten classroom.

33
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:41,456
Let's see: cat, soup can, nothing.

34
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:44,024
I'm gonna stick with the cat.

35
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:48,193
Hey, look who it is.
It's the birthday guy.

36
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:49,760
The guy whose birthday it is.

37
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:52,262
Obviously, I'm not ignoring it,
because I keep saying it.

38
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,496
Birthday, birthday, birthday.

39
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,663
Oh. Look, Theresa. The kids
are talking about my birthday.

40
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,264
OK, honey, I get it.

41
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:00,931
I forgot to say "happy birthday"

42
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,332
right when you woke
up this morning.

43
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:06,768
Uh, Daddy, Justin and I
got you a gift together.

44
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:09,170
Play along, or your robot gets it.

45
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:10,704
I got ten of them.

46
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,839
Dad, here's a gift from me.

47
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:16,674
It's a homemade,
magic pencil holder.

48
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,377
Oh! It's perfect. It combines
two of my greatest loves:

49
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:24,379
Canned foods and things
that hold other things.

50
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:30,082
Perfect? [laughs] I'm so
glad that you like it.

51
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,486
Um, that's from me too, Dad.

52
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,489
He seems to like it, so I'm in.

53
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,594
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

54
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,628
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,696
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

56
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:53,531
* Yes, please *

57
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:55,366
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

58
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,033
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

59
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,668
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

60
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:01,236
* That's what I said *

61
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,406
* Everything is not what it seems *

62
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,277
* When you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

63
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:11,947
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

64
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,583
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

65
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:19,685
* Everything is not what it seems *

66
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,954
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

67
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:27,390
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

68
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:30,691
* Because everything is not *

69
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:33,593
* What it seems *

70
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:40,594

71
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:44,202
- What are you doing?
- You'll be interested to know

72
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:46,370
that I've found the
perfect present for Dad.

73
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:49,672
[gasps] She's gonna turn
her lips into a zipper?

74
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,240
Ooh! That's a good shot.

75
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,774
How long have you been
working on that one?

76
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:54,308
Since the day Mom
came home and said,

77
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,910
"Look, there's your
little sister, Justin."

78
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,915
Well, I'm giving Dad the gift of
magic powers for his birthday.

79
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,083
What are you talking about?
Our powers are limited.

80
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:09,285
We can't give magical
powers to a mortal.

81
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,654
Ah! That's where you're wrong,
"Johnny Can't Skip."

82
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:15,191
Skipping is an
unnatural body motion.

83
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:17,127
There's a moment when both
feet are off the ground.

84
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:18,963
It's way too unpredictable.
[scoffs]

85
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,401
Look, I've done a lot of research

86
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:24,802
and there's this thing
called Merlin's Hat.

87
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:27,104
It gives whoever wears it
unlimited magical wishes

88
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:28,271
for a whole day.

89
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:31,705
- You actually researched that?
- Sort of.

90
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,107
It was on the first page I
opened up to in this book.

91
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,212
Well, you have to perform a deed of
incredible selflessness and bravery

92
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:40,014
in the wizard world
to get Merlin's Hat.

93
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:41,682
We all know that's
not gonna happen.

94
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,919
- Oh, really? Hold this.
- Really. No. OK.

95
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:55,123
[coughing]

96
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:59,761
- Alex, are you OK?
- [coughs]

97
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:01,863
- I think so.
- What happened?

98
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:03,398
Nothing much.

99
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:05,567
- Really?
- Yeah,

100
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:08,103
if you call saving an
entire wizard rec center

101
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:10,472
from a dragon attack
"nothing much"!

102
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,175
Check it out. Merlin's Hat.

103
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,211
By the way, we're having
dragon heart for dinner.

104
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,351
And so, to prove there
are more than only

105
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:26,453
two good children in this family,

106
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:29,555
I'd like to present my father
with a birthday present.

107
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,525
It's probably earrings or
something else she wanted.

108
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:39,296
Alex, is this what I think it is?

109
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:42,532
- Is this Merlin's Hat?
- Yes, and when you put it on,

110
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,068
you have unlimited magical
wishes for a whole day.

111
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:47,770
Awesome. - That's from me too,
Dad. [chuckles]

112
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:50,739
- What about our pencil holder?
- Unlimited wishes, pencil holder.

113
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,674
Come on, I'm not an idiot.

114
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:59,314
- This is amazing, Alex.
- [clears throat]

115
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:02,717
And Max. You've given
me powers again.

116
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,385
Yes, she's pulled magic
into the real world

117
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,654
for selfish reasons.

118
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:07,322
What could possibly go wrong?

119
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,961
Come on, Dad. Get up and say,
"Goonga galoonga," and make a wish.

120
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:16,264
You don't really have to say,
"Goonga galoonga." It's just funny.

121
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,169
All right. I'm a little rusty,
but here goes...

122
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:26,274
Goonga galoonga. [laughs]

123
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:27,675
Look at that!

124
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,413
- Pencils?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:35,950
To put in my new
favorite pencil holder.

126
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:39,186
- Pencils?
- I'm back on Justin's gift.

127
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:44,025
- Pencils?
- Hey, look at that!

128
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:46,927
They're already sharp!
Thank you, Justin.

129
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:51,099
Uh, doesn't anybody hear me repeating
the word "pencils" over here?

130
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:54,435
I don't know if you noticed,
but Dad just used your gift

131
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:55,803
to make my gift better.

132
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:57,738
- I noticed.
- I know.

133
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:00,141
Dad, you realize you can
do anything you want

134
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:02,076
with that hat, right? Literally.

135
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,677
Anything at all,
in the whole world.

136
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:07,413
You want me to try it again, huh?

137
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:11,249
All right, uh... Mmm... There's...

138
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:12,718
Ooh, I got it.

139
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:18,456
Goonga galoonga.

140
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,427
Yes! Huh? [laughs]

141
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:28,034
- A milkshake?
- Not just any milkshake.

142
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:32,973
This is a Milky Way Milkshake
from The Asteroid Belt.

143
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:36,276
That was his favorite restaurant when
he was a kid in the neighborhood.

144
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,512
He reminds me of it every
time he has a milkshake.

145
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:39,746
So pretty much every day.

146
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:42,815
The place doesn't exist anymore.

147
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,285
It had this cool '50s sci-fi theme.

148
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,691
Mm. Boy, I forgot how
exciting it is to have powers!

149
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:53,759
Dad, you're wrecking
the word "exciting."

150
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:57,530
Face it, Alex. Your gift
just isn't as impressive

151
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,365
as you thought it would be.

152
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,767
I don't know about that.
I'd say this milkshake

153
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:03,469
is the next best thing to having

154
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:06,204
the actual Asteroid
Belt open again.

155
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:09,140
Open again. Interesting.

156
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:21,381
Goonga galoonga.
That is fun to say.

157
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:29,323
Guys, come down here
and see how great I am!

158
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:38,198
Oh, my gosh! Alex,
what have you done?

159
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:42,069
I just wanted to show Dad
how to use the hat right.

160
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:45,638
It looks just like
The Asteroid Belt,

161
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:48,808
with the rocket ships and...

162
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:50,876
The chair's the same!

163
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,514
Honey, look! The original
Milky Way Milkshake machine.

164
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:02,151
I love this so much!

165
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:04,220
Really? You love it?

166
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:08,923
Did you hear that?
He loves it so much.

167
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:16,963
- This is incredible, Alex.
- Yeah, it's, uh, also from me too, Dad.

168
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:20,733
This was a great trip
down memory lane.

169
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:23,702
And I will never forget it.

170
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:27,972
Now you should tn it
back into the sub shop.

171
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:30,975
- Turn it back? But you just got it.
- No, I know. It was fun.

172
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,044
But, you know,
you should turn it back.

173
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,747
You heard him, Alex. Turn it back.

174
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:39,750
Excuse me.

175
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:42,153
This looks like a place I used
to go to when I was a kid.

176
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:45,223
- I'm sorry, we're closed.
- Oh!

177
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:48,592
I'd pay anything for one
of those milkshakes.

178
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:54,264
Anything?

179
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:55,432
Ten dollars.

180
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,233
We'll take three.

181
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:00,536
Maybe we should keep it
like this for a while.

182
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:03,606
- You should have said 15.
- Ooh! Welcome.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,302
[lauaughs] This place is a hit.

184
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,471
I've never seen it
this crowded before.

185
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:16,975
We are raking it in.

186
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:20,644
[sighs] See how ppy Dad is?

187
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:24,080
My gift is so good,
I don't even want you on it, Max.

188
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:27,549
You're off of it. - What'd I
do to get kicked off the gift?

189
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,751
Restaurants themes like
this are just a fad.

190
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:31,719
They never last. Believe me.

191
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:36,724
Mr. Russo, we're with the Waverly
Place Merchants' Association

192
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:39,126
and we've come to present
you with an award

193
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,927
for having a fantastic fad

194
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:43,596
that's not going
anywhere anytime soon.

195
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:49,200
We hereby declare you King
of the New York Milkshake

196
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,769
for your delicious
Milky Way Milkshake.

197
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:55,105
King of the New York Milkshake?
Are you serious?

198
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:58,105
Perhaps this
official-looking certificate

199
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,443
- will answer that question.
- Oh! Thank you.

200
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:05,880
Theresa, check it out.

201
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:09,683
I guess it's no surprise when
you marry Prince Charming,

202
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:11,984
he grows up to be a king.

203
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:16,387
You know, that pbably should've
seemed arrogant to me,

204
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:20,390
but I find your newfound
confidence very appealing.

205
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:26,128
Alex, your gift just keeps
getting better and better.

206
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,663
I'm glad you think so, Dad.

207
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:30,133
But could you say that a little
louder so Justin can hear you?

208
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,902
- I'm standing right here.
- I know.

209
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:35,604
I just wanted to hear
him say it louder.

210
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,914
Thank you all for including
me in your family meeting.

211
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:46,849
It's better than how
we do it at my house:

212
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:50,186
from separate rooms
on walkie-talkies.

213
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:55,824
Now... as you all know,

214
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:59,492
we're no longer that
crummy train restaurant.

215
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:02,594
We are now an amazing
spaceship restaurant.

216
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:06,458
Yes, amazing. Put that in your
family meeting notes, Justin.

217
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,627
A-M-A-Zing. On you.

218
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,334
The bear, me, you: bear trap.

219
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:23,706
OK, everybody,
let's listen to your father.

220
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,474
He's taking charge,
for once in his life,

221
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,943
and I, for one,
can't get enough of it.

222
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:29,912
Now, with our new popularity,

223
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:32,715
it's gonna take more people
per shift to cover the demand.

224
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,883
- Oh!
- Whoa.

225
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,955
I thought this restaurant
represented the future.

226
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:40,989
Shouldn't there be less
work in the future?

227
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,993
Oh!

228
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:48,196
- Harper, you're hired.
- Yes!

229
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,400
Oh, I hope I didn't
sound too desperate.

230
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:54,470
My mom says that's how people
get taken advantage of.

231
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:57,339
[laughs] Oh, Harper,
no one's taking advantage of you.

232
00:12:57,374 --> 00:12:58,941
You've got the first four shifts.

233
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,644
And you guys have all the rest.

234
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:04,379
Thanks a lot, Alex.

235
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:06,681
Now I don't want to hear
any complaints because

236
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:09,484
I also got us great new uniforms.

237
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,185
This can't be good.

238
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:16,123
You're all waiter-nauts.

239
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:19,894
They're not the most
comfortable outfits,

240
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:23,030
but you'll get used to the
limited range of motion.

241
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:28,334
Harper, I don't know how
much more of this I can take.

242
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:30,070
What are you talking about?

243
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:32,205
This is more breathable
than most things I wear.

244
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,240
- [ringing]
- Oh! Oh!

245
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:36,976
It's time for our
hourly rocket launch

246
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:39,579
here at The Waverly Asteroid Belt.

247
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:43,917
Where the deals are
out of this world!

248
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:46,820
Dad, you're selling food,
not electronics.

249
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:49,356
- For now.
- Ready!

250
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:55,095
Five, four, three, two, one!

251
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,366
- [rumbling]
- [all] Whoa!

252
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:08,775
Salute!

253
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:14,713
- You didn't salute.
- I didn't do a lot of things.

254
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,920
Justin, you win.
This was a bad idea.

255
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:22,722
You have to help me
get rid of this place.

256
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,791
I'm sorry you feel that way, Alex.

257
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:27,460
But, uh, I'd also like
to point out this:

258
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,034
What is wrong with you?

259
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:36,702
That's right.
I learned how to skip.

260
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:38,638
This outfit has gotten
me a lot of attention

261
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:42,007
from a very interesting,
fringe group of women. Hi.

262
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:51,016
And the Alien Language League finally
has a suitable place to meet.

263
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,519
What's up, Zeke?
[speaking alien language]

264
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:56,191
- Oh, my gosh, really? Show me.
- Mm-hm.

265
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,634
- [speaks alien language]
- Thanks.

266
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:08,302
I call it power hoppin'.
[speaks alien language]

267
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:12,540
Oh, my gosh.
I have to make this stop.

268
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:20,182
What's going on? - I made a really bad
decision with this present for my dad.

269
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:22,817
Having a popular restaurant
is way too much work.

270
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:25,352
I'd rather have a place
that's barely scraping by,

271
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:27,054
like our old Sub Station.

272
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:31,688
I'm just gonna put this hat on
and wish for it all to go away.

273
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,822
Goonga ga...

274
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:39,092
Look at how happy he is.

275
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:41,094
I can't take this away from him.

276
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:44,996
Oh, Tin Man. You do have a heart.

277
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,801
Yes, but only until I get tired
of lording this over Justin.

278
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:54,872
Oh, who are we kidding?
I'll never get tired of that.

279
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,874
- [crashing, sputtering]
- What was that?

280
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,079
Let's split up and
see what's going on!

281
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:04,283
I'll go outside!

282
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,087
I'm gonna go check
under your bed. Bye!

283
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:12,527
[rumbling]

284
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:17,965
Do you guys believe it?

285
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,768
Aliens have landed
on Waverly Place.

286
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:23,170
Who's gonna tell them
they can't park there?

287
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:24,971
They're gonna get towed.

288
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:30,644
I've been waiting my entire
life for this moment!

289
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,479
- [zooming]
- [crowd screams]

290
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:37,816
I got this. [clears throat]

291
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:41,753
[speaking alien language]

292
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:47,858
I have no idea what you
are talking about, kid.

293
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,027
I just welcomed you to this planet

294
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:53,264
and offered you my
eternal brotherhood.

295
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:55,700
Sounded like a lot of gibberish,
if you ask me.

296
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:58,869
[gasping] That's 'cause
you're from the wrong planet.

297
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:05,076
Listen up, earthlings.
We have come to your street

298
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:08,113
because we heard that the Milky Way
Milkshake has been brought back.

299
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:11,983
We have always believed
that the Milky Way Milkshake

300
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:15,853
is the tastiest milkshake
in the entire universe.

301
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:20,024
And now that the machine is
back up and running, we want it.

302
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:22,459
And we intend to get it.

303
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:24,595
[crowd screaming]

304
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,231
Thanks to your magic gift,
real aliens have come here.

305
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:28,666
What are we supposed to do now?

306
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:33,237
Lie our butts off.

307
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,074
You know I'm not really comfortable...
Oh, right, I got it.

308
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:40,844
[clears throat]

309
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:46,450
Uh, fellow citizens of New York
City and the outlying boroughs,

310
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:50,854
don't panic. This is just an
elaborate promotional stunt,

311
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:54,657
yes, a promotional stunt,
for the new restaurant here.

312
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:57,693
That's right.

313
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,728
Because if these were real aliens,

314
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:03,565
they would probably look
much more expensive.

315
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,901
- What's that?
- Yeah...

316
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:10,473
- Wizards dressed as aliens?
- Real aliens.

317
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,108
[both] Oh, boy.

318
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,776
Who are you?

319
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,547
He's King of the
New York Milkshake.

320
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:19,982
- No...
- Regular...

321
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,351
Thanks a lot!

322
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,592
Hand over the milkshake machine.

323
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:33,665
- Here's the milkshake machine.
- [gasps] Jerry!

324
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,369
All right, fine.
Everybody, run for your lives!

325
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:40,072
- [blasting]
- [ricocheting]

326
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,541
Justin, I hate to tell you this,

327
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,776
but this was a poorly
conceived promotional stunt.

328
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,475
That's coming from a
guy who is susceptible

329
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,875
to commercial ad campaigns.

330
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,975
- [grunts]
- [shattering]

331
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,344
[grunting]

332
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:55,646
Jerry, help us!

333
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,082
Uh...

334
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:04,754
Ah! Not the milkshake machine!

335
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:08,325
- Please!
- I knew it.

336
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,326
[yelps]

337
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:14,629
Max, you always play
those alien video games.

338
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:17,698
- Try to reason with them.
- I'm not really that good.

339
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,866
You only let me play an hour a day.

340
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,434
That's because you
have a C-minus in math.

341
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:24,702
Are we really having this
conversation right now?

342
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:28,472
C-minus? How are you
doing better than me?

343
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:32,212
[screaming]

344
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:35,349
Are you happy now? You just had to get
a better gift than me, didn't you?

345
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,185
Can you just forget about
that for one second?

346
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,755
They're closing in on Dad.
What should we do?

347
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:42,690
[Jerry] Alex! Give me Merlin's Hat!

348
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:49,798
Goonga galoonga.

349
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:53,068
Did it work? Am I alone
on the big island?

350
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:55,570
[Theresa] Ha! I knew it!

351
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:59,140
What is wrong with this thing?

352
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,742
You only get one
day to make wishes,

353
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:02,476
that was yesterday.
The hat's powerless.

354
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,276
Uh-oh.

355
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:10,615
Dad, I'm sorry. I guess if we've
learned one thing here today,

356
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,718
it's that I should stop
trying to be nice to people.

357
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:22,594
Hey, what happened?
Where did the milkshake machine go?

358
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:24,830
Justin! You did it!

359
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:27,699
Luckily, one of those
aliens dropped this thing

360
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,667
and I was able to quickly
figure out how to operate

361
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:32,803
their advanced technology.
It's a switch.

362
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:36,474
Well, this is just great.

363
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,310
Come on, guys,
we've got a long trip back.

364
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:50,055
How did you know that
shooting Merlin's Hat

365
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,623
would reverse all of Dad's wishes?

366
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:53,691
I didn't.

367
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:56,161
I was just really
sick of that present.

368
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:59,230
And how did you know you
wouldn't hit me with a laser?

369
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:03,134
Well, Dad, that was a risk
I was willing to take.

370
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:07,205
And Dad, why did you
try to trade me?

371
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:10,243
Son, there is no doubt in my mind

372
00:21:10,277 --> 00:21:12,512
they would have brought
you back in a day.

373
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:14,247
[mouths]

374
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,386
- Oh!
- Uh!

375
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,721
Why are we all hugging?

376
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:25,257
Because that's what
normal families do.

377
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:28,127
[spaceship launching off]

378
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:35,010
Dad, I'm sorry about
wrecking your birthday.

379
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,179
I just wanted you to have
a good birthday gift.

380
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,449
I know you did, honey.
And I appreciate it.

381
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:44,520
I just want you guys to know that
everything isn't about big birthday gifts.

382
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,890
Sometimes, it's the simple,
little gifts that are the best ones.

383
00:21:47,924 --> 00:21:49,558
That goes for magic too.

384
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:51,894
It's not always about
slaying dragons

385
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:55,163
or bringing a restaurant
back from the past.

386
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:59,534
Sometimes, a soup can
that's charmed to do this...

387
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,671
- [whirring]
- ...is all you need.

388
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:08,743
I even missed the little cat
that Max gives me every year.
