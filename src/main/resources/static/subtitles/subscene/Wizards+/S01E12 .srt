1
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:18,019
All right, my little history wranglers,
enough ruckus.

2
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:22,059
Let's start off Thursday's class
like we always do:

3
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:23,985
With an oral pop quiz.

4
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,785
Oh, my gosh. It's the Thursday pop quiz
we have every Thursday.

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,506
I'm totally caught off-guard.

6
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:33,512
In no particular order:
Wendy Bott, you're up.

7
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:36,595
The French and Indian War
was fought by three groups of people.

8
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:37,866
Name two of them.

9
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,395
The French was one for sure.

10
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,877
And the other one,
I'm just gonna guess, Indians?

11
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,634
Excellent.

12
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:51,278
Nellie Rodriguez. You're up.

13
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:56,485
The War of 1812 started in what year?

14
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:00,681
Oh, my gosh, I studied for this one.

15
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:04,892
- 1812?
- Another winner.

16
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,409
Alex Russo.

17
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:12,894
The Monroe Doctrine.
What is it? When was it passed?

18
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:15,136
And please give
a two-minute argument defending it.

19
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,342
Hold on. The other two questions
had the answers in them.

20
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:20,657
My question's supposed to be:

21
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:22,696
The Monroe Doctrine,
whose doctrine is it?

22
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:27,697
I'd say "Monroe" and you'd say,
"Yipee-dilly-lily, way to go, little filly."

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,307
Oh, Alex. You are definitely not
your brother Justin.

24
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:36,743
No, I'm not. I'm cuter, more fun to talk to

25
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:39,435
and I don't have dental floss
on a key chain.

26
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:41,308
Yeah, well, I do.

27
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,069
Justin made it for me.

28
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:49,432
Oh, Justin. Those were the days.

29
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:53,518
Can you believe this?
He's comparing me to Justin.

30
00:01:53,644 --> 00:01:56,683
I know.
It is so hard to live up to Justin.

31
00:01:56,806 --> 00:02:00,722
He's smart and handsome,
and he has the healthiest gums.

32
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,488
- I mean...
- Okay, I get it, he flosses.

33
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,090
Let's make him president.

34
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:01,525
How was school today?
Wait, let me guess who got in trouble?

35
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,085
Well, I got a hard quiz question
because of Justin,

36
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,929
got in trouble because of Justin,

37
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:12,523
and got recruited by the math team
because of Justin.

38
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:14,963
What are you smiling about?

39
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:17,970
I have had a much more productive day
than I realised.

40
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:21,893
Okay.

41
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,856
Today's lesson is about genies.

42
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:27,780
Oh, I know a Jeannie.

43
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:29,974
Jeannie Kowalski.

44
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,220
Jeannies do not like it
when you flick them in the ear.

45
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:36,341
That's lesson number one.

46
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,107
No, lesson number one
is leave that girl alone.

47
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,505
She's bigger than you.

48
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:45,103
And lesson number two
is about genies that live in a lamp.

49
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:48,353
And they are the con artists
of the wizard world.

50
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:50,946
I thought they were
supposed to grant you three wishes.

51
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:52,592
They do, but they take your wish

52
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,918
and they twist it around into something
you wish you never wished for.

53
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,795
Is Alex a genie?

54
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:01,795
No, she's just your older sister.

55
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:04,315
But good, Max.
You understand the concept.

56
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:08,927
No genie can trick me. I'd make them wish
that they never met me.

57
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,610
You don't have to be a genie
to wish you never met you.

58
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,924
So are we gonna take
this genie out or what?

59
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:18,411
You can't take the genies
out of their lamps, because they're tricky.

60
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:20,174
Once out, it's hard to get them back in.

61
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:24,497
Yeah, Alex, this was all in the handout,
which you obviously didn't read.

62
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:26,372
Why can't you be
more like your brother?

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,810
Because I don't want to grow old alone.

64
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:32,453
Wait a minute.

65
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,737
So we're getting a genie lesson
without seeing a genie?

66
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:40,020
No, the genie is not coming
out of the lamp, we're going into the lamp.

67
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,938
Come on. Justin, take us in.

68
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:47,269
<i>We are now small and teeny-weeny
Take us inside to see the genie</i>

69
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:57,312
Oh, Christmas carolers.

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,154
It's a little early.

71
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,238
But who doesn't love
a little "Jingle Bell Rock"?

72
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:05,595
Hit it, boys.
A one, two, a one, two, three, four.

73
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,038
Hi. We're not carolers.

74
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,364
We're on a field trip.
I'm just showing these young wizards

75
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:14,640
what a genie
looks like in its natural habitat.

76
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:19,206
I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting company.

77
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,848
I don't have enough food...

78
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:27,896
...to make dinner for all of us.

79
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:33,142
But I know this amazing pizzeria...
Everybody likes pizza, right?

80
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:36,495
- On 86th and a Columbus
with a topping bar.

81
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:37,773
A topping bar?

82
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,817
- How's that for a topper?
- That sounds great.

83
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:42,017
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's.

84
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:44,344
We are now small and teeny-weeny,
but instead...

85
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:47,060
See that, Dad? She thought
a genie wouldn't outsmart her,

86
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,630
and she almost set her free.

87
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,672
Hello. I was about to put my hand
over my own mouth.

88
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:56,595
This is why I brought you here.
To show you how tricky genies can be.

89
00:05:56,716 --> 00:06:00,108
That's right. Genies can be very tricky.

90
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,717
Hey, let's go talk about it over a latte.

91
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:08,872
There's this place in Brooklyn
that makes these lattes with basil in them.

92
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:13,117
Basil lattes. That sounds great.
Why don't you get your jacket and we'll go.

93
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,475
Yes.

94
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:17,682
See that? I just outsmarted the genie.
Now let's get out of here.

95
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,206
And I just found out
there's a pizzeria with a topping bar.

96
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:22,050
Take us out.

97
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:26,687
<i>We are now small and teeny-weeny
We are done visiting the genie</i>

98
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,699
Oh, it's you.

99
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,467
I was just in the middle
of snaking my drain.

100
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,261
Okay. Thank you for rubbing my lamp.

101
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:57,989
You have a lot of choices in lamps,
I appreciate choosing mine.

102
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:01,234
Your wish is my command.
You're entitled to three wishes, blah, blah.

103
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:04,396
Not valid in Vermont or Connecticut.

104
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,071
Okay. I wish people
would stop comparing me to Justin.

105
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:12,355
Oh, your older brother?
He seems really sharp.

106
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:15,922
I'm glad he's not my brother.
I could never live in that shadow.

107
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,275
That's what I'm talking about.

108
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,842
- Let's get to the wish.
- Okay.

109
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,525
- Isn't that the Macarena?
- Hold on.

110
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:26,651
Yeah, they stole it from us.

111
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:31,169
Okay. You're good.

112
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:33,731
You will no longer be compared
to your brother.

113
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:40,093
So you probably heard
genies are always trying to sneak off.

114
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:44,213
- You can't sneak off if I'm letting you go.
- You're letting me go?

115
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,222
Sure, go on. I got my wish.

116
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,539
Class is starting. Beat it.

117
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:51,302
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

118
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:54,987
Okay, my wily coyotes.

119
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:59,746
It's time for a surprise
Thursday pop quiz,

120
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:02,548
on Friday.

121
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:06,192
- Alex Russo.
- Here we go.

122
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:10,109
Name two of the three people who were
on the Lewis and Clark Expedition,

123
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,473
which also featured Sacagawea.

124
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:19,481
- Did you just give me all three answers?
- No fair. I'm not giving hints.

125
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:21,840
Okay.

126
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,200
Then I'm gonna say Lewis and Clark.

127
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:26,683
And Sacagawea.

128
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,812
Three out of three.
And I only asked for two.

129
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:34,245
I think we have a winner.

130
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,653
Actually, let's let Alex ring the bell.

131
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,017
Is there somebody
you wanna compare me to?

132
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,699
- No.
- Thank you, genie.

133
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:49,780
Can you believe it?

134
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:53,940
He didn't ask me some ridiculous question
that only Justin would know the answer to.

135
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,503
- Who's Justin?
- What do you mean, "Who's Justin?"

136
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,224
- Hey, Justin.
- Alex.

137
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,784
The weirdest thing happened to me.

138
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:02,547
I got kicked out of chemistry
because I wasn't on the class list.

139
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,551
And I told Mrs. Rieber
it had to be a mistake,

140
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:07,986
I've been there all semester,
but she still didn't remember me.

141
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:09,866
Oh, that is weird.

142
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:13,549
You'd think she'd remember the student
that came with the periodic element song.

143
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,399
<i>Hydrogen then helium</i>

144
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,080
<i>Lithium, beryllium</i>

145
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,763
<i>Boron</i>

146
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:24,438
Speaking of borons, why don't you go
tell your friends about your problem.

147
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,081
Fine.

148
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,278
That's Justin?

149
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,799
The new guy who's H-O-T cute?

150
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,085
No, the guy who's my brother
who's V-E-R-Y dorky.

151
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,683
No, you only have one brother.
His name is Max.

152
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:43,617
Oh, my gosh.
Harper, I'm gonna catch up with you later.

153
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:45,492
Fine. But I call dibs
on that new Justin guy.

154
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,419
- I liked him first.
- Dibs acknowledged.

155
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:52,941
We played video games together.
Yesterday. Remember?

156
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,783
I got overexcited and hyperventilated.

157
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,819
Your mom had to get me a bag.

158
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:01,182
Sorry, dude. Good luck with whatever.

159
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:09,309
I don't have any friends.
My teacher doesn't remember me.

160
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:12,154
What did you do?

161
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:16,070
Why? Just because something
completely out of the ordinary happens

162
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,475
doesn't mean I automatically had
something to do with it.

163
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,478
- Did you have something to do with it?
- Yes.

164
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:25,477
I made a wish with the genie that everyone
would stop comparing me to you,

165
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:27,836
but I guess she did
that by making everyone forget you.

166
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,323
Okay. Tell the genie
you wish everyone remembers me again.

167
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,886
I can't. I let her go.
That way she couldn't sneak off.

168
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,848
Oh, I get it. It's kind of like giving a burglar
your money so he doesn't steal it.

169
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:42,934
- Look, what do you want me to do?
- You've done enough.

170
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:44,775
We're gonna have to get Dad to help us.

171
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:48,656
Hi, I'm Jerry, Alex's father.
Nice to meet you.

172
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,178
We already met.

173
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:57,063
I don't think Dad's gonna help us.

174
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:03,507
Hey, who's your new friend? He's cute.
He looks a little like your Uncle Ernesto.

175
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:09,866
It's not just school,
no one remembers me.

176
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,031
Look on the bright side.
I bet you don't have to do dishes tonight.

177
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,038
Okay, Justin. I know this looks bad.
No one remembers you.

178
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:25,881
But I'll fix it.
In the meantime, think of all the benefits.

179
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:28,959
- Like not having to do the dishes?
- Yeah.

180
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:31,077
I'd trade that
for my parents remembering me.

181
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:34,361
Where am I supposed to sleep tonight?

182
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:38,400
I fell asleep at table five one night.
It's pretty comfortable.

183
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,929
Okay. Follow my lead.

184
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:51,688
Mom, Justin's parents
are out of town for a week,

185
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:57,135
and he doesn't have a place to stay,
and he lost his key when he tripped

186
00:11:57,262 --> 00:12:00,939
- and he fell down the subway grate.
- Oh, my goodness.

187
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:05,895
Well, Justin, you're more than welcome
to stay with us until your parents get back.

188
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:09,420
- Really? Thank you.
- See that? Problem solved.

189
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,269
Yeah, everything's great.

190
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,269
It's just my parents
don't know who I am.

191
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,707
Hey, Max.
Do you still remember me, buddy?

192
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:19,585
Of course I do.

193
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:23,909
- You do?
- Yes. You're Uncle Ernesto.

194
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,597
I have seen you in Mom's pictures.

195
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:34,042
Alex. Look what I made in art class.

196
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:36,965
It's a bust of that new kid, Justin.

197
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:39,887
- Do you think he'll like it?
- I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

198
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:41,519
Oh, my gosh. He's here.

199
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,124
How do I look?

200
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,530
Better than him.

201
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:50,611
Justin, look who's here.
And she made something nice-ish.

202
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:52,566
Hey, Harper.

203
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,488
You know my name?

204
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:00,099
I made this for you.
Oh, that's not my lipstick on the cheek.

205
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:03,857
Thanks, Harper. I'll put it in my room.

206
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,737
As soon as my parents
get back in town.

207
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:07,976
- Oh, where are you staying?
- Here.

208
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:12,307
He's already moved in?
You do not respect the code of dibs.

209
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:19,110
Harper made a bust of Uncle Ernesto?

210
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:20,749
It's me.

211
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:24,470
That's still weird.

212
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:28,307
Alex, we have to do something.

213
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,038
You know...

214
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,230
They can't forget you.

215
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,751
You're their first-born.
Maybe we can jog their memory.

216
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,679
Mr. Russo and Mrs. Russo,
since I'll be staying,

217
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:39,842
it would be rude
if I didn't let you get to know me.

218
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,764
So tell us about yourself.

219
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,600
- Well, Justin loves school.
- Loves school?

220
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,165
Oh, we never hear that around here.

221
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:51,406
And I love watching sports with my dad.

222
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:53,685
- Go Mets.
- A Mets fan.

223
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:56,968
You should've started with that.
Now, Jets or Giants?

224
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:59,576
- Jets.
- There it is.

225
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,975
Welcome to the family, Justin.

226
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:06,139
Justin is a great catch.
You should go out with him.

227
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:10,939
Gross. That's exactly how I felt
about your father when I first met him,

228
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,946
and now he's my big cuddly bug.

229
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:16,787
Grosser.

230
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,741
Justin is a fine young man.
You should be more like him.

231
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:27,627
Even when they don't know you,
they want me to be more like you.

232
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:29,870
You can't wish away quality.

233
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,798
Okay, how are you
gonna get the genie back?

234
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:41,001
I don't know.
I've just been racking my brain.

235
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,718
I just wish the genie would show up.

236
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,045
What just happened?

237
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,684
You wished for the genie to come back
and she came back.

238
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:55,483
And stumbling on that,
you just used your second wish.

239
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:58,926
Okay, Alex, you have one wish left.
Choose your words really carefully.

240
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:01,048
I know, I know.
I wish you would stop telling me...

241
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:05,139
That's not it, that's not it.
I'm gonna get this right. Okay.

242
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,220
I wish people would... No, no, no. No.

243
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:12,098
I wish Justin would be...
No, no, no. No, you'll wreck that.

244
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:15,138
I wish my first wish...
I wish my brother...

245
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:17,542
This is gonna be good.

246
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:20,948
- Oh, I've got it.
- Hold up. Let me hear it.

247
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,863
Okay. I wish everyone
would see Justin clearly for who he is.

248
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:29,465
Wait. There could be a problem
if you say the word...

249
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,665
"Clearly."

250
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:35,678
And that's my triple play.
Thanks for rubbing my lamp.

251
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,794
Really. It's yours to keep.
In fact, use it as a gravy boat.

252
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,118
Just remember
it's not dishwasher safe.

253
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,599
You know what?
Throw it in the dishwasher, I don't care.

254
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,162
Alex, look what you've done.
You've ruined my life.

255
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:52,969
Hold on. You're invisible. Isn't there
something you've always wanted to do?

256
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,809
Someone you've always wanted
to get back at

257
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:57,731
and they would never know
because you're invisible?

258
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,007
There. I've done it.

259
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:03,016
- Okay. I had that coming.
- Now fix this.

260
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,650
Hey, you kids want some ice cream?

261
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:10,096
- What are you doing?
- This way I'll be totally invisible.

262
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:12,937
No. Just hide.

263
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,461
Don't look.

264
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,182
- Where's your friend?
- Bathroom?

265
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,868
I love talking sports with him.

266
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,862
I'll sit right here
and wait till he gets back.

267
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,431
No, no, Dad, not there.

268
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:32,508
- Why not?
- Because I'm gonna sit there.

269
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:40,675
I like sitting here.

270
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,517
Who was that?

271
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:51,439
Alex Russo, what is going on here?

272
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,962
And why is there a pillow
floating in midair?

273
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,410
Justin's invisible
and not wearing any clothes.

274
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:03,044
Jerry, what's wrong?

275
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:07,567
I just sat down
on Alex's invisible friend Justin.

276
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:12,935
- Justin, what did Alex do to you?
- Yeah, I don't know.

277
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,780
And I'm sure this may seem like magic,

278
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:20,022
but I'm sure there's a perfectly rational,
scientific explanation for all of it...

279
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:24,345
- Dad, Justin knows about magic.
- Okay, what did she do to you?

280
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,536
- Well, she...
- Wait.

281
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:27,466
Is he holding that pillow to?

282
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,945
Oh, that's my good pillow.

283
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:38,111
And since it's the only thing I can see,
I don't feel very comfortable talking to it.

284
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:41,110
Just talk to Uncle Ernesto.

285
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,720
Alex, what did you do to him?

286
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,759
Okay, I'll tell you.

287
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:55,003
- But you're never gonna believe me.
- Of course we'll believe you.

288
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:58,599
Justin is my brother
and your oldest son.

289
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,729
I don't believe you.

290
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,520
No, it's true.

291
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:05,730
I made a wish with the genie that everyone
would stop comparing me to Justin,

292
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:08,044
but the genie conned me
and made everyone forget him.

293
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,407
- And then he became invisible.
- She's telling the truth.

294
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:17,813
You're trying to tell me
I have a son I don't even remember?

295
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,818
Please believe me.
You have to believe me.

296
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:22,537
I used up all my wishes,
but the genie was too smart for me.

297
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:25,222
Genies are sneaky.

298
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:28,862
You have to help me.
You can't let him be invisible forever.

299
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:31,742
I grew up with him.
He may be dorky and annoying,

300
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:37,145
but he's fun and gullible to pull pranks on,
and he's my brother. I need him back.

301
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:39,551
You know what, honey?

302
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:43,664
I think I believe you.
You really love your brother.

303
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,516
You love him too.

304
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,595
And sometimes more than her.

305
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:50,315
I'm trying to help you here.

306
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:53,762
We have to do something.

307
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:56,518
Honey, I believe you too, okay?

308
00:18:56,645 --> 00:19:00,003
But what am I gonna do?
The genie outsmarted you.

309
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:04,167
Justin, I'm sorry.

310
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:09,370
But I'm happy I have another son.

311
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,212
Let me have a hug.

312
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:15,045
- Well, yeah. Go put some clothes on first.
- I'll be right back.

313
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,540
Floating pillow.

314
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:29,544
You've gotta teach me that one
so I can sleep standing up.

315
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:31,615
You know what?

316
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:35,708
The genie may have outsmarted me,
but maybe we can out-dumb her.

317
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:38,470
Max, how would you get a genie
to come back to her lamp?

318
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,948
I know. Orange soda.

319
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:42,388
What?

320
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:46,714
If someone poured orange soda
in my room, I'd be really mad.

321
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:48,947
You spilled orange soda in your room,
didn't you?

322
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:50,796
What did we say
about taking that up there?

323
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,073
See? She's really mad
and she's going to my room.

324
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:02,676
Is it working? Is it working?
It's not working.

325
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,402
What are you doing? That's my house.

326
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:15,163
See? Nothing drives the ladies mad
like orange soda.

327
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:21,010
I'll stop shaking it if you give Max a wish.
It's just gonna get foamier in here.

328
00:20:21,658 --> 00:20:23,331
Fine. What do you want?

329
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,172
I wish for this haircut
and a shirt like this.

330
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:33,217
I can't give you a wish you already have.
What game are you playing, kid?

331
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:36,060
Oh, yeah? I wish for the genie game.

332
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,059
What genie game?

333
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:42,342
- What are you trying to do?
- Oh, you know what I'm trying to do.

334
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:46,182
Well, it sounds like you're trying to find out
about the reset button.

335
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:49,909
Max, there's a reset button.
You know what to wish for.

336
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:52,312
Swimming pool of pudding? Yes.

337
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:55,315
No. The reset button.

338
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,437
I wish you would show me
the reset button.

339
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:01,122
- In your lamp.
- In your lamp.

340
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:04,601
If there's a reset button,
we'll need this paperclip.

341
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:06,678
Hi.

342
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,448
Orangey.

343
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,445
Max.

344
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:19,851
I got it.

345
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,895
All right. Here it is.

346
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,615
When you press it, it undoes
all the wishes since the last save,

347
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,299
as if they'd never happened.

348
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:44,500
- That was close.
- You're back. I'm so glad I can see you.

349
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,669
Oh, Justin, sweetie,
I'm so sorry I forgot you.

350
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:50,142
What kind of mother
forgets her own son?

351
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:53,470
- What about you?
- What? I'm a dad.

352
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:56,475
Before my cup of coffee,
I'm lucky if I remember one of these kids.

353
00:21:58,238 --> 00:21:59,991
Come on, Bobby. Bedtime.

354
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:06,873
So you were pretty upset
about me being invisible, huh?

355
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:12,285
No. I was just afraid that I would be
running into you all the time.

356
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:14,559
No, you weren't.

357
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:17,640
I need my brother back.

358
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:21,689
I need my brother back. Where is he?

359
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:25,484
Yeah, I'm glad you're back.
That way I can do this.

360
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:26,965
I miss my...

361
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,488
I miss my brother. He's so athletic.
