1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,190
Yo, happy-go-trashy, come back here.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,200
Don't you see me sweeping?

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,530
What would your mother say
if she saw you do that, huh?

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,060
Mama would be mad.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,170
That's right, Mama would be mad,
and so am l.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,470
Now pick that up.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,900
And that cup too.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,510
Okay, thank you for eating
at Waverly Sub Station. Come again.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,110
Hey, Alex.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,410
Ta-da.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,320
You picked up the trash on the way here.
Just throw it in the can.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,090
No, silly.
This is a necklace l designed for you.

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,520
A little something to say thanks
for being my best friend.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,060
No, l'm not wearing that.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,060
Why not?

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,140
Well, because it's so beautiful

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,760
and you should sell it.

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,500
Okay. That will be $35.

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,910
No.

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,910
l meant on Waverly Place,
like these guys.

21
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,480
Okay, and whatever we don't sell,
we can wear to school.

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,010
School? Okay.

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,240
Big jewelry sale this Saturday.
Please don't miss it.

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,450
Please. Happy-go-trashy.

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,060
Buy your mama something nice. No?

26
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,820
So you kids are telling the Babe
that hot dogs is bad for you?

27
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,890
What's a fella eat for breakfast?

28
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,180
Beef jerky and a bowl of syrup.

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,550
l call it beef jerky and a bowl of syrup.

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,930
Alex, put him back in the picture
before Dad gets here.

31
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,970
Oh, lighten up. lf he was Obi-Wan Kenobi,
you'd be all into it.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,770
Life-size Obi-Wan? l'll be right back.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,600
Sit down.

34
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,170
Hi.

35
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,010
Alex, what did we say
about taking people out of pictures?

36
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,680
We say, ''Yay, hooray,
Alex is so fun and creative.''

37
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,620
Babe, always a pleasure.
l am a big fan.

38
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,280
Now put him back in the picture.

39
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,830
Fine.

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,430
Pictures with faces
Return to your place--

41
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,660
Oh, l don't know the rest.

42
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,370
You need to know the exact time
and place to finish the spell.

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,500
l need to know stuff?
Justin's department.

44
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,840
Yankee Stadium, 1929.

45
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,010
You even make sports
not sound cool.

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,750
Pictures with faces
Return to your places

47
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,410
Yankee Stadium, 1929

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,360
Okay.

49
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,930
Now, today's lesson is about making
an object pass through something solid.

50
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,560
Justin, say ''go through, mow through''
on my hockey stick.

51
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,170
Okay.

52
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,140
Go through, mow through

53
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,600
Okay. Now my hockey stick is charmed.

54
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,540
Watch.

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,040
lt tickles. Stop, stop.

56
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,550
Awesome. Let me try.

57
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,310
Alex.

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,520
Not the spleen. Not my spleen.

59
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,960
Miss Russo, we have a problem.
l'd like a word, please.

60
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,130
Sure, Miss Marinovich.
How about the word ''lunch''?

61
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,430
l know it's one of my favorites.

62
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,730
You haven't signed up for Saturday's
art history field trip to the museum.

63
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,640
And if you don't go, you're gonna
have to repeat my class this summer.

64
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,010
And l'm begging you,

65
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,640
please don't make me teach a class
with just you in it.

66
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,940
Oh, believe me, summer school
is not part of my plans.

67
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,520
And neither is the museum.

68
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,490
l'm actually going
to a different art exhibit.

69
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,920
My friend Harper is making jewelry,
and we're selling it.

70
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,730
lf you like macaroni and glitter,
l can get you some awesome earrings.

71
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,320
But the field trip is worth 30 percent
of your grade.

72
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,300
Please, l'm on my knees. Don't fail.

73
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,570
l missed my math field trip
last Saturday.

74
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,700
So 30 percent, is that a lot?

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,940
lt's a lot.

76
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,380
Listen. l need you to watch Alex
and make sure l get my summer vacation.

77
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,020
l will see to it that she's
at the museum on Saturday.

78
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,520
Thank you.

79
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,460
When you said ''she,'' l really hope
you didn't mean me, because:

80
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,190
He sees Russo.

81
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, l'm open. l'm open.

82
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,740
What are you gonna tell your mother?

83
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,280
All right. l know how to deal with this.

84
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,710
We'll mess up a bunch of other stuff
and say we were robbed.

85
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,450
What happened?

86
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,090
My lamp.

87
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,430
We were throwing the ball.

88
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,530
What happened to the robbery?

89
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,930
We didn't have time to mess stuff up.

90
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,600
How many times have l said, no throwing
the ball inside the house, guys?

91
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,440
- How many lamps have we broken?
- Three.

92
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,700
At least three times.

93
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,510
- We're sorry.
- Oh, not yet you're not.

94
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,680
After l get a massage and a pedicure

95
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,260
and whatever else l want that l don't need,
then you'll be sorry.

96
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,020
Man, this is bogus.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,920
What's the point of having a foam football
if it still breaks stuff?

98
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,120
Exactly.

99
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,720
You know, someone should just come up
with a ball that could fly through stuff.

100
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,300
And l think that someone is us, huh?

101
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,940
l don't know why we're nodding.

102
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,640
Go through, mow through.

103
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,710
Oh, now l get why we're nodding.

104
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,870
Okay. That's enough nodding.

105
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,050
- Okay.
- Here.

106
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,290
Go through, mow through

107
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,580
All right, let's give it a try.
Hey, go out the door.

108
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,890
Here it comes.

109
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,030
Sweet. lt works.

110
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,500
Okay. Pass it back.

111
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,330
l got it.

112
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,380
Yeah, it's just the football, Max.
Not you.

113
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,620
Hello, Miss Marinovich.

114
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,600
Mr. Kiss-Up-Ovich.

115
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,890
l'm here as you can plainly see.

116
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,230
No getting around the fact that l'm here.

117
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,740
Feel free to put a little check by my name
because l'm here.

118
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,770
Now, l'll be way over there
and you might not see me for a while,

119
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,070
because l'll be deep inside the museum,
soaking it all in.

120
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,080
l don't care what you soak in
as long as you pass my class

121
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,620
and we're not staring
at each other in summer school.

122
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,420
Because this is how l stare.

123
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,890
Go through, mow through

124
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,140
Okay, everyone, make sure
you get one of these handouts.

125
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,970
You have to fill it with historical facts.

126
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,050
lt's worth 30 percent of your grade.

127
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,250
Alex?

128
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,210
Alex?

129
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,180
Alex.

130
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,220
Oh, good, you're here.
Now we can open for business.

131
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,190
Harper, l don't think we need
to say homemade.

132
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,770
People will just know.

133
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,840
Wait a minute,
is this a knob from my dresser?

134
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,710
Oh, here comes our first customer.

135
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,340
Already? Oh, this will be easy.

136
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,540
Good morning, ma'am.

137
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,710
Morning. Can l take all this?

138
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,680
- All of it?
- Yeah, l'll take it all.

139
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,690
That'd be great.

140
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,950
Hey, Ralph. Bring the truck.

141
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,180
We got a load of trash over here.

142
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,660
What? No, this isn't trash.

143
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,390
lt's fine jewelry.

144
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,420
Really?

145
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,970
Hey, Ralph.

146
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,770
Did you know we've been driving around
in a jewelry store?

147
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,410
Oh, good job, by the way, in there.

148
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
Next time, don't use red pen.
l use red pen when l grade.

149
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,850
That's kind of why l became
a teacher's assistant.

150
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,290
Hey, that was some great art.

151
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,700
Hard to pick a favorite.
lt was all so great.

152
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,330
Save it, ditcher.

153
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,940
Ditcher?

154
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,540
Yeah. You ditched, l'm calling you
a ditcher. Got a problem?

155
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,880
There's only one tiny flaw
with your plan,

156
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,780
and it's called a worksheet.

157
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,310
A worksheet?

158
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,260
l'd hurry, because the museum closes
in like five minutes.

159
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,690
Five minutes.

160
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,930
Five minutes?
l wouldn't know this stuff in five hours.

161
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,100
But they might.

162
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,150
Frames with figures
Step out of your pictures

163
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,720
Okay. Gather around, people.

164
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,060
Gather around. Over here.

165
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,070
Why are you doing that?

166
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,230
He's The Scream,

167
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,140
Well, l got a new nickname for you.
lt's Quiet Guy, okay?

168
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,310
All right,
l'm gonna skip the introductions,

169
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,940
because l gotta fill out this worksheet
and blast out of here.

170
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,820
So, which one of you is
the Dutch boy wearing a blue costume?

171
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,860
That would be me.

172
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,050
Oh, okay.

173
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,390
And the name of your painting is?

174
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,190
Blue Boy,

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,690
This is gonna be easy.

176
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,630
All right, Frowning woman, Crazy Guy,
Guy with One Ear,

177
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,430
See that?

178
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,270
She's just going to use us.

179
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,900
And then send us right back

180
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,450
into those dingy, stiff, boring paintings
for who knows how many more centuries.

181
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,280
l say we take a vacation.

182
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,950
Wait. Fine, fine.

183
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,080
lf you're not gonna help me
with my worksheet,

184
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,820
then you're just all going back
where you came from.

185
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,090
Go.

186
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,090
l'm done taking short-cuts.

187
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,160
l'm gonna do it the hard way.
l'm gonna copy off Nellie Rodriguez.

188
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,160
Pictures with faces
Return to your places--

189
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,790
Wait. l don't know where you're from.

190
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,710
Attention,
we will be closing in five minutes,

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,210
Okay, don't panic.

192
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,180
Go ahead, Scream, panic.

193
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,890
Come on, you guys.
We're locked in a museum.

194
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,160
Let's have a slumber party.

195
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,960
And, you know, get to know each other.

196
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,230
l'll tell you about myself
and you tell me about yourself.

197
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,890
For example, l'm Alex.

198
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,440
l was made in 1992 in New York City.
Where were you made?

199
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,440
You talk so much,
l'm glad my ear's gone.

200
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,450
Cheese it. Elaine's coming.

201
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,370
Who's Elaine?

202
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,990
She's the security guard
always shining her light in our eyes.

203
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,610
Hide.

204
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,210
Man, it's like her eyes follow you.

205
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,140
Okay, we are closed.
You know what that means.

206
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,740
Pull the plastic utensils out of the trash
and wash them?

207
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,450
Already done.

208
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,220
Now it's kickoff time.

209
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,960
l'm going long.

210
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,460
Nice one.

211
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,830
Now, you go long,
and by long, l mean up.

212
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,600
Oh, nice.

213
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,000
Hut, hut.

214
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,740
Oh, hi, Max.

215
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,550
No.

216
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,250
- What?
- Hey, Maxy.

217
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,480
Did you catch the--?

218
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,390
Flu?

219
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,930
l hear it's going around.

220
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,120
Gosh. lt is?

221
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,070
Well, it's a good thing l made
my chicken posole soup, then.

222
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,640
Come on, it's done.

223
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,530
Did she see the ball?

224
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,300
No, it went into the soup.

225
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,570
Here you go, guys. Dig in.

226
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,020
How is it? lt's my secret recipe.

227
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,690
Yep. There's a secret in there all right.

228
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,260
Hey, Harper. l see you're selling...

229
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,730
What are you selling?

230
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,000
Jewelry, silly.

231
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,570
Here, l even made a ring for you.

232
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,470
That's quite an unusual stone, Harper.

233
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,670
What kind is it?

234
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,110
lt's not a stone. lt's a peach pit.

235
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,280
Because l think you're peachy.

236
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,020
Right.

237
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,990
Hey, Alex.

238
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,390
What? You're locked in the museum?

239
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,360
The paintings? A security guard?

240
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,090
l should stop repeating
what you're saying?

241
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,540
Right, okay. On my way.

242
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,480
Yeah, so l just need a minute, sir,
to find my sweater.

243
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,970
You're not an art thief, are you?

244
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,120
No, sir, no art thief.
Just a teacher's assistant.

245
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,560
Alex? Alex, where are you?

246
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,420
Hey. What's going on?

247
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,390
What's up?

248
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,940
Oh, no.

249
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,810
Oh, no.

250
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,140
Alex, you have ruined some
of the greatest artwork in history.

251
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,910
Van Gogh, Blue Boy,

252
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,170
l'm sorry. Who are you again?

253
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,680
Oh, yeah, The Scream,

254
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,010
Hey, Quiet Guy, zip it.

255
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,820
Look, you just have
to send them back. Please.

256
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,620
But then you wouldn't learn anything.
You gotta do this yourself.

257
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,390
Justin, that could take all night.

258
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,720
lt can't take that long,

259
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,700
because the security guard only gave me
five minutes to find my sweater.

260
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,460
Everybody, spread out.

261
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,830
We've got to find Justin's sweater.

262
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,540
That was delicious.
Did you guys like it?

263
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,550
Are you kidding? lt was spectacular.

264
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,710
- Loved it.
- Oh, honey.

265
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,250
Yeah, we ate all of it.

266
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,010
All the way to the bottom.

267
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,420
And there's nothing else in there.

268
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,580
Absolutely nothing.

269
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,520
we ate the ball?

270
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,960
- lt's--
- lt wasn't spicy, honey.

271
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,870
l know. Well, you...

272
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,500
Do you think we're gonna be okay?

273
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,510
We're in no way okay.

274
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,980
lf we eat the spell, we get the spell.

275
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,680
- Jerry?
- We can explain.

276
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,090
We were robbed.

277
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,490
We put a spell on the ball

278
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,070
so we could throw it through stuff
without breaking anything.

279
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,070
And it flew into the soup,
and we ate the soup,

280
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,070
and that is why you're standing
in the middle of the island.

281
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,770
You know, this is kind of fun.

282
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,070
So you're not mad?

283
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,550
Well, not in like
an l-wanna-yell-at-you way.

284
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,650
ln like an l-wanna-chase-you
kind of way.

285
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,620
Run.

286
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,420
Pictures with faces
Return to your places

287
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,570
Wait a minute.
Are those shoes too small?

288
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,940
l know.
l hate shoes that make me wanna scream.

289
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,800
Now you're ready to go.

290
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,810
Pictures with faces
Return to your places

291
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,880
Oslo, Norway, 1 893

292
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,690
Okay.

293
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,790
That leaves us with the Mona Lisa,

294
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,720
Okay.

295
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,860
The Mona Lisa,
and she was painted by Leonardo...

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,060
Di Caprio.

297
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,570
Da Vinci. Da Vinci.

298
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,930
l'll do it.

299
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,670
Time to go home, Mona Lisa,

300
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,470
Pictures with faces
Return to your places

301
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,310
- ltalian Renaissance, 1 5--
- No, wait.

302
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,470
Please don't send me back. Please.

303
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,810
But you have to go back. You're one
of the greatest art treasures in history.

304
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,650
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

305
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,290
My entire life, all l ever heard
anyone say about me is:

306
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,860
''Why did Da Vinci paint her?
She's so plain.

307
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,560
You call that a smile?''

308
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,430
well, you're gonna love
these earrings, Elaine,

309
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,700
They're strung from a string

310
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,030
that once held together
a delicious roast beef,

311
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,100
You find your sweater yet,
teacher's assistant?

312
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,970
No, not yet.

313
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,020
Well, you got two minutes,
or you're going home chilly.

314
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,790
There you are, Alex.

315
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,380
Good thing Justin repeated
everything you said on the phone.

316
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh, hello. l'm Harper.

317
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,430
Oh, hi. Mona Lisa.

318
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,530
Do l know you? You look really familiar.

319
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,140
She's not from here.

320
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,260
She's from ltaly. Florence, l think.

321
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,470
Very good.

322
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,170
Harper, that is the most beautiful
necklace l have ever seen.

323
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,080
lt is?

324
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,240
lt is.

325
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,850
And it really brings out your smile.

326
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,390
That is a smile, right?

327
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,680
Yes.

328
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,950
Thank you.

329
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,450
What are you doing?

330
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,460
Sending her back happy.

331
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,930
Harper, why don't you show Mona
the matching earrings?

332
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,660
Oh, yeah. You'll love them.

333
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,770
Pictures with faces
Return to your places

334
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,600
ltalian Renaissance, 1 502

335
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,230
Here they are.

336
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,900
Where did Mona go?

337
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,570
She was so excited
about the necklace

338
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,450
that she wanted
to go show her friend Leo.

339
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,180
She owes me $35 for that.

340
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,520
What? A necklace on Mona Lisa?

341
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,720
No, no, no.
That is not what Da Vinci intended.

342
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,160
Relax. She looks great.

343
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,700
And that's almost a smile.

344
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,130
You put a $35 necklace
on a $40 million painting.

345
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,640
Well, now it's worth 40 million
and 35 dollars.

346
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,240
Justin, just say it's cool.

347
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,670
lt's cool.

348
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,870
And l'm...

349
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,780
l'm sorry that l make fun of you
for knowing stuff.

350
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,680
You're apologizing?

351
