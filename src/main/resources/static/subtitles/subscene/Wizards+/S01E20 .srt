1
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:11,992
Okay, before I start class,

2
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:15,511
I wanna remind you all that your
grandmother is coming for a visit.

3
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,237
And since she's your mother's mother
and not my mother,

4
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:20,320
she doesn't know anything
about all of this.

5
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:22,562
You mean,
how you won't turn on the a.c. In here?

6
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:25,880
No. I'm talking about magic.

7
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:29,960
And when Grandma's here,
no one uses magic or talks about magic.

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:31,127
- Done.
- Got it.

9
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:33,768
Now let's talk about magic.

10
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:36,774
The spell for today, body switching.

11
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:39,971
Awesome.
Alex, you and me switch seats.

12
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,772
Max, that's not magic.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,259
Dad, she never lets me sit there.
It would be kind of magical.

14
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:48,223
Fine. Switch spots.

15
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,736
Anything to stop this discussion.

16
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:53,140
Okay, body switching is a spell

17
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,660
where two people
can switch bodies with each other.

18
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,910
For instance, Alex, you and Justin
could switch bodies.

19
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:02,392
Why would I wanna do that?
I can already do more pull-ups than him.

20
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,788
Yeah, well, I'd switch bodies
with Chuck Norris,

21
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:07,513
do more pull-ups
and give you a roundhouse kick.

22
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,679
You just admitted
I can do more pull-ups than you.

23
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:12,398
Okay.

24
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,639
Now, this is a tricky spell

25
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:16,075
because if you don't switch back
before sundown,

26
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,927
you'll be trapped
in the other person's body forever

27
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:21,245
with no way out.

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,808
And then you'll be a vampire
and you'll have to drink blood.

29
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,213
You really have to start reading
the handouts.

30
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,210
Alex, let's give it a try with me and you.

31
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:34,616
Now, just say the two people's names,
and then this:

32
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:40,461
All right. Alex, Jerry:

33
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:48,659
Excellent, Alex.

34
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,948
You executed the spell perfectly.

35
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:55,428
Maybe your mom's right.
I could drop a couple pounds.

36
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,508
Why is it so hot in here?

37
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:01,552
Man, you have a lot of hair.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,676
Smooth. Scratchy.

39
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:07,358
Smooth. Scratchy.

40
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:09,397
Alex, leave my face alone.

41
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:11,677
You guys get the idea.
Now switch us back.

42
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:13,317
Later.

43
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,170
I've got a little shopping to do first.

44
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,930
You don't have any money.

45
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:19,532
No.

46
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:20,928
But you do.

47
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:25,898
Would you just...? I just put you... Alex!

48
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,690
Nice try, little girl.

49
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:25,859
What? I changed us back
as soon as you caught me.

50
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:28,624
I caught you at the register at the mall.

51
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:36,144
- Harper, what are you doing?
- Planning your quinceañera.

52
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,788
Oh, my gosh. Am I sick?
What's a "quincemono"?

53
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:43,591
It's a party
celebrating a girl's coming of age.

54
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:45,753
That's why your grandmother's
coming to town.

55
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,835
You get to wear a pink beautiful dress.

56
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,598
And it's a Latin-American tradition

57
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,519
<i>that comes from the words quince,
meaning 15,</i>

58
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:55,843
<i>and año meaning year, and "era"
which just makes it sound Spanish.</i>

59
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:57,285
Yeah. I'm sorry.

60
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:00,445
Everything after "pink dress"
was just yuck, yuck, yuck.

61
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:03,802
But there are rituals symbolising
your becoming a woman

62
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,650
that you go through with your dad.

63
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:09,814
What? I didn't give anybody
permission to become a woman.

64
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:11,446
I'm with Dad. You know me,

65
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,853
I don't do anything
Dad doesn't want me to do.

66
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:21,056
Well, look, I love being half-Mexican
and half whatever he is, but...

67
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:22,254
Italian.

68
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:26,267
Italian. I tell you that every time
you order pineapple on your pizza.

69
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:30,146
The point is, look at all this stuff.
It's all too girly and lame.

70
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,420
No, thanks.

71
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,789
You'll come around.
Because for the dress,

72
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:37,749
I've embraced
traditional Mexican embroidery.

73
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:40,187
The shawl will be overnighted
from Oaxaca, Mexico.

74
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,199
What do you think?

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,514
I think you sound like you're choking
when you say "Oaxaca."

76
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:51,960
But maybe I could spill a little paint on it
and rip it and then I'll call it a dress.

77
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:55,326
And when I'm done,
it'll go great with these.

78
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,644
No, no, no.

79
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,771
There's a ritual where you change
from a flat shoe to a high-heeled shoe.

80
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:08,576
Well, maybe I can change from
these high tops to even higher high tops.

81
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,894
No, Alex.

82
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,100
There are certain things
that people do at a quinceañera,

83
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,658
and we're going to do them.

84
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:18,585
If I can't wear my sneakers
and I have to wear that, then we're not.

85
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:20,938
Alex, you can't cancel.

86
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:22,708
A lot of work has gone into this.

87
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,583
It's my party. I can cancel if I want to.

88
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:27,068
It's not just your party. It's our party.

89
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,703
Oh, yeah? Well, it seems
like it's mostly just about you.

90
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:38,198
If I see so much as a scratch on that bike,
someone's gonna eat spokes.

91
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:42,121
- Grandma.
- Lexie.

92
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:46,723
Hey, and Harple.

93
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,888
Here we go again. It's Harper.

94
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:52,286
- Hi, Grandma.
- Yeah, hi.

95
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:54,811
How was your bicycle tour
around New England?

96
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,893
It was long.

97
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,485
I was worried that the next time
I saw that bicycle seat

98
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:01,769
was gonna be in one of my x-rays.

99
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,537
Hey, where are Justin and Max?

100
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:09,134
I learned a new wrestling move.
I wanna try it out on them.

101
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:13,743
Jerry, that's the way
I left you a year ago: Eating.

102
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,822
Hi, Magdalena.

103
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,312
And for your information,
I lost 5 pounds.

104
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:24,869
Pull up your shirt. I think I found them.

105
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,719
So how's the party planning
going, girls?

106
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,959
They're very sensitive
when you make fun of my weight.

107
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,246
I talked to your mom.

108
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,208
She thinks your dad
could drop 5 pounds too.

109
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,454
She's mostly upset about you.

110
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:56,092
Yeah, she'll get over it.

111
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,972
Well, I haven't seen her this upset
since she was 15

112
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:02,100
and she asked
if she could have a quinceañera

113
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:04,181
and we couldn't afford it.

114
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,983
She wanted one
and she couldn't have one?

115
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,101
Yeah.

116
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,225
Is that why she wants me
to have one so bad?

117
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:16,826
<i>I don't know, mi hija. Maybe you're right.</i>

118
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:20,228
Maybe she figured at least
she'd get to have one for you.

119
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,798
But it's just not me.
I really don't want one.

120
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:31,234
But that doesn't mean
she can't have one.

121
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:34,127
Don't be silly.
Your mother can't have a quinceañera.

122
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:37,322
She'd have to be a 15-year-old girl.

123
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,803
Stranger things have happened.

124
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,405
No, seriously, they have.

125
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,812
Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?

126
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,850
Doing what she always does
when she's upset:

127
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,894
Venting to customers
about what's wrong with her life.

128
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,536
It's not like I have another daughter

129
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:56,701
I could give my hopes and dreams to,
you know?

130
00:07:56,865 --> 00:07:58,982
Anyway, corned beef?

131
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,622
Hey, Mom, good news.

132
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,706
I changed my mind.
I want a party after all.

133
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,065
What? We're not ready.

134
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:07,787
I thought we agreed. No womanhood.

135
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:09,463
Oh, my gosh, you do?

136
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:12,235
You really do? I'm so excited.

137
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:14,227
It's gonna be perfect.

138
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:17,272
- As long as it's over by sundown.
- Why sundown?

139
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:22,596
Because I hear that you can get
the banquet rooms for cheaper.

140
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:25,001
Yeah, that's what I heard. Good.

141
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:27,243
Oh, honey. I'm so excited.

142
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,360
It's gonna be great.
You're gonna look beautiful.

143
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,364
You're gonna have a special dance
with each one of your brothers.

144
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,120
Wait a minute.

145
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:36,603
I heard "dancing" and "brothers."

146
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:39,375
I signed you up for a couple
of ballroom dance lessons

147
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:41,966
so you'll be ready
for Alex's quinceañera.

148
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:44,694
So these two eggheads have to dance?

149
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,733
Dad made a rule
against her being a woman.

150
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,504
Well, I thought Dad made a rule
against her calling us eggheads.

151
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:56,099
So I guess this womanhood train
is clearly leaving without me.

152
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,582
Look, as a father,

153
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:02,751
I am not gonna be left behind,
so I'm on board.

154
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:07,390
No, I'm not.

155
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:16,318
Okay, class.

156
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,322
On to something
that all but two of you can do.

157
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:22,883
The salsa.

158
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,321
Oh, salsa.
Were we supposed to bring chips?

159
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:30,127
And one, two, three.

160
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:32,008
Five, six...

161
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,332
This door should open out.

162
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:38,414
Hi, boys.
I came to pick up my grandsons.

163
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,055
But, Grandma, we're about to salsa.

164
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,253
It's not just a zesty dip.

165
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:46,339
So these twinkle toes
are gonna teach you how to salsa?

166
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,779
Oh, fine. I love a good comedy.

167
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:52,103
Richard?

168
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,906
And one, two, three.

169
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,626
And add the three-step spin.

170
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,270
Wait, wait, wait. You call that a salsa?

171
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:02,912
It looks more like you're trying
to get gum off your shoe.

172
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:10,154
Maybe it'd be better if you all left.

173
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:11,754
Fine.

174
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:14,395
I'll teach my grandsons how to salsa.

175
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,997
But, Grandma,
Mom expects us to learn how to dance.

176
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,440
If I can make salsa,
I can dance the salsa.

177
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:23,806
You've heard the saying:
You dance what you eat.

178
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,807
Grandma, it's "you are what you eat."

179
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:29,212
Do you know how to dance?

180
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,058
- No.
- Then shut up.

181
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,415
One, two, three, wrestle.

182
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,509
You look beautiful.

183
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,906
Yeah. Pink and puffy.

184
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:52,105
Really pink and puffy.

185
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:57,269
But it's okay, because I'm not gonna be
the one wearing it. You are.

186
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,319
- Alex, Theresa:
- Wait a minute. Are you doing magic?

187
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,847
Why am I looking at myself?

188
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,281
Well, you may be looking
at yourself on the outside,

189
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,563
but it's me on the inside.

190
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:17,571
Hi, Mom.

191
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:20,493
You're in my body?

192
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,008
Yup. And you're in my body.

193
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:25,971
You are grounded as soon
as you get back in this body,

194
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:29,254
because I am not grounding myself.

195
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:36,138
Alexandra Marguerita Russo,
you promised your father

196
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:38,579
you wouldn't do magic
while your grandmother's visiting.

197
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,828
Mom, I know you're mad,
but just hear me out.

198
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:44,105
This is the only way you can enjoy
the "quincenomo" you've always wanted.

199
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:48,516
And then if you're mad, well,
then punish me. It's okay, fine.

200
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:50,709
It's "quinceañera."

201
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:54,551
Oh, my gosh.

202
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,198
I love this dress. I'm so pink and fluffy.

203
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:59,840
I'm 15 again.

204
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,323
That's right, Mom. You're 15 again.

205
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:04,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

206
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,250
Don't be sorry.

207
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:09,092
This is fantastic.
I'm having a quinceañera.

208
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,330
You think we can pull this off?

209
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:14,895
Trust me, it would not be the first time
I got away with magic.

210
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:18,135
I mean, it would totally be the first time.

211
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:21,701
- Alex?
- What?

212
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:24,622
No. You don't mean "what,"
I mean "what." What?

213
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:27,703
I talked to your mom
and she decided it was okay

214
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:29,307
for you to wear
the shoes you wanted.

215
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:31,990
Oh, my gosh.
When were you gonna tell me?

216
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:37,073
I was gonna tell you
before the thing happened.

217
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:40,347
- Before the thing that just happened?
- Yes, the big thing.

218
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,271
What big thing?

219
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,082
Nothing. I just decided
that I'm very okay with wearing high heels.

220
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,639
And this tiara.

221
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:53,121
I look like a princess.

222
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,528
Don't you think you should teach us
how to dance?

223
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:04,009
We've been telling Mom
that we've been going to lessons.

224
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:06,650
Don't worry.
There's plenty of time for dance lessons.

225
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:09,453
- When?
- The quinceañera is now.

226
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,096
Time got away from me, eh?

227
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,256
I need to get Alex a present.

228
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:19,063
Max, you go find me some Scotch tape.

229
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,582
And, Justin,
you go find me some wrapping paper.

230
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:22,777
Excuse me, ma'am.

231
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:25,344
You know, that necklace
really doesn't go with your outfit.

232
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,782
Oh, I know.
How about I buy it off of you?

233
00:13:29,713 --> 00:13:31,750
What are we gonna do now?

234
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:34,106
You know,
I didn't want it to have to come to this,

235
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,752
but there's only one way out.

236
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,110
We have to break each other's legs.

237
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,758
Okay. Me first.

238
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:43,475
Got it.

239
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:47,003
Attention, everyone.

240
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,838
I present to you my daughter,
Alex Russo.

241
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:59,125
Thank you so much, everyone,
for coming to my quinceañera.

242
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,566
I just love saying "my quinceañera."

243
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:03,654
Everyone, all together. My quinceañera.

244
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,089
My quinceañera!

245
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:11,262
Alex is really into this.

246
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,617
Not to take all the credit,
but I always knew I could change her.

247
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,706
What?
You know I just like to eat the icing.

248
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,345
So does Alex.

249
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,623
Now I know where she gets it from.

250
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:25,948
Yeah.

251
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:31,358
And now it's time
for the symbolic shoe ceremony.

252
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:39,043
First, I will remove Alex's flat shoes,

253
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:42,955
and then I will put on
these high-heel shoes.

254
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:46,563
Get your own, mister.

255
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:52,686
What I meant is,
I will put these high-heel shoes on Alex

256
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:57,573
to symbolise a girl becoming a woman.

257
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:08,696
Mom.

258
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,865
Yes, son?

259
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:20,507
We got kicked out of dance class.
We never learned how to dance.

260
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:22,389
We're gonna look like complete fools.

261
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:25,593
You eggheads.
You're gonna ruin this whole thing.

262
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,358
Wait a minute. Eggheads.

263
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:31,476
Eating the icing off the cupcake.
Your lip.

264
00:15:31,604 --> 00:15:33,163
And those high tops.

265
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:34,765
The body-switching spell.

266
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:36,844
You switched bodies with Mom,
didn't you, Alex?

267
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,838
Keep it down, nimrod.

268
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,529
Nimrod?

269
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,210
Alex.

270
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,526
That means Mom's out there.

271
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,567
That means
we're gonna have to dance with her.

272
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,575
And be good.

273
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,530
Okay.

274
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,938
Okay, how about I do the robot
and you pretend to oil me?

275
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,896
No, you egghead.

276
00:15:59,545 --> 00:16:01,582
We can switch bodies
with someone too.

277
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:03,140
The dance instructors.

278
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:04,542
Attention, everyone.

279
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,101
Justin and Max
have prepared to dance with Alex.

280
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:09,665
- Max, Candace.
- Justin, Richard.

281
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,952
What am I doing here?

282
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:24,312
I don't know.

283
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,836
But like all the other trouble spots
I've gotten into in all my life,

284
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:30,277
I'm gonna dance my way out.

285
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:32,720
Showtime.

286
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:41,049
Do you know how to salsa?

287
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:43,056
Yes, I do.

288
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:57,055
<i>If you were 15 years older,
I would ask you to dinner, mi amor.</i>

289
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,102
Okay, that's really weird.

290
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,129
It's time for the big finale.

291
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,448
Leap into my arms.

292
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:36,412
- Really?
- I've got you, baby.

293
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:47,385
Arms out. Hold it, girl.

294
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:50,898
That's it. You're a swan.

295
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:55,343
I'm a swan.

296
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,450
We made it back by sundown.

297
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:26,566
Did Alex and Mom switch back yet?

298
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,529
I don't think so.

299
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:32,811
Alex, the sun is going down.

300
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:37,011
Sundown? I've gotta switch back
or I'll be stuck in Mom's body forever.

301
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:38,178
Thanks, bro.

302
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:39,936
Alex, Theresa:

303
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:41,623
Theresa.

304
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:44,538
Ma.

305
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:49,346
You know, your father always wanted
to give a speech at your quinceañera.

306
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,905
He even wrote one.

307
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,024
And now that we are here
at your daughter's,

308
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:55,794
I'm going to read it to you.

309
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,756
"My dearest daughter, Theresa.

310
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:04,191
When you were born at 6:02 p.m.,

311
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:06,519
it was a rainy, rainy day.

312
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,080
I knew
because I hadn't fixed the roof yet."

313
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:12,565
- So how many pages?
- I don't know. Like 30.

314
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,525
You know,
he was always fixing that roof.

315
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:18,326
Always, huh?

316
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:22,565
I'm a klutz.

317
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,328
Oh, well, that's all right, Maxamillions,
because you know what?

318
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,974
I have it memorized.

319
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:35,261
I just would hold the papers for, you know,
that sort of dramatic effect.

320
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,662
Let's see, now where was I?
Where was I?

321
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:41,065
Oh, yes, the roof. The roof, okay.

322
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,911
And then when you started walking,

323
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:47,550
I heard the pitter-patter
of both your feet and rain.

324
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:49,786
I still hadn't fixed the roof.

325
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,549
Hey, hey, Grandma.
You wanna wrestle now?

326
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,954
<i>No. In a minute, okay, mi hijo?</i>

327
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,801
This is a very important,
emotional moment.

328
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:00,358
Oh, so are you saying you're chicken?

329
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:02,204
No. I'm just gonna start
from the very top.

330
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,682
We're supposed to be crying here.
My dear...

331
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:08,928
Oh, it's on.

332
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:10,565
We'll pick this up later.

333
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:15,694
That's not fair.

334
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,136
Alex. Alex, the sun's going down.

335
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,657
Hurry, say it. Say it.

336
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:19,814
Alex, Theresa:

337
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,744
These high heels are lame.

338
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:33,097
Get them off me.

339
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,549
She's back.

340
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:38,190
Alex, I just wanna thank you,

341
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:41,113
because the quinceañera
was everything I hoped for.

342
00:20:41,235 --> 00:20:44,752
You know, Grandma was reading me
this letter that Grandpa wrote for you.

343
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,231
You should really hear it.

344
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:49,114
Oh, the one about the leaky roof?
He read that for everything.

345
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,390
Birthdays, weddings.

346
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:53,357
He even read it when he won 10 bucks
off a lotto scratcher.

347
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:56,681
Well, I'm glad you liked it
and I'm glad it's over.

348
00:20:56,806 --> 00:21:00,085
Well, it's not over yet, young lady.

349
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:03,681
It's time for the father-daughter dance.

350
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,262
Oh, Alex, you really are growing up.

351
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:20,899
You did all this for your mother,
and look how happy it made her.

352
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:25,584
I'm glad we did this too, Dad.

353
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,386
You really are turning
into a wonderful woman just like her.

354
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:31,230
I am so proud of you, honey.

355
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,946
Even when I break the rules
and use magic behind your back?

356
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:37,426
Even then.

357
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:41,274
Oh, honey, are you crying?

358
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,152
Yeah, but why aren't you?
You've been crying for days.

359
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:46,638
Well, I think I'm all cried out.

360
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,913
Really?

361
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:51,164
What if I told you
how much this quinceañera cost?

362
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:52,721
Oh, my gosh.

363
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:55,444
Here it comes again.

364
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,811
Well, guys, you managed
to refrain from using magic

365
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:04,655
the whole time Grandma's been here.

366
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:06,609
- You're welcome.
- It wasn't easy.

367
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:08,696
Took a lot of restraint.

368
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,218
Well, you should really pat
yourselves on the back.

369
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:15,782
Well, I've never been
in this room before.

370
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:20,782
Is this room what I think it is?

371
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,181
What room do you think it is?

372
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:27,468
The wrestling room.

373
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:29,945
Best two out of three.

374
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,756
Gotcha.
