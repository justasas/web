1
00:00:00,675 --> 00:00:04,327
(sad piano music)

2
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,370
(screams)

3
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:08,751
- Well that's rich!

4
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:10,097
That is rich!

5
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:11,431
And that it's then, we're just done?

6
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:13,370
OK, throw it all the way, whatever.

7
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:14,477
Is this about the money?

8
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:15,678
Well, excuse me, princess.

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,313
Excuse me that I wasn't raised on a diet

10
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:21,116
of jewels and gold and hay!

11
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:23,501
(explosion)

12
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:25,404
I bet he's everything I'm not.

13
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm sorry, I'm not a powerful quadruped.

14
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,006
I'm sorry I don't have an ivory tusk

15
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,891
growing out of my forehead.

16
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:34,248
- [Irene] This has been
a long time coming, Jack.

17
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:35,124
You know that.

18
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,299
- I bet he takes a long time coming.

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,500
- [Irene] You're being juvenile.

20
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:39,312
(flaps lips)

21
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:41,871
My parents are in the
next room, they can hear.

22
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:43,334
- I want them to hear!

23
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,841
La, la, la...

24
00:00:44,842 --> 00:00:46,634
- [Horse Dad] Perhaps we should go, dear.

25
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:49,146
- [Horse Mom] But there's
still so much quiche!

26
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:50,382
(Jack growls loudly)

27
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,176
- That's it, isn't it?

28
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm just not man enough for you.

29
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,752
- [Irene] It's not that
you're not man enough, Jack.

30
00:00:58,753 --> 00:01:01,078
He's just all horse.

31
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,795
- We could've made this work, you know?

32
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,510
But typical you, typical naysayer,

33
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:08,126
you naysayer, all you say is "Nay!"

34
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:11,463
(makes neighing sound)

35
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:13,917
(flaps lips)

36
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:20,715
(wheezes)

37
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:26,575
(makes neighing sound)

38
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,308
- [Irene] It's done, I've told him.

39
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,598
I'm coming over now.

40
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,187
- Irene!

41
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:39,486
I'm sorry, come back!

42
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:40,978
Come back!

43
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:43,389
Come back!

44
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,693
Come back, Irene.

45
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:46,629
(sniffles)

46
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,059
Come back.

47
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:49,950
(makes neighing sound)

48
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:53,976
(yawns)

49
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,224
- Well, this is a sad sight.

50
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:03,270
Waking up alone again!

51
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,988
- Well, you're never really alone

52
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,453
with a living portrait dead
Dad watching you sleep.

53
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:10,222
- It's that kind of
attitude that makes you

54
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:12,193
such a disappointment.

55
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:13,841
I didn't hatch you from an egg

56
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,187
just for you to end the bloodline.

57
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,077
Find yourself a lady, son.

58
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,465
Start using your magic again.

59
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,837
There's nothing women
respect more than a magician.

60
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:24,517
- Dad!

61
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:26,789
- [Regimand] Before I was
confined to this living hell,

62
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,005
there wasn't a night I went
without a woman's touch.

63
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:31,068
- Well that's nice, Dad.

64
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,330
- And now, look at me! Oh!

65
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:36,625
Two-thirds of the man I once was,

66
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:39,075
having lost an entire dimension.

67
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,842
When I opted to be
immortalized in oil and canvas,

68
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,384
I thought I was cementing my legacy.

69
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:47,183
And now I pray for death!

70
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:47,893
(door closes)

71
00:02:47,894 --> 00:02:49,665
(phone ringing)

72
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,639
- How about going on a date?

73
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,572
- Excuse me?

74
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,040
Yes, absolutely, please.

75
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:54,850
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

76
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:56,525
Not with me, with someone else.

77
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:58,048
- (laughs) And I was joking.

78
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:01,124
Yeah, I find you fucking
repulsive. (chuckles)

79
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:01,989
- Outstanding!

80
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,327
Well, dating is a really
great way to meet new people

81
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:06,896
and to get a fresh perspective
on your new community.

82
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:08,637
Have you had much dating experience?

83
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:10,748
- Yeah, sure.

84
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,243
Back home, I used to slay,

85
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:14,086
uh, giants, I was a giantslayer.

86
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:16,645
You slay a giant, women just
throw themselves at you,

87
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,636
often from a catapult or a trebuchet.

88
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:19,857
(Kylie laughs)

89
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:24,102
- What is romance even
like, where you're from?

90
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,924
Is there much dating within
the wizard community?

91
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,578
- Well, um, dating other wizards is tough

92
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,429
because once two wizards
hook up, it's for life.

93
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,312
As in, it's the end of your life, you die.

94
00:03:35,313 --> 00:03:38,312
Once those wiz lips make
contact, you kind of

95
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:42,410
boil away into this frothy,
gelatinous sex ball.

96
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,046
It's gross.

97
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:45,380
Like beautiful,

98
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,550
but like, super gross.

99
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:50,024
I have never known such bliss.

100
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,615
But, um, other, other
creatures in the realm?

101
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,504
Totally fair game.

102
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:54,842
Um. (chuckles)

103
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:57,072
Once I was engaged to this elven chick.

104
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:00,559
(ethereal harp music)

105
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:04,324
My beloved, Lady Caroliniana,

106
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,248
would you make me the happiest wizard

107
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,986
from the Astral Sea to the Woodland Row?

108
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:12,366
- Oh, Jack.

109
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:14,286
You offer me this ring.

110
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,733
Well, of course, I'll take it,

111
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:20,435
and in place of your girlfriend,

112
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:22,599
I would become your wife!

113
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,929
(scary instrumental music)

114
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,870
(background noise drowns out other sounds)

115
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:29,567
A wife more powerful than the lightning!

116
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:32,834
More treacherous than the ocean blue!

117
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:37,281
And you, you will love me and despair.

118
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:44,360
(footsteps)

119
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,801
- (chuckles) So that didn't work out.

120
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:56,047
Eventually, I did marry, but um...

121
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:02,989
(horse neighing)

122
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:05,216
I think it's time to move on.

123
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,693
- Attaboy.

124
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:09,128
As they say, once you fall off the horse,

125
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:11,863
you just need to get right back on again.

126
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:14,047
So let's get you back in the saddle.

127
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,374
Uh, and who knows, we may even find you a

128
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,576
stable relationship,

129
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:18,776
(horses neighing)

130
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,318
or you could just horse around a bit.

131
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,501
(Jack groaning continuously)

132
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:23,747
You OK, Jack?

133
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:24,748
- Yep!

134
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,430
- All right, let's go, giddy up!

135
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:27,887
- I used to fuck a horse.

136
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:28,351
- What?

137
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:30,805
- Nothing! Let's go. (groans loudly)

138
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:38,823
This place is cool.

139
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:40,634
- Uh, Jack, no, it isn't.

140
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,154
But hey, speed dating is new for me, too.

141
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,039
You'll be fine, don't be nervous.

142
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,361
- Well, good thing I'm not nervous.

143
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:50,091
(burning)

144
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,431
- Uh, your forehead doesn't agree.

145
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:55,515
- What?

146
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:56,299
Oh, shit!

147
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,749
Um yeah, uh sorry, uh...

148
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,422
When I was young, my
Dad put a curse on me,

149
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:02,353
so that if I lied or was nervous,

150
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,178
my face would kind of give it away.

151
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,500
- Well, if you'd just owned up

152
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,267
to eating all the boiled turtle,

153
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,767
I wouldn't have had to!

154
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,276
- But you ate the turtle!

155
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:13,295
- As the saying goes, "A turt in the tum,

156
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:14,737
"no harm done."

157
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,038
- No one's ever said that.

158
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,222
- Well I just said it, didn't I?

159
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,304
Well, well, well.

160
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:23,428
Who is this ravishing creature?

161
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:24,381
Mm-hmm.

162
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:25,803
(thumping)

163
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:30,185
Allow me to introduce myself.

164
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:33,613
I am Regimand the Wise,

165
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:35,775
and Well-Hung.

166
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:37,112
- Hey, Jack.

167
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:37,833
Cool dad.

168
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,356
(bell ringing)

169
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,857
Oh, would you look at
that, we're about to start.

170
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,858
Good luck.

171
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:45,057
- Hey, um Dad,

172
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,236
could you fuck off?

173
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:47,676
- Don't worry, son.

174
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:50,627
I'll just finish my drink
and get out of your beard.

175
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:53,617
(splash)

176
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,342
Watercolor?

177
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:56,972
Watercolor!

178
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:57,973
Gross!

179
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:00,274
(painting clatters)

180
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:02,504
(bell ringing)

181
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,445
- Ring-a-ding-a-dingle!

182
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,024
Who wants a flingle? (giggles)

183
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:09,507
The name of the game is
speed, guys and girls,

184
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:11,014
so let's get to it!

185
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,115
(forceful drum music)

186
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,332
(relaxing pop music)

187
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,734
- (chuckles) Hi.

188
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,129
- Hi, hi!

189
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:30,121
Hi, I'm Jack.

190
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:31,947
- I know, it's on your tag.

191
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,175
- Oh, well um...

192
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:36,773
Literacy is a very attractive
quality in a human female.

193
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,147
You are Anna, just looking at the tag,

194
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:41,483
not the chest

195
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:42,484
yet.

196
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:46,440
Uh, I hope to, but we'll
cross that bridge when we come

197
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:47,441
to it.

198
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,497
So, what do you do?

199
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:54,242
- Well, I'm studying to be an accountant.

200
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:56,797
- Oh, accountancy, that's interesting.

201
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:58,444
(burning)

202
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:02,878
And, uh, you look lovely,
by the way, you look great.

203
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,451
(burning)

204
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,152
- Thanks.

205
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,477
- You're welcome.

206
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:12,028
- So, what do you do for fun?

207
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:12,564
- Fun?

208
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:13,183
Ah, fun!

209
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:14,790
I uh, well, I like to read.

210
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,102
(burning)

211
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:19,055
I like to watch television
with my friends.

212
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:20,145
(burning)

213
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,188
I like to garden.

214
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,665
(burning)

215
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:29,390
- Cool.

216
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,914
- Yeah.

217
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:32,897
- So, speed dating.

218
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:35,602
What are you hoping to get out of it?

219
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:38,407
- I just, I just want to
find somebody who's fun.

220
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:39,844
(burning)

221
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,371
- You're a pig.

222
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:46,890
- I'm actually a waterproof man.

223
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,888
(bell ringing)

224
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:58,070
- Wow, smooth.

225
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,955
- Guess I'm a bit rusty,

226
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,972
which is ironic, as I can't get wet.

227
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:06,461
Hey, um, I think I'm just gonna go,

228
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,669
but thank you very much.

229
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,496
This was awful.
- [Kylie] Oy.

230
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:11,920
- [Kylie] I never pegged
you for a quitter.

231
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,231
Come on, Jack, hustle.

232
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,127
Here, drink this.

233
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:18,063
(triumphant choir singing)

234
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:20,316
- Is it, uh, like a potion?

235
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,561
- No, you fucking idiot.

236
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,341
It's a beer.

237
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:24,884
It'll take the edge off and sort out that,

238
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:25,980
that business.

239
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:27,242
- OK.

240
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:30,935
(lively instrumental music)

241
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,119
- [Kylie] No, no, no, no, drink.

242
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,733
(crunching)

243
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:37,317
(funny electronic music)

244
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:40,588
- [Kylie] Good?

245
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,320
- Fucking sick.

246
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:44,381
(funny electronic music)

247
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,483
(gulping)

248
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:47,393
- [Kylie] Good?

249
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:48,913
(gulping)

250
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:52,403
(funny electronic music)

251
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,834
(burps loudly)

252
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:57,835
(sniffs)

253
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:00,996
(burps)

254
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,363
- Hi there.

255
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:06,584
- Hello.

256
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:07,358
(roar then bird chirping)

257
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,358
- Oh.

258
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:10,688
I knew it!

259
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,339
You are a wizard.

260
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,897
- Guilty as charged.

261
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:16,407
- That is so weird, there's
another magic guy here.

262
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,135
- Wait, what, really?

263
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:17,556
- Yeah.

264
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:18,854
- A more rousing tale,

265
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:22,535
I was snoozing as I was wont
to do in my sarcophagus.

266
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:25,147
I was rather a lazy bones in those days.

267
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,609
Lo and behold, the lid is
lifted and who should it be,

268
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,999
but Brendan Fraser.

269
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,181
He was researching his
role for the upcoming movie

270
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:33,686
at the time, Monkeybone,

271
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,477
the Hollywood sensation.

272
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:37,742
Then we, together, came to the conclusion

273
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,855
that we should bury all the slaves alive.

274
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,393
- [Waiter] You guys asked for drinks?

275
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:45,789
- You dare interrupt Lord Mummy?

276
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:49,037
Stare into my amulet!

277
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:50,214
(Waiter screams)

278
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:52,154
(gong)

279
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:56,954
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

280
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:02,334
- As I was saying, monkey bones.

281
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:05,057
Basically, they're
delicious with anything.

282
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:07,300
I have a bone salad, personally,

283
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:10,040
you toast the bones lightly under a grill,

284
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,720
and then arrange them
smoothly on cos lettuce

285
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:16,869
with a drizzle of
mayonnaise on top of that.

286
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,775
- Mummy mia, right?

287
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:20,091
(laughs)

288
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:20,691
(laughs nervously)

289
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:22,186
- And maybe some anchovies

290
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:24,045
if that's your pleasure.

291
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:26,572
I personally don't appreciate the salt.

292
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:28,093
- Anyway, tell me, what was it like

293
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,895
growing up in the wizard realm?

294
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:30,596
- Pretty normal.

295
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:32,891
Uh, Dad frothed himself into a sex ball,

296
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:33,938
hatched me from an egg.

297
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:36,517
Now he's dead and lives in a painting.

298
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,207
Oh there he is.

299
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,461
- You look about as
desperate as I am. (chuckles)

300
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:44,580
- Yeah, boring, don't care.

301
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,787
Impress me, magic man.

302
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:47,984
Show me a trick.

303
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,484
- Ah well, uh, the thing about my magic

304
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:52,586
is that I don't do any.

305
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:54,614
- Excuse me?

306
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:56,996
- I'm under a self-imposed abstinence.

307
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,018
- You're abstinent?

308
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,363
- Magically, yes.

309
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:01,488
Sexually, I'm open for business.

310
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:03,035
- And how is business?

311
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,259
- It is miserable.

312
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,212
(bell ringing)

313
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:09,442
- Yeah, good call.

314
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:12,548
- A quick date is a good date!

315
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:15,755
So long as he isn't quick
where it counts, hey ladies?

316
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:18,330
Talk about come. (chuckles)

317
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,257
(funny electronic music)

318
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:27,968
- Then and they all died,

319
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:30,426
and that's why I've never been employed.

320
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:34,284
(heartfelt acoustic guitar music)

321
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,077
Hey, do you want to see some magic?

322
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,370
- I heard you don't do that anymore.

323
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:40,211
- Shh, shh, don't tell Jack.

324
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:41,584
(laughs)

325
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:42,585
- OK.

326
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,839
- OK!

327
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,613
I noticed that your
glass, it is very empty.

328
00:12:47,614 --> 00:12:49,903
Would you like it to be very full?

329
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:50,777
- Yes.

330
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:51,720
- OK!

331
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,708
(gurgling)

332
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,708
- Oh!

333
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,835
What?
(gurgling)

334
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:58,937
(exclaims in disgust)

335
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:01,108
- Yeah?

336
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:03,726
- Gross. (laughs)

337
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:06,047
That's gross!

338
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:09,245
- I find things gross.
(gurgling)

339
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:13,903
Um, hey, grab that water, throw it at me.

340
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,803
(splash)

341
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,109
- [Mummy] Who dares (mumbles) Lord Mummy?

342
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:21,919
- OK, I have one more trick.

343
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:27,262
Hello! Bonjour!

344
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:28,591
- Yes, sir?

345
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:30,493
- [Regimand] Bonsoir.

346
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:32,101
- This lady would like a,

347
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,132
this lady would like a...

348
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,523
- Oh, this lady would like a pint, thanks.

349
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,139
- Oh, one pint for the
lovely lady, bartender,

350
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,111
two pints, um, deux pints.

351
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,169
I'm speaking in French.

352
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,011
- Yeah, sure, no worries.

353
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,218
- Au revoir!

354
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:49,605
(giggles)

355
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:53,516
- You know, I never expected to meet

356
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,379
anybody interesting here,

357
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,311
and I've been pleasantly mistaken.

358
00:13:57,312 --> 00:13:58,805
- Oh, me too, you know?

359
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:00,789
This is actually fun.

360
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,319
Um but, just anything you want,

361
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,331
anywhere you wanna go, we can do it.

362
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,731
Magic!

363
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:08,102
Gods, I've missed it.

364
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,805
- Anywhere?

365
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:11,599
- Literally anywhere.

366
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,646
- OK, don't laugh.

367
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:14,793
- I won't.

368
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,180
- Promise?

369
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:17,669
- Cross my hearts.

370
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,366
- OK, when I was a kid,

371
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,412
I really wanted to be an astronaut.

372
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,581
- I don't know what that is.

373
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:26,083
- (laughs) I wanted to
be the first white woman

374
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,409
to walk on the moon.

375
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,170
- Moon?

376
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,366
Moon, it's child's play.

377
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,883
We can go to the moon right now.

378
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:31,702
- Really?

379
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:32,448
- Yeah.

380
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:34,266
You wanna, you wanna go with me?

381
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:35,398
- No way!

382
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,379
Yes!

383
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,255
Let's do it!

384
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,210
- OK, bang, zoom.

385
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:45,320
(peaceful instrumental music)

386
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,550
Straight to the moon!

387
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:54,430
(peaceful instrumental music)

388
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:58,231
(crumbling)

389
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,809
(shatters)

390
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:07,831
Shit.

391
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:14,423
Oh hey, it's the guy and his dog from...

392
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,550
(sighs)

393
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,451
- Two deux pints.

394
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,027
Where's your friend?

395
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:43,603
- Oh she just popped out for a bit.

396
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:45,842
(burning)

397
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:51,542
(funny electronic music)

398
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:58,250
(mystical music)

399
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,333
- Excuse me, Deciding Hat.

400
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:15,113
- Hat of Deciding, actually.

401
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:17,804
- Cool. So, you're a sort
of hat who decides things.

402
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:18,813
How's it going?

403
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:20,147
- Better than this wine.

404
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:21,847
It's a terrible vintage.

405
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,497
And I don't know why I had
them heat it up for me.

406
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:26,459
It's piping hot.

407
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,109
What is this serving glass?

408
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,433
A goblet of fire.

409
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,690
(laughs)

410
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,030
- Cool.

411
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,474
So, I'm here today to kind of talk

412
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:37,389
about a few complaints, I guess,

413
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,907
from the student body.

414
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:41,454
They're a little worried
that their entire futures

415
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:43,990
hinge on the whims of a hat.

416
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:44,697
No disrespect.

417
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:47,392
- Who would they prefer decide their fate?

418
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:48,872
A Christmas stocking?

419
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:51,486
- No, because that's dumb.

420
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,145
- Make is quick, boy.

421
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,270
I'm beginning to decide that I'm bored.

422
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:57,887
And this hot wine isn't helping at all.

423
00:16:57,888 --> 00:17:00,164
- I just feel as though we're maybe

424
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:03,858
fostering a lack of diversity
amongst the school houses.

425
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:05,891
Possibly based on a personal prejudice.

426
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,773
- Prejudice?

427
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,065
I'm not prejudice.

428
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,063
I'm a hat of deciding, no less.

429
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,266
And I've decided that
I've had quite enough

430
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:14,721
of your nonsense, boy.

431
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,083
Now run along and heat me up

432
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:17,974
some more of this terrible wine.

433
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,461
- No, we are far from done.

434
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:22,167
Okay. You see, all the
kids with heroic qualities

435
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:23,782
you've put them all into Hero House,

436
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:25,081
which is great for them.

437
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:26,816
No complaints from Hero House.

438
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,865
You're kind of screwing
over everyone else, right?

439
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:31,347
I mean, you take all the nerds
put them into Nerdling House.

440
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:33,021
You pull all the morons
into Dumb Dumb House,

441
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,123
which helps nobody.

442
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:35,158
You take all the ugly kids,

443
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,714
put them into Ooglo Booglo House.

444
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,227
And don't think I haven't
noticed you put all the

445
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,629
big chested girls into
Fun Bag Tittie House.

446
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,244
- What can I say?

447
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:44,697
The hat wants what the hat wants.

448
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:47,328
- And that's not even getting
started on Evil House.

449
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:49,314
- Well, you don't want all the bad apples

450
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:51,603
poisoning the rest of the barrel, do you?

451
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,654
- No, I agree.

452
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,327
But you don't want them
scheming off together

453
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:55,520
in a little dungeon.

454
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,027
Perhaps, if you took the bad kids,

455
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:58,265
put them with the good kids,

456
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,597
then some of those good qualities

457
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:02,421
would trickle over on the bad kids.

458
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,513
I mean, to that point, why
do we even have a house

459
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,762
commemorating who is
essentially our Hitler.

460
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:09,242
Maybe, just maybe, if we took those kids

461
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:10,404
and didn't tell them,

462
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:12,204
"Hey, day one, you're in Hitler House.

463
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:13,946
"Good luck, Matey Potatey,"

464
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:16,290
we'd have a few less dark
wizards on our hands.

465
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,654
- I'll be cockhead (inaudible).

466
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:20,106
- It's a self fulfilling prophecy.

467
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:22,838
- Have at thee!

468
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,192
Oh, look. I'm about to
decide where you should go.

469
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:30,527
Hm, interesting. I've decided
that you're a big gay.

470
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:32,944
So, it's off to Poofter House with you.

471
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,378
It's been decided.

472
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,535
Poofter House for the bloody poofter.

473
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,857
- Hey, not cool you fucking homophobe.

474
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:41,682
- Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't
hear you defending minorities

475
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:44,373
over all of these gay thoughts of yours.

476
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,569
How gay.

477
00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:46,928
- (laughs) Gay.

478
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:47,929

479
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:07,322

00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,146
He's right about us as well.

549
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:44,560
A couple of dark wizards really
take advantage of the chaos,

550
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:47,602
and they fuck it up for the rest of us.

551
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:49,066
I'm not going home, I can't.

552
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:50,552
- The stories about wizards fitting in

553
00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:52,478
just fine don't sell newspapers, Jack.

554
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,417
But you do have options.

555
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:56,739
Have you thought about
starting a petition,

556
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,910
or you can canvas your local area.

557
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:00,365
- I'll never have the reach that he has.

558
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:02,639
He's already got the public in his pocket.

559
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,555
- Well, maybe it isn't the
public you should be talking to.

560
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:11,699
(knocks)

561
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:18,906
- Hello sir, madam, Greek Grell, or other,

562
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:19,802
my name is Jack.

563
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:21,892
I am from the wizard realm, just like you,

564
00:22:21,893 --> 00:22:24,145
but much prefer living here in Melbourne.

565
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:26,962
To better integrate
into Australian society,

566
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:28,245
maybe there are some ways

567
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,454
that we can all tone it
down a bit, blend in better.

568
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:33,336
Do you think there's anything you could do

569
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:36,305
to be making yourself a
little less conspicuous?

570
00:22:38,964 --> 00:22:42,005
- You know, I've never
really thought about it.

571
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:44,407
I guess I could stop
wearing this leather jacket.

572
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:46,694
It is a little threatening.

573
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:50,824
- Yeah, or, you know, you do
live next to a petrol refinery.

574
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:52,385
(sirens wail)

575
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:55,029
Don't you think your neighbors
might be a little anxious

576
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,748
living next door to somebody who,

577
00:22:58,749 --> 00:22:59,787
you know?

578
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:01,937
- Frequently barbeques?

579
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:02,467
- Maybe.

580
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,968
- Because I'm not gonna stop barbequing.

581
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:06,617
I'll have you know my
neighbors love my lamb cutlets.

582
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,159
- Your skull is on fire!

583
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,173
It's the peak of summer.

584
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:10,845
It is an arid farm land,

585
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:12,333
and you're a fucking ghost rider.

586
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:14,042
- Ghost writer, actually.

587
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:15,862
- What?

588
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:18,045
- I earn my bread writing biographies

589
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:19,558
for the rich and famous.

590
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,996
Why, I've just finished a memoir for

591
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:25,395
a very influential local
chef, Curtis Stone.

592
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:27,749
Mayhap you've heard of him.

593
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:33,191
Here I'll sign you a copy.

594
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:44,566
- Give me Harry Potters,
give me Harold Holt.

595
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:46,133
Give me Harold Holt back.

596
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,501
He'd be 98 now.

597
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:48,502
(knocks)

598
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:52,205
- Hello sir, madam, or other,

599
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:53,354
I am Jack.

600
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:54,355
- No.

601
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,291
- Oh, I haven't said anything yet.

602
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:01,466
- Bron know this land doesn't
deal with spellcasters.

603
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,577
- Well, good thing I'm
not here to play cards

604
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:05,889
because deal, poker.

605
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,164
Poker? Hardly knew her.

606
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:10,800
- You have the bearing of a man

607
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:14,229
with so much fire without flint or tinder.

608
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,097
- Well, that's a cool way to put it.

609
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:17,934
Yes, I am slash was,

610
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:20,376
but technically still am
a wizard, nonpracticing.

611
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,025
- You take a long time to
say nothing, Jack Stormcrow.

612
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:25,837
- You take a long time to
say nothing, Jack Stormcrow.

613
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:28,111
A barbarian does not take kindly to a man

614
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:30,342
who must cheat the elements for valor.

615
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,665
A true measure of a man is in the amount

616
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:37,000
of lives you can take before
his is taken from him.

617
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:39,648
I'm yet to meet the man, woman, or beast

618
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:43,034
worthy of sending me to the sleep eternal.

619
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:48,039
My body provided feast for crow and worm.

620
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:51,379
- Isn't that a little bleak?

621
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,088
- That is the way of things.

622
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,527
- Okay, well, in Melbourne

623
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,072
we have these things called laws.

624
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:59,371
- Bronlo abides only by the code.

625
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,184
Hard laws of steel and conquest.

626
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,438
- And what do those laws allow?

627
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,383
- Rape, pillage, murder.

628
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:11,082
- Well, all three of those are terrible,

629
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,002
and the opposite of laws.

630
00:25:13,003 --> 00:25:15,232
What is against the laws of barbarians?

631
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:16,384
(yells)

632
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:20,587
- Okay, well. If that
was a gift, thank you.

633
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,002
If it was not, ow.

634
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:25,179
- I grow weary of your blathering talk.

635
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,062
By the iron of Crom!

636
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:37,415
- [Dying Person] Help me.

637
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,836
- I don't think this was his house.

638
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:42,140
- [Dying Person] Help.

639
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,251
- Ernie bloody dingo.

640
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,297
(knocks)

641
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:47,574
- Good day, mate.

642
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,505
- I spy with my giant eye.

643
00:25:57,672 --> 00:25:58,672
- Cool.

644
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:15,281
- Holland Hanson.

645
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,186
Hanson.

646
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:17,035
Handsome.

647
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:18,656
She's a handsome woman.

648
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:23,129
- So, maybe stop turning
art critics into stone

649
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,641
and selling them as sculptures.

650
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,333
- [Medusa] You just
don't understand my work.

651
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,835
- Would you like to sample
some champagne, sir?

652
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,968
- [Jack's Dad] What beautiful flesh tones.

653
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:49,089
- Oh, no thanks. I only drink bugs?

654
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:52,596
- That's cool.

655
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,900
- And if you just turn your attention away

656
00:26:55,901 --> 00:26:58,873
from this lovely lady,

657
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:01,663
you'll see another fine piece of work.

658
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:03,719
This is a piece I call,

659
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,450
"Disappointment of a Son."

660
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:08,669
- Hey, dad, you could've told me

661
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,423
that this is where you wandered off to.

662
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:13,235
Trying to lay low, so, maybe just go home.

663
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,197
Stop pretending like you know about art.

664
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:16,753
- I am art.

665
00:27:16,754 --> 00:27:19,960
Fine art, if I do say so myself.

666
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:21,319
And I do.

667
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,678
I'm even in a gallery.

668
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,513
- Okay. Well, at least get
away from the nakedness.

669
00:27:25,514 --> 00:27:27,605
It's embarrassing me in
front of Medusa, man.

670
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:28,915
And she's cool.

671
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,440
- Where do you want me to stand.

672
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:33,286
Next to that giant bowl of fruit?

673
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:36,065
Or the surrealist section?

674
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,272
I don't like that.

675
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:38,813
It's weird.

676
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:40,685
The staircase is confusing.

677
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,116
The clocks are all slippery,

678
00:27:42,117 --> 00:27:45,513
and the women's face is
all in the wrong spot.

679
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:46,914
I shant be returning.

680
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,923
It's gross.

681
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:48,740
- I'll get the turps, dad.

682
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:50,050
Don't think that I won't.

683
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:51,306
- You'll never catch me.

684
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:52,747
I'll hide in the Where's Wally.

685
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:56,720
- Where's Wally already has
a wizard, and he's the worst.

686
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:58,625
- Excuse me, sir, but
there's no longer any need

687
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:00,576
to yell at the art.

688
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:10,617
- What did I just say?

689
00:28:11,718 --> 00:28:12,988
- [Medusa] Facist.

690
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,434
- Mel Gibson.

691
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:19,530
I didn't like his early stuff,
but I like his opinions.
