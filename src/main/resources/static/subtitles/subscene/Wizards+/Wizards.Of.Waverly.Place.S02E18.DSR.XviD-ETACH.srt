1
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:06,247
Ok. And...

2
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:08,248
We're set.

3
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:10,050
I forgot to do my
wizard presentation,

4
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:11,618
So I'm making one up on the spot.

5
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:13,287
What is your topic going to be?

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,657
Wizards versus mortals:
Who is stretchier?

7
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:22,963
Well, this can't be good.

8
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,798
Hey, justin, what is that thing?

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,500
It's a wizard stretcher.

10
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:28,068
Cool. What does it do?

11
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:33,073
It tickles people.

12
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,543
Oh, that makes sense.

13
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:42,349
Alex, justin doesn't seem to
think this is a good idea,

14
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,885
And he's usually better at
seeing danger than you are.

15
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,386
Come on, harper.

16
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,323
Justin thinks singing in
the shower is dangerous.

17
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:51,224
That's because singing
leads to dancing.

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,161
And dancing leads to slipping.

19
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:57,631
Ok, everybody. It's time for
alex's big wizard presentation.

20
00:00:57,665 --> 00:00:59,666
And we are not doing this.

21
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:02,202
Get harper out of there.

22
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,437
But...

23
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:04,938
Fine.

24
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:11,345
Stop it. Oh, please, it tickles.

25
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,814
Please, alex, no.

26
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:16,950
Wait. No, it doesn't.

27
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:21,154
I didn't mean to do that, but it's so
much funnier than what I meant to do.

28
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:23,924
- Alex, this is not a joke.
- Well, harper's laughing.

29
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,360
You know I use laughter
to hide the pain.

30
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:37,504
You can't get away with
treating people like this, alex.

31
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:39,306
Sometimes you're just
not a nice person.

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,908
I'm a nice person.

33
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:44,478
Well, nice enough.

34
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:53,820
Hey, hugh. I didn't
know you were coming by.

35
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,188
Hey, mister russo.

36
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,624
I was taking a stroll
through the portals.

37
00:01:57,658 --> 00:01:59,226
Thought I'd drop in.

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,696
Ok, well, have fun.

39
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,499
I'll go console harper
until she stops laughing.

40
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:08,869
Hey, hugh. What's up?

41
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:11,071
I'll tell you what's up.

42
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:12,773
A cherry lollipop?

43
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:14,808
It's a hobo bindle.

44
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,244
I ran away from home.

45
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:18,945
That is a great idea.

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,548
I'm totally gonna come here
when I run away from home.

47
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:24,317
I just found out I'm
not actually a giant.

48
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,952
Oh. Really?

49
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:28,355
I just found out people
think I'm not very nice.

50
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:32,292
- And I'm adopted.
- Ok, you win.

51
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:35,695
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

52
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:37,597
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

53
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:39,800
* you can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

54
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,435
* yes, please *

55
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,270
* but you might find out
it'll go to your head *

56
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,071
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

57
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,407
* with the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

58
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,242
* that's what I said *

59
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:52,579
* everything is not what it seems *

60
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:56,216
* you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

61
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,786
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

62
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:04,658
* because everything
is not what it seems *

63
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:07,794
* everything is not what it seems *

64
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,598
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

65
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:15,435
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

66
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,306
* because everything is not *

67
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,875
* what it seems *

68
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:28,876

69
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:32,319
I can't believe your parents waited
to tell you you were adopted.

70
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,154
Oh, I always knew.

71
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:36,857
I just assumed my birth
parents were giants, too.

72
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:38,425
And it turns out they're not.

73
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,560
I've been living a giant lie.

74
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:47,067
I like what you did there
with the giant and the lie.

75
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,468
I shouldn't be joking.

76
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:52,372
Listen, hugh,
I think you should go home.

77
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,174
From the size of your hobo bindle,

78
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,043
You only got enough
food for a bite.

79
00:03:57,078 --> 00:04:00,046
No. I'm not going home.

80
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,315
I've been acting like
a giant my entire life

81
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,718
When in reality I'm just
a regular-sized boy.

82
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:07,554
I'd put you on the
wizard stretcher,

83
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:10,857
But the tickling part is broken.

84
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:15,562
Guys, I think we need to be more
sensitive to hugh's feelings right now.

85
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:18,832
What?

86
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,434
I can be sensitive to
a person's feelings.

87
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,772
Unlike you people. Staring is rude.

88
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,609
If you want to be a nicer person,

89
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,846
It might be easier to start with smaller
things until you get the hang of it.

90
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,181
You know, like lying about
how nice my haircuts are,

91
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:38,718
Or not putting hamster
food in max's oatmeal.

92
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,657
Look, I can handle this.

93
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,359
I'll convince hugh to go back
home and talk to his parents

94
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,194
And get everything
straightened out.

95
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:52,365
Really? That actually
sounds like a helpful plan.

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,635
Let's get out of here before
helpful turns into hurtful.

97
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,707
Alex, I'm not going home.

98
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:04,578
I don't feel comfortable talking
about this with my parents.

99
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,714
They don't understand what
it's like not to be a giant.

100
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:11,585
Well, guess I have to
support your decision.

101
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:14,421
Lucky for you, today is the day
I've decided to help others.

102
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:16,556
That doesn't really sound like you.

103
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:18,091
Then if you still want to leave,

104
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,794
I can sneak you upstairs and
you can hide in my bedroom.

105
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,495
That sounds more like you.

106
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,898
Yeah. It'll be more fun. Let's go.

107
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:31,004
Uh oh, maxy.

108
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,340
Looks like you're making
your thinking face again.

109
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,308
That's right.

110
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,879
Mom, I'm sick of alex
treating me with no respect.

111
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,716
I'm thinking of a way
to get back at her.

112
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:44,517
Oh, do you mean like
a practical joke?

113
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,988
Actually, I've been
calling it revenge.

114
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,857
Let's just call it a
practical joke, ok?

115
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,159
It's less of a red flag.

116
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:57,397
I'm a bit of a
practical joker myself.

117
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:59,132
- Really?
- Yeah.

118
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,601
I've played a lot of jokes on
your father over the years.

119
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,570
- Like what?
- Well, like...

120
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:07,207
Wadding up his clothes
so they get all wrinkled.

121
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:14,147
Putting a sign on his back that
says something hilarious like:

122
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,082
"my knees hurt in the morning."

123
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:19,252
Or, or...

124
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,388
"I could use a good shower."

125
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,161
Those are the worst practical
jokes I've ever heard.

126
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:30,463
What? Maybe you just
don't understand them.

127
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:31,598
The note says:

128
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,566
"my knees hurt in the morning."

129
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:38,405
That way when people read it
they think he's a stinky geezer.

130
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:42,575
Don't you get it?

131
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,377
You don't get it?

132
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,147
All right. Here we are.

133
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,315
We'll just wait here until
you start feeling better.

134
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,851
Oh. Let me clean up.

135
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:53,486
Ok. Sit.

136
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:56,423
Are you feeling better now?

137
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,724
- No.
- Ok.

138
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:06,366
- What about now?
- No.

139
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,904
Oh my gosh, this helping others
thing is taking way too long.

140
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,439
Why don't we try talking?

141
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,508
Ok. It's just that my whole life,

142
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:17,811
I always thought I had
a giant's blood...

143
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:21,347
All right. Talking is too
exhausting. Never mind.

144
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:23,216
Why don't I just turn
you into a giant?

145
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,584
Really? Could you do that?

146
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:28,288
Well, technically,
I'm not supposed to,

147
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,423
But my dad thinks
I should be nicer.

148
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:34,160
So really I'd be going against
my father if I didn't do this.

149
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:38,298
Very impressive job
of twisting the facts.

150
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,201
Thank you. It's kind of what I do.

151
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,705
Put on a show. Let's let hugh
know what it's like to grow.

152
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,878
Um, alex?

153
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:54,748
I think you made yourself
into a giant, too.

154
00:07:54,782 --> 00:07:58,284
No. I messed up. I just made
everything in my room smaller.

155
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,487
Well, wait. That's not even.

156
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,889
alex!

157
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,991
That's my dad. I've got
to go see what he wants.

158
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,626
Wait, what should I do?

159
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:08,695
I don't know.
What do giants usually do?

160
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,964
They usually talk about
how small everything is.

161
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,465
Um... Ok, then.

162
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,970
Start with this pillow.
I'll be right back.

163
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:21,808
Oh, man. This pillow is small.

164
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:24,811
That chair is so little.

165
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,513
Ok. We get it.

166
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,449
Everything in here is small.

167
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,184
There you are, honey.

168
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,153
This is doug and cathy normous.

169
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,891
Hugh's parents?

170
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,592
They say he ran away.

171
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,094
Do you know anything about this?

172
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:44,764
I saw him this morning in the lair.

173
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,232
But then he left the lair.

174
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,334
He's not here,
right? I don't know anything.

175
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:52,238
I heard there were
giants in the house.

176
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:53,640
Oh my gosh.

177
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:55,708
Hello. Welcome, you guys.

178
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,510
My name is justin russo.

179
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:00,647
This is such an incredible honor.
I've read so many facts about giants.

180
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:05,251
Like how you're so big they make
push brooms out of your nose hairs.

181
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:08,421
Here we go again
with the stereotypes.

182
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:09,722
That's not a fact.

183
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,125
That's from a joke
book about giants.

184
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,495
No, it isn't. My dad told me.

185
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:20,300
He also told me your shoes are so
big they come with turn signals.

186
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,868
And when you back up you go:

187
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:24,337
Beep. Coming through. Giant. Beep.

188
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:30,376
I might have heard a couple
of things down at the lodge.

189
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:33,112
They may not be true.

190
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:36,649
Alex, did hugh say
where he was going?

191
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:38,985
We think he may have gone to
look for his birth parents.

192
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,353
Which is ok with us.

193
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,622
We always figured he'd
want to do that one day.

194
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:46,226
Are you saying hugh's adopted?

195
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,529
He's adopted. What?

196
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:52,131
Please, if you hear
from him, call us.

197
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,133
We certainly will, mr.
And mrs. Normous.

198
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:55,935
We'll let you know
if anything turns up.

199
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,938
Oh, doug. I hope hughy's ok.

200
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,875
Don't worry, mrs. Normous.
I'm sure he'll show up.

201
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:04,844
Oh, there.

202
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,880
Well, you know what dad says:

203
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:09,182
"giant tears,
break out the life raft."

204
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:10,383
Shh.

205
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,052
Ok. She's just joking.

206
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,355
Ooh.

207
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,956
Why don't you go wash that, honey?

208
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,625
Go ahead.

209
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,367
Oh.

210
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,102
Hello, hugh.

211
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:31,671
You don't mind if I play a
practical joke on alex, do you?

212
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,573
You think you have a
better practical joke

213
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:36,242
Than what already happened in here?

214
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:41,247
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

215
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,750
Check this out.

216
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,885
Please tell me those
aren't grasshoppers.

217
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,155
I have a terrible
fear of grasshoppers.

218
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,591
- They're not grasshoppers.
- Oh, good.

219
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,626
- They're crickets.
- Close enough.

220
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,399
They're everywhere.

221
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,267
Wow, hugh. Nice job.

222
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:04,070
You broke everything
and made it look small.

223
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:08,775
Yeah, we get it.

224
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,544
It is a very small table.

225
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:14,280
Bye bye, mr. And mrs. Normous.

226
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:16,516
Come back anytime!

227
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,021
What was that ruckus?

228
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,926
What ruckus?

229
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:28,661
From upstairs.

230
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,264
I heard a ruckus.

231
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:35,034
Can you describe
the ruckus, justin?

232
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:39,072
Kind of like a max ruckus.

233
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:41,407
You know, you may be right.

234
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,643
I'm going to investigate.
By myself.

235
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:47,747
It might be too dangerous for you.
You know how ruckuues can get.

236
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:51,351
And now I have to go investigate.

237
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,091
What are you smiling at?

238
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,660
What's that on your back, jerry?

239
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:04,764
Looks like somebody
taped a sign on there.

240
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:08,735
Says, "I'm very lazy".

241
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,570
Was that there the whole time?

242
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:15,174
Now the giants think I'm lazy.

243
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,377
Oh, honey.

244
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:20,246
My room!

245
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,848
Max, what did you do?

246
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:24,217
You see how she just
assumes it was me?

247
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:30,356
Hugh! Shrunken room!

248
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:31,958
Alex, I knew you
were up to no good.

249
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,193
You see how he just
assumes it was me?

250
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:40,135
Alex, I think you need
to go tell mom and dad

251
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,771
You've been harboring hugh
in your shrunken bedroom.

252
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:46,241
And I think you need to consider
being a nicer person, like me.

253
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:47,676
I mean that in the nicest way.

254
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:50,412
Even your nice way sounds snarky.

255
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:53,482
Um, alex...

256
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:55,751
I appreciate what you're
trying to do for me,

257
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,719
But the only thing
you've shown me is

258
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:00,622
I can't be a giant without
ruining everything.

259
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:03,926
At least before I thought I
was supposed to be a giant.

260
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,427
I don't know who I am now.

261
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:09,331
Helping people is so complicated.

262
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,567
Rj  maybe we should
find your birth parents.

263
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:12,968
That could make you feel better.

264
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:16,738
Yeah. Maybe it would.
How would we find them?

265
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:18,907
I'm sure justin will
come up with something.

266
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:22,611
- I'm not getting involved.
- Ok. Fine. Come on, hugh.

267
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:25,981
You can hide in justin's room. I'll
tell mom and dad he's hiding you there.

268
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:29,318
- I got a couple ideas.
- I had a feeling you would.

269
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:32,121
ah!

270
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,724
All right, everybody follow justin.

271
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:37,460
No. Except for you. You stay here.

272
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:40,730
If my room isn't fixed,
I'm telling mom and dad what you did.

273
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:46,635
At least give me a spell
to help clean it up.

274
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,170
you're on your own, jerk face.

275
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:49,805
Thank you.

276
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:55,678
"you're on your own, jerk face."

277
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:59,382
All we have to find is the ancient and
delicate book of wizard family trees.

278
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,684
- Got it.
- Don't drop it.

279
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,326
Wow. That thing's really sprouted
since I last looked at it.

280
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,628
I've been watering it.
I put these cool wheels on it

281
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:14,930
In case you need to
wheel it anywhere.

282
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,001
Each leaf tells a different
person's history.

283
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:20,269
Here's dad's.

284
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,905
Russo family history.
Five generations.

285
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:26,509
Current generation: Jerry russo,
son of duke and rose russo.

286
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:27,510
hey.

287
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:30,045
Shh.

288
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,915
Hugh, what are you doing here?
Your parents are worried sick.

289
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,918
We're taking your advice.
You told me to be a nicer person,

290
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,087
So we're helping hugh
find his birth parents.

291
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:40,489
You lied to us about
knowing where hugh was.

292
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,658
And you lied to a pair of giants.

293
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:46,262
The guys at the lodge
say giants eat liars.

294
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,798
It's my fault, mr. Russo.

295
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:51,700
Alex lied because this is
really important to me.

296
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,736
I need to learn about
my birth parents.

297
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,106
Well, you did tell alex
she needs to be nicer.

298
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,408
Yeah, but I didn't
think she'd do it.

299
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:01,577
All right, let's make this quick.

300
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,279
Is that hugh's leaf?

301
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:06,449
Jerry russo's great-great
grandfather, ignatius russo,

302
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,551
Wrote the first joke
book about giants.

303
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,056
I don't know anything about that.

304
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:17,893
Here it is. My family leaf.

305
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:19,195
Hugh normous.

306
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,564
Adoptive parents:
Doug and cathy normous.

307
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:24,500
Birth parents:
Lew and mary lou fineman.

308
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,469
Lew and mary lou fineman.

309
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:28,737
I wonder if you have
permission to contact them.

310
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,940
- He does.
- Oh, that was easy. Ok.

311
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:33,142
Justin, can I use your wand?

312
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:35,911
I used up all my minutes
crank calling your wand.

313
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:40,816
- So, you're miss higglebottom?
- Hello, justin.

314
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:44,587
Make this all better.

315
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,622
Um... Ok.

316
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:48,324
Put things back.

317
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:53,362
Roomius fixus.

318
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:00,803
Wow, I can't believe that worked.

319
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:03,706
Ok. Now I just have
to think of a way

320
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,008
To put all this
stuff back together.

321
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,043
Let's go thinking face.

322
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:10,679
Alex?

323
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:14,083
Whoa, what happened in here?

324
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:17,887
- Harper, I need your help.
- With what?

325
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:20,789
You were a part of alex's plan to put
me in that tickling machine earlier.

326
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:25,294
- No, I wasn't.
- Well, you were there.

327
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:28,197
What does that have
to do with anything?

328
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:31,433
I'm going to mess up my room to
draw attention away from this room.

329
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:35,037
All you need to do is help me
destroy everything that I own.

330
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:40,276
That'll teach alex to mess with me.

331
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,212
This is why I hardly
ever talk to you.

332
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,851
There, my wand is protected
from crank callers,

333
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,020
Because I added a password.

334
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:53,489
Submarine.

335
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:59,795
That's not it.

336
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:08,437
Alex, do you think my birth parents are
going to like me when they get here?

337
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,205
They're your family, hugh.

338
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:13,042
They don't have to like you,
they just have to put up with you.

339
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:16,245
Like right now, jerry.

340
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,883
I mean, they'll have no
problem putting up with you.

341
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,353
Alex, I need to talk to you.

342
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,623
Max is going to destroy his room.

343
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:29,758
He thinks it'll get him off
for destroying your room.

344
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,294
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Thank you.

345
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,930
You have to make sure
he goes through with it.

346
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,999
What? But it's a ridiculous plan.

347
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,034
What I've been learning, harper,

348
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:42,204
Is that sometimes it's nice
to do things for others.

349
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:45,474
So, could you do this
for me as a friend.

350
00:17:45,508 --> 00:17:47,176
As a very, very best friend.

351
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,245
You russos are so manipulative.

352
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:57,987
Hi, you must be the
finemans. Come in.

353
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:01,490
Yes, that's right. Hi.
Lew and mary lou fineman.

354
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,459
You must be alex.
Thanks for the phone call.

355
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:04,760
Now where's that boy of ours?

356
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:06,395
I'm right here.

357
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,298
Oh!

358
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,133
Look at you.

359
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:15,337
You're just as handsome
as we remember you.

360
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:17,906
Son, come here, ya big lout.

361
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:23,245
Wow. Big. Look...

362
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,681
I just wanted you to know
before we go any further,

363
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:29,818
That we love you and
we always loved you.

364
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:34,289
It was a difficult decision
giving you up for adoption, hugh.

365
00:18:34,324 --> 00:18:36,759
Not because there's
anything wrong with you.

366
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:39,728
There's something wrong
with your father.

367
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:43,065
It's called "
can't hold down a job."

368
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:46,135
Making pottery is a job.

369
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,705
As soon as you sell one it will be.

370
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:55,310
Look at them putting
up with each other.

371
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:56,845
It's ok.

372
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,683
I was raised by some really nice
people who I love very much.

373
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:04,753
I'm just glad to be able to meet
the people who gave birth to me.

374
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:06,689
We're glad, too.

375
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:09,858
But maybe we should go somewhere
else to talk about it.

376
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,927
I think I heard a cricket
somewhere in this house

377
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:14,396
Bnd I am terrified of those things.

378
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:17,966
Hey. Me, too!
I must get that from you.

379
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:20,302
I wonder what you got from me.

380
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:30,212
Well, you didn't get your
size from us, that's for sure.

381
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:34,016
Really? I don't normally
think of myself as big.

382
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,586
Are you kidding?
You're like a human skyscraper.

383
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,021
Don't you mean a giant?

384
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,589
Exactly.

385
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:44,093
I guess, in a way, I'm exactly
who I always thought I was.

386
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:46,462
I'm a giant after all.

387
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:51,133
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

388
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,037
When did you promise yourself that?

389
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:56,739
You didn't know this
was going to happen.

390
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,109
I'm not afraid of my emotions.

391
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:02,077
Thanks, everyone,
for all your help.

392
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:03,812
Especially you, alex.

393
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:06,682
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

394
00:20:06,716 --> 00:20:08,984
Thanks, hugh.

395
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:11,954
And could you say that again
louder so my dad can hear?

396
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:15,891
Are you ready, hugh?

397
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:19,561
Yeah, but could we stop and get
my parents before we go to talk?

398
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:22,097
Yes, we'd love to meet them.

399
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:24,333
They should come over to our house.

400
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,135
Maybe we should go out.

401
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:30,205
A couch seats four of
us but only one of them.

402
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,208
Bye, lew. Mary lou. Hugh.

403
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:39,348
Alex, your mother and I are very
proud of the way you helped.

404
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:41,283
Wait a minute. What is that?

405
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:44,019
- What?
- That feeling in my stomach.

406
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:46,655
It's kind of warm and pleasant.

407
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:50,225
That's called compassion.

408
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:55,063
It's what happens when you do
something nice for someone else.

409
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,568
Wow. Well...

410
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:02,471
I probably won't make a habit of it,
but it's not too bad.

411
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:13,570
Hey, I can't believe this,

412
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:16,106
But somebody destroyed my room.

413
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:19,576
What are you talking about?

414
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,244
Everything I own.

415
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,780
- Completely ruined.
- What?

416
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:30,153
Well, now that my
room is destroyed,

417
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:34,257
Mom and dad will never believe
I destroyed your room, too.

418
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,259
Guess I showed you, alex.

419
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:42,632
Max, you are lobbing this one
so high up for her right now.

420
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:46,570
Oh yeah? Take a look at
this whole box of lob.

421
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:50,540
- Your clock radio is broken?
- Yep.

422
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,009
- Your lava lamp is lava-less?
- Mm-hm.

423
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:56,379
And your ceramic hamburger
has a gnarly bite out of it?

424
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,181
You got that right.

425
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:03,119
Wow, max. You sure got me by
wrecking all of your own stuff.

426
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:05,589
That's right I got you. Wait...

427
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,926
Oh, man. I think I got me.

428
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,396
Dude, this is mine.

429
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:14,598
So you got her too.

430
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,267
Sucker. High five, brother.

431
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:23,268
