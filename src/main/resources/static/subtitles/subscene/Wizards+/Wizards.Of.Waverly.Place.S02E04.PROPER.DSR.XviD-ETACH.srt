1
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:08,360
Is he looking at me?
Is he looking at me?

2
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:10,198
- No. Walk by again.
- I can't.

3
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:12,602
That'll be my fifth time.
He'll think I'm lost.

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,109
How am I gonna
figure out if he likes me?

5
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:16,812
Why is this
so hard for you?

6
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:18,282
Because he knows
I like him,

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,984
And I don't know
how he feels about me.

8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,820
I've never been
in this position before.

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,159
That's why I play it cool around Justin.
I don't want him to know I like him.

10
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,263
There he is! Hi, Justin I was wondering
if you wanted to come over today

11
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:31,402
Because I rented three dvds and
they're not due till Monday...

12
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:33,573
All right, I'll talk to you
later about it! Bye!

13
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:39,680
Yeah, I can't play it
cool like you, Harper.

14
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:43,118
Look, I'm just gonna
go up to him,

15
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:44,686
Talk to him
and see if he likes me.

16
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:47,756
- Hey, Dean!
- What's up, russo?

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,292
Hey, Dean! We got the full
story on that sweet ride!

18
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,596
- The one for the race at paramus!
- Sounds great.

19
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,332
Joey's getting the story on this
car we might run. Tell it, joey.

20
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:57,067
Yeah, tell it, joey.

21
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:00,972
So, they had to rebuild. It was
completely greasy and... And...

22
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,208
Car's not gonna be ready in time.

23
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:05,810
Oh, bummer that stinks.

24
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:10,548
And I'll bet they attached
thettlebrock heads

25
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:13,014
And ordered a new
mylodon panatonic coat.

26
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:18,720
We didn't want that car. It didn't
have rack-and-pinion steering.

27
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,756
Yeah, 'cause steering
is important.

28
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:25,929
Because without it
all roads...

29
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:28,065
...Would have to be straight.

30
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:36,774
"all roads would have to be
straight"? That went terrible.

31
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,408
What's a "rack and pinion"
anyway?

32
00:01:38,642 --> 00:01:40,643
Well, a "rack" is what
you hang clothes on,

33
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:43,479
And "'pinion" is what
you think of things.

34
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:48,350
Like, "my 'pinion of that dress,
Harper, is that it's beautiful."

35
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,085
Oh, why, thank you.

36
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:55,458
Well, that sounds
kind of right, Harper,

37
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,727
But I don't think they
were talking about clothes.

38
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,397
Dean's always got
his posse with him.

39
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:02,466
I need to get alone time
with him, you know?

40
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,401
Aren't you afraid
of being alone with him?

41
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:07,770
I hear he uses bar soap
for his body and his hair.

42
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:12,141
No. That's the only way
I'll figure out if he likes me.

43
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,009
Alone time is golden time.

44
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:15,844
That's what my mom
always says to my dad

45
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:18,447
Before they take their
separate vacations every summer.

46
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:24,285
Um, ok, here he comes. I'm gonna try it again.
If I jack it up, just pull the fire alarm.

47
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,022
I will not pull the fire alarm!
I'm a junior fire marshall.

48
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:32,361
Hey! Um, my family owns
the waverly sub station,

49
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:35,931
Which is really convenient if you want
a sandwich. You should come by sometime.

50
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:38,801
You got salads there?
I likes my greens.

51
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:40,635
He does.
He eats balanced.

52
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,771
What...

53
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,539
I wasn't panicking.
I was doing fine.

54
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,375
It wasn't me.
This must be a real fire.

55
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,045
All right! Nice and orderly, people!
Nice and orderly! Single file!

56
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:54,182
I'm a junior fire marshall!

58
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:52,969
Max, why do you
keep sending away

59
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:55,138
For that stuff from the
back of the wizard weekly?

60
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:56,973
It's always a rip-off.

61
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,574
Justin, come on.

62
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:02,744
There's no way an invisibility
poncho could be a rip off.

63
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:05,746
Watch. All I need to do
is put this on,

64
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:06,880
And I am invisible.

65
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:12,018
Hey. You can't
see me, can you?

66
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,420
I'm over here.

67
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:17,788
Now, I'm over here.

68
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,923
Now, I'm over here.

69
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,560
Can't see me,
can you?

70
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:26,262
Um, only your poncho
disappeared.

71
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:30,299
Oh, man.
It's defective.

72
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,100
Of course it's defective.
Dude, it's a rip-off.

73
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:35,536
Those things never deliver
on what they promise.

74
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:39,073
Instead of spending time on that, you
should be taking steps to improve yourself,

75
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:40,241
Like I am.

76
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:42,777
You got a job
as an ice cream man?

77
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,682
Tennis racquet.

78
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:55,619
It's gonna be hard to scoop
ice cream with that thing.

79
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:58,221
I'm taking tennis lessons.

80
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:02,358
I've decided that taking up a sport will
look good on my college applications.

81
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:04,093
If you had a job
as an ice cream man,

82
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,095
You wouldn't need
to go to college.

83
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:09,765
Max, why don't you save
yourself some time and heartache

84
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:13,702
And put your poncho package
up on your "shelf of shame."

85
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:16,205
Ah, the amazing
3-d glasses.

86
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,906
Let's put these things on,

87
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:19,907
And take a look at
what else you fell for.

88
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:21,475
Shall we?

89
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:26,345
Ah, the amazing transport stick.

90
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,880
I remember this one.

91
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,815
It'll take you anywhere
you want to go,

92
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,018
As long as it's
only 36 inches away.

93
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:36,420
This one's not a rip-off.

94
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:38,389
Transport!

95
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,727
Oh, yeah.

96
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,329
Now I remember what
the defect was.

97
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,900
Anybody around it when I say
"transport" gets knocked out.

98
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,769
You're right, Justin.
These things are a rip-off.

99
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:58,471
Mind-reading kit!
I'm so getting this!

100
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:14,720
Wow! Thank you, Harper,

101
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:18,523
For going through all that trouble to make a
themed outfit for when I hang out with Dean,

102
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:20,191
But you're not
a part of that, right?

103
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:21,826
This isn't for you and Dean.

104
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,161
This is for my first day
of driver's education.

105
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:26,763
It can't hurt to put
your best foot forward.

106
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,602
That's ok, mrs. Russo.
You have the right of way.

107
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:35,503
Cars always yield
to pedestrians.

108
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,176
Um, honey, listen,
I found this great charity

109
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:44,179
Where you donate your used car and
they give it to someone who needs it.

110
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:47,548
Great. I love charities, but
we don't have a car to donate.

111
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:50,317
Uh, yeah we do. The piece
of junk in the garage,

112
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:52,886
That makes us call
our laundry room the garage.

113
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,425
And I suppose just because there's a
treadmill with your stockings hanging on it,

114
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,659
It's a home gym, too.

115
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,268
Oh, my gosh. He's here. What
do I do? What do I bring him?

116
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,104
- He likes salad.
- Right. Ok.

117
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,009
- Alex, that's not a salad.
- Oh. Right.

118
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:21,046
Good.

119
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:26,550
How am I going to talk to him
and find out if he likes me now?

120
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:28,652
I'm gonna tell him
I need to talk to him alone.

121
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:31,856
Whoa, you never tell a guy
you want to talk to him alone.

122
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,091
You know what that sounds
like? He's in trouble.

123
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:37,660
Or that a girl wants to talk about
her feelings, which is also trouble.

124
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:39,695
Why would I ever
listen to you two?

125
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:42,029
- Don't you want a guy's point of view?
- Yeah, sure.

126
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,095
Why don't you nurses
find one and send him over?

127
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:47,397
Five-point-four percent
of nurses are men.

128
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:49,098
- It's a noble profession.
- Yeah.

129
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,933
You know what else
is a noble profession?

130
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,701
Continuing to speak to Alex
like she's on a tenth grade level

131
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:56,904
When we know she can't
comprehend most words.

132
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,473
- Ooh-hoo-hoo! -
"comprehend" means understand.

133
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:01,708
- S-s-s-s.
- Total burn.

134
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:05,343
And I would have treated that burn, if
you hadn't talked smack about nurses.

135
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,016
Ok, look, Alex, if you
wanna talk to a guy,

136
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,285
You gotta find an object
of common interest.

137
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:17,587
For example, Dean's into cars and
roaming the halls without a pass.

138
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:20,722
Nah-uh! He does have a pass.
I make them for him.

139
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:23,858
Oh! Why don't you talk
to him about that car

140
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,560
Mom and dad are always
fighting about?

141
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:28,261
Dean's into cars,
you got a car... Huh?

142
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:30,629
Here's your object of
common interest. Take it.

143
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,998
I think I get it, Justin.

144
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:36,166
For example, you're into
action figures.

145
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,567
I was going through my dad's
stuff that we have to sell

146
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,202
And I found something I'm not
sure we should keep or throw out.

147
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:45,574
- It might be an action figure.
- Action figures, huh?

148
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,277
Yeah, it's like an old boat
captain or something.

149
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:52,014
With a hook for a hand and a
glass eye that's also a telescope?!

150
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,414
Yeah. How did you know?

151
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:57,117
Because that's a first edition
captain jim bob sherwood!

152
00:08:57,152 --> 00:09:00,487
Well, you can come over and look
at it right after we have dinner.

153
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:02,088
You got it!

154
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,190
Wow, his advice
really worked!

155
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,792
I think we have a date.
You should listen to him more.

156
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:11,162
I should listen to a lot of people
more. But what are you gonna do?

157
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:15,299
Hey, salad.

158
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:17,168
Just like my mama makes.

159
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:21,838
Thanks, russo.

160
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,641
So, uh,
what's going on?

161
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:27,242
The guys are upset about not
having a car to race at paramus,

162
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:29,311
So I thought I'd cheer
'em up with some nachos.

163
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:31,013
Oh, we don't
serve nachos.

164
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,548
But, how about
I melt some cheese

165
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,282
On some stale bread?
Would that work?

166
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,285
Sure. Just like my mama makes.

167
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,955
Yes...

168
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,857
Like your mom really
makes it like that...

169
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:48,794
Oh, I'm laughing too long.

170
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:50,396
Awkward.

171
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:55,333
My dad has an old car
that doesn't work.

172
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:58,770
It's in the garage. You can work on it
and fix it and maybe enter it in the race.

173
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:01,973
Really? The race at the
paramus fair is in a week.

174
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:03,173
Ooh, I love the fair!

175
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,841
I hear in the infield
this year,

176
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:09,244
They're gonna break the record by
making the world's biggest sloppy joe.

177
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,513
So, uh, when should we come by
to check out the car?

178
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:15,181
Now. You should come alone
because the garage is cramped

179
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:16,883
Only room for
a couple people.

180
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:20,653
Ok. Guys, I'm working
on the car by myself.

181
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:26,692
Daddy, you know that car momma
says is junk but I love?

182
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:27,926
You love my car?

183
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,861
Oh, yes. Keep up with me here.
Love it.

184
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,497
Ok. And you're going to love
that I got somebody from school

185
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,465
To come over
and fix it for free!

186
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,232
I do like free things.

187
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:46,973
So this is the mind reading
kit you sent away for?

188
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,008
It looks like
a toilet paper tube

189
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:51,242
With glitter and macaroni
shells glued to it.

190
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:55,679
It was a kit.
I followed the instructions.

191
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:58,982
Ok.

192
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,617
Now think something!

193
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:04,018
Thinking.

194
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:07,521
Think harder!

195
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:10,490
Don't think you need one of those
to figure out what I'm thinking.

196
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:15,494
<i>You got ripped
off again, dude.</i>

197
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,696
- It works!
- It works?

198
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,329
If you gotta stand that close
to hear someone's thoughts,

199
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:24,699
The only thing you're gonna hear is, "why is
this freak holding a macaroni tube to my head?"

200
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:30,202
So easy to criticize when you didn't
spend hours with a hot glue gun.

201
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:34,072
It took you hours
to make this stupid thing?

202
00:11:34,107 --> 00:11:37,643
No, it took me a few minutes
to make this thing.

203
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:41,413
It took me a few hours to get
my hand unglued from my face.

204
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,420
Transport!

205
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:54,026
That's what you get
for making fun of my stuff.

206
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,834
Can you hold it closer?

207
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:03,236
Uh, the answer
to that is yes.

208
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,240
- Since you asked me something, I'd like to ask you something.
- Sure. Anything.

209
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:13,144
Ok, well, there's a lot of
ways I could go here. So...

210
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:16,547
How do you feel
about me...

211
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:19,717
...In flip-flops? I'm thinking
about going casual all summer.

212
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:22,453
Uh, well...

213
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:25,488
That's, uh, not a shoe that
provides very much protection.

214
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:29,892
- I'd vote against it.
- Yeah, totally. That's what I was thinking.

215
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:32,929
Look, I'm just gonna come out and
ask you what I really want to ask you.

216
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:36,498
No, no, no, no. It's my turn.
I wanna tell you something.

217
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:39,200
Oh, you want to tell me
something? That's great.

218
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:41,702
'cause now would be the time
to do it. No one's around.

219
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:44,605
Ok, uh...

220
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,941
Well, I've been, uh, having
this feeling that, uh...

221
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:59,183
Hey, I just came down
to use the home gym.

222
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,757
There, that should
dry nicely.

223
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,659
So, how's my baby doing?

224
00:13:10,694 --> 00:13:13,228
- Daddy, I'm fine.
- Oh. Wh... Well, you are my baby.

225
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:15,863
But, I was talking
about my baby.

226
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:18,532
Ok, we're both fine.

227
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,202
Hey, if the man's giving me
his car to race at paramus,

228
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:24,238
- He gets to see what I'm doing to it.
- We're racing it at the fair?

229
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:27,674
They're making the world's
biggest sloppy joe this year!

230
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,876
I love food that's
bigger than it should be!

231
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:33,647
All this talk about sloppy joes
is making you hungry.

232
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:35,315
You should have mom
go make you one.

233
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,616
- What's going on?
- I'm adjusting your air intake,

234
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,284
So your fuel
will be more rich.

235
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,154
You should try doing that
to the cash register upstairs.

236
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,391
Oh! Watch the pipe.

237
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:52,195
Guys! Guess what? We tried
out for the tennis team,

238
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,996
And the coach told us
to get in shape.

239
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:56,866
- Really?
- For the cross country team.

240
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,734
We didn't make
the tennis team.

241
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,002
Apparently, our headbands
were a little too tight.

242
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,637
We got light-headed
really fast.

243
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:08,275
Great story. Go tell
everybody in the sub station?

244
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:10,611
Already told 'em.
They said to come down here.

245
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:12,946
All right, Alex,

246
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,950
Who shoved a super-duper bouncy
ball in my mind-reading tube?

247
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:19,551
Well, I don't know.

248
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:22,587
Who's the only person in this
family who has a super bouncy ball?

249
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:24,555
Me, but then I lost it.

250
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:29,058
If anyone sees it,
it looks just like this one.

251
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:32,494
Ok! Everybody fan out and help
Max find his super bouncy ball.

252
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:35,130
I think I saw it. Come
on, upstairs. Not here.

253
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:44,205
Yay! It's momma, coming down
here to get you all out of here.

254
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:48,976
That's a miracle.

255
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,545
Dean, my man!
That's fantastic!

256
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,280
Come on, let's take
it for a test drive!

257
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:54,747
Yes!

258
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:56,516
- Whoo!
- Bucket seats!

259
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,784
Okay. Fine.
Let's all take a family ride

260
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:00,352
In the new car.

261
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:01,920
Ok.

262
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:06,390
All right.

263
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:09,993
Oh, uh, honey, can you open the
garage door, so we can get out of here?

264
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:14,797
You wanted to
be alone, right?

265
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,348
Well, it's not like
they ditched you, Alex.

266
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:26,083
You did get to ride
in the car with Dean.

267
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:27,785
Yeah, on my mom's lap

268
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,420
With Justin and zeke signaling
truckers to blow their horn.

269
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:32,922
Honk! Dork! Dork!

270
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,492
Not how I pictured it!

271
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,194
So, I'm sorry you didn't
get to find out if he likes you.

272
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,062
Maybe it wouldn't even matter
if I was alone with Dean.

273
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:44,498
Maybe he's the kind of guy who just
doesn't tell people if he likes them.

274
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:49,068
Oh, man. Dean and I are having
the best time fixing up that car.

275
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,937
You know what
he told me?

276
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:53,271
He likes me.

277
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:57,909
It made my day.

278
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,643
I'm giddy for you, dad.

279
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:02,012
But, did he happen
to mention anything about me?

280
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,713
Why would he do that?

281
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,484
This is so frustrating. I've tried
everything. What am I gonna do now?

282
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,953
Yeah, too bad you
can't read his mind.

283
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:18,124
Yeah... Too bad.

284
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,194
See, right there. If I knew how to read
minds, I would know exactly what you meant

285
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:26,130
By the way you said,
"yeah. Too bad."

286
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:48,315
<i>I can't believe I didn't
make the cross country team.</i>

287
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:51,084
<i>Everybody makes
the cross country team.</i>

288
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:55,788
<i>I mean, I know I threw up.
But I kept running.</i>

289
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:58,723
<i>I'll tell my family
I made the cross country team</i>

290
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:02,660
<i>And then I'll sand down the soles
of my shoes to make it look real.</i>

291
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:09,299
Oh, hey, Alex.
Guess what?

292
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,767
I made the cross country team.

293
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:12,469
It works. You're a liar.

294
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:16,339
All right, what else
might come in handy?

295
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:19,809
- Oh. "transport stick?" I wonder how it works.
- No, no, no! Alex,

296
00:17:19,843 --> 00:17:22,677
- Whatever you do, don't! Don't oh!
- Oh. Transport!

297
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:29,816
<i>Lap five, race fans! The
racers have begun lap five!</i>

298
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:32,685
Honk it! Honk your horn! Honk it!

299
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,055
Would you two sit down?
There's no honking in racing.

300
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,558
Hey, there's Dean in my car!

301
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,194
Hey, he honked at me!

302
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:45,264
I gotta go. I figured out a place where I
can get Dean alone and see if he likes me,

303
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,533
During a pit stop. No one
can interrupt us there.

304
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,768
That's not going to work.
His posse is his pit crew.

305
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,370
- They'll be all over him.
- They'll be all over his car.

306
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,371
- It's the only time they won't focus on him.
- I'll come with you.

307
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:58,874
Really? Is this, like, whole "me and
Dean alone" thing just, like, lost on you?

308
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:00,575
Not anymore. I'll stay here.

309
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:14,586
Russo, how'd you get in here?

310
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:18,422
You can get in anywhere with a jumpsuit and
a yardstick. I want to talk to Dean, alone.

311
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:21,525
A bean burrito and a side of
hash browns. How 'bout you?

312
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,794
What? No!
That's not what I said.

313
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:35,836
Russo. What're you
doing down here?

314
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:37,337
Look Dean, I was
trying to find

315
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:39,038
A quiet place
so we could talk.

316
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:44,342
You know that I like you and that's why
I've been acting kind of weird lately.

317
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:47,645
And not my amazingly charming
and cool-without-trying self.

318
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,681
- You're good to go! Go! Go!
- What? No, stay! Stay!

319
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,283
Sorry, russo.
Got a race to win.

320
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:56,319
Transport!

321
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:03,687
Shoot! Didn't think
this through.

322
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,488
Oh, he's looks so cute
when he's sleeping.

323
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:14,794
Sorry, Dean. Transport!

324
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:20,467
Oh, no. The giant sloppy joe
is full of ants.

325
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:23,935
Oh, wait.
Those are people.

326
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:26,136
This is gonna be great!

327
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,238
Oh, man!

328
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:30,172
Dean, are you ok?

329
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,275
<i>I have to find
joey a girlfriend.</i>

330
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:36,844
Ok, that's what
you're thinking about?

331
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:43,484
What is Dean up to?
He's scratching up my baby!

332
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,554
Wow. That looks bad enough
to ruin the car.

333
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,656
We'll never be able
to take it home.

334
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:56,294
This will never work.
The macaroni's falling off.

335
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,663
Ok, it's time to go
old school on this.

336
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,165
- Dean, we need to talk.
- What?

337
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,367
Russo! What are you
going in here?

338
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:05,970
Watch it!

339
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,872
Brake, brake!
Now punch the throttle!

340
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:13,909
- Not bad.
- Dean, look. I like you, a lot.

341
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:16,778
Draft him. Draft him.

342
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:24,819
- Do you like me, or not?
- Whoa. Yeah, yeah, I do.

343
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,654
- Really?
- Yeah.

344
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,690
- Why do you think I told the guys they couldn't help?
- Why?

345
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:31,458
Because, I wanted
to be alone,

346
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:34,627
But then your family kept piling in.
I'm trying to make a good impression.

347
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:36,229
I'm not going
to tell them to leave.

348
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:38,130
My uncle raised me with manners.

349
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,633
You wanted to make
a good impression?

350
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,836
Yeah, but I wasn't sure
how far to go.

351
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,771
That's so sweet.

352
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:52,275
Dean, sorry, maybe you
should take the wheel.

353
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,710
Yeah.

354
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:58,447
- We make a good team.
- Yeah, we do.

355
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:00,415
I'm not talking
about the driving.

356
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,150
Good, 'cause neither was I.

357
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,120
Sloppy Joe!

358
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,160
This is so romantic!

359
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:22,753
Hey. What are you
doing out here?

360
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:25,955
Oh, well, I just found out
the boy I like likes me.

361
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:27,656
So, like all
those sappy movies

362
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,659
I thought I should come out here to
the terrace and stare at the stars.

363
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:32,695
But I gotta tell you,
it's really boring.

364
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:36,430
So, I guess you and Dean
are an item then?

365
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:38,732
I gotta say, I'm kinda sorry about that.

366
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,800
Since when do you care?

367
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:42,802
I'd always thought
when you got a boyfriend

368
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:45,539
I'd be able to intimidate him if
he gets out of line or something,

369
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:48,209
But I don't think
I could do that with Dean.

370
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:51,314
He ripped the sleeves
off of his winter coat.

371
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,186
Aw, don't worry about it.

372
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:57,857
If he gets out of line, I'll be slapping
him silly with those winter coat sleeves.

373
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:00,025
Good one.

374
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,160
- I wish I would have
thought of that. - Yeah.

375
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,895
So, what are you
doing out here?

376
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,430
Hiding from dad.

377
00:22:05,464 --> 00:22:07,331
He thinks I'm at
cross country practice.

378
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,367
Well, let me help you with that.

379
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:14,504
- Oh!
- There. Now you're all sweaty.

380
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:18,273
You wouldn't.

381
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,042
Transport.

382
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:24,311
Thank you very much.

383
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
