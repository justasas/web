1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,659
What was the name of that song?
Stop, you're hurting my ears?

2
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:16,764
Yes, it's off my new cd
called Alex is a cow, moo.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,235
Hey, we have
a sister named Alex!

4
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,339
All right, everybody,
listen up.

5
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:27,308
For today's lesson, we have a
special guest from the wizard world

6
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:31,446
Coming to talk to you guys
about a very important subject:

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,082
The future.

8
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:36,784
Oh. You mean
two minutes from now,

9
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:39,487
When I'll be faking a stomach
ache to get out of this lesson?

10
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:42,557
No, I'm talking about
you kids finding jobs one day.

11
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:46,394
Oh! Stomach ache. Look at that,
it came two minutes early.

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,431
Mr. Stuffleby! Welcome.

13
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:54,569
Kids, I'd like you to meet your
new wizard guidance counselor.

14
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:59,307
Oh. Hate to be impolite, but
what's up with your fa, dude?

15
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,577
My mother
is one quarter gargoyle.

16
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:06,381
It's a bit distracting,
but you'll get used to it.

17
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:10,151
Not likely. I'm not
even used to Justin's face.

18
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:14,255
As you all know,
one of you is destined

19
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,357
To win the family
wizard competition,

20
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,826
Thus becoming an adult wizard

21
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:22,330
And going on to live a life of
incredible excitement and adventure.

22
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:24,198
That will probably be me.

23
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:27,402
Two of you, on the other hand,

24
00:01:27,436 --> 00:01:29,604
Will lose your powers forever,

25
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:31,973
Instantly becoming
ordinary human beings,

26
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:36,311
Completely average and unremarkable
in every conceivable way.

27
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:37,378
Like your father.

28
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:41,449
- No offense.
- Too late.

29
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:47,255
So, in the event that you lose
the wizard competition,

30
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:52,260
I've been sent here to see to it that you
each establish an acceptable backup plan,

31
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:56,331
Or "plan b,"
one that is... Yes?

32
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:59,767
Does it hurt to always
be smiling like that?

33
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:04,072
Actually, it's more
of a numb feeling.

34
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:07,275
But back to my point.

35
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:13,247
Like all young wizards, you must choose
mortal jobs that will provide you... Yes?

36
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,850
Do bugs ever go in your mouth?

37
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:20,355
All the time.
Especially dragonflies.

38
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,391
But remember, I'm part gargoyle,
so they're delicious.

39
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,794
Are there any other questions?

40
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,898
That don't involve my face.

41
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:39,974
I don't see this going well.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Sync by fant0m

43
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:38,833
What are you doing
with my guitar?

44
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:41,936
Nothing.
You're using it in a band.

45
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,241
My band. Because my plan b is to
be a famous rock and roll drummer.

46
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:50,945
Drummer? You never
even play pattycake right.

47
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,748
You still don't get it.

48
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,250
I wanted to hit you in the face.

49
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:02,690
I'm busy with my own plan b.

50
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:06,360
I'm gonna make money touring the
world beating robots at chess.

51
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:13,367
Look, Justin, I didn't want
to have to say this,

52
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:16,104
But you're really good
at guitar.

53
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:20,441
Well...

54
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:26,214
I've always known I had
something special musically.

55
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,049
I've just been too
afraid to admit it.

56
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,386
You're not just
manipulating me, are you?

57
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:35,323
No. Great. So then
I guess we're in a band.

58
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:39,460
Band? With me...?
No.

59
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:42,330
All I need is me.
And my soulful lyrics.

60
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:45,933
And my bare feet in
a sandbox on the cd cover.

61
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:50,138
And a fishing net with, like,
shells and treasure in it.

62
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:53,474
Well, why don't
you use that net

63
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,844
To catch the one person
that'll buy your album.

64
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,412
Good one.

65
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,349
Hey, honey.

66
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:04,619
Um... Any luck
figuring out your plan b?

67
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:09,891
Well, I've decided to follow my
dream and be a professional drummer.

68
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:14,829
A drummer? This assignment is about
you finding something practical.

69
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:16,864
Stuffleby's gonna
be back here on Thursday.

70
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,901
And he may seem all smiles,
but he's not.

71
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,103
Dad, come on.
Didn't you ever have a dream?

72
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:23,838
Yes, a practical dream.

73
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:27,141
To own and operate my own
subway-themed sandwich shop.

74
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:30,344
And look at me now.
Living the dream.

75
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:36,017
- Hey, what's going on?
- Well, Alex has decided

76
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:39,921
- That her backup plan is to be a musician.
- Cool.

77
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:43,791
- I was just gonna work at the sub station.
- That's my boy.

78
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:47,695
But Alex's idea is way better.
I'll do that instead.

79
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,965
Wait. Who's gonna
run the sub station?

80
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:53,668
That's the only reason
we had you kids!

81
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,938
Not you.

82
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:12,687
<i>âª oh, I would
run a kilometer for you âª</i>

83
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:15,389
<i>âª and on my little
thermometer for you âª</i>

84
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:19,961
<i>âª I'm burning up âª</i>

85
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:21,862
In celsius.

86
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:24,599
<i>âª oh, metric system
metric system âª</i>

87
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:27,768
<i>âª if there are better systems I
must've missed 'em oh, metric system âª</i>

88
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,771
<i>âª metric system if there are better
systems I must've missed them âª</i>

89
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:35,576
Mom?
What are you doing?

90
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:39,447
I'm harmonizing with my eldest
son. Didn't that give you chills?

91
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:43,384
And the creep-outs.

92
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:47,188
Oh, my gosh. You know what?
We should form a band!

93
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:51,092
What do you say? We'll call
ourselves mother and son,

94
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:53,594
So we don't get confused
as brother and sister.

95
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,965
Oh... No.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,068
I... Can't.

97
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:02,370
Why not?

98
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:05,806
Because I'm
already in a band

99
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,408
And that wouldn't be right.

100
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:10,611
With who?

101
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,416
This drumming thing
is gonna be so easy.

102
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,253
- With Alex.
- Alex?

103
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:22,723
- Justin said you guys are in a band together.
- He did?

104
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:25,526
Yeah, and that's why he
can't be in a band with me.

105
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,896
Now, I'm caught up.

106
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:34,368
That's right, mom.
Justin is in a band with me.

107
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,637
Well, that's too bad 'cause...

108
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:40,041
<i>âª mother and son mother
and son we could've sung âª</i>

109
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,843
<i>âª last chance to be
in a band with me âª</i>

110
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:53,521
- Thanks. I owe you one.
- Oh, I know.

111
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:55,256
Welcome to the band.

112
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:00,661
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:04,231
Mom, I brought
you the newspaper.

114
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:08,602
Or... Possibly flowers.

115
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:15,276
Oh. Thanks, honey. These are nice, but I
kind of wanted the coupons from the paper.

116
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:22,450
- Max, what are you doing? - I'm practicing
to be a magician, same as you guys.

117
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:26,120
That's great, Max.

118
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:30,391
But we said "musician,"
not "magician."

119
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,369
Maybe dad's right.
Less talking more listening.

120
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:47,074
But it's just so hard to listen
with all this money in my ears.

121
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,224
Ok, since this
is our first band practice,

122
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:04,925
There are things
we gotta figure out.

123
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,661
Right. Band outfits.
Way ahead of you.

124
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:10,464
No.

125
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:14,535
I was thinking we'd do
sort of a punk-rock thing.

126
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,873
Oh! What about this?

127
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,778
Or maybe...

128
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,218
You didn't want to use
this one for the band, did you?

129
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:33,487
Nope.

130
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:38,192
Ok, we need to figure out
what we want to sound like.

131
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:42,196
For example, I like soft, meaningful guitar
plucking. And I like to play barefoot.

132
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,031
It shows how
I fight conventions.

133
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:47,334
Walk outside barefoot,
you'll be fighting infections.

134
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:52,706
Convections? Infections? It rhymes.
It's a lyric. Let's put it in a song!

135
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:58,078
Ok... Ah!
Follow my lead.

136
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:02,516
And a one, and a two, and...

137
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,618
Play on four.
Four and...

138
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:06,554
You don't...

139
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:13,093
- I wanna start with a solo.
- It's not backwards day.

140
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:17,965
- Why can't we in the beginning?
- What is going on up here?

141
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:21,769
Justin's in your band?
What'd you do, bribe him?

142
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:25,806
No. Of course not.
It was more like blackmail.

143
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:31,178
I knew it. I'm sure your brother had
something practical as his plan b.

144
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,849
That I did. I wanted to make
money beating robots at chess.

145
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:38,986
Is working at the
sub station that bad?

146
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:44,625
Daddy, being in a band
is a great plan b.

147
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,594
It's totally
gonna make us money.

148
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:51,131
All right. You think you can
make money, let's prove it.

149
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,767
You'll put on a concert
at the sub station,

150
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:58,005
And if you can bring in an audience, then
you can consider this band your plan b.

151
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,443
- What if we don't?
- Then you'll give up this ridiculous dream

152
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:05,279
Once and for all
and you'll work downstairs.

153
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:07,982
- Is it a deal?
- Sure, dad.

154
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:10,084
Here you go.

155
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:12,019
Come listen
to the loudest band in town.

156
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,388
I hear they got a great drummer.
She's cute, too.

157
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,790
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey.

158
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:18,959
Concert at waverly sub station.
Don't miss it.

159
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:22,696
You named the band burn
without even consulting me?

160
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,933
I do everything without consulting
you. Why should I start now?

161
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:30,037
Because maybe I had a different
idea for our band name.

162
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:32,740
Possibly with more of a
reference to medieval plant life.

163
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:35,709
Yes, because kids
love medieval plant life.

164
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,514
Look, I came up with the idea of
being a band, so I should name it.

165
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,318
Yeah, but I'm a better
musician. I'm all...

166
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:49,557
And the crowd's all... "Justin!
You're so good-looking!"

167
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:52,059
And you're all...

168
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,862
- The crowd's all, "when's the
guitar coming back?" - Justin!

169
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:59,500
You know what? I'm very
annoyed with you right now!

170
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:01,735
You know what?
I'm kicking you out of the band!

171
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:05,039
You can't kick me out of the band,
'cause I'm kicking you out of the band!

172
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:08,108
You can't kick me out of the band!
I already kicked you out of the band!

173
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,743
- Fine!
- Fine!

174
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:23,244
Hello, Alex. I just stopped by to
see how it's going with your plan b.

175
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,480
Well, it's not going so great.
I probably should've stuck

176
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:28,816
To the sub station as my plan b,
just like my dad did.

177
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,220
What? Your dad's plan b
wasn't to own the sub station.

178
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:35,890
It was to be
a professional bull rider.

179
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:39,827
- It was?
- He called himself "the italian buckaroo."

180
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:42,496
He had jean jackets
made up and everything.

181
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:46,634
- You're kidding.
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

182
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:49,170
Don't answer that.

183
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:52,873
- Wow, so he never went after his dream?
- No.

184
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:55,309
I think his dad
talked him out of it.

185
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:58,112
And then he ended up owning
a sandwich shop instead?

186
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:01,115
That's right.

187
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:15,930
Hey. Uh, you remember that
one time I apologized to you?

188
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,365
No. When was that?

189
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,869
Oh, my goodness. Can we please stop
talking about it? You get the point.

190
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:25,639
Are you trying to
apologize to me, Alex?

191
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:28,342
Yes. How many times do
I have to say, "I'm sorry"?

192
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:30,644
Actually, you
haven't said it.

193
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,848
I think we should get
the band back together.

194
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:36,617
Go on.

195
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:40,020
Because it's important for us to chase
our dreams while we're still young.

196
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:42,790
And I'm even willing to
compromise in order to do it.

197
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:46,227
So if you play
my kind of music...

198
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:48,496
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

199
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,867
...I'll let you
name... The band.

200
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,304
- I'll take that deal.
- Great. Ok.

201
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,174
Better get started. We've got
a lot to do before the concert.

202
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,476
- Perfect. I'll put in some earplugs.
- Again.

203
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:04,311
You are such a rock star.

204
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:25,966
The great Maxini thanks you!

205
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,840
Looks like you might
be working here after all.

206
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:37,811
Here you go, Max. I took the liberty
of having it personalized. Huh?

207
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:41,882
The great Maxini is offended
by your lack of support.

208
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:45,786
His next trick
will blow your minds.

209
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:49,056
After it pops into my mind.

210
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:54,662
I had some made for you
guys, too. Just in case. Huh?

211
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,864
Thanks for the support, dad.

212
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:58,799
You're on.

213
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:11,412
Hi.

214
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:15,683
Thanks for coming out.

215
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:18,852
- We're the alabaster carnation.
- Oh, my gosh.

216
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,056
One, two, three!

217
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:44,044

00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:18,605
- We did it!
- That was unbelievable!

241
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,910
Alabaster carnation!
Alabaster carnation!

242
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:26,480
Hi, I'm harvey buchwald. I'm
president of legitimate records.

243
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:29,083
I think you got a real
future as a girl drummer.

244
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:31,719
- Here's my card.
- Thank you.

245
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:35,522
Oh, my gosh! Your guitar playing
like totally spoke to us.

246
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:39,293
Well, as a musician, that's
all you can ever hope for.

247
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,328
- Who wants my sweat towel?
- I do!

248
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:44,298
Take it. Put your number
down on my hand.

249
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:47,801
Hold on... I'll get your...

250
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:51,271
- What a show!
- You liked it.

251
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:55,109
Of course I liked it!
I'm smiling, aren't I?

252
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:58,011
Usually music isn't the
best choice for a plan b,

253
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:02,516
But not for you two.
You can't miss! Can't miss!

254
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,819
Honey, I'm so
proud of you.

255
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:09,223
It was great. Ybe missing a
more mature female vocal element,

256
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:11,091
But still,
I really liked it.

257
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:15,229
Yeah, I should've had
more faith in your abilities.

258
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:19,600
You guys proved me wrong and you did it
the right way, without using any magic.

259
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:22,469
- You didn't use magic, did you?
- No.

260
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:25,305
Yes, it's true.

261
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,541
Justin and Alex
didn't use any magic.

262
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:32,212
But... The great Maxini did!

263
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:34,748
What?

264
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:40,320
- Max, what did you do?
- Dude!

265
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:43,824
The audience was
all an illusion.

266
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,860
The great Maxini thanks you!

267
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:51,799
Make yourself disappear.

268
00:18:57,138 --> 00:19:01,942
Hey, um, you remember that time
I said I was sorry? Right?

269
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:04,244
Yeah, you didn't.

270
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:10,551
- Your sister's been trying
that for years. - He's right.

271
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:15,255
Which is why, from now on, we're
videotaping all apologies in this family.

272
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:19,793
Jerry, can you stand
a little closer to Max?

273
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,999
Look, you guys
sounded great.

274
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:30,103
But because of you, Max, we won't know
if music is a viable career or not.

275
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:33,207
- Dad, it's ok.
- No, Justin. It's not.

276
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:37,744
I need to know that everything's
gonna be ok for my kids.

277
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,647
But that's just it, dad.

278
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,416
You can never be sure of that.

279
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,018
Sometimes dreams
don't work out.

280
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,221
But that doesn't
mean we shouldn't try.

281
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:52,226
I mean, you can understand that,
right, "italian buckaroo"?

282
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:58,232
Theresa, shut
the camera off.

283
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:02,569
Where did you
hear that name?

284
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:06,607
Mr. Stuffleby told me about your
dream of being a bull rider.

285
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:09,576
What a mouth on that guy.

286
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:14,014
Is that true, jerry?
"italian buckaroo"?

287
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:17,251
Yes, it's true.
I wanted to be a bull rider.

288
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:20,821
But your dad wanted you
to do something practical?

289
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:23,123
No. He was a rodeo clown.

290
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:26,393
He thought bull riders
were stuck-up.

291
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:31,098
Wait. Grandpa
was a rodeo clown?

292
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,233
That's my plan b.
I call it.

293
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:38,672
Look, I'm sorry if I was getting
in the way of your dreams.

294
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:42,376
Actually, dad,
it's kind of reassuring to know

295
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,413
That you didn't have a practical backup plan
and your life still turned out pretty good.

296
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:50,384
Yeah, my life
did turn out pretty good.

297
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:52,853
I'm really proud of you guys.

298
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:55,889
You did something
not even I had the guts to do.

299
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:59,359
It must feel good
to chase your dreams.

300
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:04,064
Well, maybe you should find that
out for yourself.

301
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:11,505
Next up, the italian buckaroo.

302
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,177
All right, for probably about
the next one to seven seconds,

303
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:19,246
You'll feel what it's
like to live your dream.

304
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,149
And my guess is it's gonna
feel a lot like chafing.

305
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,356
I'm... Living the dream!

306
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:38,065
- Mom, what's your dream?
- That this is over soon so we can go home.

307
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,936
Looks like we're done.

308
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:55,078
âª you won't know anything
unless you try âª

309
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:59,383
âª might end up falling
but you just might fly âª

310
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:03,620
âª you know it's all about
what you believe âª

311
