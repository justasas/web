1
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:15,738
Okay.

2
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:19,943
- Whole wheat, no crust, $5 in a bag.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:23,504
You might wanna put a jacket on
because it's very chilly outside.

4
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:26,831
<i>Fine.
Stop all the racket, I'll wear a jacket</i>

5
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:30,148
- Hey.
- Hey.

6
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:33,154
No, not, "Hey."

7
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:34,471
I meant, hey.

8
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:36,316
And when your mom said
to put on a jacket,

9
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:38,907
she meant go get one, not pop one on.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,837
What's the big deal? It's just a jacket.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,429
The big deal is today it's just a jacket.

12
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:46,999
How long is it gonna be before you're
popping a calculator into your math test?

13
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:49,957
First it's cheating on math,
then it's cheating on everything.

14
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,837
Then this happens, then that happens.

15
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:53,240
Then you're in jail.

16
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:59,002
This happens and that happens?
I just didn't wanna walk upstairs.

17
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:04,804
Well, walk upstairs, take that jacket off,
then come back down and put it back on.

18
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:07,330
Anything to keep me out of jail.

19
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:10,731
Hey, Maxy. What's in the box?

20
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,971
Oh, it's my Mars diorama for school.

21
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:16,805
Where's the Mars part?
It's just a bunch of beach sand.

22
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:20,408
Well, it's a pretty barren planet.

23
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,696
What's "barren" mean?

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,060
Sandy?

25
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:29,181
We'll discuss this later.

26
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:30,861
You need to work harder, young man.

27
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:33,782
Come on. Let's get your sandbox to school
before a cat finds it.

28
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:37,020
You see? Now I'm late.

29
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:39,217
- Can you at least write me a note?
- Sure.

30
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:40,382
Okay.

31
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:44,180
Dear principal, Alex is late
because her dad is a meanie

32
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:46,983
for not letting her use magic
to zap a jacket on.

33
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,859
Okay, I'll run to school.

34
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:54,990
Hey, there's T.J.

35
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,753
Hey?

36
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,316
Are you a...? Would...? You just...
Wha...? Feel... Wizard!

37
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:08,982
Excuse you.

38
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:11,580
Hey, guys, that kid's face reminded me.

39
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:12,778
Wanna get some pizza?

40
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:15,426
I'll show you a pizza.

41
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:17,145
What did you say, kid?

42
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:20,583
I said, I'll show you a pizza.

43
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:23,669
You're always doing that.
That doesn't even make sense.

44
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:26,309
I'll show you what doesn't make sense.

45
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:29,156
Dude, get a new insult book.

46
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:30,752
I'll show you a new...

47
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:01,730
Hey. Nice shirt.

48
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:04,051
- I'll show you a...
- Save it.

49
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:09,772
So your shirt appeared on your body
as if by magic.

50
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:12,771
Yeah, I change fast.

51
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:14,535
You know, I'm a quick-change artist.

52
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:17,126
I was thinking of doing it
for the talent show.

53
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,768
You're a wizard.

54
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:20,699
You mean with tools.

55
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,698
Like the ones I used
to build the clothes rack?

56
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,255
Yeah, I'm kind of a wizard.

57
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:29,139
No, a wizard as in potions
and brooms and spells.

58
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,100
Come on. A wizard?

59
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,182
Okay, I guess I was wrong.
See you around.

60
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,587
Sorry, I'm a klutz.

61
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:43,467
- I saw that.
- Okay, okay.

62
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:44,990
I'm a wizard.

63
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:46,591
Don't tell anybody.

64
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:49,432
It's okay. Because guess what?
I'm a wizard too.

65
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:51,112
You are?

66
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:53,430
- Prove it.
- Okay.

67
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:55,672
How many fingers am I holding
behind my back?

68
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,027
- How is this gonna prove anything?
- Just guess.

69
00:04:58,157 --> 00:05:01,070
- Four.
- None. It's my foot.

70
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:04,035
Oh, nice. The Feet for Hands spell.

71
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,959
I totally forgot about that one.
Show me how it works.

72
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:09,550
I can't. My parents are really strict
about magic.

73
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,719
I could get in so much trouble
for just doing that.

74
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,118
Oh, that's lame.

75
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:14,758
As long as nobody knows I'm a wizard,

76
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:17,446
my parents let me use magic
whenever I want.

77
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,127
You're so lucky.
I can't even magically switch my jackets

78
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:23,207
without my dad threatening
to send me to jail.

79
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,286
I don't know how you survive
in this world.

80
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,800
It's so hard being me.

81
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:36,685
- Are you hungry?
- Starved.

82
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:39,649
- I'll show you starved.
- Okay, dude, you've gotta stop doing that.

83
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,580
Mustard or ketchup?

84
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:51,419
The works.

85
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:06,859
- Aren't you gonna pay for those?
- Oh, right.

86
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,745
Wow, your life is so much easier
than mine.

87
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:17,502
I'd have to walk all the way over there,
ask the guy to make me a hot dog.

88
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,511
I would've been exhausted.

89
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:26,109
Hey.

90
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:29,711
- I said "hey."
- Will you get in here?

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,115
Okay. So I met an interesting guy
at school today.

92
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:37,154
For the last time,
I will make my own friends. Thank you.

93
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:40,713
You're making it so hard
to be excited about something.

94
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:42,358
This guy is a wizard like us.

95
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,477
Really? A kid from our school?

96
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,837
Oh, that is so cool. What's his name?
Does he seem nice?

97
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,036
We should have him over.

98
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,636
See, this is how you're gonna ruin it.
Just listen.

99
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:52,043
It's T.J. Taylor.

100
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,638
T.J. Taylor's a wizard?

101
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,208
Then that magic act he did
at the school talent show was fake.

102
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:02,168
I mean real.
Which is what made it fake.

103
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:05,249
He needs to return that first-place ribbon,
I'm making a call.

104
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,253
Wait, Ju... Justin.

105
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:08,730
Forget about the ribbon.

106
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:11,452
Do you know his parents
let him use magic whenever he wants?

107
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,217
Just think about how our lives would be.

108
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,650
I could read books in the dark.

109
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:19,613
Magic is a waste with you.

110
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:24,056
Besides using magic
for what electricity can do,

111
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:26,824
we need to get Dad to let us use
magic whenever we want.

112
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:28,625
Don't you already do that?

113
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:30,703
Yes, but I'm tired
of getting in trouble for it.

114
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,499
So I'm gonna tell Dad about T.J.

115
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,584
Maybe that will get him
to loosen up on the rules.

116
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,937
But I love the rules.

117
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:39,461
Remember that summer when he said
I could go to bed whenever I wanted?

118
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,388
I was a mess.

119
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:43,632
Well, rules bore me.

120
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:46,143
I'm gonna go talk to Dad
when he's his happiest.

121
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:49,187
After dinner and before pro wrestling,
when he's rubbing his belly. Yeah.

122
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,432
Magic whenever you want.

123
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:03,273
No.

124
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,597
But, Daddy,
T.J.'s parents let him use magic

125
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:08,680
all the time to do whatever.
It's not fair.

126
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,194
Well, T.J. Taylor's parents
aren't your parents.

127
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,362
My house, my rules.

128
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,523
Get your own house,
you can make your own rules.

129
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,607
Fine.

130
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:21,439
And that's not me giving you permission
to conjure up your own house.

131
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,523
Shoot.

132
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:31,286
Dad, do most Martians wear tin foil
or catcher's equipment?

133
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,732
And you want me to add
freewheeling magic to this chaos?

134
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:41,658
Hey, you guys. We're five minutes away
from pro wrestling.

135
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,089
Oh, gosh. I've turned into my mother.

136
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,576
Okay.

137
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,499
Honey, Alex ran
into another wizard at school

138
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,217
and now she's talking all kinds
of nonsense like,

139
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:55,020
"Oh, I wanna do magic
whenever I feel like."

140
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:57,702
I don't talk like that.

141
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:00,060
There's another wizard family?

142
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:03,101
Because, you know, I would love
to meet the parents and compare notes.

143
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:07,141
When you guys come over, I wanna make
sure your parents convince my parents

144
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:09,991
that everyday magic is okay
rather than the other way around.

145
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:11,990
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

146
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:14,389
Oh, you don't know our dad.
He'll throw a tantrum.

147
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,983
And you'll know
because it sounds like this:

148
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:19,549
Alex.

149
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,751
Who cares? All right, okay.

150
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:24,392
A couple of years ago,
I got into trouble for using magic.

151
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:26,555
My parents tried to send me off
to military school,

152
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,991
so I put a charm on them so no matter
what I do, they go along with it.

153
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:33,353
I mean, they're not even like parents,
they're more like my little robots.

154
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:36,320
You charmed your parents?

155
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:41,035
You're kind of scaring me a little,
but I'm feeling a lot of respect.

156
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,520
Okay, so it is set.

157
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:45,640
I will clear my parents' schedule,
and we can come over for dinner tonight.

158
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,043
Great.

159
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,762
There. They're free.

160
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,560
- You didn't even use a spell.
- Oh, right.

161
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,569
See, spells are like training wheels.

162
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,490
When you're really good,
you don't need them.

163
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:02,206
This is your Mars project?

164
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,485
Yep.

165
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:06,894
That's not a Martian.
That's you in a Martian mask.

166
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:09,249
How do you know that's me?
That could be a real Martian,

167
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,169
and I just happened to catch a photo of
him conducting Earth gravity experiments.

168
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:16,533
On a ride called Trip to Mars.

169
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:18,942
Yep.

170
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:23,295
Hey, look what I found
in a plastic bag upstairs.

171
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:24,461
My old bowling shirt.

172
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,421
I thought you threw this out.

173
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:29,540
Jerry, when you find something
in a bag with used floss

174
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:32,467
and empty shampoo bottles,
it was thrown out.

175
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,630
Honey, I want you
to put something nice on for the Taylors.

176
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:40,109
It doesn't matter what I wear to tell them
what they're doing wrong with their kid.

177
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:47,229
Oh, so the freewheeling magic
starts now.

178
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:51,749
- Look, they popped in.
- That's right. No one had to get the door.

179
00:10:51,878 --> 00:10:54,997
What's more courteous than magic?
Nothing.

180
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,794
I'm Theresa,
and this is my husband Jerry.

181
00:10:57,921 --> 00:11:00,356
- This is my wife, Lori.
- I brought you this noodle kugel.

182
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:01,518
Oh, thank you.

183
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:04,841
Two of my favourite things,
noodles and funny words.

184
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,003
Though I'm also a fan
of the chocolate-chip babka.

185
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:12,247
Hey.

186
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:14,485
T.J., Justin and I would love
to show you the lair.

187
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:15,644
- Okay.
- No, I wouldn't.

188
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,161
I'm staying here to watch your plan
blow up and pop. Metaphor.

189
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:21,609
Well, I'll be the one laughing
like a hyena.

190
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,724
- Simile.
- No. Animal joke.

191
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:30,850
Oh, no. It's kind of chilly down there
and you don't have a jacket.

192
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:34,448
If only you could zap yourself a jacket.

193
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,934
Don't be silly. He's a wizard.

194
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,176
And I don't want my little boy
to be cold.

195
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,656
I can take care of this, no problem.

196
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:48,182
Toasty. Wherever I go.

197
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:52,455
Oh, look, honey. There's a wood-burning
stove in the middle of our loft.

198
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,578
There's nothing strange about that.

199
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:59,378
Oh, look, it's moving.

200
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,431
Nothing strange.

201
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,628
Not too close to the shelves.
We need those books

202
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,028
so we don't look like
we watch too much TV.

203
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,990
- Here's our lair.
- I'll show you a lair.

204
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,793
You weren't kidding.
He really does do that.

205
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,192
My whole house is filled
with magic stuff.

206
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:30,872
I mean, there's this one room,
you open the door, it's a black hole.

207
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:33,439
I know. Cool, right?

208
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,598
Your life is so great.

209
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:37,478
I just hope your parents convince
my parents

210
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:40,566
- we can use magic with no rules.
- You don't have to worry about that.

211
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,287
Well, my dad can be pretty stubborn.

212
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,722
Not after he eats the kugel, he won't be.

213
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,684
Well, what does that have to do
with my dad?

214
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,807
Oh, the charm I put on my mom and dad,
it's in the kugel.

215
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,573
It's what gives it the cinnamony flavour.

216
00:12:57,696 --> 00:13:01,007
So wait. When our parents eat it,
they're gonna be under the spell too?

217
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:02,533
You're welcome.

218
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:07,579
This is great. The only thing
that could possibly make this better

219
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,259
is if Justin were here to hate it.

220
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:16,420
Don't you think it's a little irresponsible
to let T.J. Use magic whenever he wants?

221
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,545
Cinnamony.

222
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:24,465
Yes, it is completely irresponsible.

223
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:27,338
What? I thought it was okay
for him to use magic.

224
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:31,146
It is absolutely okay
for T.J. To use magic.

225
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:36,272
That is so right. You know,
I like your parenting style, Taylor.

226
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:37,463
What do you think, honey?

227
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:41,706
The only thing I like better
than freewheeling magic is this kugel.

228
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,190
What?

229
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:49,278
- Dad, you hate magic without rules.
- Relax. Have some kugel.

230
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,359
I'm allergic to cinnamon. That's why
I get my own pie at Thanksgiving.

231
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:55,552
Oh, yeah. The bland pie.

232
00:13:58,403 --> 00:14:00,281
Oh, so I see you enjoyed the kugel.

233
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:03,044
- Oh, kugel.
- Max.

234
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:05,646
Alex.

235
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:08,123
I don't believe it.
Your misguided plan actually worked.

236
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,321
The Taylors convinced mom and dad
to let us use magic whenever we want.

237
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:13,406
And now you can read in the dark
all you want.

238
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm happy about that,
but a little bit guilty.

239
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,851
And also suspicious,
and a little bit hungry.

240
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:28,773
Hey, Mom, I don't know what to wear.

241
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:31,207
Oh, well. What are you thinking?

242
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,571
Well, I'm thinking instead of trying
a bunch of stuff on and showing you,

243
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,974
it'd just be easier to do this.

244
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:42,492
- Is that okay?
- If it's okay with you, it's okay with me.

245
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:44,463
Just making sure.

246
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,704
- Thank you, kugel.
- I love that kugel.

247
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:50,819
Okay.

248
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:53,746
So I like the shoes on this one,
but the shirt's too light,

249
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:55,780
and the hat's cute on this one.

250
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,468
- Well, I think...
- Oh, that's the one.

251
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,709
- Thank you, Mom.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

252
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,268
A catwalk.

253
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:17,114
Oh, this is awkward.

254
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,836
Oh, shoot. I'm hungry.
I forgot to eat breakfast.

00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:28,677
<i>Comemakeus Pancakeus</i>

256
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:38,124
I made it. I missed the subway.

257
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:41,322
Well, why didn't you use magic
to transport yourself here?

258
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,681
Have you used any magic
since the rules were lifted?

259
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:47,647
- Yes.
- Besides reading in the dark?

260
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,812
Then, no.

261
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:52,530
I haven't had time.
I overslept so I was late.

262
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:54,328
That's the perfect time to use it.

263
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:55,936
You're afraid, aren't you?

264
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:59,368
- No.
- Prove it. Use magic right now.

265
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:06,655
That's not magic.

266
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:08,899
How do you know
I didn't forget my locker combination

267
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:10,615
and then use magic to remember it?

268
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:12,621
Because you made up
a locker combination song.

269
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:14,383
<i>Right to clear it
Come on, let's hear it</i>

<i>Six, and you're off to class</i>

273
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:26,460
Miss Weston didn't like my
Aliens on a Rollercoaster project.

274
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:28,947
She is so obsessed
with this Mars thing.

275
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,748
Well, if she loves Mars so much,
why doesn't she marry it?

276
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,152
Perfect. Justin.

277
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:40,633
I'm gonna show you how to enjoy
using magic in a way you'll understand.

278
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:42,635
You're gonna help Max
with his Mars project.

279
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:43,874
<i>- Transportium...
- Oh, no.</i>

280
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,796

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,478
Mars.

283
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:55,643
It's all sand.

284
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,325
My shoebox looked just like this.

285
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,245
This is dangerous, Alex.

286
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,402
We shouldn't be here.

287
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,119
Hey, get a picture of me by this rock.

288
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,763
Would you stop it?
There are no Martians.

289
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,641
Cool. Hey, look, the Mars Rover.

290
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,000
No, not cool. Don't break it.

291
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:11,530
This doesn't look right.

292
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,969
It's back online.

293
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:25,367
These rocks will be great for my report.

294
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:26,931
No, no. Max, come on. We're going.

295
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:29,129
You can't upset
the natural order of things.

296
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:30,579
What are you talking about?

297
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,900
If we can't take rocks from Yosemite, I'm
pretty sure we can't take them from Mars.

298
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,817
What is your problem?

299
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:39,014
I can hardly believe
Mom and Dad would be okay with this.

300
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:41,864
Of course they're okay with it.
Just like T.J.'s parents are.

301
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:44,064
That's what charming
your parents means.

302
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:46,582
Mom and Dad are charmed?

303
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:49,460
What? How? When? Who?

304
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:51,307
- Mom and Dad.
- What? How? When?

305
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:52,943
- At dinner.
- What? How?

306
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,301
- It was in the kugel. I think you know what.
- What?

307
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:58,905
- We have to fix this.
- It's already fixed.

308
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,468
- We can use magic whenever.
- That's what I'm trying to fix.

309
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,233
That's not fixing anything.

No, you don't understand.
I left Max on Mars.

00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:32,148
I should be in big trouble right now,

00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:34,790
What's to fix? Max will be fine.

Just use the spell you used
to go to Mars to get him back.

338
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:40,592
You mean you don't even care
that we left our brother on Mars?

339
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:43,359
We're just happy
you're all having fun with magic.

340
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,755
It's not about that.

341
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:48,319
It's about you not caring and I'm disrupting
a million-dollar space programme.

342
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:49,842
- Billion dollar.
- Billion dollar?

343
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:51,477
Billion-dollar space programme.

344
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:52,879
And I'm scared.

345
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,474
- Scared's good.
- No, it's not. It's dangerous.

346
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:58,280
- Dangerous is good.
- No, it's not. That's why we have rules.

347
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,638
So we don't do anything
that's scary or dangerous.

348
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,566
Are you saying that you want rules?

349
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:05,079
Yes, I want rules. More importantly,
I want my parents back.

350
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,769
Snap out of it. You're under a spell.

351
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:10,932
Oh, isn't that nice.
She put a spell on us.

352
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:15,809
Okay, you take the rover back to Mars
and get Max.

353
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:18,370
I'm gonna figure out
how to reverse the spell on Mom and Dad.

354
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:20,727
To the thinking chamber.

355
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,255
You mean your bedroom?

356
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:27,136
- Do you want me to help you or not?
- Sorry. To your thinking chamber.

357
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,580
Whatever you did. Okay, go.

358
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,616
<i>Transportium nextorbitorium</i>

359
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,182
You guys like the brownies?

360
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,335
Delicious. Is there any more kugel left?

361
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:39,785
No.

362
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,227
Oh, it's good to be home.

363
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:46,466
You were there a long time.
You probably have to go to the bathroom.

364
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,182
No.

365
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,381
Did that in Yosemite too.

366
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,585
Brownies? This is what your thinking
chamber came up with?

367
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,708
It turns out the cocoa powder
in the brownies reverses the spell.

368
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:03,397
That's ridiculous.

369
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,916
Why is there red dust
all over my living room?

370
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,191
It's... There... Mars. Who...? Alex.

371
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,797
Maybe it's not that ridiculous.

372
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,992
Not to mention she left me on Mars.

373
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:18,317
He's right. It's all my fault.

374
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,595
You are in so much trouble, young lady.

375
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,441
I know.

376
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:31,765
Here you go.

377
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,122
Alex and Justin were happy
to make you these brownies.

378
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:38,404
T.J. Says eating brownies
is against the law.

379
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:44,409
That law was overturned yesterday.

380
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,813
It was in the...
I mean, don't you read the papers?

381
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:49,451
Yeah.

382
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,050
Delightful.

383
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,857
Delicious.

384
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:01,497
Where is T. J?

385
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:06,062
He's busy riding up the side of the Empire
State Building on a skateboard.

386
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:12,667
I made it. I made it all the way to the...

387
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,388
Brownies.

388
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,624
You're in trouble, young man.

389
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,384
I'll show you trouble.

390
00:22:25,154 --> 00:22:27,385
That was never funny.
