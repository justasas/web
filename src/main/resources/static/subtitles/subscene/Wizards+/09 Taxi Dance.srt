1
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,537
I can't believe we're
going out to dinner,

2
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:10,269
And it's not a birthday,
anniversary

3
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,062
Or city-wide black-out!

4
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:15,116
This is going to be great!

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,473
Yeah, you know where I hear
a great place to eat is?

6
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:20,904
The waverly sub station!

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:26,901
I know the owner and he
might give us a discount.

8
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:30,768
Yeah, I know the owner,
too, and he won't.

9
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,632
alex, shh!

10
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,398
The owner is right there.

11
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,698
Fine, we'll go out.

12
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:42,965
That's great, honey.

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,866
I'll call the sunshine cab company.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,234
Why do we always call them?

15
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:50,737
Max, the sunshine cab company
is special to our family.

16
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:54,971
They own the cab that
alex was born in...

17
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:56,506
...After your cheap father

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,339
Tried to get me to
walk to the hospital.

19
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,807
I offered to push you
in a shopping cart.

20
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:05,876
see? I was more exciting than you

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,410
From the minute I was born.

22
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,912
Some people don't want exciting.

23
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:14,813
They want smart,
reliable and cpr certified.

24
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:17,781
I remember when you were born,
too, justin.

25
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:19,815
It was mid-city hospital,

26
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,283
Room...

27
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:26,384
You don't remember the
room I was born in?

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,520
He was really nervous.

29
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,786
Remember? You'd just bought
that lottery ticket...

30
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:36,956
Right, the numbers
were 33-24-44-55-8-9.

31
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:42,292
You remember the
lottery ticket numbers

32
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:44,560
But not the room
that I was born in?

33
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:51,163
Bad news. Alex's cab
isn't available.

34
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,464
It's retired.

35
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:54,031
It's headed for the junkyard.

36
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,766
All right!

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,634
I outlived a cab. Yeah!

38
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,671
Which is very, very sad.

39
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:08,439
* well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

40
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:10,373
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

41
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,542
* you could fix any problem
with the slightest ease *

42
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:14,410
* yes, please *

43
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,244
* well you might find out
it'll go to your head *

44
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:17,978
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

45
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:20,546
* with the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

46
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,080
* that's what I said *

47
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:25,148
* everything is not what it seems *

48
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:28,918
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

49
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:32,721
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

50
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:36,590
* because everything
is not what it seems *

51
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:40,494
* everything is not what it seems *

52
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:44,530
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

53
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,100
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

54
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,537
* because everything is not *

55
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,206
* what it seems *

56
00:02:55,207 --> 00:03:00,807

57
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:05,413
Your mom's really
upset about cab 804.

58
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,881
Well, you look upset, too, dad.

59
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,749
Me? I'm not upset.

60
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:11,050
I'm a man.

61
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,085
Men don't get upset
about silly things

62
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,220
Like the very cab
where their baby girl

63
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:18,722
Was born is headed
for the junkyard...

64
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,192
Will you please excuse me.

65
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:28,596
It is pretty terrible
losing pieces of your past.

66
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,764
I've never thrown out
anything I've ever worn.

67
00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:33,866
I incorporate the clothes into
outfits I wear as I get older.

68
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:39,137
Here's a dress that has a
jumper from my toddler years.

69
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:43,572
Try and guess where
I've incorporated it.

70
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:50,276
Well, that's a tough one.

71
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,812
I'm gonna have to go with...

72
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:55,348
Oh, please don't make
me play this game.

73
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:57,116
Look, harper,

74
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,650
Everyone's upset,

75
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:00,419
So maybe we should go down there

76
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,954
And get, like, a souvenir from
cab 804 for my mom and dad.

77
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,857
If you can get the
vinyl upholstery,

78
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,325
I can make them vests.

79
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:07,793
Vinyl vests?

80
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,963
I don't know, my dad sweats
a lot in the vest area.

81
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:23,645
Hey! Lookihere, it's alex russo!

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,547
The cab 804 baby!

83
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,820
The baby I always talk about?

84
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,254
These chowderheads.

85
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,290
Hard being the smartest
guy in the room.

86
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,525
I know how that song goes, buddy.

87
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,395
Harper, this is my uncle al.

88
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,063
Not my real uncle.

89
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,999
Nice outfit.
Does your mom dress you?

90
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,702
That'll change when you move out.

91
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:49,337
look at you.

92
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,706
These cheeks are as
chubby as the day

93
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,441
You were born in the
backseat of the cab.

94
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:57,477
Harper and I came down because
we heard about cab 804

95
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,612
And we were wondering
if we could get

96
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,414
Some sort of souvenir from it?

97
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:03,282
My mom and dad were
upset the other night

98
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,718
When they heard about
804 being junked.

99
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,587
That might be the most
touching thing I've ever heard.

100
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,288
I was being sincere.
Get the kid a keepsake.

101
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:16,394
Good.

102
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,830
Go!

103
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:21,999
There.

104
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,335
Now you'll always have
a piece of cab 804.

105
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,307
And I'll always smell
like canadian rockies.

106
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:34,346
sorry, that's all that's
gonna be left of cab 804.

107
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:38,784
Uncle al, would it be ok

108
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:41,053
If, um, maybe harper and
I had a moment alone

109
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:42,855
To say goodbye to cab 804?

110
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,758
Yeah. Give us a chance
to go out in the alley

111
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:50,029
And not cry out there.

112
00:05:50,064 --> 00:05:51,898
Remember, boys,

113
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:55,435
If it doesn't spill over the eyelid,
it's not tears.

114
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,638
Wow, there's a lot
of crying going on.

115
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:00,974
Add some door slams
and it's my house.

116
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:04,211
Harper, I know you hate
it when I get an idea,

117
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:05,279
But I've got an idea.

118
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,115
Oh, I hate it when you get an idea.

119
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:10,452
This cab means way too much
to my mom, dad, uncle al

120
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:13,355
And all those guys to let it get junked.
I have to do something.

121
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,825
Here's something. We could leave
before your idea gets us into trouble.

122
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,328
I'm going to use magic to fix it.

123
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:21,063
Now go get that toolbox over there.

124
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:24,766
Oh, you're gonna use
magic on the tools.

125
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,836
No, I'm gonna use magic on the cab.

126
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,639
We'll put the tools near the cab
so people think we worked on it.

127
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,407
But if we do that,
isn't that cheating?

128
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,577
Harper, magic is cheating.

129
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:38,380
I can't bear to part with
this cab that won't drive.

130
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:40,615
Do whatever needs doing
to bring it alive.

131
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:56,691
Hey, what's going on with 804?

132
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:58,459
I fixed it.

133
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:00,694
How is it possible
that a 15-year-old girl

134
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,028
Could fix this hunk of junk?

135
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:04,631
Hey, look at those tools!

136
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:06,032
And they're near the cab.

137
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,136
Hey, she's right.

138
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,639
Those tools are near the cab.

139
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:15,174
Of course she fixed it. Aw!

140
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:31,960
ok, as you guys know,

141
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,528
I went down to mid-city hospital

142
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,329
To see exactly what
room I was born in...

143
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:37,397
And I got a free gurney!

144
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:42,737
Ok, which story do you
want to hear first?

145
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:45,740
The story of me researching
which room I was born in,

146
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:48,810
Or max's story about his
free hospital gurney?

147
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,645
Let's hear the gurney story first,

148
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:53,012
Since it's the one we probably
have to get involved in.

149
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:55,445
What?!

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,715
Mom, dad, here's the story.

151
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:02,585
They were giving this
away and I took it.

152
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:06,855
pretty amazing story, huh?

153
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,191
When you say they
were giving it away,

154
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:11,859
Was this gurney parked
next to an ambulance?

155
00:08:11,894 --> 00:08:14,761
Yes! - Uh,
were the lights flashing?

156
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,795
Yes! That's what made me notice it!

157
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:21,364
Max, just because something's
sitting out on the sidewalk

158
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,334
And nobody's next to it doesn't
mean it's free for you to take.

159
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:26,369
I wish you would've remembered that

160
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,770
When you brought home that
stinky chair from the alley.

161
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,874
Well, you shouldn't have thrown
it away in the first place.

162
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:38,746
Uh, guys, sounds like an "after
we go to bed" conversation.

163
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:42,050
On to my story.

164
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:43,851
As you guys know, I went d.

165
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:45,454
Good news.

166
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:47,622
Alex, I'm talking.

167
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,658
I'm happy to announce
mid-city hospital,

168
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:52,160
Where I was born, has been
turned into a shopping center

169
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,529
That includes one of
my favorite stores,

170
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:57,599
The science fun toy activity store.

171
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,367
Yes!

172
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:02,170
Try and top that!

173
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,773
Cab 804 is fixed.

174
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:06,808
Yes!

175
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:11,913
She topped it.

176
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:22,689
you know what, harper?

177
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:24,757
It's one of those great days.

178
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:28,160
It feels so good to do
something nice for somebody.

179
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:29,595
Then why'd you yell at that guy

180
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:31,364
Playing guitar in front
of the restaurant?

181
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,266
Singing about losing his girl?

182
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,768
Waa-waa. You're playing guitar
in front of a restaurant.

183
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,837
No wonder she's gone.

184
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:42,441
Guys, check it out.

185
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,843
I told the people at the
science fun toy activity store

186
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,945
That I was born in it,
they hooked me up.

187
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,713
They got me these
night-vision goggles

188
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,348
And this flashlight that can work

189
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:54,218
In temperatures up to
300 degrees fahrenheit.

190
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:59,856
So you need a
flashlight on the sun?

191
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,059
The surface temperature of the sun

192
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:05,861
Is 9,944.33 degrees.

193
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:09,831
If you want it to hurt,
you gotta be accurate.

194
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,436
tech-noggin, does that
baby have a camera in it?

195
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:16,338
How 'bout you get a shot
of me and the ladies?

196
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:19,007
Did you just say something?

197
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,445
No. Alex, did you
just say something?

198
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,680
No, I was hoping you did.

199
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,982
what's with the confusion,
tweeners?

200
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,650
It was me, cab 804.

201
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:33,921
You used magic to
bring the cab to life.

202
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:36,190
Alex, I'm new to magic,

203
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:38,226
With a tng c I'm not
sure if I should scream

204
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,327
Or just run away.

205
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:40,461
So, I'm going to faint.

206
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:43,097
Catch me, justin.

207
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:50,031
Oh!

208
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:53,667
What was so confusing about,
"catch me, justin?"

209
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:57,203
Sorry. I'm a little distracted
by the magic talking cab.

210
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:59,372
Hey, I got distracted
by commander gadget

211
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:01,508
Letting the cute girl take
a header into the cement.

212
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:05,178
Oh, thank you.

213
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:08,047
Relax, justin. It's no big deal.

214
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:11,150
A lot of times these things
happen to me when I use magic.

215
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,619
We're just not going to
tell anybody about it.

216
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:15,754
See, harper. This is how it works.

217
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:18,223
Alex messes something up and
then I gotta fix it for her.

218
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:20,324
You're not gonna have to
come and fix it for me

219
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,626
Because I have
everything under control.

220
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:25,996
hey, new york, alex russo
brought me back to life!

221
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:29,767
Let's celebrate! Garcon,
round of wiper fluid for everyone!

222
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,403
Go ahead, ask for help.

223
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:36,140
Car alarm. Just the car alarm.

224
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,442
- Don't need it.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:41,346
Alex russo, from being
born in my back seat

226
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,949
15 years ago to
saving my life today,

227
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:46,752
We're more than friends.
We're family!

228
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:49,554
I already have all
the family I need.

229
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,622
In fact, I think one
member too many.

230
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:53,458
You know who we're talking about.

231
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:55,293
I like the cut of your jib.

232
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:58,296
Good luck hiding your
giant magic talking cab.

233
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,233
And I know who
you're talking about.

234
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,969
And max is going to be very
disappointed when I tell him.

235
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,305
alex, you saved my life.

236
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,175
I feel like I got that
new car smell again.

237
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,642
I want to pay you back.

238
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:13,577
How 'bout I give you a
ride to school tomorrow?

239
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:15,546
I won't put my meter on. Free ride.

240
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,847
You can't turn that down.

241
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:21,217
This cab knows me.
I can't turn that down.

242
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:27,490
See, riding in the cab was awesome.

243
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:29,258
And we're even not that late.

244
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:32,528
We missed two periods.

245
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:35,630
Uh, ok, fine. You're late.

246
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:37,898
This is when I usually get here.

247
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,368
Oh, well.

248
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,538
Hey, alex. Say, harper.

249
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,473
I was thinking you saved my life

250
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:52,576
And it meant so much more to me
than just a free ride to school.

251
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:55,678
Do you like tacos?

252
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:57,480
Stand next to it.
Maybe it will blend in.

253
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:06,421
Wow. Magic talking
cab in tribeca prep.

254
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:08,756
Yep, you've got it
all under control.

255
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:11,926
We can't possibly explain what
this magic cab's doing here.

256
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
What's your plan?

257
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,595
I'm thinking of one.

258
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,931
I've got one. I'll see ya in p.E.

259
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,370
Hello, everyone.

260
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,071
I know what you're thinking.

261
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:31,008
That is one honking big art
project I brought into school.

262
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,476
I'm not an art project.

263
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,811
I'm a talking magic cab.

264
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,745
Or an art project.

265
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,647
I'll stop talking.

266
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:45,018
I've never heard of alex
russo turning in a project.

267
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:48,321
Hmm... I wonder where all the
other cab art projects are,

268
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:51,690
From the cab art class.

269
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
hate you.

270
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:59,764
the words I'm looking
for are "help me."

271
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:02,834
Ok, fine. Help me.

272
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:04,501
All right.

273
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:08,237
A lot of you know my sister as a snarky,
apathetic slacker...

274
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:13,409
But the truth is, this cab,
along with other cars

275
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:15,611
We hope you'll encourage
your parents to donate,

276
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,847
Will be used to create an
artificial reef habitat

277
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:21,382
In the hudson river
for homeless otters.

278
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,350
very nice.

279
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:25,352
Thank you.

280
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:28,889
Thank you. I don't
know what happened.

281
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:30,523
The cab won't leave me alone.

282
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:32,625
When you bring an
inanimate object to life

283
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:34,324
It develops an attachment to you.

284
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,592
Wow. Where did you
learn all that from?

285
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,794
From the magical place of
listening to dad when he teaches.

286
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:42,430
I used to talk like
that like three years a

287
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,500
But I don't anymore.

288
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,833
Gosh! You've got me doing it again!

289
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,913
man, you drive like
I've got four flats.

290
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:01,482
Shh! You'll wake up
the dispatch guy.

291
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,895
Look, the car is back and
the dispatch guy is asleep.

292
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,897
- The problem is over.
- no, it's not.

293
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:18,200
I'm the dream you'll
never wake up from.

294
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:21,003
I've known you since
the day you were born.

295
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,606
Let's chain him up.

296
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,808
I hope you're talking
about snow chains.

297
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:28,978
I have a better idea.
Why don't we just take out his key?

298
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,414
No, no, no! Not the key.

299
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:34,685
Don't take out the key.

300
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,286
Wait a minute,

301
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,221
I used a spell to
bring the cab to life,

302
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,091
But you take out the ke?

303
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:43,159
Yup. Movin' on...

304
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,270
What's wrong, max?

305
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,104
You've hardly touched your dinner.

306
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,339
I miss my gurney.

307
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,511
Well, you did the right
thing by returning it.

308
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,513
And we did the right thing
by telling you to return it.

309
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,183
And here it is...

310
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:15,219
...By itself...

311
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:18,321
...With no one pushing it.

312
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,726
It came back?

313
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,894
How?

314
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:28,096
Well, I...

315
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,164
I didn't feel like
pushing it all the way.

316
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,134
So, I did some magic on
it and brought it to life,

317
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:34,935
So it could push itself.

318
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:39,439
don't you know when you
bring an inanimate object

319
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:42,743
To life it develops
an attachment to you?

320
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,049
you are incredible.

321
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:56,656
Max russo, we are very
disappointed in you.

322
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,025
Your sister is right.

323
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,094
Which is weird.

324
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:04,998
Jerry, this isn't about how
right or weird alex is.

325
00:17:05,032 --> 00:17:08,034
This is about max and
his now magical gurney.

326
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,504
And how he's going to finish
his dinner in his room.

327
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,785
Well, I'll see you in p.E.

328
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,559
Wow. That car horn sounds like

329
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,495
It's coming from
outside the terrace.

330
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:36,929
- Oh...
- Have you heard about

331
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:39,165
The tribeca prep homeless
otter reef project?

332
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:41,935
alex! You may have taken my keys,

333
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:47,808
That's a guy from school.
His name's burt.

334
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,910
He likes me but I don't
think he's getting the hint

335
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,346
That I'm not interested!

336
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,184
Alex, I see what's going on here.

337
00:17:57,218 --> 00:17:59,619
You're bringing your
problems home to discuss

338
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:01,287
Instead of scheming about them.

339
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,592
Oh, well, that's
very mature of you.

340
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,460
No wonder this boy
likes you so much.

341
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,795
But you should give
him back those keys.

342
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,131
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

343
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:17,136
She is growing up to be
a very fine young woman.

344
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:20,640
She is unbelievable.

345
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,845
Harper, you're acting like
you're looking at a ufo.

346
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:28,880
It's just a flying cab. Relax.

347
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:31,349
hey, alex.
Are those copper gutters?

348
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:32,818
I'm up here.

349
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,954
Yeah, I know where you are.
You've got to come down

350
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,722
Before people start to notice.

351
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:39,659
I know. We'll tell everybody
it's a parade balloon.

352
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:41,927
Where's the rope?

353
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,229
Uh... Right here.

354
00:18:43,396 --> 00:18:46,065
Yeah, it's like very thin,
super strong.

355
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,001
It's the latest thing in parade
balloon rope technologies.

356
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,536
It's good. Check it out.

357
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,838
alex, you've got to listen to me.

358
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:54,672
I want to protect you from trouble.

359
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,108
No. You've got to listen to me.

360
00:18:57,142 --> 00:18:59,576
You've got to stop talking.
You've got to stop flying.

361
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:01,312
And thenou've got to get over me.

362
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:03,780
Wait, hold thi

363
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:10,754
Rope from greenwald's, help me now.

364
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:14,590
Climb up there a tie a bough...
Bow... Bough.

365
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:17,126
Oh, you know what I mean.
Rope, do your thing.

366
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,734
alex!

367
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:28,203
I'll go see where she went.

368
00:19:30,206 --> 00:19:32,407
oh, would you...

369
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,875
Thank you.

370
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:39,513
Would you... Thank you.

371
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:48,122
oh! There you are.

372
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:50,491
I was worried you might
be having boy trouble.

373
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:55,730
Uh, nope. All done.
And speaking of boys,

374
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:57,799
Did you know they're
making parade balloons

375
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:02,571
More real these days? Try and
remember that if that comes up, ever.

376
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:05,040
So, uh, how's it going with burt?

377
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:07,042
No, no. It's none of my business.

378
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:10,646
No. Yes, it is my business.

379
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,748
Uh, eat. Everything's
under control.

380
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:25,728
thank goodness my lamp's ok.

381
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,969
Oh, my goodness!

382
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:37,305
A realistic parade
balloon broke free!

383
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:41,410
I will not be ignored, alex russo!

384
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,178
Well, not when you do that.

385
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:46,114
There's a...

386
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,584
Max... Gurney... Alex... Cab!

387
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:53,055
You know how sometimes
you use magic,

388
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,124
When you're not supposed to,
but for something good,

389
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:56,358
And it makes people happy?

390
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,928
Do I look happy?

391
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:01,430
Does anyone look happy?

392
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:04,133
It's not alex's fault.
It's my fault.

393
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,602
I only wanted to protect alex,

394
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:08,837
To thank her for
bringing me back to life.

395
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:13,442
You brought cab 804 to life?

396
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:15,277
For good reason.

397
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:17,079
You, dad, and eryone were so upset

398
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:19,181
That cab 8 was going to be retired.

399
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,917
Uh, I go by burt.

400
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:24,687
I just wanted it to be ok,
and for it not to beone.

401
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:27,890
honey,

402
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:32,328
Just because something is
gone and we're sad about it,

403
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:35,131
Doesn't mean you should try
do anything to bri it back.

404
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:39,602
I mean, missing something is part
of what makes it a great memory.

405
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:43,005
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,874
I'm sorry for charming the cab

407
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:48,978
And having him crash
into our living room.

408
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:50,946
I'm rey for my punishment, daddy.

409
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,314
Come he.

410
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:57,052
Is that a punishment?

411
00:21:57,086 --> 00:22:00,889
No, it's an alex-ment.

412
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:04,293
Something that should be a
punishment but is a reward.

413
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,695
You get those sometimes, right?

414
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:11,567
No. No, I don't.

415
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:12,568
