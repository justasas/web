1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:05,606
(serious music)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,269
- Sticks and stones may break my bones

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,519
but this story may break your heart.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,510
Good evening and welcome to a very special

5
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:18,847
edition of No Nonsense.

6
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:22,179
This past month has been
dominated by a single story,

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,222
the fate of one little boy, Baby Bones.

8
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:28,477
The product of a dark wizard's curse,

9
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:31,809
Baby Bones was rejected
by his biological parents

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,222
simply because he was born without skin.

11
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:37,721
On tonight's episode we
take an exclusive look

12
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:41,236
at the life of Baby Bones
and his adoptive parents.

13
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:45,612
A Channel Bueno exclusive,
let's take a look.

14
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,733
- Me and Harry had been trying for a baby

15
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:50,643
ever since the wedding,

16
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:52,776
but it just wasn't happening.

17
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:54,219
Adoption seemed like the only way

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,007
for us to have a real family.

19
00:00:56,008 --> 00:01:00,456
And the orphanage just broke our hearts.

20
00:01:00,457 --> 00:01:02,247
So many beautiful children who needed

21
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:05,354
the loving care of parents.

22
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,595
But there was one child who needed love

23
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:09,480
more than any other.

24
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:13,076
That child was Baby Bones.

25
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:15,412
- Yep.

26
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:17,708
- [Deborah] It's been a
little over two months

27
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:19,731
since the couple adopted
the innocent child,

28
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:22,494
unaware of the celebrity
status the media had

29
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:24,790
cruelly forced upon him.

30
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,030
- We would like to go up.

31
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:26,924
- Hopefully.

32
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:29,422
- Baby Bones get down from there.

33
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,945
(screeching)

34
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:40,543
That's our Baby Bones.

35
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:48,446
(phone ringing)

36
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,958
- Hello this is the
mobile telephone of Jack.

37
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,092
May I ask to whom that I speak?

38
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,916
- Hey Jack, I'm at the studio already.

39
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,334
Where are you?

40
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,015
- I'm sitting in my motorized vehicle

41
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:03,006
in a seemingly endless queue of other

42
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,485
motorized vehicles, and it is boring

43
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:08,065
and it feels natural
and it just feels right.

44
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:11,601
- Okay yeah, they have run
the Baby Bones retrospective.

45
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:12,799
- Oh fuck.

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,323
- Oh fuck is right Jack.

47
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,030
Look, wizards aren't in the
public's good graces right now

48
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:17,452
and if you don't get to
this interview on time,

49
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,626
Quinn is gonna tear you a new one.

50
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,068
Are you sure you can't
get here any faster?

51
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,059
They've got fish and chips.

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,051
- I don't know what to do.

53
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:25,305
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.

54
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:28,007
Fuck okay, so Baby Bones has
reared his ugly head again.

55
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:32,997
Did the show make us look that bad?

56
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:37,304
- Of course his life
would be easier with skin.

57
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:40,473
Of course I wish those damned
awful wizards hadn't cursed

58
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:45,113
an innocent child to live without skin.

59
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:49,474
But he's my Baby Bones.

60
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,546
I wouldn't change him for the world.

61
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,603
Excuse me.

62
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:55,508
Baby Bones stop eating
the cat this instant!

63
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:00,005
(screeching)

64
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,538
- Look um, I'm not gonna lie.

65
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:14,464
Hilde was more on the
Baby Bones bandwagon,

66
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:15,987
the triple B.

67
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:19,299
However, I love my wife.

68
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,241
And now I love my son.

69
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:28,242
My son who is a Baby Bones.

70
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:36,670
Nutritionists weren't quite
sure what would sustain

71
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:40,124
Baby Bones, but after some
research into the occult,

72
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,481
Hilde and I discovered that
he really likes something

73
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:46,118
we like to call four blood salad.

74
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,698
Basically you take the
blood from an animal,

75
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,075
put that in a bowl, and
you take the blood from

76
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:53,046
another animal, put that in a bowl.

77
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:56,865
Followed by two more types of blood.

78
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,673
A little pinch of nutmeg, give it a stir,

79
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:03,093
and you've got yourself a salad.

80
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:06,689
It's actually a recipe from
Curtis Stone's new book.

81
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,490
It's a weird shift from
his previous books.

82
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,802
- Aww, my two boys.

83
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:20,401
(screeching and squealing)

84
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:24,193
- I was hoping they had
forgotten about Baby Bones.

85
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:25,798
I mean well that's it. I'm fucked.

86
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,399
I'm completely, utterly,
shittingly fucked.

87
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,228
- Just get here ASAP Jack.

88
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,812
- I'm stuck in fucking traffic.

89
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,967
- Technically you're not in
traffic, you are traffic.

90
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:41,440
What possessed you?

91
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:44,520
- What possessed you to
turn that baby into a bones?

92
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,718
I mean of all your plans to fuck me,

93
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:46,937
that one's fucking me rotten.

94
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,034
It's fucking me frontways.

95
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,274
It's fucking me sideways.

96
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:50,716
Thanks to you I'm pretty much a big soggy

97
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:52,159
fuckbag of cum.

98
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,703
- Well you're very welcome, Jack.

99
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:55,206
I don't do that for everyone.

100
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:56,954
- And now on the one nationwide interview

101
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:58,945
that I've booked, my one
chance to redeem myself,

102
00:04:58,946 --> 00:05:01,687
I'm gonna miss it 'cause
I'm stuck in traffic.

103
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:04,755
- Aw yeah I heard there was
a big accident up there.

104
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:06,381
It's caused all this traffic.

105
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:08,534
Also I saw it.

106
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,405
Also I did it.

107
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,138
(laughing)

108
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,845
Why don't you just teleport there?

109
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:18,690
I mean use a bit of, you
know, as the French say

110
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,417
they'd just say magic wouldn't they?

111
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:25,251
I mean they're French.

112
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,022
They're people.

113
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:27,708
They're fucked but they're people.

114
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,045
- Or I could just sit down

115
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:33,377
like a civilized person and wait.

116
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:35,612
- Because you're an idiot.

117
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,989
And just to show you how idiot you are,

118
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,777
I'm gonna skip across the globe.

119
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,934
Excuse me.

120
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,152
I'm back.

121
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:48,310
Gee whiz I had a lot of fun.

122
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,134
Glad I'm not stuck in
traffic like a bloody drongo.

123
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:56,084
Oh and by the way, the rain in
Spain falls mainly on nothin'

124
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,746
'cause I evaporated Spain.

125
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:01,021
It's gone. Cha cha.

126
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,728
No jamon for you.

127
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,475
That's Spanish ham.

128
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,472
Fuckin' buy it in a Safeway.

129
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,010
Buy a whole leg into your cart now.

130
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:11,073
- We love you Baby Bones!

131
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:14,644
- He may not have skin, but certainly

132
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,107
he has fans.

133
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:17,651
- I love his bones.

134
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:21,145
- If I have a baby, I'm gonna
rip off all his skin too.

135
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:24,254
- Appeared on tee shirts,
mugs, his hip-hop single,

136
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,206
or the wildly successful
line of children's toys.

137
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:31,754
♫ Baby Bones Baby Bones Schmampftz ♫

138
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,825
- Baby Bones merchandise
is a must-have accessory

139
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,109
for kids this summer.

140
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,385
- I like Baby Bones because
he doesn't listen to teachers.

141
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:39,685
(screaming)

142
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:43,207
- I love those bones!

143
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,342
- Baby Bones has become a media darling.

144
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:49,308
Mr. and Mrs. Pottinger
have faced harsh scrutiny,

145
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,803
forcing their child to undergo
a life-threatening procedure

146
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,911
to have its bones surgically removed.

147
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:58,731
Needless to say, Baby Skin has failed

148
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:03,732
to capture the imagination
of the Australian public.

149
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:06,898
But is it all too much?

150
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,149
Child Psychologist and mother
of four, Miranda Merhtens

151
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,501
believes Baby Bones should
be Baby Left Alones.

152
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,594
- I just don't think it's healthy

153
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:18,947
that the youth of our
country is so obsessed

154
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:23,816
with what is objectively
a spooky, scary skeleton.

155
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,888
- And do you have any words tonight

156
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,243
for all those fans watching you?

157
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,319
(screeching)

158
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,789
- All your skins shall cast asunder

159
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,790
and all that will remain will be bones!

160
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:49,234
(laughing)

161
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,933
- What a darling little trooper.

162
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:02,219
- He may not look like a normal baby.

163
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,059
But he's an extraordinary Baby Bones.

164
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,742
- [Deborah] And what do you
think of the media's obsession

165
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:12,987
with your Baby Bones?

166
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:16,603
- I consider it an invasion
of my family's privacy.

167
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:19,915
I beg of everyone please,
stop making my family

168
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,019
into a media circus.

169
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,150
(disturbing rasping and whispering)

170
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,628
- Well we thank you for letting
our crew into your home.

171
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:30,807
- Oh you're welcome.

172
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:33,224
It's been my pleasure.

173
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:38,067
(horns honking)

174
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:43,158
- Whew these Cubans are delicious.

175
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,866
Cigar's not bad either.

176
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:46,898
Yak yak yak yak yak yak yak.

177
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,925
Seriously bud, I ate
a lot of Cuban people.

178
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:51,570
And most of them were delicious,

179
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:52,586
except Diego.

180
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:53,643
- Shut up!

181
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:56,040
I'm trying to listen to this
interview that I am missing.

182
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,377
- [Voiceover] Talk about
Jack the Ripper, Ripoff.

183
00:08:58,378 --> 00:08:59,840
Jack the Ripoff.

184
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:00,957
This is typical.

185
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,623
This is the mark of a coward.

186
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:03,653
They're good aren't they.

187
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,457
You create a level playing field.

188
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,378
And he hasn't got the guts to turn up.

189
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:10,511
Why? What's he hiding?

190
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:12,949
It's disrespectful to
your wonderful listeners

191
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,127
whom I adore.

192
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:16,606
It is rude, crude, it's kangarooed.

193
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:19,836
It's absolutely fair
dinkum, unfair dinkum.

194
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:21,970
He's a dirty, rotten coward.

195
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,880
This is appalling, Paul Hogan.

196
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:28,881
(screech snoring)

197
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:36,154
- And now for some unfortunate news.

198
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,124
Since we recorded that
episode, there have been

199
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,547
some alarming developments

200
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:41,680
in the Baby Bones saga.

201
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,524
Two days ago, Baby Bones's adoptive father

202
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:47,186
Harry Swinton disappeared.

203
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,652
While no full body has been
recovered, his undamaged skin

204
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:54,959
has been found in the crawlspace
beneath the family home.

205
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,368
The whereabouts of Baby Bones
is currently Baby Unknowns.

206
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:02,618
However the police have
released this security footage

207
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,036
taken from a mechanic's mere blocks

208
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,166
from the Swinton residence.

209
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,908
(creepy music)

210
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,190
Baby Bones is considered
at large and dangerous.

211
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,096
Here at Channel Bueno, we
strongly urge all our viewers

212
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:28,229
to keep children and pigs inside,

213
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,642
doors and windows firmly
fastened, and please

214
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:33,819
lock up your bones.

215
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,379
(reporters shouting at man on television)

216
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,573
- I have no official comment tonight.

217
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:41,347
But I will say this, this latest business,

218
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:44,091
the quadruple B, the
bigger Baby Bones business,

219
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,492
this is disgusting.

220
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:46,833
It sticks in my craw.

221
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,601
They've gone too far this time.

222
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:50,327
They went too far the other times as well.

223
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,339
But this time they've gone even further.

224
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,964
It's time for us to do
a little bit of magic

225
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:56,098
and make the bastards disappear

226
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,495
next Saturday at the ballot box.

227
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,150
We've had enough!

228
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,055
- I'm totally boned.

229
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,067
(screeching)

230
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:13,031
(gentle music)
