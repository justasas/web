1
00:00:02,943 --> 00:00:04,744
Keep your arm steady.

2
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:06,988
Aim and follow through.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,915
Oh, my goodness! I got 100 points!

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,437
Nice going, Russo.
Try it on your own this time.

5
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:19,271
On my own? Oh...

6
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:23,276
No. Now I'm torn between admitting
I've gotten pretty good at skeeball

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,446
and wanting you to keep doing that cuddly,
guiding my arm thing you were doing.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,990
- Let's get something to eat.
- OK.

9
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,584
<i>Welcome to Betty's and Fleming's.</i>

10
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,364
<i>Please tap in your order.</i>

11
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:46,011
I'll order for you. It's romantic.

12
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:49,626
Barbecue bacon cheese
burger with curly fries...

13
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,800
...in the bun.

14
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,638
And a double chocolate shake,

15
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:54,684
with whipped cream on the bottom.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,536
You know me.

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,014
Doesn't it freak you out how
perfect we are together?

18
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:04,654
Nah, I don't think about it.

19
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:09,037
'Cause then I'd be thinking
instead of enjoying it.

20
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:12,651
Dean, you just made sense.

21
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:14,863
This is the best date ever.

22
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:16,301
Do that thing I think is cool.

23
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:20,346
Again. I love that!

24
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,752
Oh!

25
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:25,062
Finger snapping,
bacon burgers, milkshakes...

26
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:27,701
It's like I'm a princess.

27
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:34,387
Ah!

28
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:38,298
What a nice dream.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,583
Oh, man. I'm late for school.

30
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:48,791
Try again tomorrow.

31
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,809
See you in your dreams
tomorrow night, Dean.

32
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:57,045
Oh, Gosh!

33
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,781
Harper, what are you doing here?

34
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:00,686
Waiting for you to stop
using the dream helmet.

35
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:02,624
Hurry up. We're gonna
be late for school.

36
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:05,164
We can't sneak in because I'm
wearing my squeaky shoes.

37
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:11,378
Harper, I just had another
perfect date with Dean.

38
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:14,018
He took me to that touch-screen
place and ordered for me...

39
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,421
Dean moved away months ago.

40
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:17,826
You've got to stop using magic
to date him in his dreams.

41
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:20,332
- It's just wrong.
- Look...

42
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,336
I go into his dreams and
I control everything,

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,273
so it's exactly the way I want.

44
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,644
Since Dean moved away,
our relationship has never been better.

45
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,815
Do you ever listen to yourself?

46
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:32,524
Or is there some invisible shield
that blocks the words from your ears?

47
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:35,196
You're just mad because I went to
Betty's and Fleming's without you.

48
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:42,210
No, I'm not. Touch screen ordering?

49
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:44,748
It's dehumanizing when a
robot gets your order wrong.

50
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:49,324
And, if we don't watch out, robots are
going to unite and take over everything.

51
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:52,631
How do you know I'm not one...
I'm not one...

52
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:53,901
- I'm not one...
- It's happening!

53
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:58,410
<i>* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

54
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,447
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

55
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,317
<i>* You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease *</i>

56
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,154
<i>* Yes, please *</i>

57
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,991
<i>* But you might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

58
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:07,995
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

59
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,499
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

60
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,036
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

61
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:15,209
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

62
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:19,050
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

63
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:22,855
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

64
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,862
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

65
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:30,433
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

66
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:34,540
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

67
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:38,247
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

68
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:42,421
<i>* Because everything is not *</i>

69
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,692
<i>* What it seems *</i>

70
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,093
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

71
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:47,965
Tears of Blood totally rocked.

72
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:51,002
I'm not just saying that because I'm a
vampire and love anything to do with blood.

73
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:52,372
I had so much fun with you,

74
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,042
I completely ignored my
self-prescribed bedtime.

75
00:03:57,247 --> 00:04:00,650
I'm gonna get, like,
37 minutes less sleep than usual.

76
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:02,785
But totally worth it.

77
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,452
Oh, hey, Justin!

78
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:07,287
So, my family and I are
going away on vacation.

79
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:09,756
And I don't want to be away
from you for that long.

80
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,325
So, I was wondering if you want
to come with us to the lake?

81
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,462
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
That would be great.

82
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,163
I'm gonna ask my parents.

83
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:19,532
I mean, they can't still
treat me like I'm a kid.

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,801
They can't say I'm not ready to go
away with my girlfriend and her family.

85
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:26,372
Sounds like fun.
Juliet's a sweet girl.

86
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,408
Stop yelling at me! I get it.

87
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:32,176
You don't want me to go.

88
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,547
Justin, I'm giving you my permission to
go away with your vampire girlfriend.

89
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:42,819
As long as you're hanging
upside down in separate rooms.

90
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:47,089
Great. But, we should
probably ask Mom, huh?

91
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:48,757
She might think that Juliet and I

92
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:50,359
are getting too serious too fast.

93
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:52,327
Which we're not.

94
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:58,832
Even though a lot of people and
parenting books might say that we are.

95
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:03,202
Justin, you've got to stop
buying me those parenting books.

96
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,636
I'm not gonna read them.

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,007
Dean's here?

98
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,275
Alex, are we in one of
your dream dates right now?

99
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,443
Dean?

100
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:19,112
No, it really is Dean. He is here.

101
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:21,680
It's really me, Russo. Finkle.

102
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:25,216
Moriarty. It's been long enough.

103
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:28,285
I believe a friendly
hug is in order.

104
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:32,823
Alright, I'm not ready.

105
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:37,293
Ah! Same old Finkle.

106
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:39,795
What are you doing here?

107
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:41,997
Well, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

108
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,966
And you've been in
a lot of my dreams.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,100
- Wha...
- Oh.

110
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:49,204
So I took my vacation days
from school a little early.

111
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:52,573
You don't get to choose your
vacation days from school.

112
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,608
This is why I don't hug you.

113
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:59,479
Dean hug her.

114
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,949
Justin, hey!

115
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:07,117
Did you talk to your dad?
Can you go?

116
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:08,351
Uh, yeah, I talked to him.

117
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:11,220
And he said... no.

118
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:13,154
I... I can't go.

119
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,491
- Really?
- Yeah.

120
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:22,029
Wait! It's not because
I'm a vampire is it?

121
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:25,365
No! They're totally over that.

122
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,702
You're like the most normal
magical girl I've ever dated.

123
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:33,171
Yeah. Alex told me
about the werewolf.

124
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,110
Um, my dad...

125
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:42,511
He reads all these
parenting books and,

126
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:45,113
apparently, they say
it's not a good idea.

127
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,749
I got mad at him though, so mad.

128
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,217
And he got this serious look
on his face and he was like:

129
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:53,953
"No way, Justin.
And don't bring it up again."

130
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:55,454
So if you see him...

131
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:58,589
...wouldn't bring
it up if I were you.

132
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:03,226
- Well, did he say why?
- Yeah, yeah.

133
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:07,096
Something about us getting
too serious too fast.

134
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:10,298
I mean, we are getting
pretty serious.

135
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:12,966
I'm fine with it.

136
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,401
But you know parents.

137
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:18,638
They get all serious
about getting serious.

138
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,375
Well, I'll really miss you.

139
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:25,876
Me too.

140
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:28,746
I should get back to work.

141
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,015
OK. Um...

142
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:38,821
The usual, please.

143
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,527
Mustard? Again?

144
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:47,396
What's going on with you?
You know the usual has ketchup.

145
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:49,498
Right.

146
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:52,501
Don't call the cops. I'll fix it.

147
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,209
We need to figure out
what's happening between us.

148
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:04,479
I think I figured out
what's happening.

149
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:05,780
You're holding up the line.

150
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:07,748
Next!

151
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:15,888
Yes! I nailed it.

152
00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:19,558
OK, you have enough tickets
to buy a pencil sharpener now.

153
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:21,192
Can I go?

154
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,560
Come on, Russo. You know
you're no good at skeeball.

155
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:24,627
Right. Yes.

156
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:27,931
But maybe you could show me

157
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,235
by guiding my arm in a
cuddly way, like this.

158
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,904
Yeah, right.

159
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:39,742
Oh, sweet! I beat my own record.

160
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,279
Let's eat.

161
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:56,254
<i>Welcome to Betty's and Fleming's.</i>

162
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:59,056
<i>Please tap in your order.</i>

163
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,824
Oh. Are you ordering for me?

164
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,527
<i>No. I'm playing Bonko.

165
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:06,030
Shoot. I bonked out.

166
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,165
I'm going again. You got any
money left on your game card?

167
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,134
Uh, Dean...

168
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:13,302
You're not really
paying attention to me.

169
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:17,507
What are you talking about?
I'm here, aren't I?

170
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,544
Yes, but we haven't seen
each other in months,

171
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:24,380
<i>and you're more interested in
this stupid Bonko game.</i>

172
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:26,381
OK, fine.

173
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,816
Why don't you order your food?

174
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,152
You want me to order myself?
You don't want to order for me?

175
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:33,854
No, actually, you order for me.

176
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:36,824
I'm gonna go get that pencil
sharpener from the prize tent.

177
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:39,693
Dean, this is a date.
We're staying together.

178
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,567
Barbecue bacon cheese burger,
with curly fries inside the bun.

179
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:53,570
A double chocolate shake,
with whipped cream on the bottom.

180
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:57,440
You've got to stop
eating like that.

181
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,775
A giant of hunk of meat
will just wreck your heart.

182
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:03,912
Yeah, that's not the only thing
that's wrecking my heart.

183
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:06,982
Bonko!

184
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:15,116
- Well, you were right.
- I knew it.

185
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,485
I'm in your dream. Can I fly?

186
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,921
- When do I get wavy?
- Harper! This isn't a dream.

187
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:23,588
You were right about me and Dean.

188
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,858
We've grown apart and I've been fooling
myself by going into his dreams.

189
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:30,360
You only made it worse,
because you created Dream Dean

190
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,728
and you now expect Real
Dean to be someone he's not.

191
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:35,563
I said you were right.
See, a lot of times you are right,

192
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:38,198
and this is exactly
why I don't tell you.

193
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,133
So what are you going to do?

194
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:43,035
I'm gonna do what I should've
done in the first place.

195
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,669
I'm gonna break up with him.

196
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:48,472
- Breaking up is always hard.
- How do you know?

197
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,407
You're making it hard
to be supportive.

198
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:54,209
But, Harper, you're right.

199
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:56,578
It is going to be hard.

200
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:59,280
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

201
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:02,348
This would be so much easier
if he just broke up with me.

202
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:06,452
Hey, that's a good idea!
Get him to break up with you.

203
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:08,987
I could do that.

204
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,856
But it'll be a challenge
because you're awesome.

205
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,124
I like you.

206
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,427
- Oh, that's such a relief.
- Really?

207
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:18,796
I get a little insecure from
time to time, but I'm back.

208
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:26,337
- Mr. Russo. Is Justin around?
- I haven't seen him.

209
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:28,205
He must be packing
for his big trip.

210
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,306
Why would he be packing?
He can't go.

211
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,907
He can't go?

212
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,041
He'll be so disappointed.
He was really excited.

213
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:35,842
Yeah, yeah. I know.
So why can't he go?

214
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:37,910
I don't know, you haven't told me.

215
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:40,947
So you didn't say, "no"?

216
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:44,449
No. I mean, yes, I didn't say no.

217
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:47,385
- Are we clear here?
- I think so.

218
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:50,020
Good. Because I'm not.

219
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:53,323
You said "yes" and he said "no."

220
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:54,924
Oh!

221
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:01,230
- Justin.
- Hey.

222
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,098
Why did you say you couldn't
go on vacation when you could?

223
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,834
Because... I...

224
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:07,769
I didn't think this
moment would happen.

225
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:09,203
Because if I did...

226
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:11,305
...probably wouldn't have done it.

227
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:15,375
If you didn't want to go with
me you should've just said so.

228
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,009
Look, Juliet, I'm...

229
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:22,481
I'm...

230
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:25,249
I'm... sorry. I wasn't thinking.

231
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:30,253
It is probably because of the
37 minutes of sleep I lost.

232
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:34,423
I am no good with less
than eight hours of sleep.

233
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:38,727
Yeah. Well, it looks like you're no good
with more than eight hours sleep either.

234
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:48,269
Hey, Max. Maybe you can
help me with something.

235
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,938
How do you get your brother to
say what's really on his mind?

236
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:54,207
- Oh, I use randomness.
- What?

237
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:56,643
Well, I just say random
things and while people are

238
00:12:56,677 --> 00:13:00,579
trying to figure it out,
they say stuff that's on their mind.

239
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,115
Have you ever noticed that
pineapples never wear bathrobes?

240
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,284
Why... Why would you even say that?

241
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,319
We were talking about how Justin
doesn't want to go on vacation with me,

242
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:10,887
and how I'm really upset by that,

243
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:12,856
because I think I might
be in love with him.

244
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,993
Hey. That random
thing really works.

245
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:20,462
What? What random thing?

246
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:23,032
I haven't even done it yet.

247
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:34,674
OK, how about this idea?

248
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:39,077
Dean will totally break up with you if
you wear something totally repulsive.

249
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,414
I could use a spell
to make me a slob.

250
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,983
I mean, nobody wants
to date someone gross.

251
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:48,819
OK.

252
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:50,687
What I need now is the
opposite of clean.

253
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,988
Make me a girl without hygiene.

254
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:58,392
Whoa!

255
00:13:58,426 --> 00:13:59,793
You're hideous.

256
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:03,996
Awesome. It worked.

257
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,533
OK.

258
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:12,403
Normally I'd stick around and check out
whatever flies out of that nest on your
head...

259
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:15,039
...but you reek.
Keep your arms down, please.

260
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:17,641
Hey, Harper. What's up?

261
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:19,342
Your chances of getting a rash.

262
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:23,179
- Whoa!
- Hi, baby.

263
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:26,382
Oh, wait. Let me fix myself.

264
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,784
Hi, baby.

265
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,853
Oh, man.

266
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,188
I'm gonna try and say
this as nice as I can...

267
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:37,458
...but you look like something I
snaked out of my shower drain.

268
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:41,194
Well. I held myself
together for our date,

269
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,695
but this is really the way I am.

270
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,198
- It's pretty disgusting, huh?
- Oh! Yeah. You are.

271
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:47,833
Makes you not want to be around me.

272
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,701
I totally understand.

273
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,805
No, I get it.
This is because of me.

274
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,740
Well, yeah.

275
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:57,442
Since I left, you've been
overwhelmed with sadness...

276
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:59,878
...and you just let yourself go.

277
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:02,080
I've seen people like
you on talk shows.

278
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:04,148
Don't worry, I'm gonna
help you get back on track.

279
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:07,084
- Where's the floss?
- What? No. Dean. No.

280
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:10,120
- That's not what I want.
- Ooh! Of course not.

281
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:13,690
And you probably don't want a warm
wash cloth behind the ears either.

282
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:15,257
Now, where's your wash cloth?

283
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:20,427
I thought you'd see me like
this and want to break up.

284
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,263
You want to break up?

285
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:26,464
Well, now that you bring it up...

286
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,334
Since it's your idea and all I
think that maybe, maybe we...

287
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:31,135
We should.

288
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,942
OK. Then let's break up.

289
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:40,480
Really? Oh? Well...

290
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,048
...that was easy.

291
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,785
That was really easy.

292
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,621
That was really, really easy.

293
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:52,423
No big deal. See ya.

294
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,527
What was that?

295
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:03,898
Hey, Dad.

296
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,567
You must have noticed how down
I was and wanted to come talk.

297
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,436
No. We need the table.

298
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:16,377
OK. We can talk.

299
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:19,579
I lied to Juliet and
now she's mad at me.

300
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,780
About that. Why didn't you
want to go on the vacation?

301
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,582
- You really like Juliet.
- I know.

302
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:28,251
It's just, I've never been
in a relationship this long.

303
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,320
And going on vacation with
a girl and her family...

304
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:33,022
It's... I mean, it's serious and...

305
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:35,691
It just feels like
it's happening fast.

306
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:37,760
So you're afraid.

307
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:42,163
Why? I mean, it's not like they were going
to have you sleep in a guest coffin.

308
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:43,865
I think they were.

309
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,468
Look, Justin, I...

310
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:50,570
Going away with a girl's
family is a big step.

311
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,705
And I said "yes" because
I think you're ready.

312
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,974
Having your first
serious girlfriend

313
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:57,776
is all part of growing up.

314
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,478
You read those parenting books.

315
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,981
It was on the back.

316
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,551
I really messed up.

317
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:11,087
Messing up is also
part of growing up.

318
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,755
I'm still growing up.

319
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:14,056
Just ask your mother.

320
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,527
So what do I do now?

321
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,662
Tell her you want to go
on the vacation with her.

322
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:23,363
I can't. They already left.

323
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:26,132
Here.

324
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:30,536
I feel bad enough without
you throwing things at me.

325
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:35,274
These are the keys
to the flying carpet.

326
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:37,142
Why don't you see if you
can't catch up with her.

327
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:38,209
Thanks, Dad.

328
00:17:40,712 --> 00:17:42,746
And then I said I
wanted to break up.

329
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:44,982
He agreed,
and then just walked out.

330
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,817
- I mean, what was that?
- I don't get it.

331
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:49,418
You wanted to break up and you did.

332
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,019
Mission accomplished, right?

333
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:55,223
Yeah, sure, I got what I wanted.

334
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:58,159
I don't know. I guess I just
thought he'd fight for me.

335
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,595
Well, it was a pretty
convincing spell.

336
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,830
And you know Dean,
he doesn't talk a lot,

337
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:05,032
say what he's thinking,
or share much.

338
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,633
What'd you see in him?

339
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:10,836
Well, Dream Dean was good
at expressing himself.

340
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,905
Well, he wasn't real,
and you were controlling it.

341
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,974
I know.

342
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,210
And it was wrong.

343
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:22,379
You know I'm against this,

344
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:24,447
but you could go back into
Dean's dream one more time

345
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:26,549
and get the break up
you really wanted.

346
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:30,953
- You're awesome.
- I like you.

347
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:32,187
Oh, that's a relief.

348
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:34,189
- Really?
- No. I always knew.

349
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:49,935
- Hey, Russo.
- Hi, Dean. Listen...

350
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:53,138
Most of the time I come into your
dreams and I control everything.

351
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:56,240
But not this time. It's your dream.

352
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,442
You can say and do
whatever you want.

353
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:00,244
I can?

354
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:03,213
Cool.

355
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:12,153
- Abraham Lincoln?
- Yeah.

356
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:15,589
Well, it's my dream, and in my dreams, I
like to have the 16th president as my wing
man.

357
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,124
So what's up, Russo?

358
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,994
Oh, I wanted to talk to
you about our break up.

359
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,932
- I don't know.
- Go ahead, Dean.

360
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,934
Tell her how you really feel.
It's best to be honest.

361
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,337
After all, that is my nickname.

362
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:36,439
What does Mister One Six
have to do with honesty?

363
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,543
I'll let you wear my stovepipe hat.

364
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:42,145
OK.

365
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,881
Here it is.

366
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:50,116
I couldn't be real with you
when we broke up because...

367
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,018
...it was just too painful.

368
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,288
- It was?
- Yeah, it was.

369
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:58,723
I've never known anyone like you.

370
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:02,392
And the only way for me to get through it
was to tell you that it was no big deal.

371
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:06,262
You'll always be my
first love, Alex.

372
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:08,431
That's one thing that
will never change.

373
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,766
Same here.

374
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,538
Goodbye, Dean.

375
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,518
All right!

376
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,057
Well, alright...
Let's play some skeeball.

377
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,030
Juliet, wait up!

378
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:49,998
Justin!

379
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:52,667
My dad loaned me his flying carpet.

380
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:55,002
I am so glad you came.

381
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,303
Hey, um...

382
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,939
I have to talk to
you about something.

383
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,840
Remember when you
said you loved me?

384
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:05,043
Yeah. That was embarrassing.

385
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:07,746
No, no. It wasn't.

386
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,247
Because...

387
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:10,448
...I love you, too.

388
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:14,151
What? I can't hear you? Fly closer.

389
00:21:16,553 --> 00:21:18,521
I said,

390
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:20,189
I love you, too.

391
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,560
I love you, too, too.

392
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:27,696
- Hey!
- whoa!

393
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,000
Why does your carpet
make so much noise?

394
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:35,769
Um, yeah, it...

395
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:39,072
It needs a tune up.
It might break down.

396
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:41,607
Don't worry. If you fall,
I'll catch you.

397
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,195
I know that we've had our problems,

398
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,498
but I really want to work it out.

399
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,134
Do you want to...

400
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,170
...pass out fliers?

401
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:05,471
If that's what it takes.

402
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:08,307
All right.

403
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:10,476
One usual coming up.

404
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:16,447
Nice gesture wearing
that hot dog suit for me.

405
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,016
What?

406
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,852
Oh, this? Oh, no! It's not for you.

407
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,287
It's for something I'm doing later.

408
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:30,288
