1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,570
Okay, everybody, gather round.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,740
Time for the semiannual
new-sandwich-idea meeting.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,310
Okay. Max, go.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,780
The Crust Lover's Special.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,080
lt's a sandwich
made out of only bread crusts.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,920
What do you do with the middles?

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,750
lt would be nice if you pitched ideas
rather than problems once in a while.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,190
Okay.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,170
- Alex, go.
- Okay. Meat Me in Little ltaly.

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,700
Double the meat on a small ltalian roll.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,070
And you could also say
Meat Me in Turkey.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,650
And l think you know
where l'm going with this.

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,450
l have created sandwich-naming dice.

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,490
One has the name
of New York City locations,

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,120
the other, various sandwich meats.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,420
Watch.

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,800
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,530
That's the beauty
of the sandwich-naming dice.

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,160
lf you don't like it, you just roll again.

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,500
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,640
Here, l'll...

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,510
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,550
Hey, somebody fixed these dice.

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,350
Why are you looking at me?

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,720
Yeah, you should look at me.

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,830
Wait a minute. l've got an idea.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,730
What if we take double the meat
and put it in a small ltalian roll--

28
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,560
And we can call it
Meat Me in Little ltaly.

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,040
What?

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,370
Don't you get it, honey? lt's a pun.

31
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,880
lt's not a pun. lt's stolen.

32
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,340
You heard me, right, Justin?

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,710
l didn't hear a thing.

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,680
Well, Alex, if you say you said it,
you probably did.

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,790
The most important thing is,
if one of us has a great idea,

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,250
we all have a great idea.

37
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,420
Oh, honey,
l just came up with another one.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,620
Meat Me in Turkey.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,320
Alex, you can take credit for that one.

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,800
See? Now everybody's happy.

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,180
Question.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,190
lf you're faced with a situation
and time is running out, what do you do?

43
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,790
Let one rip
and blame whoever else is in the room.

44
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,860
Okay.

45
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,460
We're talking about magic.

46
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,800
More specifically,
the freeze-frame spell.

47
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,770
You can freeze people around you
without freezing yourself.

48
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,740
lt was developed by Dr. J. Geils.

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,000
Justin, why don't you give it a try?

50
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,110
All you have to do is say:

51
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,580
And time will be frozen.

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,740
- For how long?
- For as long as you can hop on one leg.

53
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,050
Wait, wait. Why one leg?

54
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,880
Because Dr. J. Geils
only had one leg.

55
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,130
Charley horse. Charley horse.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,900
Going down.

57
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,020
Hey, l like this spell.

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,490
All right.
One Meat Me in Little ltaly combo,

59
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,960
or, as l prefer to call it,

60
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,730
My Mom and Dad
Never Give Me Enough Credit

61
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,170
For All the Hard Work l Do sandwich.

62
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,570
Oh, a sandwich with a side of attitude.

63
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,230
Tasty.

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,810
- What are those?
- Oh, my gosh, you're relentless.

65
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,540
lf you must know,
l work for a fashion magazine.

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
Well, not a good one.

67
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,150
All these outfits are trying
way too hard to be different.

68
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,660
Well, you're unusually opinionated.

69
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,320
No, it's pretty usual for me.

70
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,690
l'll tell you what l like.

71
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,630
This with this and that with that.

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,180
l like your panache, kid.

73
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,540
Oh, we don't have panache.

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,050
But we do have quiche.
lt's kind of like a pie.

75
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,820
Would you be interested
in an internship this summer

76
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,750
with Fashion Fatale Magazine?

77
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,330
Fashion Fatale?

78
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,860
l read those for free at the newsstand
until the guy chases me away.

79
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,300
Just give me one second.
Let me ask my parents.

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,270
Mom, Dad,
some dude from Fashion Fatale Magazine

81
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,930
just offered me an internship,
and l'm gonna take it. Okay.

82
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,940
They said yes.

83
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,050
Before we get started,

84
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,490
l'd like to introduce you to our new intern,
Alex Russo.

85
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,390
Air kisses.

86
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,200
Okay. That was really weird.

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Kiss back.

88
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,230
- Really?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,310
Hi, l'm Alex. What's your name?

90
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,780
Paul.

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,820
Oh, that's a cool name.
How do you spell it?

92
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,480
P-A-U-L.

93
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,330
lsn't that just Paul?

94
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,260
lt's Paul.

95
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,230
Okay, people.

96
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,060
l'd like those ideas
for the fall-fling issue.

97
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,600
l want different.

98
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,260
What different ideas do you have?

99
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,900
Eve, you're up.
You panicked. We're done with you.

100
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,840
Jack, you're up.

101
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,780
Wearable yogurt.

102
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,810
You have got to stop pitching that.

103
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,850
l have an idea.

104
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,790
No, you don't.
lnterns don't pitch ideas, they get coffee.

105
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,450
Sure, Alex, what you got?

106
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,390
Well, something different would be

107
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,830
finding a way
to make summer colors work in the fall.

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,460
Love it.

109
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,570
Pushing the envelope
without bursting the envelope.

110
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,730
Okay, l need research on it,

111
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,840
l need editorial on it,
l need photography on it.

112
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,780
And, Paul, l need some coffee.

113
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,780
Eight sugars. Dash of cream.

114
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,610
And l'll have a chocolate biscotti, Paul.

115
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,730
Okay. Our new hire, Millie,
will be here any minute,

116
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,840
and l expect the two of you to show her
how things are done around here.

117
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,870
Millie? lsn't that a grandma's name?

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,400
What, is it short
for ''millions of years old''?

119
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,470
l bet you she smells like ham.

120
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,550
Hey, maybe then people will smell her,
and we'll sell more ham.

121
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,480
There she is.
Hi, Millie, welcome to the shop.

122
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,990
Well, now we know
what her first job is gonna be.

123
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,330
Hey, Millie. How you doing?

124
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,330
- These are our sons, Justin and Max.
- Hi, guys.

125
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,400
Did l forget to wear pants or something?
Because l have that dream sometimes.

126
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,240
No, no, no.

127
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,810
Hi.

128
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,510
l was two away from all girls.

129
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,610
l'm going to be training you,

130
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,620
so we might be spending
a lot of time together.

131
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,950
Yeah, it's an intensive process.

132
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,060
You don't smell like ham.

133
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,290
Thank you.
l've worked really hard on that.

134
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,900
Hey, you like Tears of Blood?
l love that band.

135
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,230
l never thought a girl
like you would like them.

136
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,070
A girl like what?

137
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,370
Pretty.

138
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,010
l don't smell like ham and l'm pretty?

139
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,550
l like it here.

140
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,050
Hey, Millie,
come over here and l'll show you

141
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,810
where Jerry hides
when l'm looking for him.

142
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,950
lt looks like you should ask Millie out.

143
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,390
You know,
l could be your wingman on this one.

144
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,430
A wingman? What do you know
about being a wingman?

145
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,060
l know plenty.

146
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,130
All right, fine.
Okay, yeah, you're my wingman.

147
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,710
Great. l gotta get some wings
and a hawk mask.

148
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,940
No. Dude, a wingman is someone
who says cool stuff about me

149
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,280
to Millie to get her to go out with me.

150
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,980
You mean cool stuff like:

151
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,790
Pretty.

152
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,870
So this is where it all happens.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,090
Over there is photography,

154
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,170
where they show beautiful girls
so other girls feel inferior.

155
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,240
Over there is editorial, where they write
articles that make girls feel inferior.

156
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,110
What's over there?

157
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,550
Oh, that's the kitchen, where people
are too self-conscious to eat.

158
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,950
lt's just like l imagined it would be.

159
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,820
Lots of cool people
not making eye contact with me.

160
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,120
Watch.

161
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,090
Hi.

162
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,660
See? She didn't even look up.

163
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,360
Alex, this is not show-and-tell time.

164
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,590
Ms. Angela will be here any minute.

165
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,260
Ms. Angela is the publisher
of the magazine.

166
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,140
She's gonna come by to approve my
bringing-summer-colors-into-fall idea.

167
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,800
Jeffrey.

168
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,040
Where are the treats for my doggie?

169
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,810
Ms. Angela, you don't have a dog.

170
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,940
Run down to Petland and get me a dog.

171
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,040
Bye-bye.

172
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Jeffrey, who are these people?

173
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,260
Hi, l'm Alex. l'm the new intern.

174
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,960
No, no, not you. l was talking about the girl
who's dressed like a giant preschooler.

175
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,130
That was rude.

176
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,440
Don't worry, l've rewired my brain
so they come across as compliments.

177
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,210
Thank you.

178
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,340
Jeffrey.

179
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,140
Jeffrey.

180
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,950
Oh, Jeffrey.
l need to see the new issue.

181
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,630
lnteresting.

182
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,860
Summer colors in the fall.

183
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,560
l like it.

184
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,500
l like it a lot.

185
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,700
Great idea, Jeffrey.

186
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,970
You are not fired today.

187
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,580
Thank you, Ms. Angela.

188
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,810
l try to come up
with the best ideas possible for you.

189
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,280
Well, just keep those ideas coming,
Jeffrey. l have big plans for you.

190
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,450
Jeffrey, you totally took credit for my idea.
What was that about?

191
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,890
That's about you being an intern

192
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,590
and me being the next editor-in-chief
of Fashion Fatale Magazine,

193
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,790
l can't believe you stole my idea.

194
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,800
Don't worry, kid.
You'll have your time to shine.

195
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,410
ln the meantime,
how about some coffee?

196
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,340
Oh, no, thanks. l don't drink coffee.

197
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,070
You don't have to drink it to get it.

198
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,880
Everyone, Alex is going on a coffee run.

199
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,080
Can you believe that?

200
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,250
l know. lt's horrible.

201
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,120
l'll have a caramel macchiato.

202
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,320
All right, wingman,
get over there and talk me up.

203
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,490
As soon as you feel she's ready,
you give me the high sign.

204
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,400
Got it.

205
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,900
What's a high sign?

206
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,810
Finish scratching that itch
and show me the high sign.

207
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,810
Just wave hi, okay? Just like this.

208
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,290
- Got it.
- Good.

209
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,520
Hey, Millie.

210
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,720
Did you know that Justin
wears his underwear in the shower?

211
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,860
l thought l was supposed
to give the high sign.

212
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,400
This does not make it private.

213
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,740
l think it does.

214
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,200
No, it doesn't.

215
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,140
Well, here's something
that's cool for sure.

216
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,680
He has a lot of comic books.

217
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,850
- That's cool.
- But wait, there's more.

218
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,510
He has action figures
of the heroes in the comic books,

219
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,520
and he uses them to act out the scenes.

220
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,520
She's ready.

221
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,000
The idea was all mine.

222
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,760
And Jeffrey made Ms. Angela
think it was all his idea.

223
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,460
And then he made you get coffee.

224
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,840
By the way,
mine was cold when you brought it back.

225
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,480
You know,
since Jeffrey steals my good ideas,

226
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,550
l should just give him a bad idea
and watch him take credit for that.

227
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,650
Well, Ms. Angela hates my clothes.

228
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,310
Give him an idea with those in it.

229
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,550
Right.

230
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,780
Even though you love my clothes.

231
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,250
Right.

232
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,790
So how many outfits do you think
you can make in a day?

233
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,760
Let's say 20.

234
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,100
l'd say 40, but my dad's using my
sewing machine to make a new saddle.

235
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,140
Right.

236
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,500
Who is it?

237
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,050
lt's me, Alex.

238
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,250
Oh, l didn't see you.

239
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,860
My door's closed. Come on in.

240
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,550
What have you got?

241
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,360
l have another idea l wanna give you.

242
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,590
Fashion for people
who are not into fashion.

243
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,630
lsn't that just any clothing store
with the word ''barn'' in the name?

244
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,110
No, it's for those people who are after
a totally, completely unique look.

245
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,870
A look so outrageous

246
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,470
that only people who have rewired their
brain could feel good about wearing it.

247
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,510
Tasty. Why don't you get me
some sketches?

248
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,850
l can do even better.

249
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,590
By this time tomorrow,
l could organize a fashion show right here.

250
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,630
Fashion show. Extra tasty.

251
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,170
And you know, l could get Ms. Angela
to come and almost be interested.

252
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, aren't you just full of good ideas?

253
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,160
We are bursting with flavor.

254
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,480
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

255
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,380
l'm sure a lot of guys in gym class
shower in their underwear.

256
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,240
No. l'm the only one.

257
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,350
There are some times
when you should lie.

258
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,900
To me and everyone.
And this is one of those times.

259
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,730
Oh, my gosh, there she is. Hide me.

260
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,000
Justin.

261
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,130
Justin. Oh, Justin.

262
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,210
There you are.

263
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,910
Nice hiding place.

264
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,620
You know, your brother said
some cool stuff about you the other day.

265
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,750
He makes a lot of that stuff up.

266
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,450
You mean like playing
with action figures and stuff?

267
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,650
Because l thought
that was really awesome.

268
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh, that.
Well, that's the cold, hard truth.

269
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,930
Good.

270
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,440
So l was wondering,
are you busy Friday night?

271
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,230
Me?

272
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,470
Friday?

273
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,170
What's up?

274
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,470
Well, l have two tickets
to Tears of Blood, and l was thinking--

275
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,110
Say no more. l'm in.

276
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,310
- Really?
- Yeah.

277
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,510
Okay, great.

278
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,240
So be at my house at 7:30.

279
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,900
l'm going out with Millie on Friday.

280
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,290
How's that for a guy who showers
in his underwear? You might wanna try it.

281
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,000
Harper, thank you for creating
the most horrible clothes l've ever seen.

282
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,210
You're welcome.
What are best friends for?

283
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,420
Oh, are you going on the runway too?

284
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,310
No.

285
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,580
l know.

286
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,220
No, no, no.
Don't wanna ruin the surprise.

287
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,530
Everyone is very excited
about the presentation. And so am l.

288
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,400
Well, people are gonna be talking
about this for quite some time.

289
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,660
Jeffrey, can we get started?

290
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,640
l'm so excited
to see all of your great ideas.

291
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,940
You know, Ms. Angela, about that.

292
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,270
l was reading my horoscope,

293
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,940
and it's very important
that l do one good thing today.

294
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,340
l'm giving credit where credit is due.

295
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,920
And what you're about to see
is entirely our intern, Alex Russo's, idea.

296
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,490
What? Now you give me credit?

297
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,490
That's not the plan.
Ms. Angela, we're all a big team here.

298
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,990
ldeas bounce around,

299
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,830
and which one lands in whose head,
you never do know.

300
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,260
This one is all Jeffrey's.

301
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,460
Alex, stop.

302
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,470
You were right
when you talked to me earlier.

303
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,170
That plus my horoscope
equals this is Alex's idea, 100 percent.

304
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,330
Would somebody please
show me something?

305
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
Oh, this will be something, all right.

306
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,850
Just give me one minute, please.

307
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,620
Harper, change of plans.
We need to change the models.

308
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,980
Jeffrey decided to give me credit
for this whole thing.

309
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,720
Wait, that's good then.
lsn't that what you wanted all along?

310
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,520
Yes, but l wanna take credit
for something Ms. Angela would like.

311
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,520
- Oh, she's gonna hate these.
- l know.

312
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,400
And now,
something that was Alex Russo's idea.

313
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,300
Wait, no. This can't happen. l have
to do something to make you look good.

314
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,430
What do you mean?
l just got the whites of my eyes whitened.

315
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,600
l can't...

316
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,960
How can anybody think
with that junk on?

317
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,190
Oh, l hope l have enough time
to do this.

318
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,460
Wait.

319
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,070
l have all the time in the world.
lt's frozen.

320
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,380
Okay.

321
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,930
Oh, Charley horse. Charley horse.

322
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,530
Go, go, go, work it.
Come on now, ladies. Work it.

323
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,960
Hey, where's your big pineapple?

324
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,330
And she was a butterfly.

325
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,900
Oh, this is all wrong.

326
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,240
l just made bad outfits differently bad.

327
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,140
What is this?

328
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,410
lt looks like they're half-dressed.

329
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,990
Fashion for the non-fashionable.

330
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,390
lt's so unfashionable,
it brings out your under beauty.

331
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,090
Yes.

332
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,990
That's exactly what it does.

333
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,830
l love it.

334
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,830
- You do?
- Well, yes.

335
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,100
Can't you tell?

336
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,800
The way l'm bursting.

337
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,540
Great job, Alex.

338
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,870
l'm going to give you
the highest possible praise.

339
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,640
You are not fired
from your unpaid internship.

340
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,380
Oh, Alex, l have big plans for you.

341
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,950
Actually, l have my own plans.

342
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,780
Harper?

343
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,130
l quit.

344
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,290
And we're gonna go eat.

345
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,890
ln the kitchen.

346
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,430
And we don't care who watches.

347
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,050
Oh, hey, Justin. You're right on time.

348
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,820
Yeah. Tears of Blood
