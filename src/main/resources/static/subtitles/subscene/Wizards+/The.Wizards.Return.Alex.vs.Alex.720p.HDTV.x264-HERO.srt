2
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:49,321
Alex Russo, you kneel before
the Crystals of Justice

3
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:55,222
where you are charged with treason for
attempting to destroy the mortal world.

4
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:58,354
I'm telling you, you have the wrong wizard.

5
00:00:58,355 --> 00:00:59,366
Silence!

6
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:03,268
Ok, I am right here. You
do not have to yell.

7
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:08,989
What I was trying to say is that,
ok, maybe some bad things happened,

8
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:14,379
and maybe it was because of me, but
that doesn't mean it was my fault.

9
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,248
I'd make a terrible lawyer.

10
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:18,108
Your fate has been decided.

11
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:21,193
The Crystal Cavern of Justice
hereby find you guilty!

12
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:24,930
Wait! No! Isn't there some way
we can replay what happened

13
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,932
so you would know I'm innocent?

14
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,578
Well, almost innocent.

15
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:31,253
You're not speaking of the
time vortex, are you?

16
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:34,520
Well, if that's what you call
a rewind button, then yeah.

17
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:39,522
Very well. We will send you back
to the moment this incident began.

18
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:41,575
All right. Well, get your
popcorn and licorice

19
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:46,796
because you're going to
like how this got started.

20
00:01:56,424 --> 00:02:00,260
I just love drive-in movies. You can
yell at the screen and nobody cares.

21
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:05,916
Hey, genius, the walls are oozing
maggots, why are you taking a shower?

22
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,957
Alex...

23
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,904
Your own personal drive-in?!
Get rid of it now.

24
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:18,239
Come on, dad. I can get you your own car
and you can watch the movie with us.

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,491
I can get you a Churro truck.

26
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:23,373
Lose it.

27
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:25,294
Fine.

28
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,190
And whose car was that?

29
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:29,393
I don't know, but there's
some guy out on Waverly Place

30
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:32,399
who's been looking for his car for about
an hour, show me some love, Harper.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,254
- Yeah.
- Harper, don't high-five her.

32
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:37,000
What she did was wrong and
unbelievably selfish.

33
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,879
Well, we left the guy
half a pack of licorice.

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,433
No, we didn't.

35
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:44,038
Dad, what's the big deal? I've
always done stuff like this.

36
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,447
Right, but now that
you're The Family Wizard,

37
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:50,123
it's time to stop using
magic for selfish reasons.

38
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:53,239
Now give me that popcorn.

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,380
Thank you so much, Mason.

40
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,557
Ok, you and Alex can hang up the banner.

41
00:02:57,558 --> 00:03:00,039
Harper, get the ice cream
cake out of the freezer.

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,341
Jerry, stop eating popcorn off the floor.

43
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:07,302
Wait, did you say party? For who?

44
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,991
I have a fair inkling.

45
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:12,244
Another party for Justin?!

46
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:15,008
We're just so excited about
him taking over WizTech.

47
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:17,319
It's a big deal.

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,125
Yeah. I guess you're right.

49
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:21,151
It's not like, you know,
actually winning the

50
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:23,758
family competition and
becoming the full wizard.

51
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,912
Since nobody ever threw me a party.

52
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,936
Hey, I didn't get a party
or get to become a wizard.

53
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:33,273
I just got these all-you-can-eat
bologna scraps.

54
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:36,724
Mm-mm. Maybe I am the winner.

55
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:39,371
Come on, everybody. We've
got a lot of work to do.

56
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:43,212
Justin's going to be here soon.

57
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:47,152
All right, I'm done. Where's my magazine?

58
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,996
Mason, rub my shoulders.
That was hard work.

59
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,458
Hey! I just told you,

60
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,084
magic is not for getting what you
want or using it for selfish reasons.

61
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,804
Mason, stop rubbing her shoulders!

62
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,485
That's right, Mija, you should use your

63
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:03,027
magic to make other people's lives easier.

64
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:07,254
I know a pretty Latina who would love
to never have to do laundry again.

65
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:08,408
Theresa.

66
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,600
Sorry. Your father's right.
It's time to grow up.

67
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:15,992
"Grow up?" Everybody knows people
who grow up too fast are miserable.

68
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:17,350
I mean, look at Harper.

69
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:20,738
She's been doing her parents' laundry
since she was in the second grade.

70
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,877
Oh, see, the laundry I didn't mind so much.

71
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,686
It was rotating the tires
on the minivan that just...

72
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:28,507
Really got to me.

73
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:33,967
Where's Justin? He should've
been here by now.

74
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,230
You mean he's not here?

75
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:38,315
I'm so bored I thought he was here
telling one of his nerdy stories

76
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:43,296
that always ends with "hey,
wake up, everybody!"

77
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm so sorry for the intrusion.
I'm Justin's friend Dominic.

78
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,313
He asked me to give you a message.

79
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:52,586
He is too busy at WizTech and
unfortunately cannot come.

80
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,739
Ok. Give us the message.

81
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,860
Uh... that was the message.

82
00:04:57,861 --> 00:05:01,594
Ok. Can we start from the top? Because
this guy is all over the place.

83
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:05,801
- So is Justin all right?
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Russo. Justin is fine.

84
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:09,604
It's just more difficult for someone with
his spectacular talents to get away.

85
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:11,673
Now, I don't usually use
the word "spectacular,"

86
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:15,634
but in Justin's case, spectacular.

87
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:18,923
Justin isn't coming? What are we
gonna do with the ice cream cake.

88
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:22,517
Oh, I'm sure you'll think
of something, Jerry.

89
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:25,792
Excuse me, you must be Alex Russo.

90
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:29,982
You're quite famous in the Wizard World
but I had no idea you were so...

91
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,685
Beautiful.

92
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:34,811
Oh, come on. I'm not that famous.

93
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:38,409
Dominic. Nice to meet you, mate.
I'm Mason Greyback.

94
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,051
Perhaps you've heard of me,
Alex's Werewolf boyfriend.

95
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:44,578
Boyfriend? You're a lucky man.

96
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,179
Yes, I am. A lucky Werewolf.

97
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:54,621
Well, it seems like I've made
this awkward, forgive me.

98
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:58,259
It was an honor meeting you, Alex.
So long, everyone.

99
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,420
Werewolf.

100
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:06,467
Boy, he was the most polite
wizard I have ever met.

101
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,436
And easy on the eyes.

102
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:11,917
Reminded me of a young me.

103
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:15,041
You know, I think he was into you, Alex.

104
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,553
Oh. No, no, no, no.

105
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:19,398
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

106
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,129
I can't believe Justin's not coming.

107
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,884
I wanted him to be here
for my big announcement.

108
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:27,869
A while ago, I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela, in Italy,

109
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,723
inviting us to a Russo family reunion.

110
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,271
It's ok, dad. What's your announcement?

111
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:37,030
- That was the announcement.
- Oh, great, now dad's all over the place.

112
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:41,104
Aw, Jerry, you're taking me on a
romantic trip to Italy, I love you.

113
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,937
Well... actually, I'm
taking the whole family.

114
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:47,714
Why? They don't know we have kids.

115
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:51,415
But, Theresa, it's a family reunion.
Or should I say...

116
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,315
Riunione di famiglia?

117
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:55,988
Please don't do that, dad.

118
00:06:55,989 --> 00:07:00,073
It's almost as annoying as
when you say "mootsa-rella".

119
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:02,857
Well, you guys have fun.

120
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:06,393
I'll just stay here and read or something.

121
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:09,597
Yeah, and I'll just stay here
and chew up the furniture.

122
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,318
This couch looks pretty fruity.

123
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,169
You guys are family, too. I got
tickets for all of us to go.

124
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,406
- Oh yay!
- All right!

125
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:23,177
Tickets? Dad, if you want to go to
Italy, I can be our travel agent.

126
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:29,078
No time for that travel confusion. Show
me the door to our Italian reunion.

127
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:36,157
Ok, I don't know how to say
"Wizard Speed Pass" in Italian,

128
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:38,992
so I'm just going to go with "Mamma Mia!"

129
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:43,133
Or at least I think that's Italian.

130
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:47,872
A door to Japan? How cool.

131
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,937
It's Italy.

132
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,575
I don't know all the towns in Japan, dude.

133
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:58,262
Alex, you're not going to turn this trip
into one of your selfish shortcuts.

134
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:00,881
I want us to experience the whole journey.

135
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:03,552
Getting there is half the fun.

136
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:07,093
Now, get rid of this thing.

137
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,710
Whoa.

138
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,306
Did you just see that girl?

139
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:15,262
Alex, I have to get her number first.

140
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:18,090
Max, get back here!

141
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:21,871
Would you please grow up?! Max!

142
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:28,636
Ok, let's just find Max and go home.

143
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:31,934
So we can fly back here.

144
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:35,235
Wow! Look at this place.

145
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,190
Oh. It's beautiful.

146
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,305
Your family lives here?

147
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,062
Villa di Russo.

148
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:53,900
I don't know who "Villa di" is,
but Russo is definitely me.

149
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,770
I don't think he's mad at you anymore.

150
00:08:55,771 --> 00:09:00,854
Oh, don't be fooled. He's happy
anywhere there's cheese hanging.

151
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,710
Man. I lost her.

152
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:06,614
I didn't even get her name,
but she looked like a Tomiko.

153
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:09,105
Tomiko! Tomiko!

154
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:12,853
Max. Forget the girl. We've
got girls back home.

155
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:15,789
Yeah, but there's no
Italians in New York, Mom.

156
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,559
Oh, come on. Can't we stay a little longer?

157
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,528
This is the first time Alex's magic
took me somewhere that didn't scare me.

158
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,565
No. We're not coming to Italy this way.

159
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:27,468
We're going to experience a
family trip the real way.

160
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:30,364
You mean on a discount flight in
cramped seats with bad food and

161
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:35,576
an obnoxious kid in front of you
saying, "peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo".

162
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:37,977
Ciao, bella.

163
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:41,415
Are you here for a tour
of the Russo vineyard?

164
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,116
Well... I, uh...

165
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:46,387
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

166
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:50,605
We're not here for the tour, paisan.
Go back to work.

167
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,489
And put a shirt on! All right, let's go.

168
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,029
Ok, fine. But you'll only
have yourself to blame

169
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,614
when that peek-a-boo kid uses
your lap for a barf bag.

170
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:05,215
All right, is everybody here?

171
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:08,546
Good. Now, Alex, get rid of this thing.

172
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:10,347
Ok.

173
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:15,548
Hmm... the spell I need is
like things in my bedroom.

174
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,852
It's buried under the
dirty clothes of my mind.

175
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:23,857
You see? Justin would never do a spell
that he didn't know how to undo.

176
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:26,854
Oh, I get it. I get this
whole "grown-up" thing now.

177
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:29,344
You think Justin should've
been The Family Wizard.

178
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:32,115
Honey, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean it that way.

179
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:37,819
No. I'm sorry I'm not the grown-up
Family Wizard you want me to be.

180
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,720
Well, up until then, that was the best
five-minute vacation I've ever had.

181
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:03,821
Ahem, excuse me, is this Jumbotron taken?

182
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,773
Dominic? What are you doing here?

183
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:09,594
My night job is cleaning
the back of the Jumbotron.

184
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,334
You being here is just a bonus.

185
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:14,990
Look, you seem really nice,
but I have a boyfriend.

186
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,142
And to be honest I don't think I'd
be really good company right now.

187
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,550
Unless you're a fan of big,
sloppy emotional meltdowns.

188
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,242
You know, I was just saying this morning,

189
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:26,928
I haven't seen a big, sloppy
emotional meltdown in a while.

190
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:30,229
Let's see what you got.

191
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:32,837
Ah, a smile.

192
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,628
Have you ever considered
joining The Wizard Council?

193
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,563
The Wizard Council?

194
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:43,148
Isn't that for old geezers who wear robes
because they're tired of shopping?

195
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,760
I just believe you have the
potential to be the most,

196
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:48,707
powerful wizard of your generation.

197
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,478
Trust me. You have no idea
what you're truly capable of.

198
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,783
Well, if you ask my family,

199
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:59,551
I'm not capable of anything
except refusing to grow up.

200
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,901
They're mortals. They can't
understand wizards with your power.

201
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:06,224
Besides, if their opinions
really bothers you,

202
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:12,125
you're powerful enough to create your own
spell to smooth out your little edges.

203
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:15,490
Why are you telling me this?

204
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:20,891
Because where everyone else
sees trouble, I see magic.

205
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,347
And beauty.

206
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,311
Ok, now you're just flirting.

207
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,146
Yeah, a little bit.

208
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:32,704
- Here. It's a small gift.
- Oh, no. I can't take that.

209
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:36,665
It's simply a friendship bracelet.

210
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,859
Everything ok up here?

211
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,829
Oh, yeah. Mason, sorry. I just had
to get away from home, you know.

212
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,600
And I just came to check on her.
I apologize if I've overstepped.

213
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,603
You have, mate, and I'm here now.

214
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,764
Werewolf.

215
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,580
- Good-bye, Alex.
- Bye.

216
00:12:58,004 --> 00:13:00,164
Werewolf.

217
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,450
I do not like that guy.

218
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,452
Anything I should be worried about?

219
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,620
Not a thing.

220
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,740
Good. Well, I've got a
surprise to cheer you up.

221
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,391
I thought we would have a little picnic.

222
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:18,093
Don't say Italian, because I've
had enough of that, today.

223
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:22,774
No. I was thinking
something sophisticated...

224
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,864
- Poached salmon.
- Oh, Mason...

225
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:29,006
That's so sweet.

226
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,510
But can I make a little tweak?

227
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,391
Of course, darling.

228
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:38,612
Check it out, finger food feast.
I call the wing.

229
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:41,564
No, Alex! Alex, you know
this food is bad for you.

230
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:45,428
Besides, I cooked that salmon,
two hours over a hot poacher.

231
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:49,965
Why? You know it only takes
me like two seconds.

232
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:53,270
I see. So, this is how it's
going to be from now on.

233
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:57,531
- What?
- Just you, me and your wand.

234
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:02,694
Just using your magic selfishly
no matter who it hurts.

235
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:06,914
Mason, where are you going?
I did all this for us.

236
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:09,195
So did I.

237
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:21,679
So you turned Mason's classy picnic
into a county fair fry-fest?

238
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,679
Well, everybody knows that
my favorite food comes in

239
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,263
cardboard containers with
some kind of dipping sauce.

240
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:29,487
Ewe.

241
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:35,388
Oh, hi, Alex. Can you tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

242
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:39,336
Everything you're wearing
is from the nineties.

243
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:43,001
Oh, but if you guys wear
it, it's "vintage".

244
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,169
Have you figured out how to
get rid of this thing yet?

245
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,577
Uh, no. I've been a little busy.

246
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:53,478
But don't worry, I'll figure it out
something before Max can use it again.

247
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:58,783
Hey, who wants to help me
make a hot tub out of this?

248
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:01,409
I bet I know how he's going
to make the bubbles.

249
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,989
Max, stop going to Italy. And, Alex, you...

250
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,753
I know, I know. Grow up.

251
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:10,979
You're right, pop. I'll
just take this back.

252
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,930
Max, you forgot the barrel!

253
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:14,791
Max!

254
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:17,802
He's not coming back, is he?

255
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:20,705
Theresa, we have to find Max again!

256
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:24,176
What?! I was about to make dinner.

257
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:28,497
It's just Italy, we'll be right back.

258
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:38,548
Hey, are you ok?

259
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:42,018
It's just that, I thought once
I became The Family Wizard,

260
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,296
all of this pressure would be off of me.

261
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:49,266
But no, it's like everybody
still wants me to change.

262
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:51,368
Well, that doesn't make a lot of sense.

263
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,601
It's who you are in the first place
that made you The Family Wizard.

264
00:15:54,602 --> 00:16:00,244
I know, but maybe growing up
would make me a better person.

265
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:02,146
I mean, I can't even say anything nice

266
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:04,315
about my best friend's
hideous clambake outfit.

267
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:07,284
I'm sorry, Harper. I held
off as long as I could.

268
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:10,704
But you see? That's what I mean. You
making fun of my outfit is you.

269
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:13,124
And me loving this outfit is me.

270
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,193
People should appreciate
you for who you are,

271
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:18,963
not for what they think you should be.

272
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:24,587
Right. And I am a powerful wizard
who can change if I want to.

273
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:27,183
Just smooth out my little edges.

274
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:29,049
Wait, hold up. Ok, so,
after my great speech,

275
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,293
you're still going to change
your personality with magic?

276
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,358
Well, just the parts that nobody likes.

277
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,607
So, you're going to change
your whole personality?

278
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:38,167
I owed you for the clambake comment.

279
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:41,652
- All right.
- Yeah, that's good.

280
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:43,758
Selfish, mean and tired of rejection.

281
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,319
Take these parts to a place of reflection.

282
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:51,034
Alex, are you ok?

283
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:54,094
I think so. Did it work?

284
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:56,942
I don't know. You look the same.
Here, let me test you.

285
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:59,203
What do you think of my clambake outfit?

286
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:02,141
Mm. It's horrible...

287
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:03,540
That you didn't make me one.

288
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,736
- Oh, it worked!
- I'm totally nice!

289
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:09,615
Wait.

290
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:12,950
If you still have all your good parts,
where did all your bad parts go?

291
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:16,254
Hey! Let me out of here, you ugly hags!

292
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:19,090
And I found my bad parts.

293
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:21,500
Oh, come on. She doesn't seem that bad.

294
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,649
I can smell that nasty outfit
all the way from here!

295
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,866
- Oh, I am not afraid of you!
- Well, come and get me, lobster girl!

296
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:32,707
Harper, don't let me taunt you.

297
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:35,331
Hey, maybe she's like a bird.

298
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:37,968
She'll be quiet if we cover her up.

299
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,909
Hey! Take this off!

300
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:50,049
Oh, Alex. You have no
idea what you've started.

301
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,554
Did you find Max?

302
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:06,355
No.

303
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:09,424
But I found out where my
cousins keep their cannolis.

304
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:13,678
Jerry, you're supposed to be
looking for your son, not dessert.

305
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,533
Let me have a bite of that. Come on.

306
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:19,474
- Oh, Max!
- Where?

307
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:21,174
Oh!

308
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:22,608
Mmm.

309
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:25,913
Let's just go home and try to
lure Max back with this cannoli.

310
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:28,010
- Ok.
- What I'm saying.

311
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:30,079
There's not going to be any left.

312
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,614
- Let's get a couple to go.
- Ok.

313
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:36,733
Where are you going? Thieves!

314
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:40,391
Buon giorno. We're just
looking for our son.

315
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:43,332
We're not stealing.

316
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:50,525
Carmela? Cousin Carmela?

317
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,302
Jerry Russo!

318
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:56,263
Bianca, Gino, put your wands down.

319
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,566
Geraldo!

320
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:01,147
Cugino Geraldo!

321
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:06,222
Look at you. You still have a baby face.
It's so smooth.

322
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:08,784
Oh, that's just the
grease from the cannoli.

323
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:11,394
- Carmela, this is my wife, Theresa.
- Oh, Theresa!

324
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,845
Nice to meet... too tight.

325
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:17,837
Too thin. This one is like a bread stick.

326
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:22,768
Hey, Geraldo, what are you doing here?
The reunion isn't for month, huh?

327
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,189
Oh, who cares? Let's eat.

328
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:33,867
- Benvenuto!
- Max.

329
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:37,146
I'm sorry. I just love meeting people.
Hi, Max Russo.

330
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:39,906
We have been looking all over for you.

331
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:42,484
This is our son, Max. I'm sorry.

332
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:46,063
He saw a pretty girl through the Wizard
Speed Pass and came to find her.

333
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:48,390
You have a Wizard Speed Pass?

334
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,736
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

335
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:54,330
Only the most powerful
wizards can create those.

336
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:58,033
Ah, but your Family Wizard, Alex Russo.

337
00:19:58,034 --> 00:20:01,625
Yes. Alex is very powerful, and very...

338
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:04,086
Irresponsible!

339
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:11,110
Just because you say it loud and weird
doesn't make it Italian, Jerry.

340
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,116
There's that girl. I have to meet her.

341
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:16,185
She might be the future Mrs. Max Russo.

342
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:19,021
Mrs. Russo! Mrs. Russo!

343
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:22,322
Your son likes Francesca?

344
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:27,734
What's so funny?

345
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:30,975
Francesca is his cousin!

346
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,970
Ewe.

347
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:38,840
Theresa, did Geraldo tell you that we were
wizards in training at the same time?

348
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:41,153
We had so much fun.

349
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:45,474
Geraldo, remember I used to tickle you?

350
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:49,584
Stop, stop! Get the bread stick.
Get the bread stick.

351
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:52,225
No. No, oh no.

352
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:03,598
So, what do you think about
taking accordion lessons with me?

353
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,569
Well, why wouldn't I?
You're my best friend.

354
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,639
It's like a dream come true.

355
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
Ok. I'm ready!

356
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,902
- What do you think?
- I think it's missing something.

357
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,595
- Come here.
- Oh.

358
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:24,119
- Oh, this is the best day of my life.
- Oh, I'm so happy you're happy.

359
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,255
Thank you, Alex. You're such a good friend.

360
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:28,477
- Now, take it off.
- What, why?

361
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:31,890
Because even though I love that you finally
appreciate something I like to do,

362
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:35,818
it's just not you and,
I don't need it to be.

363
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:36,861
Thank you.

364
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,504
Besides, I can pull off a clambake outfit.

365
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:43,165
On you, it just looks stupid.

366
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:46,108
What was that?

367
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:49,979
Oh! Something I think is going
to take up the rest of the day.

368
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,860
Harper, grab the fishing net.
We might need it to catch me.

369
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:02,657
Yup. I broke out.

370
00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:04,601
Ok, where would a Bad Alex go?

371
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:08,620
Usually, only as far as the
couch, but that door is open.

372
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,841
Oh, gosh.

373
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,835
What are you doing?

374
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:19,736
You know, I really should have
made a shawl out of this net.

375
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,588
Carmela, this cheese is amazing.

376
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:26,482
Oh yeah, Papa Fabrizio makes it.

377
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,283
Eh.

378
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:34,356
We need find me before
I do something bad...

379
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:37,326
Hi, Mom and dad. Guess what? I've changed.

380
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:41,527
Yeah, into a third grade art project.

381
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:44,397
No, no, no. Not that, dad. Guess what?

382
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:47,525
All the part of me that has all
of those bad things is gone.

383
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:51,246
Yup. Gone. Nowhere to be seen.

384
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:53,033
Unless of course you've seen it.

385
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:55,744
Mom, dad, from now on I promise...

386
00:22:55,745 --> 00:23:00,249
To be the unselfish grown-up
you expect me to be.

387
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,526
I don't believe her.

388
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:04,186
Me neither.

389
00:23:04,187 --> 00:23:07,122
Seriously, why are you
wearing a clambake outfit?

390
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:09,058
Because my best friend asked me to.

391
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,819
Dad, sometimes you need to do
things to make others happy.

392
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:17,943
Now, I definitely don't believe her.

393
00:23:17,944 --> 00:23:21,812
Look, I still don't like
the way we got here...

394
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:25,890
But they're feeding us. So you
might as well meet the family.

395
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:30,900
Everyone, I'd like you to meet our friend
Harper, and our Family Wizard, Alex!

396
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:32,701
Oh.

397
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:35,650
So cute.

398
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,553
Pooka-pooka-pooka!

399
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:39,217
Just like your father!

400
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:44,078
- Why is she tickling me?
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!

401
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:53,430
Excuse me, I'm looking for a girl that's
about this tall and this beautiful...

402
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,121
Hey it's you.

403
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:03,239
You know my name?

404
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,140
Or, wait, does it just take that
long to say my name in Italian?

405
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,079
I don't understand what
you're saying right now.

406
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,520
I'll try the language of love with you.

407
00:24:17,293 --> 00:24:21,363
Ok, maybe you don't speak that language.

408
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:24,233
Oh, Max. I'll save you.

409
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:26,574
Not really.

410
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:39,878
Thanks, Alex. They kiss really weird here.

411
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:43,363
All right. I'm safe in a bracelet. Thanks.

412
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:46,064
Safe or trapped?

413
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:52,731
By that evil chuckle, I'm
going to go with "trapped".

414
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:58,653
And this is where we press the
finest grapes in all of Tuscany.

415
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:02,374
Oh, that looks like hard work.

416
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:07,325
Please. Stomping your feet isn't hard work.

417
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:10,712
Yeah, filling bread rolls
with cold cuts all day.

418
00:25:10,713 --> 00:25:13,533
That's hard work.

419
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:15,836
Geraldo...

420
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:17,319
Why don't you try it?

421
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,560
- Oh, no. No, thanks.
- Ah...

422
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:24,061
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!
- Ha-ha-ha! Ok. Ok.

423
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,728
- You too, Theresa.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm ok.

424
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:28,797
- Get in.
- No, no, no.

425
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,904
- Theresa, get in.
- No thank you.

426
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,819
Get in!

427
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,160
Si, senora.

428
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:38,607
It's nice to appreciate my Mom and
dad doing something together.

429
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:42,244
Old me would've just been thinking
of ways to make fun of them.

430
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:43,612
- Oh.
- Oh.

431
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:47,273
- Oh, it's so squishy.
- Oh.

432
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,287
Ugh. And the worst part
is, I kind of like it.

433
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:55,290
Thanks a lot, Jerry. You know
what this reminds me of?

434
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:59,418
The time the bathtub backed up and you
made us take showers in there anyway.

435
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:03,968
Don't blame me. You were the one who
said, "oh, handsome vineyard guy"...

436
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:08,515
"You're so strong, the way
you squash those grapes".

437
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:10,272
I never said that.

438
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:14,233
- Oh, yes, you did.
- Oh, please.

439
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:19,080
- You imagined it.
- Oh. Oh, really?

440
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,727
Your insecurities imagined it.

441
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:21,811
Aha!

442
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:23,402
Ooh.

443
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:27,155
Hey, you know, they should
really have machines for this.

444
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:29,090
- Don't you think?
- Oh!

445
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:32,511
You know what? Yes, I do.

446
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:39,364
I would never disrespect you like that!

447
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:41,121
- Oh, honey, wait.
- What?

448
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:43,216
You love me so much you got so jealous?

449
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:46,337
- Oh, honey...
- Good!

450
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:52,781
Aw. They found a way to make it worse
for themselves without my help.

451
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:55,902
Changing me was great.

452
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:13,568
My cousins! Where did they go?

453
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:16,590
Oh, no. Harper, do you think my bad side

454
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,932
could've done something
terrible to my parents?

455
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:23,073
Hmm, let's see. All of your bad
is concentrated into one you.

456
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:28,974
- Do you want to finish where that's going?
- I get it, I did it.

457
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,013
Where are we?

458
00:27:35,014 --> 00:27:37,992
Dad. You're not going to like this.

459
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:42,263
Oh, it's just Alex. Thank you
for cleaning me up, Mija.

460
00:27:42,264 --> 00:27:45,099
Now, get me out of here. It's stuffy.

461
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,804
What's your hurry? Handsome
vineyard guy waiting for you?

462
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:51,280
What are you talking about?

463
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:55,401
You're the one who had to prove what a big
macho man you were with your cold cuts.

464
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:58,234
Yeah-ha! They're delicious!

465
00:27:58,235 --> 00:28:00,999
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I can't
concentrate on the evil

466
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,053
plan we have going here if you
two are flappin' your yappers.

467
00:28:04,054 --> 00:28:05,062
Evil plan?

468
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,349
You remember when I said, "you're
not going to like this?"

469
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,058
This is what I was talking about.

470
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:12,459
Who's "we?"

471
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:16,202
Excellent, Alex.

472
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:19,038
Hello, Russo's.

473
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,939
Hey, it's that guy. Hey, did you ever
remember that message from Justin?

474
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:35,833
Just as I thought.

475
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:40,407
Alex! You don't have to do this.

476
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,375
So, what's next?

477
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:48,276
How would my partner like a little
road trip to the Tower of Pisa?

478
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:56,753
Dominic is evil?

479
00:28:56,754 --> 00:29:00,824
Is it weird he's even more attractive now?

480
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:06,725
- Harper. He took my family.
- Oh yeah, right. I won't date him.

481
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:14,032
Even as a young wizard I knew
that some day my dreams...

482
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:17,268
Though disturbing, would come true.

483
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:22,273
And so, from this high vantage point, we
will launch the final steps to my plan

484
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:24,942
to rid the world of mortals and then...

485
00:29:24,943 --> 00:29:28,956
You know, it's really kind
of killer on the calves.

486
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:32,078
That's a nice story, can we
get to what this thing does?

487
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,079
Right. This device...

488
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:37,087
Replicates spells.

489
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,822
Once energized with
sufficient wizard power,

490
00:29:39,823 --> 00:29:42,894
it will cast a spell
repeatedly across Earth.

491
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:47,095
I call it the "Dominic One Thousand".

492
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:49,983
Is that too self-centered?

493
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:52,751
You're asking the wrong girl.

494
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:56,175
I designed the Dominic One
Thousand to imprison every mortal,

495
00:29:56,176 --> 00:30:00,400
thereby paving the way for a new
Wizard World that I will rule.

496
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:03,848
- Uh, that last part again?
- That we will rule.

497
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:08,953
All that is needed is a spell cast by our
generation's most powerful wizard...

498
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:10,755
Alex Russo.

499
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:13,558
All right. Well, then let me at it.

500
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,869
No offense, you're just a knock-off.
You don't have all of her powers.

501
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,567
I have enough powers to scorch a hole
in your little purple jacket there.

502
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:24,301
Point taken.

503
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:28,646
All right. So, what if your "all
powerful" Alex doesn't come?

504
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:31,527
Oh, she'll come...

505
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:36,351
To save her family.

506
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:43,416
Wait, wait, wait. I'm confused.
Are we tiny or are they giants?

507
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,286
So if it's called the Leaning Tower
of Pisa, where is all the pizza?

508
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:51,207
What?

509
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:57,327
Alex, you need to come up with a plan.

510
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:59,883
I'm not good with heights.

511
00:30:59,884 --> 00:31:02,487
Or substandard architecture.

512
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:06,069
You're fine, Harper. Just don't
look down, it'll make you dizzy.

513
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,329
Oh, Too late. Dizzy. Going down.

514
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,790
Wait, Harper!

515
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,416
Oh. All right then. Ha ha.

516
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,586
So, this is the top of the Tower of Pisa.

517
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,355
Woo. Would you check out that view.

518
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:27,461
That is breathtaking. My
breath has been taken...

519
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:29,144
- From my lungs.
- I know, right?

520
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:31,073
- We should post this on Wiz-agram.
- We should.

521
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:36,174
- Can you take a picture?
- Yeah, let's do that.

522
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:40,003
Ready? Say, "cheese".

523
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:43,004
- Harper, run!
- Ah!

524
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:46,046
Yes.

525
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:49,707
Harper has joined your family in captivity.

526
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:53,517
- You let them go right now or I'll...
- You'll what?

527
00:31:53,518 --> 00:31:56,386
Don't forget, I have all the bad.

528
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:58,789
Yeah, well...

529
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,924
I look really cute in that outfit.

530
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:03,594
I know. I wasn't really sure
about the boots at first but...

531
00:32:03,595 --> 00:32:05,829
Focus on the mission.

532
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,635
Yeah, I heard all about your mission.

533
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:12,259
Clear out the mortal world so that you
can make room to rule all evil wizards.

534
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,801
Good. You're up to speed.
Now, for that spell...

535
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:18,832
- Never.
- Why would you underestimate me, Alex?

536
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:22,045
Perhaps you remember my
very determined uncle.

537
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:24,581
- He had wings.
- Gorog.

538
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:27,418
I came to finish what
you took from my uncle.

539
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,753
But where he failed, I will succeed.

540
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:32,255
My own wizard empire right here on Earth!

541
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:36,396
Ow! Why are these stupid bells here!

542
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:40,415
Maybe to knock some sense into you
because I'm never doing that spell.

543
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,233
My family is more important than anything.

544
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:45,241
Now give me the bracelet.

545
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:47,797
You're so stubborn with that spell.

546
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:53,618
Perhaps if I fill up one more
charm, it will convince you.

547
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:58,048
Mason!

548
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,849
No!

549
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:07,090
Mason. You're ok.

550
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:09,308
Get tired of Dominic already?

551
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,544
What? I don't care about him.

552
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:15,799
He's some crazy wizard who's weaving some
sort of wicked web to take over the world.

553
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,025
Well, you're some kind of
wicked web weaver yourself.

554
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,627
What are you talking about?

555
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:23,478
I saw you at the Villa with Dominic,
you two looked quite chummy.

556
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,709
No. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

557
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,779
Dominic tricked me into
casting out my bad side.

558
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,323
That's who you saw. There's
another me walking around.

559
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:36,243
And I have to get you out of here
before she finds you. Let's go.

560
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:39,578
I knew I wasted time with that hug.

561
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:41,859
- Two Alex's?
- Mason, get away from her.

562
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,528
She's with Dominic, and they're
trying to take over the world.

563
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:47,773
Nice try, me. Mason, she's the bad one.
Let's go.

564
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:53,674
No! Don't listen to her. I'm the good one.
She's the bad one.

565
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:57,508
Well, isn't this a sticky wicket.

566
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:59,773
Mason, please believe me.

567
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,740
She's trying to trick you.

568
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:05,821
She doesn't even know how I dress.

569
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:09,319
That is something Harper would wear.

570
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,422
No, no, no, no. I'm wearing it
because Harper asked me to.

571
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:16,623
Ok, that doesn't even sound like me.

572
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:24,200
Thank goodness. I hope you and Dominic rot.

573
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:26,481
Mason, no!

574
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:40,984
- Where are we?
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa.

575
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:43,805
Oh. Very romantic.

576
00:34:43,988 --> 00:34:46,388
I think so.

577
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,390
Dominic.

578
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:54,063
Oh, no.

579
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:58,744
Aw. You picked the wrong Alex.

580
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,366
Oh. Now, this is what I call a
"take over the world" look.

581
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,887
As for you...

582
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:16,039
Max, who joined us over there?

583
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,800
Hey, it's Mason.

584
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:29,609
What have I done? I can't even
"grow up" when I try to grow up.

585
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,402
I don't even deserve to
be The Family Wizard.

586
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:34,803
Justin does.

587
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:37,865
And he'd know what to do.

588
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:40,447
Beep, beep, boop, beep, beep...

589
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:44,888
Professor Justin Vincenzo Pepe Russo is...

590
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:05,902
People should appreciate
you for who you are,

591
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:09,522
not for what they think you should be.

592
00:36:09,523 --> 00:36:11,942
Harper's right.

593
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:15,846
Everybody should just get over it.

594
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:18,449
I'm not perfect, I'm just...

595
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,151
A wizard who has to save the world, again.

596
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:24,012
Ugh!

597
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:31,112
Ok, Dominic wants a spell?

598
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,086
I'll give him a spell...

599
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:37,987
With a little bit of a surprise.

600
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:47,377
Ok, I'm here to get my family back.
Let's do this.

601
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:48,812
Excellent.

602
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:54,093
Aw, she's here to save the family.
How sweet. Ugh.

603
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:59,229
Dominic, give me the bracelet, and
I'll do the spell for your machine.

604
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,470
Agreed. Give it to her.

605
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,747
Wait...

606
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:07,197
I know me.

607
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:10,833
We'll give her the bracelet and she'll
flash out without doing the spell.

608
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:14,528
Right. Spell first then the bracelet.

609
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:17,207
Nice try, but I know me, too.

610
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,110
I'll do the spell and you'll
keep my family anyway.

611
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:21,690
No bracelet, no spell.

612
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:23,741
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

613
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,558
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

614
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,235
- Spell first!
- Not doing anything...

615
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:29,319
Spell first! Spell first!

616
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,480
Stop it!

617
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:35,523
Tower of Pisa that hurt!

618
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:41,003
Alex will cast the spell at the same time
Bad Alex gives you the bracelet, agreed?

619
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:46,737
- That's a good idea.
- Well, why didn't you think of it first?

620
00:37:46,738 --> 00:37:49,126
One wave, two waves, three waves, four.

621
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:52,427
Every mortal be no more.

622
00:37:56,976 --> 00:38:02,556
Excellent. The world will now
be wiped clean of mortals.

623
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:07,104
Ow! And then we wipe it clean of bells.

624
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:27,229
Was this how you wanted it to work?

625
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,931
Ok, the Leaning Tower of Pisa may
not have been the ideal place

626
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:35,046
for my Dominic One Thousand,
but it's working.

627
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:39,122
Every mortal will be
imprisoned in these beads.

628
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:42,559
Are you sure you don't want
a bucket or something?

629
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,560
The bracelet, please.

630
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:50,516
You know, Alex, now is the time to join us.

631
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:54,425
With your powers, we can rule
more than just this world.

632
00:38:54,426 --> 00:38:57,265
Thank you for remembering
I'm a powerful wizard.

633
00:38:57,266 --> 00:39:00,614
Powerful enough that I can
undo any spell I create.

634
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:01,619
No!

635
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,360
The mortals who were
gone before, can now...

636
00:39:10,754 --> 00:39:12,889
What are you doing? I was
about to fix everything

637
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,058
before you guys swirled me out of there.

638
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,827
Well, if you're looking
for someone to blame,

639
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:19,629
you can just point your
fingers at yourself.

640
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,031
If you had fingers, I mean.

641
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:24,269
- Told you it was too soon.
- It wouldn't have mattered.

642
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,151
She's obviously stalling.

643
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:29,639
Don't you understand? The spell
replicator is still capturing mortals.

644
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,845
You have to let me go, so I
can save the world, again.

645
00:39:34,846 --> 00:39:38,686
There he is! Grab him, get him!

646
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:43,041
Dominic, the Crystals of Justice recognize

647
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:45,421
you as an esteemed member of WizTech.

648
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:47,256
Do you have any testimony?

649
00:39:47,257 --> 00:39:49,306
I most certainly do.

650
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:53,755
Alex Russo had no intention
to undo her spell.

651
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:56,889
She is a powerful, but selfish wizard.

652
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,782
Why does everybody keep saying that?

653
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:02,958
So powerful that she put me under her
spell to take the blame for her crime.

654
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,768
Spell?! He's lying!

655
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,772
You need look no further than the fact that
she extracted her own evil personality

656
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,543
and cast the spell into
the Dominic One Thous...

657
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,364
Alex One Thousand.

658
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,921
That's what she called it.

659
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:20,127
Alex Russo, do you deny this?

660
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:22,834
He's twisting things. He set me up.

661
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:24,191
Silence!

662
00:40:24,192 --> 00:40:26,826
The evidence against you is overwhelming.

663
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:30,830
After careful deliberation,
we, the Crystals of Justice,

664
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:36,731
find you guilty as charged and
sentence you to no dessert for a week!

665
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,604
Oh.

666
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:41,073
Well, that's not that bad.

667
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:44,710
Oh, no, sorry. I was reading
the wrong subsection.

668
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:46,294
It's actually death.

669
00:40:46,295 --> 00:40:49,046
Death by chocolate?

670
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,987
No! Death by death!

671
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:56,522
What?! No! It's Dominic you want, not me!

672
00:40:56,523 --> 00:41:00,213
You will be incarcerated until
your sentence is carried out.

673
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:03,529
Wait! No! Please! You have to believe me!

674
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,970
I didn't do anything! He has my family!

675
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,001
I hope you got a last glimpse of
Alex before she meets her end.

676
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:19,455
You won't get away with this!

677
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:21,291
Already have.

678
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:24,192
You have a girl's bracelet on!

679
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:27,208
No! It's a uni-bracelet.

680
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:29,372
Dominic, if you had a spine,
you'd let me out of here,

681
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:34,173
so you and I can settle
this like gentlemen.

682
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:47,272
This just in, it's been reported
that people around the world

683
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:49,598
have been mysteriously disappearing.

684
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,619
As of now, there is no official...

685
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,638
Uh...

686
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:05,651
In other news, the people of
the world are becoming...

687
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:09,192
This is bad. We should eat.

688
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,101
Why did I choose the Tower of Pisa?

689
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,815
I'm wondering the same thing, dude.

690
00:42:20,816 --> 00:42:23,810
Nonetheless, Alex is now doomed.

691
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:29,711
And best of all, her loved ones had
a front row seat to her conviction.

692
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:35,036
Dominic, one of those charms is broken.

693
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:39,366
- Mason.
- Yep.

694
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,689
This is ridiculous. I've got
to try to get out of here.

695
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:53,150
Hello! Hello!

696
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:01,931
I'm going to use magic to blow this
door down, so you better stand back.

697
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:05,802
And let me apologize in
advance for the mess I make.

698
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:08,623
I am really nice.

699
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:17,394
Double-Decker bus, that was close!

700
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,563
Mason, I'm so glad you're here.

701
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,834
Look, I just want to say
I'm so sorry for ruining

702
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:25,159
your picnic and being
selfish and immature...

703
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,859
Alex, there's no time for that now. You
must save humanity from Dominic and...

704
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,041
Well, you.

705
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:34,654
But I can't. I can't get out.
This dungeon is magic-proof.

706
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:39,935
Well, then, let's find out
if it's Werewolf-proof.

707
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,588
Thank you.

708
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,658
If you're really grateful,
you'd scratch behind my ears.

709
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,727
Oh. That's the spot. All right.

710
00:43:58,728 --> 00:44:00,562
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh.

711
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:04,499
And more people are mysteriously
disappearing around the globe.

712
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,400
The government asks that everyone
remain calm and in there houses.

713
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:13,232
And now for the sports.

714
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:18,753
Antonio, por favor tell all
the workers to come inside.

715
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,580
Eh!

716
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,900
Tall, skinny guy, girl in a
bikini, Italian newscaster...

717
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:32,548
Ryan Gosling?

718
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:40,448
Hey, guys. Don't mind me, I just
dropped by to give myself a beat down.

719
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:43,310
Alex?! How did you get out?

720
00:44:43,311 --> 00:44:45,774
Take a guess.

721
00:44:45,775 --> 00:44:47,758
Dominic, it's over.

722
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:51,900
You're not gonna take over the world
because I'm here to save it, again.

723
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:54,989
You're not going to be
able to save it this time.

724
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,210
Oh, yeah?

725
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:03,641
- Here...
- No, I got it. I got it.

726
00:45:03,642 --> 00:45:07,002
You're ruining my moment.

727
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,302
Get her out of here before
she stops the replicator!

728
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,842
I'm not going anywhere.

729
00:45:23,843 --> 00:45:28,622
You will to protect your family...
and your home.

730
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:30,940
Oh, no. Mason, I'll be right back.

731
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:36,581
No worries, love. I'll just
stay here and have a snack.

732
00:45:39,898 --> 00:45:41,832
What am I up to?

733
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:47,233
It's kind of hard chasing
me without my sneaky side.

734
00:45:57,615 --> 00:46:01,695
Oh, I wish I could just rest here.

735
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:16,395
Ok, maybe I don't care about the kitchen,
but now you've messed with my couch.

736
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:30,495
- That's weird, right?
- It's really weird.

737
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:39,752
Hey!

738
00:46:39,802 --> 00:46:43,197
You are a very ugly side of
me and it is time to go.

739
00:46:43,198 --> 00:46:45,118
Sure.

740
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:51,249
Oh! Why didn't I see myself doing that?

741
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:58,286
Watch out for the bars.

742
00:46:58,287 --> 00:47:02,367
Don't get cute. I'm the cute one.

743
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:16,988
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

744
00:47:23,065 --> 00:47:26,545
You're right. This is fun.

745
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:14,426
Psst. Over here.

746
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:25,544
I didn't think it'd be that
hard to kick my own butt.

747
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:38,384
Always underestimating me.

748
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,060
Mason! Mason, wake up! I'm so sorry.

749
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:57,867
- What did you do?
- I put your dog down.

750
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,748
This is for Mason.

751
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:02,990
Guess who?

752
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:06,411
I'm back? Darn I'm good.

753
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,837
Drop it.

754
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:14,288
And I'll take the bracelet.

755
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:19,272
Oh. Finish her.

756
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:35,572
Ok, that definitely got rid of me.

757
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:37,412
I think.

758
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:41,274
All right. Now time to get rid of this.

759
00:49:41,275 --> 00:49:43,091
Alex!

760
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:46,707
Don't you think your time would be
better served saving your family?

761
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:51,148
Hey, I think I can see Tokyo from here.

762
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:10,564
Are you guys all right?

763
00:50:10,565 --> 00:50:11,958
- Yeah, we're ok.
- Good job Mija.

764
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:15,083
Got a little steamy in my bead.

765
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:19,884
Clearly I can't defeat
the great Alex Russo.

766
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,221
But think of the world I am creating.

767
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:26,742
It needs you.

768
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,469
I need you.

769
00:50:39,729 --> 00:50:43,598
No surprise. You all
knew I did not like him.

770
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,679
Mason! I was so scared I lost you.

771
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,240
Mason! I was so scared I lost you.

772
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:58,141
Ugh. Wouldn't it be nice if I was
this determined in everyday stuff?

773
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:00,348
Haven't we had enough of this?

774
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,847
Can we just call it a day
and get back together.

775
00:51:02,848 --> 00:51:08,748
No way. Dominic went bye-bye, so that
leaves more room at the top for just me.

776
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:14,468
And thanks to this, I'm going
to take over the world.

777
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:17,349
You're really bad.

778
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:21,590
I have no choice.

779
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:23,808
Oh. Just as I thought.

780
00:51:23,809 --> 00:51:27,349
Too good for your own good.

781
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,995
No one wins if we both lose everything.

782
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:35,896
What do you mean lose everything?

783
00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:40,591
By all my power is to go.

784
00:51:40,592 --> 00:51:43,090
- No. No, no, no. You can't!
- Alex, what are you doing?

785
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:46,148
She's casting the spell
to cancel all her powers.

786
00:51:46,149 --> 00:51:50,113
A wizard's essence, spirit and soul
will be nothing but a lump of coal.

787
00:51:50,114 --> 00:51:52,005
- Alex, stop! Don't do it!
- Honey, don't do it!

788
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:57,906
By all the power vested in me my power
be wrested out and forever free.

789
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:22,716
Alex Russo...

790
00:52:22,796 --> 00:52:27,095
Once again, you've shown immense
bravery in saving the world.

791
00:52:27,096 --> 00:52:32,398
Consequently, your guilty
verdict is hereby overturned.

792
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,933
Ha! All right.

793
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:37,072
However, we cannot ignore
the fact that this,

794
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,169
as in every time in the past,

795
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,010
you were involved in bringing the
world to the brink of disaster.

796
00:52:42,011 --> 00:52:46,848
Oh, come on. This was a good moment.
We don't need to dig up the past.

797
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:51,659
How about you just give me my magic back,
and we can all go home with a warm feeling?

798
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,188
We have been patient, but
you have failed to show the

799
00:52:54,189 --> 00:52:57,926
maturity and responsibility needed
to handle being The Family Wizard.

800
00:52:57,927 --> 00:53:01,196
Therefore, we have decided that it is in
the best interest of the Wizard World

801
00:53:01,197 --> 00:53:03,724
that your powers not be reinstated.

802
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:08,003
Wait. Wait, please. I've been
trying to help her grow up.

803
00:53:08,004 --> 00:53:12,324
Just give her another chance to change.

804
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:14,842
No.

805
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:21,604
I'm tired of everybody wanting
me to grow up, or to change.

806
00:53:21,605 --> 00:53:24,626
Or to not be selfish.

807
00:53:24,627 --> 00:53:28,767
No one is happy for just who I am.

808
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,980
Except for one person.

809
00:53:32,111 --> 00:53:36,083
This is so embarrassing.
She's talking about me.

810
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:38,124
Harper.

811
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:43,694
I'm sorry, dude. I thought
she was gonna say you.

812
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:52,487
You're the only one that
accepts me with all my flaws.

813
00:53:52,488 --> 00:53:55,691
And I know that I have a lot of them.

814
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:57,770
And even though that there have been times

815
00:53:57,771 --> 00:54:01,257
where you wanted me to
change and I didn't...

816
00:54:01,258 --> 00:54:04,498
You stood by me anyway.

817
00:54:05,982 --> 00:54:09,571
So it's ok if you don't give me my magic.

818
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:12,249
My best friend Harper is my magic.

819
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,470
Oh, Alex.

820
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:21,483
I am so proud of you, honey.

821
00:54:21,484 --> 00:54:24,018
Even though you don't have your powers,

822
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:27,679
you still deserve to be The Family Wizard.

823
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,600
Here.

824
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:35,278
All right. Let's go home.

825
00:54:36,266 --> 00:54:37,717
Perhaps...

826
00:54:37,718 --> 00:54:42,337
The appreciation you have for
others is in itself very mature.

827
00:54:42,338 --> 00:54:46,445
It seems you have other qualities
that can make a great Family Wizard.

828
00:54:46,446 --> 00:54:48,535
I don't like where this is going.

829
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:51,689
There still may be hope
for you, Alex Russo.

830
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,350
We grant you one more chance.

831
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:14,270
I have my magic back.

832
00:55:14,271 --> 00:55:16,505
Thank you.

833
00:55:16,506 --> 00:55:20,886
I'll see you the next time I mess up.

834
00:55:23,379 --> 00:55:27,155
Carmela, grazie for this
beautiful family reunion.

835
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:30,429
Please come visit us anytime.

836
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,770
Except you.

837
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:39,049
Can I come back and visit you sometime?

838
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:45,441
"Stupido". I'm wearing her down.

839
00:55:47,337 --> 00:55:52,241
Alex, before you go, please give
some advice to Bianca and Gino.

840
00:55:52,242 --> 00:55:56,011
- They're our wizards in training.
- Mmm. Yep.

841
00:55:56,012 --> 00:56:00,316
All right. Look, guys, there's gonna
be a lot of work ahead of you.

842
00:56:00,317 --> 00:56:02,802
And it won't really be easy.

843
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:06,996
And one day, only one of you will
get to become The Family Wizard,

844
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:10,917
but until then, the most important
thing to remember is...

845
00:56:10,918 --> 00:56:16,138
Have as much ridiculous fun
with magic as you can.

846
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:23,172
All right. Guys, this has been a great
trip but there's no place like home.

847
00:56:23,173 --> 00:56:25,453
Let's go.

848
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:28,244
Uh, hang on, Harper.

849
00:56:28,245 --> 00:56:31,580
What happened in here?! The kitchen!
My couch!

850
00:56:31,581 --> 00:56:33,405
Alex!

851
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:37,906
I think we should stay in Italy a while.

852
00:56:38,642 --> 00:56:40,682
Action!

853
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:44,664
You say, "here we go".

854
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:45,732
What?

855
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:47,801
- You say, "oh, here we go".
- Oh.

856
00:56:47,802 --> 00:56:49,842
Action!

857
00:56:50,738 --> 00:56:52,778
Action!

858
00:56:54,317 --> 00:56:55,319
Action!

859
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,138
I still don't like the way we got here.

860
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:01,379
But they're feeding us.

861
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,820
Your own personal drive-in?!

862
00:57:10,074 --> 00:57:12,185
What? What did I do?

863
00:57:12,186 --> 00:57:15,455
Come on, dad. I-I... I spit popcorn.
I'm sorry. Ok.

864
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:19,392
I don't know how to say wizard...

865
00:57:19,393 --> 00:57:23,129
I got an invitation from
my cousin, Carmela,

866
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:27,390
in Italy, inviting us to a re-usso...

867
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:29,269
Russo.

868
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:35,090
I got an invitation in Italy
for a re-usso family reunion.

869
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:42,182
A while ago, I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela, in Italy...

870
00:57:42,183 --> 00:57:46,152
I got an invitation from
my cousin, Carmela,

871
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:49,489
in Italy, inviting us to a re-usso...

872
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,656
I'm not doing it!

873
00:57:51,657 --> 00:57:57,557
