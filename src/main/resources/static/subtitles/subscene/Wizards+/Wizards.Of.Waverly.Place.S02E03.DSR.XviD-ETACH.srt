1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,542
With my brave knight and
my hello pony blankie,

2
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:13,463
The faster we go, the safer I feel.

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:24,276
Oh, sweet, shining alex,
thou art the bomb.

4
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:27,243
Right back at thou.

5
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,177
Oops.

6
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,319
You dropped your blankie, milady.

7
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,823
Take it. It shall keep thee cozy.

8
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:42,861
hey, justin. Why don't we invent an
edible flaming sandwich for kids?

9
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:46,096
because I think most kids
like having their eyebrows.

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,496
- Oh.
- Halt! Who goes there?

11
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:49,664
I shall never let
danger touch milady.

12
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:51,665
Not danger. Dorks.

13
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:57,271
No one must know that I crush on thee.
I'm sorry, knight,

14
00:00:57,305 --> 00:01:00,273
But I must bid thee... Later.

15
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,642
Literarium terrarium.

16
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,345
I'm telling you,
there has got to be a way

17
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:14,014
To put something on fire in
my mouth without it hurting.

18
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,416
What are you doing in here?

19
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,952
What does it look like
I'm doing in here?

20
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:25,255
Uh... Trying to come up with an
answer to the question I just asked.

21
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:29,426
Ok, you got me.
You win. Nice going.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,661
Heh-heh. We won.
I feel pretty good about that.

23
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:35,264
- She's up to something.
- Yeah, we never win.

24
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:38,260
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

25
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:40,192
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,493
* you can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

27
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,227
* yes, please *

28
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,062
* well, you might find out
it'll go to your head *

29
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:48,031
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

30
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,500
* with a snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

31
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:52,234
* that's what I said *

32
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:55,204
* everything is not what it seems *

33
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:58,973
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

34
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:02,808
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

35
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:07,043
* because everything
is not what it seems *

36
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,513
* everything is not what it seems *

37
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:14,415
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

38
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,152
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

39
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:21,120
* because everything is not *

40
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:24,089
* what it seems *

41
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,490

42
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:30,578
Alex, look! There's dean,
that guy you like.

43
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:35,615
Should I get you a bullhorn so you
can announce it to the whole school?

44
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:39,151
I don't want anyone to know. - Sorry,
but I just don't know what you see in dean.

45
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:43,020
He's dangerous. He gives temporary
tattoos in the boys' bathroom!

46
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:49,260
- Hey, dean.
- What's up?

47
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,696
So, I hear your temporary tattoo
business has really taken off.

48
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,765
Hey, joey, show her my portfolio.

49
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,367
Bam!

50
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:01,170
Hm. So, do you ever give
those to cute girls?

51
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:03,805
What cute girl are
you thinking about?

52
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,273
Harper.

53
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:11,644
Uh, she's totally into it.
We'll get back to you on that, ok?

54
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:17,882
I don't care how much you have a crush on
him. I'm not getting a temporary tattoo
from dean!

55
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:20,083
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
I just panicked.

56
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:25,187
What do you see in him,
anyway? He had a mustache all summer!

57
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:28,523
Alex, red alert. Gigi and the
wannabes are heading this way.

58
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:36,463
I can't believe it. It's after second
period and I haven't humiliated anyone
today.

59
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:42,067
Look. Hey, everyone. Laura moloney is
moving into andy hollenbeck's locker.

60
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:43,902
They're totally going out.

61
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:45,603
We're just lab partners.

62
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,404
We're just lab partners?

63
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,472
You are embarrassed to
be going out with me.

64
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,040
That's it. We're done.

65
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:59,079
It's sick. It's like gigi gets a thrill out
of humiliating people just 'cause they like
someone.

66
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,115
See? This is why no one can
know I have a crush on dean.

67
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:04,650
He doesn't have a bedtime!

68
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:07,418
I'm sorry. You just say his
name and these things pop up.

69
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:12,288
Guess what, alex? We're having
a sleepover at cindy's tonight.

70
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,223
And like always,
you're not invited.

71
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,992
Gigi, how many times are you
gonna not invite me to something

72
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:18,727
Before you realize I don't care?

73
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,795
Well, if you don't care so much,
why did you crank call us last time?

74
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,598
You can't prove that was me.

75
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,234
Hey, justin, look what
I found in the lair.

76
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,769
Alex has a book with hundreds
of drawings she made.

77
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,205
That's lame. - Yeah.
Almost as lame as that book you have

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,674
With the pictures of that
weather lady from channel nine.

79
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:43,310
Her name is wendy leonard,
and her forecasts are extremely accurate.

80
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,347
You know what?

81
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:50,750
Dude, this isn't a book.
This is a magic journal.

82
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:54,019
Alex has drawn herself an entire
fairy tale world that she lives in!

83
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:57,155
Dude, she uses the literarium
terrarium spell to go inside of it!

84
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,591
Wow. Look at all this
embarrassing princess-y stuff.

85
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:03,194
Who knew alex was such a girl?

86
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,297
It is pretty shocking.

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,868
Oh, my gosh. There's gigi.

88
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:13,402
Oh, brother.

89
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:17,973
I usually don't notice girls
with soft, shiny hair,

90
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,974
But it's like a field
of gold up there.

91
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,977
Ok, dude, whatever you do,
don't show this to gigi.

92
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:26,280
If alex didn't want us to see it,
there's no way she wants gigi to see it.

93
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:29,149
Justin. Hi, max.
What you got there?

94
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:32,886
It's alex's secret journal and pictures.
She's created drawings. Look.

95
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:37,224
Like I said, don't show it to gigi!

96
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,662
But justin, we hate alex
and gigi hates alex,

97
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:41,464
So don't we want
to give it to gigi?

98
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:44,101
There's a difference between
family hate and people hate.

99
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,069
If someone in your family hates someone,
you're supposed to, too.

100
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:50,237
Oh, I get it. Then I hate pumpkin
pie so you hate pumpkin pie.

101
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,105
You know I love pumpkin pie!

102
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:56,109
Max, could you carry
my books for me?

103
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,811
Yes!

104
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:00,146
Can I brush your hair, too?

105
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:03,516
Is that weird?

106
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,119
Yeah.

107
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:08,654
It is, actually. That's ok.
I'll take my books back.

108
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:12,391
Max, she just took alex's journal.
Oh, did I?

109
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:14,694
I see it right there,
so I'm just gonna take it back.

110
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,030
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Just hand it to me.

111
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:19,665
- I'm popular so I can keep the book.
- Voice is being raised.

112
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,869
- I get everything I want.
- Oh, whoa, max!

113
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:25,270
I don't have my gym clothes on.
Go get her!

114
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:29,039
Literarium terrarium!

115
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:38,480
I got the book back. - Now how are
we gonna get her out of the book?

116
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:42,349
Hey, I got the book back. Now you've
got to start pulling some weight.

117
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:45,952
Hello?

118
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:47,353
Hello!

119
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:48,788
Is anybody here?

120
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:01,366
"alex's blankie?"

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,668
Where am I?

122
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,941
You're in alex's journal.

123
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:10,977
I'm in alex's journal?

124
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:14,314
Ok, I thought I was just reading
alex's journal. - Right.

125
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:16,816
You're reading alex's journal.

126
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,686
I'm alex's teddy bear.

127
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:26,693
Stay on the pathways, and if you see any
stuffing that looks like this, it's mine.

128
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,129
I'm so glad alex erased that dog.

129
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,700
Ok, she has a teddy
bear and a blankie?

130
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:36,068
She's not as tough as she
wants everyone to think.

131
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:37,970
What else does she have in here?

132
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:39,639
All her secrets.

133
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:42,408
Oh, I'm so gonna keep reading.

134
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,944
The school's gonna love
hearing stories about alex

135
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:46,679
That I don't have to make up.

136
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:49,215
You know what I'd love?
Some fiberfill.

137
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,918
If you see alex,
tell her to draw me some.

138
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,453
And maybe a hot tub.

139
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,089
Wouldn't you just get
all wet and soggy?

140
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,824
Hey, that's my problem.

141
00:07:57,859 --> 00:07:59,493
Just mention it to her.

142
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:10,837
Hey, check out the wannabes.

143
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,338
They're totally lost without gigi.

144
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,374
Here's our chance
to mess with them.

145
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,544
Hey, guys, where's gigi?

146
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,746
We don't know where gigi is.

147
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:25,983
Oh. Well, she's probably off getting
a jump on the new fashion trend...

148
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:29,152
...Wearing shoes on your hands.

149
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:32,254
And, uh, you guys should probably
do it too, or she'll get mad.

150
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:34,789
Oh, thanks, alex.

151
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,694
For an enemy, you are a lifesaver.

152
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:42,097
Just because we're enemies
doesn't mean we don't care.

153
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:46,201
Yeah, thanks.

154
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:49,638
Gigi's also off getting
her head shaved.

155
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,306
Do with that what you will.

156
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:02,280
Yeah, right. How do we get
gigi out of the magic journal

157
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:05,484
Without letting her know that
there is a magic journal?

158
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:08,287
Well, I've given this
a lot of thought.

159
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:10,189
Perfect. What do you got?

160
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:12,658
That's it.

161
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:18,129
- We gotta buy ourselves some time.
- Yes, yes, um...

162
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:20,898
Where's a good hiding spot
for the journal? - I got it.

163
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:24,701
You know how dad can always stare into the
fridge and never find the mustard bottle?

164
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,769
He's, "we're out.
I can't make a sandwich!"

165
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:29,939
And then mom's like, "
it's right in front of your eyes, jer."

166
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:31,606
Oh, yeah, yes!

167
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:36,010
So we'll use magic to turn alex's
book into dad's squeezable mustard!

168
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,480
No.

169
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:41,615
We gotta hide the
journal in plain sight.

170
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,418
Aw, man, I was hoping we
could use a spell like...

171
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,054
...Like bookus mustardo.

172
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,626
Alex always steers
clear of a bookshelf,

173
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,696
Plus, boom, it'll blend right in.
She'll never know.

174
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,598
I think that's alex.
Act natural, act natural.

175
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:07,037
Hey, guys. Did you notice that
gigi left school early today?

176
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:10,073
I kind of missed her. Especially in pe.
We started dodgeball.

177
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:13,009
And why is my journal on
the bookshelf by the door?

178
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:16,745
- How did you see that?
- I knew it wouldn't work.

179
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:19,714
Bookus mustardo! Bookus mustardo!
Bookus mustardo!

180
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:22,083
You guys are toast.

181
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:24,419
My journal is for my eyes only.
What do you know?

182
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,722
That you have a crush on
dean "the tattoo" moriarty.

183
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,692
I do not!

184
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:32,260
And that we accidentally
trapped gigi in there.

185
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:33,595
What?

186
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,396
Gigi's in my journal?

187
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,165
This is unbelievable.
This is my worst nightmare.

188
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:41,702
All of my secrets are there and now gigi's
gonna know that I have a crush on dean.

189
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:43,036
Knew it!

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,577
Gigi hasn't talked to the knight who looks
like dean so she doesn't know about my
crush.

191
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,480
I'm gonna go get her out before
she meets him. - No, you can't.

192
00:10:57,516 --> 00:10:59,917
She'll tell everyone she
was in a magical journal.

193
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:03,319
They'll know we're wizards. - What do you
want me to do, leave her there forever?

194
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,588
No! No, just give me some time to figure
out how to explain this to her when she
gets out.

195
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,592
Fine. I'll give you one day.

196
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,860
In the meantime,
nobody opens this book.

197
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:16,230
As long as this book stays closed,
everything in my fantasy world freezes.

198
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:18,966
I won't let her find out
any of my other secrets.

199
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:20,701
- Like...
- Max, stop it!

200
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:33,178
Listen... Nobody's crying!

201
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:35,814
Gigi must not be in school again!

202
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:40,150
Well, something tells me her
schedule must have been booked.

203
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:42,486
That she's in a real binding.

204
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,088
That she may be starting a
new chapter in her life.

205
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,857
Why are you talking like that?

206
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:50,291
Oh, it's really clever if you knew.

207
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,893
Hey!

208
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,431
I mean... That's good...

209
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:03,734
...That you did what
gigi wanted you to do.

210
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:05,635
I didn't think they'd do it.

211
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:10,005
Gigi also told me she wants
you guys to wear yarn wigs.

212
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,473
Yarn wigs?

213
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:14,509
They exist. I can show
you how to make them.

214
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:17,044
Now, that one you're
just making up.

215
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:19,612
That's ridiculous.
Gigi would never say that.

216
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,314
She hates yarn.

217
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:23,080
How can you hate yarn?

218
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:26,183
I wear a lot of yarn.
Then again, gigi hates me.

219
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,651
It all makes sense now!

220
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:38,257
Hey, justin, so I was looking at alex's
journal... - Where did yofind that?

221
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,159
- She hid it in my hamper.
- Genius.

222
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:46,496
You never open that thing. - I know. I
tripped over some clothes and I fell on it.

223
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,864
Oh, quick. Alex is coming.
Hide it in plain sight.

224
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,570
Hey, guys, what's up?

225
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:57,504
it's working.

226
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:02,841
No, it's not working.
What are you doing with my journal?

227
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:04,809
I peeked.

228
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:06,510
You opened it?

229
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,645
That's what "peeked" means.

230
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:13,216
Oh, no. Gigi's riding with
my knight on his motorcycle.

231
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,051
He has his helmet on.
She doesn't know he looks like dean.

232
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:19,387
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go in there and
get her out before she finds out.

233
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,488
- Literarium...
- No, alex, you can't.

234
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:23,822
I haven't figured out how to
keep her from exposing us.

235
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:27,391
Yeah, well, gigi finding out about dean
is worse than finding out about magic.

236
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:30,726
- Really?
- No, but it's important to me.

237
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,160
Literarium terrarium.

238
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:38,861
Ok, we gotta get going.
We gotta keep her from exposing magic.

239
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,031
Literarium terrarium.

240
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:50,937
- No, alex, stop. What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to stop gigi.

241
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:54,073
Here. Hold my veil. I don't want
it to get caught in the catapult.

242
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:03,581
- That was close.
- It wasn't that close enough!

243
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:06,584
Alex, as much as that was like,
totally awesome...

244
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:10,122
Did you see that! It was like,
swoosh...!

245
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:16,831
It's not the right way to
deal with the situation.

246
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,602
Well, I've got to stop her before she finds
out I drew the knight to look like dean.

247
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:23,038
Hey, I could joust her for him.

248
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:27,308
Then, when I win, we could ride off
in the sunset and she'll never know.

249
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:31,245
Joust? - Yeah. I've got jousting
stuff in the jousting shed.

250
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,982
Oh. Your fantasy world
involves a lot of sharp metal.

251
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:35,817
- Oh, thank you.
- Welcome.

252
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,355
Ok.

253
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:47,698
Let's take our mount and
chase down that evil gigi

254
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:50,167
Before she unveils the
knight's true identity.

255
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:55,871
- Hold on.
- Onward, my loyal bros.

256
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:59,574
What are you doing? - This is how I
talk when I'm in my fantasy world.

257
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,277
Oh, how awesome are thou and thee.

258
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,613
See, this is why I
never draw you here.

259
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:13,786
- Oh, there she is!
- drive faster!

260
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,655
- I don't know the speed limit.
- Well, it's faster than this.

261
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,323
My teddy bear's about to pass us.

262
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:22,994
Stop! Stop! My stuffing's
caught in your chain.

263
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:35,372
Pull over! Pull over, my unfair maiden,
and hand me back my blankie!

264
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,078
Oh, alex, your journal
is so beautiful.

265
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:44,080
- Thank you.
- And revealing.

266
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:48,017
I've seen your hello pony blanket,
I've seen your teddy bear.

267
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:51,990
I can't wait to see who the knight you're
crushing on is. - No, you're not gonna see
him.

268
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:54,259
Because I challenge thou to a duel.

269
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:58,930
A joust of sorts.
Well, actually, it is a joust.

270
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:02,300
Whoever knocks the other off her iron
steed rides away with the knight,

271
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,669
Sir lord of cuteness.

272
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:07,037
Fine. Give me a lance
and I'll joust you.

273
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:08,906
I've got one for you.

274
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,678
- And a helmet for safety.
- Ow!

275
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:17,682
Should have given you
the shin guards first.

276
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,008
We should move or we're
gonna be shish-kabob.

277
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:45,144
Are those the sticks with beef
or the sticks with chicken?

278
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,114
It's meat with a stick through it.

279
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,251
- Oh.
- Come on.

280
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:03,996
Whoo!

281
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:06,598
Yes! Whoo!

282
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,100
It was great!

283
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:13,004
Knight, knight! Let us
ride off into the sunset.

284
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,807
- Not before a kiss.
- It's dean!

285
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:19,611
It's dean!
Alex has a crush on dean!

286
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:21,947
What? That is not dean!

287
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,416
Dean is a lot taller than that.

288
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:26,386
And his eyes aren't
even that color.

289
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:28,956
Not just because I ran out
of that color pencil, either.

290
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:31,727
Dean's eyes are blue or blue-green,
depending on the light.

291
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,664
A beautiful blue-green.

292
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:37,002
Ow! Something bit my toe.

293
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:40,439
- Oh, those would be toe leeches.
- Toe leeches?

294
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:44,410
It's my book. They started out as smudges,
but then I made them into something.

295
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:46,345
Get me out of here!

296
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,080
Oh, anything for you, my love.

297
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:50,014
Literarium terrarium.

298
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,082
What did you just do?

299
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:55,151
- She wanted to get out.
- Of the pond!

300
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:57,387
She's gonna tell everyone
that we're wizards.

301
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:59,655
Forget about that.
What about my crush on dean?

302
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:02,725
You gotta get over this kid.
He doesn't even have a library card!

303
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,627
- Well, neither do I.
- Yes, you do.

304
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:07,595
I signed you up for on

305
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,766
Oh, hey, gigi. The wannabes
have been looking for you.

306
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,534
Ah! Here it is. Alex's journal.

307
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:21,670
That's alex's journal?
You better not look in there.

308
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,907
Welli already did,
and I've seen everything.

309
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,275
It's amazingly vivid.

310
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:33,311
Gigi! Last thing you remembered,

311
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,445
We were chasing after you
to get alex's journal,

312
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,814
When you fell and
bumped your head. Boop!

313
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,783
You were completely passed out,
talking all kinds of nonsense

314
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:43,917
About being trapped
in a medieval world.

315
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:47,718
But really you just had
a horrible concussion.

316
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:51,520
And you, you were there.
And he was there.

317
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:54,923
D I... Was there.

318
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,224
What? I thought I was just
reading alex's journal

319
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,992
And everything was totally vivid.

320
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:02,795
That's exactly what
I'm trying to say.

321
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,065
- Gigi, give me back my journal.
- No. Alex, you are so burned.

322
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:11,102
Listen up, everyone.

323
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,671
I found out at miss
"too cool to care" alex

324
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:16,206
Has a journal full of
embarrassing secrets.

325
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,708
- She's making this up.
- No, she's telling the truth.

326
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,277
What are you doing? - I'm not
gonna give her the satisfaction.

327
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:27,780
Ok, so gigi saw my journal.

328
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:32,483
Where I draw pictures of
myself living like a princess

329
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:37,454
In a castle with my hello
pony blankie, my teddy bear

330
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:40,389
And a handsome knight who sure
looks a little bit like dean.

331
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,391
But it could have en anybody.

332
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,125
Oh, no, it could not have.

333
00:19:46,428 --> 00:19:48,962
See? Alex has a crush
on dean moriarty!

334
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:52,532
Hey, I have a journal
with secrets in it.

335
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,868
I'll admit it. I like
prending I'm a princess.

336
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:59,137
But I'm also the kind of girl who
wouldn't be caught dead at prom,

337
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:01,972
Unless it was a zombie prom and
we all dressed up like zombies.

338
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:05,508
Oh, my gosh. I would so be
on the committee for that.

339
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:10,478
Bottom line, I'm hard to
figure out. Deal with it.

340
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:14,714
Yeah, and I have acrapbook with pictures
of the weather lady from channel nine.

341
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:17,150
Deal with that!

342
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,585
Seriously, you should keep that to yourself,
but thanks for trying.

343
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:30,757
Ok, so from this point on, everybody in
this school is done being humiliated by
gigi.

344
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:32,959
- Who's with me? Come on!
- I am!

345
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,416
This is still my school.
Clear the halls.

346
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:53,526
- Hi.
- Sorry if I embarrassed you.

347
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,728
Nope. I liked it.

348
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:58,062
The way you drew me,
I look pretty ripped.

349
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:01,164
That's because you are ripped,
dean, yeah! - Oh, yeah!

350
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:04,734
Thanks, guys.

351
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:08,402
Gigi thought it looked like you,
but I'm not that great of an artist.

352
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:12,136
I think you're pretty good,
russo. - At drawing?

353
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,570
If that's what you want
to be talking about.

354
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,371
Then, sure.

355
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:23,075
Nicely done, alex.

356
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,176
It always pays to be
proud of who you are.

357
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:28,811
I mean, that's what I do and
everyone respects me for it.

358
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,046
I respect you.

359
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,879
I justamily hate you.

360
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:34,881
I can live with that.

361
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:36,782
You kinda have to.

362
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:39,149
I know.

363
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:47,915
I'm ready for my temporary
tattoo. Just do it!

364
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:51,085
Harper, I told you, you didn't have
to do this if you didn't want to.

365
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,186
No, I have to prove
something to myself.

366
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:56,389
I have to conquer my fear.
Do it, dean, just do it.

367
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:58,757
He plays video games
with parental warnings!

368
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:02,427
Oh, it's so cold.
Get it off, get it off!

369
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:06,196
No, come on, come on.
Two more seconds, two more seconds.

370
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,798
And we're done.

371
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,500
Does it make me look too tough?

372
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:14,536
I don't know. It's the
first unicorn I've done.

373
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:18,072
Nah, I think it looks good.

374
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:21,409
Dean, you said I could
have the unicorn!

375
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:30,410
