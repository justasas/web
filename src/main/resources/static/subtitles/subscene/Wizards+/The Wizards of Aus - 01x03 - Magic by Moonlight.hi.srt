1
00:00:00,675 --> 00:00:04,327
(sad piano music)

2
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,369
(screams)

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,565
- Well that's rich!

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:10,911
That is rich!

5
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:12,245
And that it's then, we're just done?

6
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,184
OK, throw it all the way, whatever.

7
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:15,291
Is this about the money?

8
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:16,492
Well, excuse me, princess.

9
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:19,127
Excuse me that I wasn't raised on a diet

10
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:21,930
of jewels and gold and hay!

11
00:00:22,842 --> 00:00:24,315
(explosion)

12
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,218
I bet he's everything I'm not.

13
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,714
I'm sorry, I'm not a powerful quadruped.

14
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:30,820
I'm sorry I don't have an ivory tusk

15
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:32,705
growing out of my forehead.

16
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:35,062
- [Irene] This has been
a long time coming, Jack.

17
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:35,938
You know that.

18
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,113
- I bet he takes a long time coming.

19
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:39,314
- [Irene] You're being juvenile.

20
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,126
(flaps lips)

21
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:42,685
My parents are in the
next room, they can hear.

22
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:44,148
- I want them to hear!

23
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,655
La, la, la...

24
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:47,448
- [Horse Dad] Perhaps we should go, dear.

25
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,960
- [Horse Mom] But there's
still so much quiche!

26
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:51,196
(Jack growls loudly)

27
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:54,990
- That's it, isn't it?

28
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,974
I'm just not man enough for you.

29
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:59,566
- [Irene] It's not that
you're not man enough, Jack.

30
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,892
He's just all horse.

31
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:03,609
- We could've made this work, you know?

32
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,324
But typical you, typical naysayer,

33
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:08,940
you naysayer, all you say is "Nay!"

34
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:12,277
(makes neighing sound)

35
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:14,731
(flaps lips)

36
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:21,529
(wheezes)

37
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,389
(makes neighing sound)

38
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:33,122
- [Irene] It's done, I've told him.

39
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:34,412
I'm coming over now.

40
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:38,001
- Irene!

41
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:40,300
I'm sorry, come back!

42
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,792
Come back!

43
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,203
Come back!

44
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,507
Come back, Irene.

45
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:47,443
(sniffles)

46
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:48,873
Come back.

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,764
(makes neighing sound)

48
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:54,790
(yawns)

49
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:01,038
- Well, this is a sad sight.

50
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,084
Waking up alone again!

51
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:05,802
- Well, you're never really alone

52
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:09,267
with a living portrait dead
Dad watching you sleep.

53
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:11,036
- It's that kind of
attitude that makes you

54
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,007
such a disappointment.

55
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,655
I didn't hatch you from an egg

56
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,001
just for you to end the bloodline.

57
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:19,891
Find yourself a lady, son.

58
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,279
Start using your magic again.

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,651
There's nothing women
respect more than a magician.

60
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:25,331
- Dad!

61
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:27,603
- [Regimand] Before I was
confined to this living hell,

62
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:30,819
there wasn't a night I went
without a woman's touch.

63
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,882
- Well that's nice, Dad.

64
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:34,144
- And now, look at me! Oh!

65
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,439
Two-thirds of the man I once was,

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,889
having lost an entire dimension.

67
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,656
When I opted to be
immortalized in oil and canvas,

68
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:45,198
I thought I was cementing my legacy.

69
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,997
And now I pray for death!

70
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:48,707
(door closes)

71
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,479
(phone ringing)

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,453
- How about going on a date?

73
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:53,386
- Excuse me?

74
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:54,854
Yes, absolutely, please.

75
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:55,664
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

76
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,339
Not with me, with someone else.

77
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,862
- (laughs) And I was joking.

78
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:01,938
Yeah, I find you fucking
repulsive. (chuckles)

79
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:02,803
- Outstanding!

80
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:05,141
Well, dating is a really
great way to meet new people

81
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:07,710
and to get a fresh perspective
on your new community.

82
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,451
Have you had much dating experience?

83
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,562
- Yeah, sure.

84
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:13,057
Back home, I used to slay,

85
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,900
uh, giants, I was a giantslayer.

86
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,459
You slay a giant, women just
throw themselves at you,

87
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,450
often from a catapult or a trebuchet.

88
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:20,671
(Kylie laughs)

89
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,916
- What is romance even
like, where you're from?

90
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:27,738
Is there much dating within
the wizard community?

91
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:31,392
- Well, um, dating other wizards is tough

92
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:33,243
because once two wizards
hook up, it's for life.

93
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:36,126
As in, it's the end of your life, you die.

94
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:39,126
Once those wiz lips make
contact, you kind of

95
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:43,224
boil away into this frothy,
gelatinous sex ball.

96
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:44,860
It's gross.

97
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,194
Like beautiful,

98
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:48,364
but like, super gross.

99
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:50,838
I have never known such bliss.

100
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,429
But, um, other, other
creatures in the realm?

101
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,318
Totally fair game.

102
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,656
Um. (chuckles)

103
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,886
Once I was engaged to this elven chick.

104
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,373
(ethereal harp music)

105
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:05,138
My beloved, Lady Caroliniana,

106
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,062
would you make me the happiest wizard

107
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:11,800
from the Astral Sea to the Woodland Row?

108
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,180
- Oh, Jack.

109
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:15,100
You offer me this ring.

110
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,547
Well, of course, I'll take it,

111
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,249
and in place of your girlfriend,

112
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,413
I would become your wife!

113
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:24,743
(scary instrumental music)

114
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:26,684
(background noise drowns out other sounds)

115
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:30,381
A wife more powerful than the lightning!

116
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:33,648
More treacherous than the ocean blue!

117
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:38,095
And you, you will love me and despair.

118
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:45,174
(footsteps)

119
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:51,615
- (chuckles) So that didn't work out.

120
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:56,861
Eventually, I did marry, but um...

121
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:03,803
(horse neighing)

122
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,030
I think it's time to move on.

123
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,507
- Attaboy.

124
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,942
As they say, once you fall off the horse,

125
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,677
you just need to get right back on again.

126
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:14,861
So let's get you back in the saddle.

127
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:17,188
Uh, and who knows, we may even find you a

128
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,390
stable relationship,

129
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,590
(horses neighing)

130
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,132
or you could just horse around a bit.

131
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,315
(Jack groaning continuously)

132
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:24,561
You OK, Jack?

133
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,562
- Yep!

134
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:27,244
- All right, let's go, giddy up!

135
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:28,701
- I used to fuck a horse.

136
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:29,165
- What?

137
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,619
- Nothing! Let's go. (groans loudly)

138
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:39,637
This place is cool.

139
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:41,448
- Uh, Jack, no, it isn't.

140
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:44,968
But hey, speed dating is new for me, too.

141
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,853
You'll be fine, don't be nervous.

142
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:49,175
- Well, good thing I'm not nervous.

143
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:50,905
(burning)

144
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:55,245
- Uh, your forehead doesn't agree.

145
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:56,329
- What?

146
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,113
Oh, shit!

147
00:05:57,114 --> 00:05:59,563
Um yeah, uh sorry, uh...

148
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:01,236
When I was young, my
Dad put a curse on me,

149
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,167
so that if I lied or was nervous,

150
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:04,992
my face would kind of give it away.

151
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:06,314
- Well, if you'd just owned up

152
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,081
to eating all the boiled turtle,

153
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:09,581
I wouldn't have had to!

154
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:11,090
- But you ate the turtle!

155
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:14,109
- As the saying goes, "A turt in the tum,

156
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,551
"no harm done."

157
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:16,852
- No one's ever said that.

158
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:19,036
- Well I just said it, didn't I?

159
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:21,118
Well, well, well.

160
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:24,242
Who is this ravishing creature?

161
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,195
Mm-hmm.

162
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:26,617
(thumping)

163
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,999
Allow me to introduce myself.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,427
I am Regimand the Wise,

165
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,589
and Well-Hung.

166
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,926
- Hey, Jack.

167
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:38,647
Cool dad.

168
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,170
(bell ringing)

169
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:41,671
Oh, would you look at
that, we're about to start.

170
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:42,672
Good luck.

171
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:45,871
- Hey, um Dad,

172
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,050
could you fuck off?

173
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:48,490
- Don't worry, son.

174
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,441
I'll just finish my drink
and get out of your beard.

175
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:54,431
(splash)

176
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:56,156
Watercolor?

177
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:57,786
Watercolor!

178
00:06:57,787 --> 00:06:58,787
Gross!

179
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,088
(painting clatters)

180
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,318
(bell ringing)

181
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,259
- Ring-a-ding-a-dingle!

182
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,838
Who wants a flingle? (giggles)

183
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,321
The name of the game is
speed, guys and girls,

184
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:11,828
so let's get to it!

185
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,929
(forceful drum music)

186
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:18,146
(relaxing pop music)

187
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,548
- (chuckles) Hi.

188
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,943
- Hi, hi!

189
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,935
Hi, I'm Jack.

190
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:32,761
- I know, it's on your tag.

191
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:33,989
- Oh, well um...

192
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,587
Literacy is a very attractive
quality in a human female.

193
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,961
You are Anna, just looking at the tag,

194
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:42,297
not the chest

195
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:43,298
yet.

196
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:47,254
Uh, I hope to, but we'll
cross that bridge when we come

197
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:48,255
to it.

198
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:51,311
So, what do you do?

199
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,056
- Well, I'm studying to be an accountant.

200
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,611
- Oh, accountancy, that's interesting.

201
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,258
(burning)

202
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:03,692
And, uh, you look lovely,
by the way, you look great.

203
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,265
(burning)

204
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:07,966
- Thanks.

205
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:10,291
- You're welcome.

206
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,842
- So, what do you do for fun?

207
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:13,378
- Fun?

208
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:13,997
Ah, fun!

209
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:15,604
I uh, well, I like to read.

210
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:16,916
(burning)

211
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,869
I like to watch television
with my friends.

212
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,959
(burning)

213
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,002
I like to garden.

214
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,479
(burning)

215
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:30,204
- Cool.

216
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:30,728
- Yeah.

217
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,711
- So, speed dating.

218
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,416
What are you hoping to get out of it?

219
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:39,221
- I just, I just want to
find somebody who's fun.

220
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:40,658
(burning)

221
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,185
- You're a pig.

222
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,704
- I'm actually a waterproof man.

223
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,702
(bell ringing)

224
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:58,884
- Wow, smooth.

225
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,769
- Guess I'm a bit rusty,

226
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,786
which is ironic, as I can't get wet.

227
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:07,275
Hey, um, I think I'm just gonna go,

228
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,483
but thank you very much.

229
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:10,310
This was awful.
- [Kylie] Oy.

230
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:12,734
- [Kylie] I never pegged
you for a quitter.

231
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:14,045
Come on, Jack, hustle.

232
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,941
Here, drink this.

233
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:18,877
(triumphant choir singing)

234
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:21,130
- Is it, uh, like a potion?

235
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:22,375
- No, you fucking idiot.

236
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:23,155
It's a beer.

237
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,698
It'll take the edge off and sort out that,

238
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,794
that business.

239
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,056
- OK.

240
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:31,749
(lively instrumental music)

241
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,933
- [Kylie] No, no, no, no, drink.

242
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,547
(crunching)

243
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:38,131
(funny electronic music)

244
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:41,402
- [Kylie] Good?

245
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:43,134
- Fucking sick.

246
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:45,195
(funny electronic music)

247
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:47,297
(gulping)

248
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:48,207
- [Kylie] Good?

249
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,727
(gulping)

250
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:53,217
(funny electronic music)

251
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:57,648
(burps loudly)

252
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:58,649
(sniffs)

253
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,810
(burps)

254
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:06,177
- Hi there.

255
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:07,398
- Hello.

256
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,172
(roar then bird chirping)

257
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:09,172
- Oh.

258
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:11,502
I knew it!

259
00:10:11,503 --> 00:10:13,153
You are a wizard.

260
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,711
- Guilty as charged.

261
00:10:14,712 --> 00:10:17,221
- That is so weird, there's
another magic guy here.

262
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:17,949
- Wait, what, really?

263
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,370
- Yeah.

264
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:19,668
- A more rousing tale,

265
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,349
I was snoozing as I was wont
to do in my sarcophagus.

266
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,961
I was rather a lazy bones in those days.

267
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:28,423
Lo and behold, the lid is
lifted and who should it be,

268
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:29,813
but Brendan Fraser.

269
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:32,995
He was researching his
role for the upcoming movie

270
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,500
at the time, Monkeybone,

271
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,291
the Hollywood sensation.

272
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,556
Then we, together, came to the conclusion

273
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:40,669
that we should bury all the slaves alive.

274
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,207
- [Waiter] You guys asked for drinks?

275
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,603
- You dare interrupt Lord Mummy?

276
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:49,851
Stare into my amulet!

277
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,028
(Waiter screams)

278
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,968
(gong)

279
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:57,768
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

280
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:03,148
- As I was saying, monkey bones.

281
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,871
Basically, they're
delicious with anything.

282
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:08,114
I have a bone salad, personally,

283
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:10,854
you toast the bones lightly under a grill,

284
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:14,534
and then arrange them
smoothly on cos lettuce

285
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:17,683
with a drizzle of
mayonnaise on top of that.

286
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,589
- Mummy mia, right?

287
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,905
(laughs)

288
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:21,505
(laughs nervously)

289
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,000
- And maybe some anchovies

290
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,859
if that's your pleasure.

291
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,386
I personally don't appreciate the salt.

292
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,907
- Anyway, tell me, what was it like

293
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,709
growing up in the wizard realm?

294
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,410
- Pretty normal.

295
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:33,705
Uh, Dad frothed himself into a sex ball,

296
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:34,752
hatched me from an egg.

297
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:37,331
Now he's dead and lives in a painting.

298
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:38,021
Oh there he is.

299
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:42,275
- You look about as
desperate as I am. (chuckles)

300
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,394
- Yeah, boring, don't care.

301
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:47,601
Impress me, magic man.

302
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:48,798
Show me a trick.

303
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,298
- Ah well, uh, the thing about my magic

304
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,400
is that I don't do any.

305
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:55,428
- Excuse me?

306
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:57,810
- I'm under a self-imposed abstinence.

307
00:11:57,811 --> 00:11:58,832
- You're abstinent?

308
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,177
- Magically, yes.

309
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,302
Sexually, I'm open for business.

310
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:03,849
- And how is business?

311
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,073
- It is miserable.

312
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:09,026
(bell ringing)

313
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:10,256
- Yeah, good call.

314
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,362
- A quick date is a good date!

315
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:16,569
So long as he isn't quick
where it counts, hey ladies?

316
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,144
Talk about come. (chuckles)

317
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,071
(funny electronic music)

318
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:28,782
- Then and they all died,

319
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:31,240
and that's why I've never been employed.

320
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:35,098
(heartfelt acoustic guitar music)

321
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,891
Hey, do you want to see some magic?

322
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,184
- I heard you don't do that anymore.

323
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,025
- Shh, shh, don't tell Jack.

324
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,398
(laughs)

325
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,399
- OK.

326
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:45,653
- OK!

327
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:48,427
I noticed that your
glass, it is very empty.

328
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:50,717
Would you like it to be very full?

329
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:51,591
- Yes.

330
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:52,534
- OK!

331
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:53,522
(gurgling)

332
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,522
- Oh!

333
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:56,649
What?
(gurgling)

334
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,751
(exclaims in disgust)

335
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:01,922
- Yeah?

336
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,540
- Gross. (laughs)

337
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,861
That's gross!

338
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,059
- I find things gross.
(gurgling)

339
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,717
Um, hey, grab that water, throw it at me.

340
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:16,617
(splash)

341
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:20,923
- [Mummy] Who dares (mumbles) Lord Mummy?

342
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:22,733
- OK, I have one more trick.

343
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:28,076
Hello! Bonjour!

344
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:29,405
- Yes, sir?

345
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,307
- [Regimand] Bonsoir.

346
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,915
- This lady would like a,

347
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:33,946
this lady would like a...

348
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,337
- Oh, this lady would like a pint, thanks.

349
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:38,953
- Oh, one pint for the
lovely lady, bartender,

350
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,925
two pints, um, deux pints.

351
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,983
I'm speaking in French.

352
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:44,825
- Yeah, sure, no worries.

353
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,032
- Au revoir!

354
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,419
(giggles)

355
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:54,330
- You know, I never expected to meet

356
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,193
anybody interesting here,

357
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:58,125
and I've been pleasantly mistaken.

358
00:13:58,126 --> 00:13:59,619
- Oh, me too, you know?

359
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,603
This is actually fun.

360
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,133
Um but, just anything you want,

361
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,145
anywhere you wanna go, we can do it.

362
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,545
Magic!

363
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,916
Gods, I've missed it.

364
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:10,619
- Anywhere?

365
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,413
- Literally anywhere.

366
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:14,460
- OK, don't laugh.

367
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:15,607
- I won't.

368
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:16,994
- Promise?

369
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,483
- Cross my hearts.

370
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,180
- OK, when I was a kid,

371
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:22,226
I really wanted to be an astronaut.

372
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:24,395
- I don't know what that is.

373
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,897
- (laughs) I wanted to
be the first white woman

374
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,223
to walk on the moon.

375
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:28,984
- Moon?

376
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:30,180
Moon, it's child's play.

377
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:31,697
We can go to the moon right now.

378
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:32,516
- Really?

379
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:33,262
- Yeah.

380
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,080
You wanna, you wanna go with me?

381
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:36,212
- No way!

382
00:14:36,213 --> 00:14:37,193
Yes!

383
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:38,069
Let's do it!

384
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,024
- OK, bang, zoom.

385
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:46,134
(peaceful instrumental music)

386
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:51,364
Straight to the moon!

387
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:55,244
(peaceful instrumental music)

388
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,045
(crumbling)

389
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,623
(shatters)

390
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:08,645
Shit.

391
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,237
Oh hey, it's the guy and his dog from...

392
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:23,364
(sighs)

393
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,265
- Two deux pints.

394
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:40,841
Where's your friend?

395
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:44,417
- Oh she just popped out for a bit.

396
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:46,656
(burning)

397
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:52,356
(funny electronic music)
