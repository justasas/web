1
00:00:00,503 --> 00:00:04,530
(quirky music)

2
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:09,419
- I cannot believe this
many people showed up.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,434
- I can't believe it's not butter

4
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:13,408
but I am!

5
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:15,015
- Get out of here, Butter Man!

6
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,792
- It's pronounced Butterman.

7
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:18,542
I wasn't planning on staying.

8
00:00:18,543 --> 00:00:21,160
The cry of a dry crumpet calls to me.

9
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:23,132
Til we melt again!

10
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:28,718
- How don't we just change the
law so that only I can stay?

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,980
- Mhmm.

12
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:33,170
There, Jack, look at this crowd.

13
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:35,767
The public are coming around,
this isn't a lost cause

14
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,641
so just get up there and say something.

15
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:38,435
- Okay, okay, okay, just gotta

16
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:39,828
get that butter guy out of my head,

17
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:41,633
it's a fucking dude, man.

18
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:43,248
- [Butter Man] You butter believe it!

19
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:44,995
- Quiet!

20
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:47,109
- Hey!

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,101
Jackie, Jackie Chan, yeah yeah yeah yeah!

22
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:53,233
I didn't know you were having a party.

23
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:56,427
It's really cool, man (laughs).

24
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:57,438
- Hello.

25
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,641
- Oh good day, love.

26
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,189
(woman shrieks)

27
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,197
- Skulldrich, did you
come here just to mock me?

28
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,107
- Is that popcorn?

29
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,270
- Yes and no.

30
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:13,909
Yes I am here to mock you but
no, these are scarab beetles.

31
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,420
Sorry, mate, they're a little dry.

32
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:21,644
- But of course!

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,031
- Neat-o, neat-o petit-o.

34
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:26,161
But I've got a little speech to make

35
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:28,787
so maybe you could just
butter off, bugger off.

36
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,067
- Good on you, Jack.

37
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:30,594
Break a leg.

38
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:32,704
- Yeah, leg, spine.

39
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:35,608
Hell, break it all.

40
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:38,914
Yeah.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,090
You texting?

42
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:45,982
That's cool.

43
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:49,993
(marching music)

44
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,472
- Okay.

45
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:58,950
Hi.

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,119
- Hey!

47
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:04,161
- Guys, girls.

48
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:05,152
Whatever that is.

49
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:07,589
(baby crying)

50
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,485
Thank you so much for
coming, what a turn out.

51
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:14,850
It really means so much that
you all care about my cause,

52
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:19,131
this cause, our cause, really
matters to this many people.

53
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:21,484
I'm Jack.

54
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:22,686
- Boo!

55
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,348
Boo, am I right?

56
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,380
- You might remember
me from Fishy Thursday

57
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:29,362
or the time I blew up Morgan
Wright's eardrum on television.

58
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:32,131
- Yeah, nice one ya dickhead!

59
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:34,999
- Or a positive example...

60
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:39,252
- What'd do ya think of that?

61
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:42,230
- And I have run out of words.

62
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,368
Lotus.

63
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:52,624
- Hello, he tried.

64
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,714
Okay, guys, well we
all know why we're here

65
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:57,894
so let's just open the
floor for public discussion.

66
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,500
- Hi, Marvolo Loprego.
- [Woman] Get up.

67
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:03,345
- Sorceror, level 16.

68
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:04,910
- Hi, Marvolo.

69
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:07,304
Enjoy that level sweet 16, mate,

70
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:09,161
it'll be over before you know it.

71
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:10,801
- What level are you?

72
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:13,072
- Oh, I'm level...

73
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,691
- You know, you're not
the only wizard in town.

74
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:19,702
Some of us have been here for centuries,

75
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:23,863
going completely unnoticed
and then you turn up,

76
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:26,141
turn a railway station into a fish

77
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:29,147
and suddenly we're all
being told to fuck off.

78
00:03:29,148 --> 00:03:31,925
- I am (stutters).

79
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:33,993
- I uh, I uh (spits).

80
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:35,231
What a cunt!

81
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:38,404
(dramatic sting)

82
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,130
- Hey, Zandark, necromancer.

83
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:42,005
- Hey, Zandark.

84
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:43,868
- Hey, Skulldrich.

85
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,149
So Zach, so Jack, my bad.

86
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,037
It seems your petition calls for any acts

87
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:50,990
of raising the dead to cease forthwith.

88
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,519
I think that's pretty unfair considering

89
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,149
some of our professions, fetishes.

90
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,196
- Gross.

91
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:59,532
- And what's with no murdering people?

92
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,098
- What?

93
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,643
- Aw, boo!

94
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:04,599
(crowd heckles)

95
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,680
- Stick it up your...

96
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,162
- Beanbag.

97
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,567
- Cool it, guys, come on.

98
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:12,084
- Hello, I'm Snot-beak Fuck-Nuggs,

99
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,491
spokesgoblin for Saint
Cook's Wizards Council

100
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:17,348
for Equal Rights for the
attractively impaired.

101
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,914
- Hello.

102
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:20,128
- Oh yes, your documentation,

103
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,222
you have no options for
aesthetically-challenged members

104
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,062
of the magical community whatsoever.

105
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,656
What's the story there, mate?

106
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:29,202
- I didn't think of it.

107
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,472
I don't know man, look,
if you wanna fit in

108
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:32,517
why didn't you change your
name from, what was it?

109
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:37,518
Shitbird Dicklips, into
something like Tim.

110
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:41,961
- I'll have you know that
Fuck-Nuggs is a proud goblin name.

111
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:44,034
- You gotta tick on you, mate.

112
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:45,650
(crowd heckles)

113
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,282
- Boo!

114
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:47,999
- You fraudulent poet.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,284
- I hate this man.

116
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:53,953
- Oh, I've got such a
hard-on right now, man.

117
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:57,760
Fucking Medusa, she took a
peek of this and (sputters).

118
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:01,829
(dog barks)

119
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,834
- He hates them.

120
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,110
Look at his shirt!

121
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:05,567
- What?

122
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:07,854
- Skulldrich.

123
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,074
(laughs)

124
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:13,523
- Now that is very offensive.

125
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:15,453
- He tried to get me to stop Barbie.

126
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,380
Hell, what Australian is that?

127
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:19,518
- She just wanted to be an astronaut.

128
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,459
You murderer!

129
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,947
- Won't anyone think
about my poor baby bones?

130
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:28,556
- And he can't even keep
it up, unlike Enrique.

131
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:32,089
- And my hot water hasn't
been working for days!

132
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,311
- That's right, he's a pervert!

133
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:39,129
- He got me so wet in a
restaurant that I was late

134
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,468
for a date with Brendan
Frazier and Rachel Weisz,

135
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:47,048
star of The Lovely Bones and
Monkeybone, respectively.

136
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:48,700
- I like him.

137
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,940
- Thank you, Terry.

138
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,316
- Fuck you, Terry!

139
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,629
- Why don't we just send him back?

140
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,401
He caused this whole mess.

141
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:59,783
Why blame the majority for
the actions of a minority?

142
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,812
- Yeah, what a dickslit.

143
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,501
Send him back!

144
00:06:03,502 --> 00:06:05,106
Send him back!

145
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:06,704
Send him back!

146
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:08,449
Send him back!

147
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,775
(crowd heckles)

148
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:15,823
- This has been, like
a complete and utter,

149
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:19,421
what's the expression,
like a locomotive disaster,

150
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,981
like a bunch of people on
the metro who die in a crash.

151
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,389
- A trainwreck?

152
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,388
- No, anyway, why did I
think this was a good idea?

153
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,601
I left home to escape these lunatics,

154
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,499
and now I've given them
a rallying point, me.

155
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,844
- Jack, this was a good idea.

156
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:36,355
And granted, it maybe against you now

157
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:39,807
but for good reason (mumbling)

158
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:42,235
but they all need this vote to go through

159
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,319
so just get them on side.

160
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,562
- I can't do that, they hate my guts.

161
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:49,719
I'm pathetic.

162
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,838
- You're not pathetic.

163
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,450
Okay, look, you've made some mistakes

164
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:56,799
but you're a good guy.

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,420
Just

166
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:02,020
stand up and speak from the heart.

167
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,307
You've got this.

168
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,495
I believe in you.

169
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:12,885
Be charming.

170
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:14,355
(laughs)

171
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:16,504
You can do charming.

172
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:19,275
- [Voiceover] Boo!

173
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:22,132
(melodramatic music)

174
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,107
- Hey, this baby-eating fuck is...

175
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:29,669
(dramatic music)

176
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,385
- Hey!

177
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:38,748
Listen, I know I'm nobody's
favorite person right now

178
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,073
and I know that I got us into this mess

179
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:43,319
but please let me get us out of it.

180
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:46,628
Why are you all here?

181
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:47,834
Why would anybody leave their home

182
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,652
for somewhere so different and so strange?

183
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,699
I can tell you why I came here

184
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,388
and it's cheesy but I came
here 'cause I love this city

185
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:56,791
and I love this country.

186
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,820
I love that I can check my mail without

187
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,665
being buried in owls, I love
that I can go to the beach

188
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,904
without fear of kraken attack.

189
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:06,494
I love, that by and large,
there aren't many butter people

190
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:08,866
here trying to assault my toast
with slip-free cholesterol.

191
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:11,410
- I'll get you yet.

192
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:14,709
- But what I love the most is
that in spite of my accidents,

193
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,321
in spite of all the times I've fucked up

194
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:20,336
I've actually felt pretty welcomed here.

195
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:23,909
And for someone like
me, that's everything.

196
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,693
And do you not all feel welcome?

197
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:30,483
All of us, outsiders,
black sheep, eye kings.

198
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:31,726
- Aye!

199
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:32,523
- Wizards.

200
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:33,641
- Aye!

201
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:34,735
- Necromancers.

202
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,568
- Aye!

203
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,943
- Terries.

204
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:40,018
- Aye!

205
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,577
- Goblins and mummy lords.

206
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,960
- He and I once strangled a
puppy to death for no reason.

207
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,535
We were just bored.

208
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:48,802
- And assorted others.

209
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:51,064
- [Butter Man] You're churning me on!

210
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,578
- Fuck you, Butter Man!

211
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,787
New settlers have always
been welcomed in this country

212
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:58,154
but let's show them that
we're worth the effort.

213
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:02,583
Let's show 'em that we
can be Australians too.

214
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,310
(crowd cheers)

215
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:10,336
(dramatic music)

216
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:13,218
(crowd cheers)

217
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,580
(dogs barking)

218
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,497
- Well, Jack, I never
knew how passionately

219
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:29,435
you felt about this place.

220
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,348
I mean, look, I feel
like a bit of a bloody

221
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:35,160
dill pickle saying this, but, the reason

222
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:37,990
I wanted you back home
was because I miss you.

223
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,745
I miss having someone
around that I could just

224
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,728
fucking hate, you know, and I do.

225
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,004
I hate you.

226
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:46,787
- I hate you too, man.

227
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:48,050
(laughing)

228
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:50,222
- Gotta admit though, I did
get you to use magic again.

229
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,079
- Yes, you did, you cheeky fucker.

230
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,193
(laughing)

231
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,852
- Watch your language you cunt.

232
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:59,467
Alright, I'm outtie (sighs).

233
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:12,091
(light melodic music)

234
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:19,180
(woman laughing)

235
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:20,167
- You did it, Jack.

236
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,294
- We did it, Kylie.

237
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:22,825
This is the start of something great,

238
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,657
a long life here in Melbourne.

239
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:31,169
It's beautiful.

240
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,653
Allow me.

241
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:40,727
(twinkling sound)

242
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:49,753
(twinkling sound)

243
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:51,664
- Yeah, okay, stop it, stop it, Jack.

244
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,133
I know how to eat.

245
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:53,940
(laughs)

246
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,562
I am happy for you, though.

247
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:57,410
And I'm proud of the
small part that I played

248
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:58,913
in helping you find a home.

249
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:00,174
- Small part?

250
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:02,003
Thanks to you I found a new home

251
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:06,287
and I think I've found
someone I wanna share it with.

252
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,706
- Oh! (laughs)

253
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:16,935
(light melodic music)

254
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:21,564
- Jack, Jack, what do you
think you're doing, Jack?

255
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:22,986
- What do you mean?

256
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:25,766
We won, now we kiss, that's how this ends.

257
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,036
- No, no it isn't.

258
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,760
Look, you're a really nice guy

259
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:31,973
but I'm aggressively unattracted to you.

260
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,602
- But where I'm from, we win the quest,

261
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:37,192
we kiss the maiden.

262
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:38,903
- Oh, well that's fucked up!

263
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:40,815
Just because I'm the only
woman you know, Jack,

264
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,063
doesn't mean that we are
destined to be together.

265
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:45,083
If I was interested, I
probably wouldn't have

266
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:46,909
taken you speed dating.

267
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,732
- But you kissed me.

268
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,631
- Jesus Christ, there is
a big difference between

269
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:53,045
a kiss on the cheek
and a cock in my mouth.

270
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:53,819
- What?

271
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,526
- What do you mean, whoa, what?

272
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,084
- It's gross.

273
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,656
I don't know, it's weird, it's vulgar.

274
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:02,412
- Fuck you, it's vulgar!

275
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:03,983
You just pulled me against my will

276
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:05,542
to your gaping moor and I am not

277
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:08,305
into wispy, beard mouth.

278
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,633
- I'm not sure I understand
what's happening right now.

279
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,785
- Typical.

280
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,865
Look, Jack, I'm really happy that

281
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:21,954
I could help you, really I am.

282
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,455
Maybe I'll see you around.

283
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:35,159
(melancholy music)

284
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:42,132
- Well, at least wizards
can live in Melbourne now.

285
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,959
Yay!

286
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:56,036
Well, at least I haven't
ruined everything.

287
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:58,424
I have ruined everything.

288
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:02,823
(exploding sounds)

289
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:15,333
- Good question.

290
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,034
I think Melbourne has
changed since the wizards,

291
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:18,981
you know, showed up
now that you mention it

292
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,705
but it's always been a hectic city,

293
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:22,417
so much hustle and bustle, you know?

294
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,397
I love it.

295
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:25,130
- As a vegetarian, I couldn't be happier

296
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:27,521
since my husband was
turned into a cauliflower.

297
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:29,213
- As a pescatarian, I couldn't be happier

298
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:30,815
with my new neighbor.

299
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:32,523
- Good day.

300
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,722
- Since the wizards took
over, metro trains have been

301
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:38,059
running on time if not
slightly in the future.

302
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,859
(mumbles)

303
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,354
- Good day, hello, good to see you.

304
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,921
Yeah, look, alright I'll admit

305
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,358
when the johnny-come-latelies
first turned up

306
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:49,199
I was on serious bloody tender
hooks, you know what I mean?

307
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,593
But when they showed me the beauty

308
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:55,986
of the self-battering fish

309
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,017
well I've been making
some yahoo serious dosh.

310
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:02,737
- Why must everything I love die?

311
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:06,296
I mean, I finally got a
place that I fit in, sort of.

312
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:07,717
I left to escape this bullshit

313
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:11,160
now I'm knee, no cock, no
neck fucking deep in it!

314
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:15,185
It all followed me over, all of it!

315
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,871
Huh.

316
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,011
(light pleasant melodic music)

317
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:35,580
At least it's peaceful.

318
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:38,336
I mean, fucked up a good
city, ruined a lot of lives

319
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,187
(sighs) but hey, this is nice.

320
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:46,864
(light pleasant music)

321
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:02,527
- Well, everyone else is gone but

322
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,542
I'm glad you changed your mind.

323
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:08,283
It feels right, doesn't it?

324
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,665
Like old times.

325
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,395
- I don't know, man,
it's been a weird month.

326
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,707
I mean, everything I have ever loved

327
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,076
has either died or turned to shit.

328
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:24,111
Maybe I should just
embrace something I hate.

329
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:32,692
- I hate you, Jack.

330
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:42,251
- And I hate you, Skulldrich.

331
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:49,657
Now and forever.

332
00:15:56,896 --> 00:16:01,736
(dramatic music)

333
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,244
(moaning)

334
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:17,235
(vomiting sounds)

335
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:22,137
(screaming)

336
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:29,468
(light pleasant music)

337
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:50,632
- Thus, the circle of life continues

338
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:53,684
its dance into eternity.

339
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:06,666
- That is a beautiful thing.

340
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:12,311
- I cannot articulate how
much I regret this decision.

341
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:20,012
(spaghetti music)
