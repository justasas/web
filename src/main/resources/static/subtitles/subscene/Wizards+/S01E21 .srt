1
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,383
Yo, happy-go-trashy, come back here.

2
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:15,388
Don't you see me sweeping?

3
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,705
What would your mother say
if she saw you do that, huh?

4
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,271
Mama would be mad.

5
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:24,347
That's right, Mama would be mad,
and so am I.

6
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:25,668
Now pick that up.

7
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:29,105
And that cup too.

8
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:32,710
Okay, thank you for eating
at Waverly Sub Station. Come again.

9
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:35,312
Hey, Alex.

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,558
You picked up the trash on the way here.
Just throw it in the can.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,320
No, silly.
This is a necklace I designed for you.

12
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:45,751
A little something to say thanks
for being my best friend.

13
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:49,283
No, I'm not wearing that.

14
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:51,283
Why not?

15
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:54,364
Well, because it's so beautiful

16
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:57,958
and you should sell it.

17
00:00:58,128 --> 00:00:59,720
Okay. That will be $35.

18
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:01,123
No.

19
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:04,119
I meant on Waverly Place,
like these guys.

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,685
Okay, and whatever we don't sell,
we can wear to school.

21
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,127
School? Okay.

22
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:10,448
Big jewellery sale this Saturday.
Please don't miss it.

23
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:11,643
Please. Happy-go-trashy.

24
00:01:11,774 --> 00:01:14,243
Buy your mama something nice. No?

25
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:15,115
So you kids are telling the Babe
that hot dogs is bad for you?

26
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,153
What's a fella eat for breakfast?

27
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:19,478
Beef jerky and a bowl of syrup.

28
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:23,837
I call it beef jerky and a bowl of syrup.

29
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:28,201
Alex, put him back in the picture
before Dad gets here.

30
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:32,241
Oh, lighten up. If he was Obi-Wan Kenobi,
you'd be all into it.

31
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:36,048
Life-size Obi-Wan? I'll be right back.

32
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,885
Sit down.

33
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,441
Hi.

34
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:45,286
Alex, what did we say
about taking people out of pictures?

35
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:50,927
We say, "Yay, hooray,
Alex is so fun and creative."

36
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:55,895
Babe, always a pleasure.
I am a big fan.

37
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:57,532
Now put him back in the picture.

38
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,099
Fine.

39
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,692
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your place...</i>

40
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,939
Oh, I don't know the rest.

41
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:09,618
You need to know the exact time
and place to finish the spell.

42
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:12,745
I need to know stuff?
Justin's department.

43
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,103
Yankee Stadium, 1929.

44
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:18,258
You even make sports
not sound cool.

45
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:21,982
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places</i>

46
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,669
<i>Yankee Stadium, 1929</i>

47
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:28,592
Okay.

48
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:33,152
Now, today's lesson is about making
an object pass through something solid.

49
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:37,788
Justin, say "go through, mow through"
on my hockey stick.

50
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,397
Okay.

51
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:42,435
<i>Go through, mow through</i>

52
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,909
Okay. Now my hockey stick is charmed.

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,838
Watch.

54
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:51,355
It tickles. Stop, stop.

55
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,836
Awesome. Let me try.

56
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:57,643
Alex.

57
00:03:58,006 --> 00:03:59,837
Not the spleen. Not my spleen.

58
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,243
Miss Russo, we have a problem.
I'd like a word, please.

59
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:12,448
Sure, Miss Marinovich.
How about the word "lunch"?

60
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:14,723
I know it's one of my favourites.

61
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:19,050
You haven't signed up for Saturday's
art history field trip to the museum.

62
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,930
And if you don't go, you're gonna
have to repeat my class this summer.

63
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,285
And I'm begging you,

64
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,933
please don't make me teach a class
with just you in it.

65
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,253
Oh, believe me, summer school
is not part of my plans.

66
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,814
And neither is the museum.

67
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,773
I'm actually going
to a different art exhibit.

68
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,258
My friend Harper is making jewellery,
and we're selling it.

69
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:43,015
If you like macaroni and glitter,
I can get you some awesome earrings.

70
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:46,617
But the field trip is worth 30 percent
of your grade.

71
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,585
Please, I'm on my knees. Don't fail.

72
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,947
I missed my math field trip
last Saturday.

73
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,061
So 30 percent, is that a lot?

74
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,226
It's a lot.

75
00:04:57,111 --> 00:05:01,709
Listen. I need you to watch Alex
and make sure I get my summer vacation.

76
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:04,304
I will see to it that she's
at the museum on Saturday.

77
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,828
Thank you.

78
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:12,757
When you said "she," I really hope
you didn't mean me, because:

79
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,518
He sees Russo.

80
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:25,312
Oh, I'm open. I'm open.

81
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:34,122
What are you gonna tell your mother?

82
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:37,646
All right. I know how to deal with this.

83
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:42,088
We'll mess up a bunch of other stuff
and say we were robbed.

84
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:44,801
What happened?

85
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,445
My lamp.

86
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:49,806
We were throwing the ball.

87
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,891
What happened to the robbery?

88
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,292
We didn't have time to mess stuff up.

89
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,966
How many times have I said, no throwing
the ball inside the house, guys?

90
00:05:58,097 --> 00:06:00,818
- How many lamps have we broken?
- Three.

91
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,056
At least three times.

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,861
- We're sorry.
- Oh, not yet you're not.

93
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,018
After I get a massage and a pedicure

94
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:13,621
and whatever else I want that I don't need,
then you'll be sorry.

95
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:15,373
Man, this is bogus.

96
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:19,261
What's the point of having a foam football
if it still breaks stuff?

97
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:20,456
Exactly.

98
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:24,059
You know, someone should just come up
with a ball that could fly through stuff.

99
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,624
And I think that someone is us, huh?

100
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,265
I don't know why we're nodding.

101
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,985
Go through, mow through.

102
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:38,027
Oh, now I get why we're nodding.

103
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,232
Okay. That's enough nodding.

104
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:43,387
- Okay.
- Here.

105
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:46,629
<i>Go through, mow through</i>

106
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,909
All right, let's give it a try.
Hey, go out the door.

107
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:55,231
Here it comes.

108
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,362
Sweet. It works.

109
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,841
Okay. Pass it back.

110
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:04,644
I got it.

111
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:10,687
Yeah, it's just the football, Max.
Not you.

112
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,007
Hello, Miss Marinovich.

113
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:28,970
Mr. Kiss-Up-Ovich.

114
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,293
I'm here as you can plainly see.

115
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,614
No getting around the fact that I'm here.

116
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,129
Feel free to put a little check by my name
because I'm here.

117
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,135
Now, I'll be way over there
and you might not see me for a while,

118
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:43,455
because I'll be deep inside the museum,
soaking it all in.

119
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:47,461
I don't care what you soak in
as long as you pass my class

120
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:49,975
and we're not staring
at each other in summer school.

121
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:52,780
Because this is how I stare:

122
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:06,352
<i>Go through, mow through</i>

123
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:13,588
Okay, everyone, make sure
you get one of these handouts.

124
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:15,435
You have to fill it with historical facts.

125
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:18,470
It's worth 30 percent of your grade.

126
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:20,670
Alex?

127
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,631
Alex?

128
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,631
Alex.

129
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:30,642
Oh, good, you're here.
Now we can open for business.

130
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:38,637
Harper, I don't think we need
to say homemade.

131
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,202
People will just know.

132
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:44,241
Wait a minute,
is this the knob from my dresser?

133
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:49,129
Oh, here comes our first customer.

134
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:51,767
Already? Oh, this will be easy.

135
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:52,962
Good morning, ma'am.

136
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:55,130
Morning. Can I take all this?

137
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:58,084
- All of it?
- Yeah, I'll take it all.

138
00:08:58,696 --> 00:09:00,095
That'd be great.

139
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:02,367
Hey, Ralph. Bring the truck.

140
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:04,614
We got a load of trash over here.

141
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,051
What? No, this isn't trash.

142
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:08,812
It's fine jewellery.

143
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,813
Really?

144
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,380
Hey, Ralph.

145
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:17,180
Did you know we've been driving around
in a jewellery store?

146
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,816
Oh, good job, by the way, in there.

147
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:30,063
Next time, don't use red pen.
I use red pen when I grade.

148
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:32,260
That's kind of why I became
a teacher's assistant.

149
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,753
Hey, that was some great art.

150
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:51,153
Hard to pick a favourite.
It was all so great.

151
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:52,798
Save it, ditcher.

152
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,389
Ditcher?

153
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,991
Yeah. You ditched, I'm calling you
a ditcher. Got a problem?

154
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,354
There's only one tiny flaw
with your plan,

155
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,235
and it's called a worksheet.

156
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:07,760
A worksheet?

157
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:10,720
I'd hurry, because the museum closes
in like five minutes.

158
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,158
Five minutes.

159
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,370
Five minutes?
I wouldn't know this stuff in five hours.

160
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:25,569
But they might.

161
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,572
<i>Frames with figures
Step out of your pictures</i>

162
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,179
Okay. Gather around, people.

163
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:51,499
Gather around. Over here.

164
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:56,579
Why are you doing that?

165
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:58,743
<i>He's The Scream.</i>

166
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:02,583
Well, I got a new nickname for you.
It's Quiet Guy, okay?

167
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,822
All right,
I'm gonna skip the introductions,

168
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:08,466
because I gotta fill out this worksheet
and blast out of here.

169
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:12,302
So, which one of you is
the Dutch boy wearing a blue costume?

170
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,345
That would be me.

171
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,544
Oh, okay.

172
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,871
And the name of your painting is?

173
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:19,669
<i>Blue Boy.</i>

174
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:22,196
This is gonna be easy.

175
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:27,110
<i>All right, Frowning Woman, Crazy Guy,
Guy With One Ear.</i>

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,915
See that?

177
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,760
She's just going to use us.

178
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:33,395
And then send us right back

179
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:38,918
into those dingy, stiff, boring paintings
for who knows how many more centuries.

180
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,765
I say we take a vacation.

181
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,440
Wait. Fine, fine.

182
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:47,560
If you're not gonna help me
with my worksheet,

183
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:50,284
then you're just all going back
where you came from.

184
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,565
Go.

185
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,568
I'm done taking short-cuts.

186
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:56,650
I'm gonna do it the hard way.
I'm gonna copy off Nellie Rodriguez.

187
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,645
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places...</i>

188
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,288
Wait. I don't know where you're from.

189
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:09,172
<i>Attention.
We will be closing in five minutes.</i>

190
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,692
Okay, don't panic.

191
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:16,660
Go ahead, Scream, panic.

192
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,423
Come on, you guys.
We're locked in a museum.

193
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,696
Let's have a slumber party.

194
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,499
And, you know, get to know each other.

195
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:33,780
I'll tell you about myself
and you tell me about yourself.

196
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,422
For example, I'm Alex.

197
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:38,987
I was made in 1992 in New York City.
Where were you made?

198
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,989
You talk so much,
I'm glad my ear's gone.

199
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,992
Cheese it. Elaine's coming.

200
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:48,904
Who's Elaine?

201
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,504
She's the security guard
always shining her light in our eyes.

202
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,150
Hide.

203
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,780
Man, it's like her eyes follow you.

204
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:55,701
Okay, we are closed.
You know what that means.

205
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:59,302
Pull the plastic utensils out of the trash
and wash them?

206
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:03,017
Already done.

207
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,780
Now it's kick-off time.

208
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:07,508
I'm going long.

209
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,021
Nice one.

210
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:17,384
Now, you go long,
and by long, I mean up.

211
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,152
Oh, nice.

212
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:20,549
Hut, hut.

213
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:28,276
Oh, hi, Max.

214
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:33,112
No.

215
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,799
- What?
- Hey, Maxy.

216
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:38,038
Did you catch the...?

217
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,915
Flu?

218
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:43,474
I hear it's going around.

219
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:44,754
Gosh. It is?

220
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,684
Well, it's a good thing I made
my chicken posole soup, then.

221
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:49,240
Come on, it's done.

222
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,165
Did she see the ball?

223
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,928
No, it went into the soup.

224
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:57,129
Here you go, guys. Dig in.

225
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,606
How is it? It's my secret recipe.

226
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:12,290
Yep. There's a secret in there all right.

227
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,849
Hey, Harper. I see you're selling...

228
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,330
What are you selling?

229
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:22,610
Jewellery, silly.

230
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:25,177
Here, I even made a ring for you.

231
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,061
That's quite an unusual stone, Harper.

232
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:34,256
What kind is it?

233
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,697
It's not a stone. It's a peach pit.

234
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,866
Because I think you're peachy.

235
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:42,625
Right.

236
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,584
Hey, Alex.

237
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,989
What? You're locked in the museum?

238
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,945
The paintings? A security guard?

239
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,669
I should stop repeating
what you're saying?

240
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,110
Right, okay. On my way.

241
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,070
Yeah, so I just need a minute, sir,
to find my sweater.

242
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:09,554
You're not an art thief, are you?

243
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,671
No, sir, no art thief.
Just a teacher's assistant.

244
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:22,119
Alex? Alex, where are you?

245
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:25,002
Hey. What's going on?

246
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:28,002
What's up?

247
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,529
Oh, no.

248
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:32,403
Oh, no.

249
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:35,731
Alex, you have ruined some
of the greatest artwork in history.

250
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:37,492
<i>Van Gogh, Blue Boy.</i>

251
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:39,767
I'm sorry. Who are you again?

252
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,290
<i>Oh, yeah, The Scream.</i>

253
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,612
Hey, Quiet Guy, zip it.

254
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:49,448
Look, you just have
to send them back. Please.

255
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:52,253
But then you wouldn't learn anything.
You gotta do this yourself.

256
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,019
Justin, that could take all night.

257
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,331
It can't take that long,

258
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:58,341
because the security guard only gave me
five minutes to find my sweater.

259
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:00,102
Everybody, spread out.

260
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:02,455
We've got to find Justin's sweater.

261
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:10,143
That was delicious.
Did you guys like it?

262
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:13,142
Are you kidding? It was spectacular.

263
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:15,347
- Loved it.
- Oh, honey.

264
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,870
Yeah, we ate all of it.

265
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:18,630
All the way to the bottom.

266
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:21,028
And there's nothing else in there.

267
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:23,232
Absolutely nothing.

268
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,153
<i>We ate the ball?</i>

269
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:33,557
- It's...
- It wasn't spicy, honey.

270
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,471
I know. Well, you...

271
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,119
Do you think we're gonna be okay?

272
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:45,198
We're in no way okay.

273
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:49,634
If we eat the spell, we get the spell.

274
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:52,360
- Jerry?
- We can explain.

275
00:17:58,689 --> 00:18:00,760
We were robbed.

276
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:05,166
We put a spell on the ball

277
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,727
so we could throw it through stuff
without breaking anything.

278
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,731
And it flew into the soup,
and we ate the soup,

279
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:14,725
and that is why you're standing
in the middle of the island.

280
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,455
You know, this is kind of fun.

281
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:20,728
So you're not mad?

282
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:23,215
Well, not in like
an l-wanna-yell-at-you way.

283
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,296
In like an l-wanna-chase-you
kind of way.

284
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:27,254
Run.

285
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,061
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places</i>

286
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:39,218
Wait a minute.
Are those shoes too small?

287
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,584
I know.
I hate shoes that make me wanna scream.

288
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:52,467
Now you're ready to go.

289
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,544
<i>Pictures with faces
Return to your places</i>

290
00:18:54,673 --> 00:18:57,586
<i>Oslo, Norway, 1893</i>

291
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,393
Okay.

292
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,509
<i>That leaves us with the Mona Lisa.</i>

293
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,430
Okay.

294
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:14,553
<i>The Mona Lisa,
and she was painted by Leonardo...</i>

295
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:15,751
Di Caprio.

296
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,278
Da Vinci. Da Vinci.

297
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:19,632
I'll do it.

298
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,357
<i>Time to go home, Mona Lisa.</i>

299
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,163
<i>Pictures with faces

300
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:26,000
<i>- Italian Renaissance, 15...
- No, wait.</i>

301
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:28,164
Please don't send me back. Please.

302
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:31,526
But you have to go back. You're one
of the greatest art treasures in history.

303
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,368
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

304
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:38,966
My entire life, all I ever heard
anyone say about me is:

305
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,567
"Why did Da Vinci paint her?
She's so plain.

306
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:44,255
You call that a smile?"

307
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:47,132
Well, you're gonna love
these earrings, Elaine.

308
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:48,405
They're strung from a string

309
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:51,735
that once held together
a delicious roast beef.

310
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:57,817
You find your sweater yet,
teacher's assistant?

311
00:19:58,581 --> 00:19:59,650
No, not yet.

312
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,696
Well, you got two minutes,
or you're going home chilly.

313
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,543
There you are, Alex.

314
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:14,139
Good thing Justin repeated
everything you said on the phone.

315
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:16,903
Oh, hello. I'm Harper.

316
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,180
Oh, hi. Mona Lisa.

317
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,264
Do I know you? You look really familiar.

318
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,865
She's not from here.

319
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:26,024
She's from Italy. Florence, I think.

320
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,224
Very good.

321
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:31,904
Harper, that is the most beautiful
necklace I have ever seen.

322
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:33,833
It is?

323
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,993
It is.

324
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:40,595
And it really brings out your smile.

325
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,119
That is a smile, right?

326
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,434
Yes.

327
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,677
Thank you.

328
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,191
What are you doing?

329
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:49,200
Sending her back happy.

330
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:51,679
Harper, why don't you show Mona
the matching earrings?

331
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:54,399
Oh, yeah. You'll love them.

332
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:57,478
<i>Pictures with faces

333
00:20:57,646 --> 00:21:00,320
<i>Italian Renaissance, 1502</i>

334
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,965
Here they are.

335
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,647
Where did Mona go?

336
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,289
She was so excited
about the necklace

337
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:10,171
that she wanted
to go show her friend Leo.

338
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:12,887
She owes me $35 for that.

339
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:20,254
What? A necklace on Mona Lisa?

340
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,447
No, no, no.
That is not what Da Vinci intended.

341
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:23,852
Relax. She looks great.

342
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,417
And that's almost a smile.

343
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:29,852
You put a $35 necklace
on a $40 million painting.

344
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:33,421
Well, now it's worth 40 million
and 35 dollars.

345
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:37,018
Justin, just say it's cool.

346
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:40,457
It's cool.

347
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:41,654
And I'm...

348
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:44,506
I'm sorry that I make fun of you
for knowing stuff.

349
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:47,463
You're apologising?

350
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:50,583
Will you say that tomorrow at school
in front of my friends?

351
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,745
- No.
- Didn't think so.

352
00:21:58,112 --> 00:21:59,182
Good. You're home.

353
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:00,388
Sit down.

354
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:04,984
Look, I can explain.
I'm having a little trouble in art history.

355
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:06,987
Yeah, what else is new? Sit.

356
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:11,955
Now, what you're about to see
I normally don't condone,

357
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,035
but it's a heck of a lot of fun.

358
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,673
Okay, kids. Watch this.

359
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:28,679
I guess we found out
how long the spell lasts.

360
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,765
I hate living with wizards.
