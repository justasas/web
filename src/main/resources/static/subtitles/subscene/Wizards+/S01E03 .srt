1
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:13,673
Check it out.
I got an F on my Spanish midterm.

2
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:15,513
Why are you so happy about it?

3
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:17,228
Because Riley got an F too.

4
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:20,708
That means he's been paying as much
attention to me as I've been to him.

5
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,751
Failing Spanish is hard work.

6
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:25,878
How is failing Spanish hard work?

7
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,359
Every day, I show up late
so he'll definitely notice me.

8
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:30,794
Then I forget my textbook
so we have to share one.

9
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,043
And finally, I let the teacher catch us
passing notes

10
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,363
so she keeps us both after class.

11
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:37,241
That is hard work.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,844
You must be exhausted.

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,128
That's why I sleep during History.

14
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:43,893
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey, Riley.

15
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:47,326
A bunch of us are going to this cool
restaurant, Medium Rare, on Friday night.

16
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:48,651
Wanna come?

17
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:50,734
Oh, sure, Medium Rare.
I go there all the time.

18
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,896
But it's new. Friday's opening night.

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,059
Oh, Medium Rare.
I thought you said Medium Roar.

20
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,778
You know, like, bigger than a kitten
and smaller than a lion.

21
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:01,100
You know, like a cougar.
Anyway, it's out by the zoo.

22
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:02,862
You can come too.

23
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:08,343
Well, I might as well, since my best friend
never took me to Medium Roar.

24
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:16,274
Look at that. All those hours
I didn't spend on studying totally paid off.

25
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:21,037
Oh, no. Here comes your brother.

26
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,479
I think he's coming over here.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,320
Oh, he's so cute.
I never know what to say to him.

28
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,673
Just talk about current events.
He loves current events.

29
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:29,237
Hey, guys.

30
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,682
Alex failed her Spanish midterm.

31
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:35,476
Not that current.

32
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,400
Hey, guess who got asked out
on a date today, me or Justin.

33
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:37,044
Not Justin.

34
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,921
I'm more interested in learning
about what happened in Spanish class.

35
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:43,566
Yeah, we heard you failed.

36
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:45,490
That's right.

37
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:48,734
I did fail, but I can explain.

38
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:53,098
There I was,
studying as hard as I ever have.

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,817
But I couldn't concentrate,
because right outside that window,

40
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:58,900
the boys were playing paintball,

41
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:01,421
and I didn't wanna ruin their fun.

42
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,180
Paintball on the terrace?

43
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:05,458
I told you not to
because it chips the bricks.

44
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:07,181
Oh, now that you mention it,

45
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:10,587
I do remember you
saying something about that.

46
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:13,788
No, no, no.
No, no, no, we didn't play paintball.

47
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,713
What are pigeons eating nowadays?

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,718
You guys are gonna scrub that terrace
until those bricks sparkle.

49
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,313
Shiny bricks coming up.

50
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,804
I'm so sorry.

51
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:35,518
Your failing Spanish is all my fault.

52
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,079
Okay. You're right. It is your fault.

53
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:45,052
- It is?
- Of course it is.

54
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,813
I'm going to call your Spanish teacher

55
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,770
and tell her what a horrible role model
I've been.

56
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:52,498
Here I am, a proud Latina,

57
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:55,374
and I haven't been sharing
your Mexican heritage with you.

58
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,653
I should be speaking Spanish
around the house

59
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:00,014
and we should be making
our own homemade tortillas.

60
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,503
Oh, my gosh, that's a lot of work.

61
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,421
Let's just start with the Spanish, okay?

62
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,582
Mrs. Chow.

63
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:14,023
Thanks a lot, Alex.
You busted us for paintball.

64
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,715
- Well, you busted me for failing Spanish.
- I'm done with you.

65
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:18,189
Justin...

66
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:19,956
Done.

67
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,996
Yes, it is embarrassing.

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,838
<i>Thank you. I mean, gracias.</i>

69
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:32,083
Good news!
Mrs. Chow said she'd give you a re-test.

70
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,041
Great. You're not going anywhere
with your friends

71
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,807
until you get your grades up.

72
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:38,921
Jerry, this is my responsibility.

73
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,169
<i>Don't worry, honey,
I'm gonna help you with your español.</i>

74
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:45,445
Okay, that's fine,
but I really need help with my Spanish too.

75
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,929
<i>Español is Spanish.</i>

76
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,975
<i>Español is Spanish for what?</i>

77
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,529
This is gonna be hard.

78
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,455
No, it's not. It'll be easy.

79
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:59,417
We're gonna whip through this
and I'm gonna go on my date with Riley.

80
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,974
Two days to learn a whole language?

81
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:05,817
I got some Spanish for you:
No way, José.

82
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:07,741
José.

83
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:17,155
And finally, did you guys know
that in the magic world,

84
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,793
there's a place you can get information
on any subject quickly and easily?

85
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:22,637
You mean like the Internet?

86
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:26,317
Speaking of the Internet, when am I
getting a computer in my room?

87
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:29,356
It's cooler than the Internet, and never.

88
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:31,794
Come on, guys. Come on.

89
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:35,441
Check it out.

90
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,841
You just pull this lever
and it generates Pocket Elves

91
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,882
that have in-depth knowledge
on any subject

92
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,810
you could ever need to know about.

93
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,448
You just pull it,
and whatever Pocket Elf you want,

94
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:49,775
it comes shooting out
of the magic portal, huh?

95
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:52,812
Okay.

96
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:03,458
Awesome.

97
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,501
All right. Well, there you go.

98
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:07,745
You've got a wealth of knowledge
at your fingertips

99
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,021
and you played a fun game of catch.

100
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:12,545
Come on, guys.

101
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:15,868
The best way to teach you
about Pocket Elves

102
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:18,955
is from a Pocket Elf himself.

103
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,308
- Look at him.
- Oh, he's so cool.

104
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,351
Thanks, I know.

105
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:28,520
Good day, I am the Pocket Elf
who specializes in history

106
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:30,236
and use of Pocket Elves.

107
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:33,278
Now, Pocket Elves
are useful for research on everything

108
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:36,087
from magical illnesses
to magical creatures.

109
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:37,443
Any questions?

110
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,529
Yes, little lady in the attractive hat.

111
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:44,284
Are there Pocket Elves
for subjects non-magical?

112
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,930
Because of the Magic World
Equal Opportunity Act,

113
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:49,446
there are Pocket Elves on all subjects.

114
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,977
Shaquille O'Neal.

115
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:53,249
I know his Pocket Elf.

116
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,972
He owes me an autographed shoe
that I'm going to be living in.

117
00:06:57,462 --> 00:07:00,615
Yes, boy with the '80s hair.

118
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,337
How many Pocket Elves
can you check out at once?

119
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,107
None. They're not library books.

120
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,261
Can I have some of that?

121
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,984
- Sure.
- No.

122
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:12,946
Wait. Give me...

123
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:14,347
It's gonna blow!

124
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:16,591
What are you doing?

125
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:21,310
Oh, did I mention that Pocket Elves
are not supposed to have chocolate?

126
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:23,032
What happens if he has chocolate?

127
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:25,834
To you and me,
chocolate is a delicious treat

128
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:28,318
often used to say sorry to a loved one.

129
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:32,798
But to this little guy,
it's like lighting a fuse on a crazy bomb.

130
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:38,324
Then let's set this baby off
and give him some chocolate.

131
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:42,531
You know, in this controlled environment,
it might be helpful to the students

132
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:45,003
if someone were to give me
some chocolate,

133
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:47,171
purely for educational purposes.

134
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:49,891
- Sure, yeah, come on.
- All right.

135
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:52,772
For educational purposes, we'll do this.

136
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,731
Honey, grab me that box.

137
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,330
Legs up off the floor,
button your collars all the way up.

138
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,982
No open-toed shoes, right?

139
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:04,135
And whatever you do,
do not let a Pocket Elf bite you.

140
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:13,352
Before we get started, I just wanna say
thank you for the chocolate,

141
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:16,387
and I'm really sorry
for what you're about to see.

142
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,354
Hey, that's not supposed to happen.

143
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,114
Proceed to an exit in an orderly fashion.

144
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:33,720
- What's happening?
- Go. Go.

145
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,486
Okay, let's review.

146
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:49,775
Lampito.

147
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,973
It's okay.

148
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:00,820
Cupito.

149
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:04,984
Honey, just adding "ito" to a word
doesn't make it Spanish.

150
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,907
<i>You say "como se dice" before everything.
Is that Spanish?</i>

151
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,462
Oh, boy.

152
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,822
Maybe you'll have to spend
the summers with Grandma.

153
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,229
She does need help with the chickens.

154
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:17,905
But my test is tomorrow.

155
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:20,996
And if I don't pass, I won't be able
to go on my date with Riley on Friday.

156
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:23,031
I know, honey.

157
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,991
Maybe we can bake cookies on Friday.

158
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,043
What are you thinking
about wearing on Friday?

159
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,160
I think I'm gonna stick
with this whole fruit theme, you know?

160
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,082
I don't want us to be wearing
the same thing.

161
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,931
Oh, okay.
Well, you can wear it this time.

162
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:44,009
And the time after that.

163
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,808
We're set. And you've got
your Spanish re-test covered, right?

164
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:50,452
I'm taking it right now during study hall.
Consider this test passito.

165
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:52,809
Passito? Okay, see you later.

166
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,776
Yeah, she won't be there.

167
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:05,296
<i>Señorita, you are so lucky to have me
as your Spanish-language Pocket Elf.</i>

168
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:08,024
Keep quiet, elf.
You're here to cheat on my Spanish test.

169
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,744
Just stay in here and zip it.

170
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:15,623
A journal.

171
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:20,029
"Dear diary. Riley is such
a hottie with his new haircut."

172
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:22,195
Oops, my bad.

173
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:32,196
<i>Okay, wake up, señorito. We're home.</i>

174
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:35,202
<i>Can I make you breakfast, chiquita?</i>

175
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,596
Huevos rancheros?

176
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:40,006
Perhaps you can dine on that
while I enjoy some semi-sweet chocolate

177
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,849
that you give me.

178
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:45,131
Hey, your Spanish confuses me,
and I'm not giving you chocolate.

179
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:48,209
Good. It was a test, and you passed.

180
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:51,731
<i>That's why I want
to grow old with you, chiquita.</i>

181
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:54,215
Dad, finished cleaning the bricks.

182
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,933
You're not Dad.

183
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:57,381
Is that a Pocket Elf?

184
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,971
No. It's my retainer case.

185
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:01,219
You don't have a retainer.

186
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:03,422
You don't know what goes in my mouth.

187
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:07,464
<i>And what a beautiful mouth it is,
señorita.</i>

188
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,787
Oh, so you're so good at Spanish, you
taught your retainer case how to speak it.

189
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:14,232
Cheater.

190
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:15,463
I didn't cheat. I just...

191
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:17,994
Cheater.

192
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:21,278
I just used the Pocket Elf
to get the answers right on the test.

193
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,589
Okay, I cheated. So what?

194
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,473
"So what" is you're in trouble.

195
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,320
Come on, Justin. Please don't tell Dad.

196
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:29,081
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't.

197
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:32,197
You ratted me out for paintball.
I spent the last two days cleaning bricks

198
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,681
and listening to Max sing "Brick House."

199
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,001
You know what?

200
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,278
I'm not gonna tell on you.

201
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,728
- Thanks.
- I'm gonna get even.

202
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:44,602
Yeah. Okay, that'll never happen.

203
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,690
Remember the last time
you got even with me?

204
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,046
I got the bigger bedroom,
and you got what?

205
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,697
Shotgun on that one trip
to the outlet mall.

206
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:54,731
Exactly. Some things never change.

207
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,259
Guess who got an A
on her make-up test.

208
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:09,548
Really? Oh, let me see that.

209
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,144
Wow, you even got
your subjunctive conjugations.

210
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,913
Oh, you know what the Spanish say...

211
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,274
Hey, Dad. Guess what.

212
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:23,476
I got an A on my make-up test,
and I'm gonna go on my date with Riley.

213
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:29,120
I wasn't expecting this.
I'm very disappointed.

214
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,712
That I passed?

215
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:33,959
Yeah.

216
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:39,324
Because now we have to have
the date talk.

217
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,041
All right, here goes.

218
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:46,444
A lot of times, when you're out alone
with a boy, he's thinking about...

219
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:49,727
- Alone? We're not gonna be alone.
- You're not?

220
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,088
No. Harper, Stacy, Jeff,
Cassandra, Terry, Samantha,

221
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,335
Chris, Noah and Kelly will be there too.

222
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,613
And you call that a date?

223
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,937
That's not what I called a date
when I was a kid.

224
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:01,015
What was a date when you were a kid?

225
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:05,783
You know what? You're right.
That is a date.

226
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:14,671
Is she still getting ready for her date?

227
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,307
Yeah. And she's gonna be a while too.

228
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:18,073
I tied all her belts in one big knot.

229
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,150
Now this is getting even.

230
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,996
When that Pocket Elf goes wild
on her date,

231
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,587
she'll wish she was home
making us cookies.

232
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,994
Here she comes.

233
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:33,958
Oh, Justin got even with me.

234
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:37,757
Tied all my belts together
so I'd be fashionably late for my date.

235
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:41,246
Wow, you got me. You're so clever.

236
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:44,888
Wow, I don't even know why I try.
You are too good for me.

237
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:47,813
Well, at least you can relax,
there's nothing else to worry about.

238
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,972
Yup, nothing's gonna go wrong
on your date

239
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,375
as long as you take your purse and...

240
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,698
All right, Dad, I'm leaving.

241
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,379
Okay, honey.

242
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:00,093
Have fun on your date.

243
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:04,374
It's so not a date.

244
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,390
Welcome to Medium Rare. How many?

245
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,706
Ten, but Lauren and Meg might come.
And if they do, Kelly will definitely leave.

246
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:20,590
And if Kelly leaves,
Stacy will call Frances, who will show up.

247
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:22,754
Which means I have to leave,
because we're fighting.

248
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,198
How many is that?

249
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:26,276
It's either ten, 11, 13 or 12.

250
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:32,878
Follow me to your table
for ten, 11, 13 or 12.

251
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,765
So I heard you got
your learner's permit.

252
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:39,766
- Oh, yeah, check it out.
- Yeah.

253
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,688
Oh, that's a great picture of you.
But you know what would make it better?

254
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:44,928
Me in it with you.

255
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,726
Oh, I don't think they do that.

256
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:50,893
You and Riley are so clicking.

257
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:52,167
He's totally cool.

258
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:55,372
And he can drive with a parent or guardian
during any daylight hour.

259
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:59,058
This is great. I bet that elf went crazy,

260
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:02,096
and Alex is flopping all over the floor,
looking as stupid as Dad did.

261
00:15:02,224 --> 00:15:04,057
She's gonna be so embarrassed.

262
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,506
Yeah, we're geniuses.

263
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,384
How much chocolate
did you put in her purse?

264
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,023
About this much.

265
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:15,823
I was supposed to put this chocolate
in her purse.

266
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,150
That was your only part of the plan,
genius.

267
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:21,030
I told you not to trust me
with a complicated plan like this.

268
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:23,673
What's so complicated
about putting that chocolate in her purse?

269
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,634
That I had to remember
to put this chocolate in her purse.

270
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,191
Look.

271
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:31,760
We gotta get to that restaurant
and get that chocolate in her purse.

272
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,605
I was thinking, when I get my car,

273
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,483
I'm gonna get a little licence-plate
keychain with your name on it.

274
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:42,045
- Is that cool?
- I guess, if you want.

275
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:46,046
Harper, did you hear that?
He's gonna put my name on his keychain.

276
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:47,649
I'm gonna cry.

277
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:48,884
I promised I wouldn't cry.

278
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,928
There she is. Duck.

279
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:59,372
Excuse me. What are you doing?

280
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:04,624
Trying to figure out
how to get chocolate into that purse.

281
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,660
- Why?
- To mess with our sister.

282
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,745
I have a sister.

283
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,630
Get in.

284
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,718
Why did that just shoot out
of her purse?

285
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,639
Okay.

286
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,571
As much as I want, I cannot.

287
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,208
Oh, great.
We picked the one elf that's on a diet.

288
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:48,405
Oh, come on, elf, eat it.

289
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,732
You know you want to.

290
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:00,459
Oh, this is good.

291
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:04,257
Oh, this is really good.

292
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,583
You guys probably wanna get away
from me right now.

293
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:12,107
Home, Jeeves.

294
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:19,070
- Alex, do you have any lip gloss?
- Let me look.

295
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:23,028
Something bit me.

296
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:30,595
What are you doing here?

297
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,123
And why did you bite me?

298
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:35,477
I'm eating chocolate
like there's no tomorrow.

299
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:37,040
And there may not be.

300
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:40,958
<i>And you can't have any
You can't have any</i>

301
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:45,291
I don't want any of your chocolate.

302
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,325
Oh, you will, baby.

303
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,888
You're gonna love it.

304
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,290
It didn't go crazy. It just bit her.

305
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,058
Oh, that's bunk.

306
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,140
I wanna get my ride in midnight blue.

307
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:01,140
Oh, yeah,
that would look great with my eyes.

308
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:02,896
- Can I have a bite of that?
- Sure.

309
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:04,775
What colour interior?

310
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,741
- I'm thinking tan leather.
- I'm more of a dark-leather person.

311
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:09,502
Can I have that?

312
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:10,785
Okay, sure.

313
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:15,352
You know what's not a good colour combo?
Our school colours.

314
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:17,942
Blue and gold.
That's why I'm not a cheerleader.

315
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:19,584
Besides, I'm not self-centred.

316
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:23,472
I should start a school petition to change
our colours to midnight blue and chocolate.

317
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:25,511
Oh, wait, that's not a straw.

318
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:31,555
That's an interesting story.

319
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,443
Hold that thought.

320
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:36,045
You were saying?

321
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:45,885
I wanna get the tyres for my ride
bigger in the back and smaller in the front.

322
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:47,732
It's called chopper style.

323
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:50,168
Oh, I hope it doesn't run on chocolate.

324
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,288
That would be a waste of chocolate.

325
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,779
Happy anniversary, you guys.

326
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,369
I knew you two would work out.
I love you guys.

327
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,175
Can I have some?

328
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:23,394
Oh, wait, I want that.

329
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,557
Is she okay?

330
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:29,996
You know us girls.
Gotta have our chocolate.

331
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:35,316
Now we're talking.

332
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,740
Does anyone know the chocolate slide?

333
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:06,025
Revenge is sweet.

334
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:07,586
And sticky.

335
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:22,274
That was fun.
What a nice break from chocolate.

336
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:24,549
Chocolate sounds good right now.

337
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,232
Listen, I just ordered the nachos,
so I think 10's good.

338
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,041
She had a really nice time and she
totally wants to go out with you again.

339
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,486
- You want me to call your parents?
- That would be terrific.

340
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,570
I think they should see this.

341
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:50,847
And we had nothing to do with it.

342
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,422
And how long did you think
it was gonna be

343
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:04,456
before we figured out
you didn't know Spanish?

344
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:07,624
I really only needed you to think it
till the date was over,

345
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:09,466
so I'm good.

346
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:11,979
No. You are not good.

347
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,626
You almost exposed magic
to the real world.

348
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,425
Yes, and I've already punished myself,

349
00:21:16,553 --> 00:21:18,705
because I embarrassed myself
in front of Riley

350
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:21,270
and he probably
won't ever text me again.

351
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:25,631
And the fact that you two were just
conveniently down at the restaurant.

352
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,279
You had something to do with it.

353
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,474
We were on our way to another place.

354
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,435
We stopped there on our way home.

355
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:36,036
- From where?
- From a place

356
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,361
that Max knows the name of.

357
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,598
Pass.

358
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,639
What is going on here?

359
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:45,091
Okay.

360
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:47,722
Look, here's what happened.

361
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:50,005
I called them
when things started to go wrong.

362
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:52,571
They just came down to help.
It's not their fault.

363
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,497
Fine, for now.

364
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,739
You, go hose off on the balcony.

365
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,253
- Fine.
- And you two, clean up when she's done.

366
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:04,898
We don't need ants.

367
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,861
Alex.

368
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:13,549
- Wow, thanks for not ratting us out.
- Don't thank me.

369
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:17,143
I didn't rat you out because I'm gonna
get even for you guys getting even.

370
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:21,148
Oh, no, her getting even
is way worse than telling.

371
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:23,672
- Dad, it was us!
- We gave it!

372
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:25,950
- We gave the elf chocolate!
- We did it.
