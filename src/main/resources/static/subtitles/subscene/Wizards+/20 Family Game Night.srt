1
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:06,043
Harper! I see you dressed

2
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:08,612
for your history test on the
women's suffrage movement.

3
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:10,213
- How'd it go?
- Great.

4
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:12,549
Except I fell off my bustle
during the essay part.

5
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:15,085
Everybody saw my pantaloons.

6
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:18,522
Oh, they're looking again.

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,694
Wait a minute. There's an essay?

8
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:25,862
I thought there was
just multiple choice.

9
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:28,465
That's why I wrote down
all my guesses on my arm.

10
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:30,367
I didn't write anything
about an essay.

11
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:33,637
Yes, you did. It says "essay"
right there by your elbow.

12
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:37,007
No, that says "easy."

13
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,543
I wrote that down as a motivator.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,547
I need to switch brains with you.

15
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:46,016
Whoa! I don't want
your brain in my body.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,952
Would it sound better if I
said I wanted to switch bodies?

17
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:52,856
Well, you are wearing
a cute outfit today.

18
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,059
And I get to wear...

19
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:57,861
..that. Oh, OK.

20
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,968
<i>Alex, Harper. Cambia corporum
meum corpora sua nominavi.</i>

21
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,806
- Oh!
- Harper?

22
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:11,408
Alex?

23
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:13,410
Yes!

24
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:17,581
[sighs] OK, Alex, I guess
I'll take your test for you,

25
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:20,517
but I'm not walking around
with the answers on my arm.

26
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:23,754
Oh, fine, but if you run out
of time at the end of the test,

27
00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:25,155
just answer all As.

28
00:01:25,323 --> 00:01:27,290
You'll be right one fourth
of the time which...

29
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:28,925
I think is passing.

30
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:44,641
I had fun with you at the art
museum last night, Justin.

31
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:47,144
That was a great date.

32
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:50,313
What? A date?

33
00:01:50,348 --> 00:01:51,615
You and me? Like...

34
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:56,853
What? The only reason
you and I were alone

35
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,356
is because no one else in the
group bothered to show up.

36
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,193
But I saw the way you
were looking at me.

37
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:05,295
I was looking at you
because you were standing

38
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,330
in front of every
painting I was looking at.

39
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:11,334
Oh, I was looking at
you looking at the art,

40
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,236
because that was my art.

41
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,972
And now my cell-phone wallpaper.

42
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,579
I've read tons of articles
on dating and relationships,

43
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:24,948
and last night was
definitely a date.

44
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:30,487
Staying alone with someone
because you don't wanna be rude

45
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:33,557
and just bug out of
there is not a date.

46
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:35,192
I do the all quizzes, too.

47
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,060
They all say I'd be
a great girlfriend.

48
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:39,996
- Girlfriend?
- Yes! I'll be your girlfriend.

49
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:44,668
- I'm so glad you asked.
- No! I don't think I did.

50
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:46,770
And by the way,
I'm talking slowly right now,

51
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:49,139
which means I don't
understand what's happening.

52
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:52,109
I'll tell you what's
happening. Love.

53
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,544
And love is the most
important thing.

54
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:58,181
Because in the future,
when the aliens take over,

55
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,484
it's the only thing
we'll have left.

56
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:03,053
You know, you really didn't
have to add the alien part

57
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:04,921
'cause I'm already really scared.

58
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,090
That's how you know it's real.

59
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,759
Hey, so what are you doing tonight?

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,827
Because I think we should
go on a second date.

61
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:14,264
Oh, you do? I can't,
because I'm going to the Mets game.

62
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:16,066
Great! It's a date.

63
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,402
Our relationship is
off to a great start.

64
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:23,073
Hey, I know it's taken me
a long time to say this,

65
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:25,475
- but I love you.
- Uhh!

66
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,913
I'm in love!

67
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:39,055
Way to go, Justin.
You're in a relationship.

68
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,159
I never thought it would happen.

69
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:44,594
What are you talking about?
It happens all the time.

70
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,830
The werewolf, the centaur girl,
the goth chick.

71
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:48,932
Why do people think I don't date?

72
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,600
I don't remember 'em.

73
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:55,172
Anyway, it's awesome that you
came to me with this problem.

74
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:57,574
I didn't come to you.
You came over here to me.

75
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:01,444
True, but you usually go to
Alex with this type of stuff.

76
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,947
You're talking to me.
I'm taking it as a victory.

77
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:07,751
I am here for you, bro.

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,489
OK. [sighs] So what
should I do about Daphne

79
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:15,425
thinking that we're dating
when we're actually not dating?

80
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,795
Hmm. That is a tough one.

81
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:22,966
I am stumped.

82
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,070
<i>* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

83
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,972
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

84
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:31,174
<i>* You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease *</i>

85
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,809
<i>* Yes, please *</i>

86
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:34,644
<i>* But you might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

87
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:36,279
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

88
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,782
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

89
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:40,617
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

90
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:43,954
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

91
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:47,591
<i>* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

92
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:51,161
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

93
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:56,032
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

94
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:59,169
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

95
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:02,973
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

96
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:06,810
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

97
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:10,680
<i>* Because everything is not *</i>

98
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:13,216
<i>* What it seems *</i>

99
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:20,217

100
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:22,759
OK, Alex, I really aced
your history test for you.

101
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:25,228
I hope you made it believable
that I took the test.

102
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:26,830
For the things you didn't know,

103
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,365
did you draw a picture
to distract them?

104
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,068
I just don't feel right
about cheating like this.

105
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:34,938
Cheaters never prosper.
Switch me back. Switch me back!

106
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:37,040
OK. Alex, Harper.

107
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,843
<i>Cambia corporum meum corpora
sua nominavi.</i>

108
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:47,350
What happened?
Why am I still looking at me?

109
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:49,185
And you spilled iced
mocha on my dress.

110
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,421
Suffragettes did not
drink iced mochas.

111
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,323
Cool it, weirdo. It didn't work.

112
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:55,125
Let me try it again.

113
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:59,129
<i>Alex, Harper. Cambia corporum
meum corpora sua nominavi.</i>

114
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,199
I don't know what happened,
but don't worry.

115
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:05,668
I'll just go into the
lair and figure it out.

116
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:10,273
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

117
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,542
Hi, Justin. Cute shirt.

118
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:15,678
Thank you. I actually...
What did you do to it?

119
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:17,780
- Where?
- Stop it, Alex.

120
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,916
- We're on a mission.
- Oh, Alex.

121
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,519
I need to ask you something.

122
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,420
I'm taking a girl to
the baseball game.

123
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:26,089
What girl? Who are you taking?

124
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:27,857
Daphne. She thinks we're dating.

125
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,093
I need your sneaky advice
of how to get out of it.

126
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,695
Dump her. Just dump her.
Dump her hard.

127
00:06:34,865 --> 00:06:37,700
Oh! You wanna get rid of her,
you're gonna need a road flare,

128
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:39,903
a barrel of maple syrup,
and a mini trampoline.

129
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,972
We're not using the maple syrup
for what you think. We gotta go.

130
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,744
And what did I think we were
using the maple syrup for?

131
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:49,579
Like who...

132
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,650
Oh!

133
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:56,986
I get it.

134
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,427
Hey. Huh? Ooh!

135
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:06,362
[chuckles] Look what I found

136
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:09,199
when I was dropping some
stuff off at the resale shop.

137
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,467
It's the Almost
Charades board game.

138
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:15,104
Like we used to play on
family game night. Ooh!

139
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:20,410
Honey, I got rid of
that thing for a reason.

140
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:23,880
Family game night nearly
destroyed this family.

141
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:26,983
Don't you remember? The fighting,
the cheating,

142
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:28,952
the crying when someone lost?

143
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:30,220
[scoffs]

144
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:32,488
But that's because
the kids were young.

145
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:34,557
I think they're old
enough to handle it now.

146
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:36,593
They weren't the
ones who were crying.

147
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:39,996
Come on. Let's play
tonight. Please.

148
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,864
Please. Please, please, please.

149
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,300
All right, fine, we'll play.

150
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:46,836
But you know what?
We're gonna play on the terrace.

151
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,539
- Fine.
- Why do we have to play there?

152
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:51,975
Because that way
we'll be out in front

153
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,410
where all the neighbors can see.

154
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:56,212
We'll be shamed into behaving well.

155
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:59,916
And also, when stuff starts to fly,

156
00:08:00,217 --> 00:08:02,151
my ceiling won't get
stained with guacamole.

157
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:03,820
Oh, good.

158
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:06,923
I thought that was something
seeping down from Max's room.

159
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,830
That is totally
coming from my room.

160
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,415
So, how was the date?

161
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:35,018
What do you think?

162
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,853
I think I thought of a way

163
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:39,822
for you to break with her at
the ball game. Check it out.

164
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:43,159
After a batter strikes out,
you look at her and you say,

165
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:46,296
"Strike three! You're out!"

166
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,598
"No, seriously, get outta here."

167
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:53,303
I kissed her.

168
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:56,839
Oh. You wanted her
to break up with you.

169
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:01,911
No, I was leaning in to tell her
we weren't in a relationship.

170
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,180
Then, of course,
they put us up on the big screen.

171
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:07,183
The whole crowd kept chanting,
"Kiss, kiss, kiss, you guys!"

172
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:10,153
"Kiss, kiss!" And I
choked under the pressure.

173
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:12,722
Well, lucky for you,

174
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:15,625
I still know a way for
you to get rid of her.

175
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:18,294
Look, Dad's forcing us to have
family game night tonight.

176
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:21,497
You know us. The cops'll be
there an hour after we start.

177
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:24,067
And I'll invite Daphne to come.

178
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,869
She'll see how mean and hurtful
and cheating us Russos can be,

179
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,771
she'll bail and never
wanna see me again.

180
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:31,174
That's a great idea.

181
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,810
I was thinking we could plant
some of Mom's jewelry on her

182
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:35,478
and get her arrested.

183
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:38,681
I gotta call Daphne right now.
This is a great idea.

184
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:40,483
I know. Hey, You should've started

185
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:42,852
coming to me for
advice years ago, huh?

186
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:45,421
I didn't come. You were
standing there when I walked in.

187
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:47,457
And you talked.
That's good enough for me.

188
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,196
So Justin told me all
about his new girlfriend.

189
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,600
Yeah, he and I are tight now.
Close buds. Tells me everything.

190
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:00,737
Really? Justin has a girlfriend?

191
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:02,305
Mm-hm, yeah. Her name's Daphne.

192
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,640
He also told me that he's
bringing her home tonight.

193
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:08,611
Wow. He must really like her if
he's bringing her to meet us.

194
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:11,647
Does he know it's
family game night?

195
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:13,449
He knows.

196
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:16,319
Well, we'll just have to be
on our best behavior, then.

197
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:20,289
Theresa, we will be friendly
and cordial and polite.

198
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:22,992
Good sportsmanship is
the order of the day.

199
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:25,828
Mm. That is a great idea, too.

200
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:28,531
- There was another idea?
- Justin had a great idea.

201
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:32,034
But this one's great too.
I say go with it.

202
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:36,973
Here's one that might work.

203
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,978
Hair brainium scheme changium.

204
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,686
That's not it.

205
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:54,357
Alex, why do I still have your body,
except with my hair?

206
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:56,359
Oh, it smells like a waterfall.

207
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:00,029
OK, what about this one?

208
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:03,566
After all that's been said,
we wanna switch back our heads.

209
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:10,373
- [Alex's voice] Oh, I did it.
- [Harper's voice] Not exactly, Alex.

210
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:12,208
I'd still like my body back.

211
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,377
You don't sound like yourself.

212
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:15,878
You sound like me.

213
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:17,847
OK. Stop yelling.

214
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:20,316
Voices right noises.

215
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:25,421
[with Alex's voice] Testing,
one, two, three.

216
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:27,490
Again, I'd like my body back, Alex.

217
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:30,860
I'm on it. I'm on it.
We can do this, Harper.

218
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,763
This has all been a pain.
We wanna switch back our brains.

219
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:40,436
[as Alex] Wow! There's a
lot of pressure in here.

220
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,142
Waterfall.

221
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:51,347
[hollow sound]

222
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:54,016
Oh, my goodness.
Now you have no brain.

223
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:56,786
[as Harper] Actually,
my brain's inside your head, Alex.

224
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,723
[as Alex] Ow! All these brains
are pounding against my skull.

225
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:02,725
Oh, no wonder smart
people are no fun.

226
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,293
- Pretty...
- No!

227
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:13,856
OK, Harper. Maybe I should
just try another spell.

228
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,859
[as Harper] Let's see.
My brain is cramm inside your head,

229
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:18,827
and I'm standing over
there looking lost,

230
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,796
like my dad when I talk
about the Internet.

231
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:23,265
Sure, try another spell.
How could it get any worse?

232
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,701
[as Alex] OK, Harper,
I know we can do this

233
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,369
if we just put our heads together.

234
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,371
Well, our heads can't
get much more together

235
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:31,106
and that doesn't
seem to be helping.

236
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:34,410
OK, um... Maybe we
should just go to Justin.

237
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:37,112
Really? Because I suggested
that five minutes ago

238
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,280
before you did all this.

239
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:40,282
OK, OK.

240
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:43,619
But what do we do with that
thing while we're gone?

241
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,088
[clears throat] Um...

242
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:48,624
"That thing" is me.

243
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:50,893
How about we tuck me into
bed so I'll go to sleep?

244
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,928
Looks like someone's
using their noggin.

245
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:55,631
- Nap time!
- See?

246
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,235
Lawn mower.

247
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,304
Oh, you don't know what
this thing wants. No!

248
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,851
Aren't you getting
dressed for your date?

249
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:18,387
These are my good flip-flops.

250
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:20,723
They match the sweater.

251
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:23,525
OK. Well, we're all very excited

252
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,961
that Daphne's coming over
for family game night.

253
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:28,297
We'll do anything to help
this romance flourish.

254
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,699
Ooh, Theresa, why don't you
make your deviled eggs?

255
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,267
And put a dozen aside for me.

256
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:35,304
No, no. You guys just
be yourselves, OK?

257
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,673
I want Daphne to get to know
you guys for who you are.

258
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:41,477
This night should be like
any other family game night.

259
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,849
Alex, you're just in time
for family game night.

260
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:48,550
Sorry. I don't play games.

261
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:51,387
Especially ones that end
like crime-scene tape.

262
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:54,490
[as Harper] Oh, let's play, Alex.
I love games.

263
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:57,659
Harper, stop talking. We gotta
get Justin and get out of here.

264
00:13:57,694 --> 00:13:59,194
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

265
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:01,597
Every time you have a thought,
it comes out your mouth.

266
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,899
You can be so bossy.
Oh, I didn't mean to say that.

267
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:05,467
Harper! Justin.

268
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:08,804
What are you doing?

269
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:11,974
[whispers] I have two
brains inside my head.

270
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,645
If you're trying to psyche me out,

271
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,180
you have to do better than that.

272
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:20,649
No, no, no. I'm serious.

273
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:22,251
I mixed up a bunch of spells

274
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:25,354
and now I got Harper's
brain inside my head.

275
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:27,689
I can prove it.
Just talk to Harper's brain.

276
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,826
OK, let me...

277
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:34,563
Let me see.

278
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:39,334
Hello, Harper's brain.

279
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:44,339
You're staring at me with those eyes.
I think I might faint.

280
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,343
Definitely Harper's
brain all right.

281
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,212
How'd this happen?

282
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:52,514
I did the body switching
spell and I can't undo it.

283
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,783
Body switching? Don't you
read the wizard memos?

284
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:56,785
That spell's full of glitches.

285
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,422
- What's wrong with it?
- I think you just found out.

286
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:01,824
[doorbell rings]

287
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,659
Daphne's here.

288
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:07,429
You three should really get
to know each other. Stay put.

289
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:10,065
Fine. If you're not gonna help me,
I'm getting out of here.

290
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,868
I'm going downstairs
to get cold cuts.

291
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:16,638
Come on in, Daphne.

292
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:32,121
<i>Teen Girl magazine says,
"Never meet the family empty-handed,"</i>

293
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:34,723
so I brought cold cuts.

294
00:15:34,757 --> 00:15:37,359
Terrific. Now Alex doesn't
have to go downstairs.

295
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:40,129
She can stay up here and mingle.

296
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:43,265
Really? My family owns a deli shop.

297
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:46,135
[as Harper] Alex,
we have guests. Be polite.

298
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:47,536
[grunts]

299
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,538
Um, hi.

300
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:52,341
Welcome, Daphne.
So nice to meet you.

301
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,009
Welcome to our normal home.

302
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:58,280
I'm Justin's calm,
level-headed dad.

303
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:00,916
Yeah, until the game starts.

304
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,118
Let's all go out onto the terrace

305
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:05,721
in full view of the neighbors
where everyone can see us.

306
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:12,227
Let's do it. I love charades.
But my parents won't play.

307
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,062
They say their whole
life is a charade.

308
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,398
Harper, we can't play
charades with two brains.

309
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:18,300
My parents will
know something's up.

310
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:23,639
Oh! You figured out
how to move my feet.

311
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:26,675
Your brain has a short attention span.
It's easy to overpower.

312
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,811
No! I am not playing...

313
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:30,879
No!

314
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,218
Now, remember,
this is Almost Charades.

315
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:39,388
You can only write down books,
movies or television shows.

316
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:43,592
Oh, it's so great

317
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:47,396
to play a civilized game of
charades with the family.

318
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,798
That's right. We're out
here playing charades.

319
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:51,767
In a friendly, family way.

320
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:54,503
[woman] Quiet down there, ya nut!

321
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:57,639
All right, let's divide into teams.

322
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,509
Team one: Justin, me,
and the lovely Daphne.

323
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,044
Team two: Jerry, Max, and Alex.

324
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:03,111
Yeah!

325
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:07,749
Whatever you say, honey.

326
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:10,085
Dad, those teams aren't fair.

327
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,788
Aren't you gonna accuse Mom of
stacking things in her favor

328
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:14,656
then go off and pout
like you usually do?

329
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,426
Whatever your mom wants,
I'm happy to comply.

330
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,195
I just want our guest, Daphne,
to have a good time.

331
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,232
Oh! Justin, your parents
make me feel like

332
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,367
I'm already part of the family.

333
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:27,836
We're so compatible.

334
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,972
Alex, get out here!

335
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:33,942
Wow, Harper, you're strong.

336
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,845
Daphne, you should
really get to know Alex.

337
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:39,848
She's got a lot going on up here.

338
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,052
Hey, Harper. Come on out.

339
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:47,923
Hello, Daphne.

340
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:50,259
If you don't stay away from Justin,
I'm going to...

341
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:53,829
Eat more of this. Mmmm.

342
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:59,668
Why, thank you. Justin,
your sister's so sweet and hungry.

343
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:03,972
You haven't really
seen the real her.

344
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:06,708
OK, let the games begin.

345
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:13,048
Oh, this is a good one. I'm ready.

346
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,519
Two words. First word.

347
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:20,122
- One syllable.
- You got it!

348
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:26,895
- Who wrote down "One syllable"?
- I did.

349
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,200
You're supposed to write titles.

350
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:34,970
That is infuriating, isn't it, Dad?

351
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:38,874
Doesn't it make you just
wanna throw a table?

352
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:42,678
<i>I'm sure there's a book
titled One Syllable</i>

353
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:44,179
out there somewhere.

354
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,315
Excellent guess, Daphne.

355
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:49,084
She's smart and beautiful,
just like your mother.

356
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:52,487
Aw! This is the best
family game night ever.

357
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:55,023
What a loving family.

358
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:57,659
I guess it's true,
"The family that plays together..."

359
00:18:57,694 --> 00:19:00,529
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
"Stays together." Alex's turn!

360
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:04,366
Oh, yay! Me, first. Me, first.
Can I go first, pretty please?

361
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,168
- Uh, OK.
- Uh, really?

362
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:10,238
Harper, I hate charades.

363
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:13,141
Hate charades?
That's like hating sunshine.

364
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:14,509
OK!

365
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:17,279
Movie!

366
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:18,847
[Max] Three words.

367
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,349
[Jerry] Foot.

368
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,684
- Sock.
- Foot. Bunion foot!

369
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,319
- Foot!
- Foot! Foot!

370
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:28,090
- I... Ball of your foot.
- Ball of your foot.

371
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:30,759
[Max] Oh, um...

372
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:32,961
Foot. Calluses. Callus, ball, foot.

373
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:36,264
- That's three words.
- For the love! It's "football."

374
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,934
<i>A movie. Football.
Friday Night Lights.</i>

375
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:41,236
Yes! You got it.

376
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,271
Wait a minute.
You said, "Football."

377
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,841
You talked. You're disqualified.
She's disqualified.

378
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,710
- Good. I'm out of here.
- Alex, you're not disqualified.

379
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:50,579
I got that fair and square.

380
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:53,849
Your mother is stacking
the teams against us!

381
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:56,184
That's what I'm talking about.

382
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:59,788
What?! What? You heard her.
She cheated.

383
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:03,291
And I'm livid! They should both
be disqualified. Out of here!

384
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,827
Ho! This if totally bogus.

385
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,929
Dad's pouting 'cause
he lost a fight again.

386
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:10,532
No! We are not fighting.
That's one thing we're not doing.

387
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:13,068
We're not fighting,
so stop fighting!

388
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:16,138
The neighbors can hear us!

389
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,941
[woman] That's it!
I'm calling the cops!

390
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:24,479
<i>- Karate Kid!
- We are not fighting!</i>

391
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,982
We are trying to make
a good impression!

392
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,317
I think your family
should keep it down.

393
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,186
Nah, they're good.

394
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,488
Da-ta!

395
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,257
Oh, no!

396
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,092
Lollipop.

397
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:41,096
Alex, what did you do to Harper?

398
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,366
Uh, nothing. See, this is why
I should have tied you up.

399
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,169
That's a great idea.
Someone should have tied you up.

400
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:49,070
What's wrong with these people?

401
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:52,307
Nothing. This is just a
typical family game night.

402
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:58,480
You call this normal?

403
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:00,215
Yes. You should get used to it,

404
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:01,983
now that we're in
this relationship.

405
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:04,553
Oh, no, no, no.
I am way over my head

406
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:06,455
with this toxic family dynamic.

407
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:10,625
And next time you meet a girl,
Justin, do not bring her home!

408
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:28,638
Please, brain, leave, brain.

409
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:31,641
Oh, really? It's just that easy?

410
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:35,378
And polite. No wonder you
couldn't figure out the spell.

411
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,649
Please, brain, leave, brain.

412
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,686
Oh, I'm back.

413
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:46,122
It feels good.

414
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:47,657
Yes.

415
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:49,892
Feels awesome having my skull back.

416
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:51,928
Every time I kept
looking out my eyes,

417
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:53,596
your brain kept leaning in going,

418
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,598
"Let me see! Let me see!"

419
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,768
Well, I didn't wanna
look in your brain.

420
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:00,803
There's a lot of
scary stuff in there.

421
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:04,974
Thank you.

422
