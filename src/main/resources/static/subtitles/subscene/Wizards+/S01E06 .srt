1
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,154
Alex is gonna love her room.

2
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:17,958
The flowery thingies are perfect
for my little princess.

3
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,198
Hey, check it out.

4
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:21,394
The wallpaper glue
dried my fingers together.

5
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:26,245
Dude, that's awesome. Give it up.

6
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:31,474
Come on, guys,
stop messing around, all right?

7
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:37,842
To do this job right, you need to focus,
you need intensity and a root beer.

8
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:40,960
Hi, Daddy.

9
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:42,806
I like the new wallpaper.

10
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:46,922
And I'm glad you're not finished yet,
because you're really gonna love this.

11
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,679
Pink fur wallpaper.

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,446
Watch Daddy's little girl
make us put up her new wall fur.

13
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,246
Don't you love it?

14
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:59,488
But what about the little flowers?

15
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:01,170
It's a little young for me.

16
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,805
I think I'm ready for this.

17
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:07,367
You know, now that I think about it,
this pattern does look like my boxers.

18
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:10,767
I almost didn't get the pink fur,
because the guy at the store said

19
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:12,452
only a professional could put it up.

20
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:15,851
But he doesn't know my dad.

21
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,249
Well, you got that right.

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,014
The Russo boys are on it.

23
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:21,445
We're gonna need more glue.

24
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,727
Yeah, but I thought we were gonna work
on my room next.

25
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:25,654
Your room's good enough.

26
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:29,255
Good enough for Justin's room maybe,
not for the J-Man.

27
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,536
Who's the J-Man?

28
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,456
Me. That's my nickname.

29
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,691
Yeah, who calls you that?

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,088
Lots of people.

31
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,336
You know, not at school,
but around the neighbourhood.

32
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,259
Okay. A couple.

33
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,572
Me mostly.

34
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,658
But that's just because we haven't redone
my room.

35
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:51,256
- Your room looks great.
- No, Justin's right.

36
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:52,816
We shouldn't forget about him.

37
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:55,332
That's why he should have
this wallpaper.

38
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:58,173
I'm comfortable being forgotten.

39
00:01:58,304 --> 00:02:01,820
It'll totally tie together your little
action figures and the big water stain

40
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:03,060
from where the roof leaks.

41
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:06,457
I was gonna paint over that water stain.
But you know what? No, you're right.

42
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,816
This wallpaper would look way better.

43
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:11,586
Attaboy.
Come on, guys, let's go before it dries.

44
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,777
Let's hustle. Fun and games are over.

45
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:15,898
Dad, I was kidding.

46
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:18,660
You gotta show me how you do that.

47
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:21,701
Unless you wanna be Daddy's little girl,
I can't help you.

48
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,547
But that shirt's got you halfway there.

49
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:30,200
Honey, you didn't make a giant burrito
out of Max again, did you?

50
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:32,116
No, Mom.

51
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:34,519
It's no fun anymore. He likes it.

52
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:36,635
The rug's for my room.
I found it in the basement.

53
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:39,279
Honey, you know you're not supposed
to be going down there.

54
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:42,164
Well, Daddy said I could take
whatever I want from down there.

55
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,876
Oh, well, all right.

56
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:46,525
We like to put up a united front.

57
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,080
So fine.

58
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:50,715
And if you see him,
could you tell him I need to talk to him?

59
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:56,886
Oh, my gosh.

60
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:58,761
What happened to you guys?

61
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,562
What happened was
Alex got pink fur wallpaper,

62
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,442
and we just finished hanging it up
for her.

63
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,483
Mom, will you vacuum us off?

64
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,129
Here's the crevice device.

65
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,889
Be careful.

66
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,366
I don't wanna be vacuumed.

67
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:12,971
I'm wearing this to school tomorrow.

68
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:18,087
So, Justin,
how's your room coming along?

69
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,732
I have girl wallpaper.

70
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,047
And are you okay with that?

71
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,732
No.

72
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:24,048
I gotta make it a man's room.

73
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:25,493
I need man stuff.

74
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:26,804
Okay, like what?

75
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:31,087
Like pictures of girls on motorcycles
and my favourite band, Tears of Blood.

76
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:32,808
T.O.B.

77
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:34,255
Stands for Tears of Blood.

78
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,329
I got it.

79
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,493
Listen, that sounds awesome,

80
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:43,617
and, like, I'll probably not be visiting
your room that often.

81
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:49,855
But if you want some real scary stuff,
Dad's chair shaped like a baseball glove,

82
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,049
it's in the basement.

83
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,776
Oh, that's awesome.

84
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,938
Baseball glove chair?

85
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:02,374
I knew you didn't throw it away.
I can't wait to sit in it.

86
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:10,653
<i>And now at number four,
previously at number six,</i>

87
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:14,299
<i>Spontaneous Bling with "Oh, Yeah."</i>

88
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:34,102
A flying carpet.

89
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,748
Random.

90
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,821
That's it, honey. You're good.

91
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:47,304
Fits like a glove.

92
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,900
Hey, it is.

93
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,103
Listen, that's going to Justin's room.

94
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:54,184
- But...
- Guys, check it out.

95
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,463
This tiki dude's
gonna man up my room.

96
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:59,472
And so is the guitar
after I smash it and hang it on the wall.

97
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,824
You're not smashing anything.
That's mine.

98
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:06,506
I used to play it in an all-girl mariachi band
at Las Piñatas.

99
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,794
- I didn't know you played the guitar.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,635
She doesn't.

101
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,354
But thanks for finding it.

102
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,150
No, honey, thank you.

103
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,509
If you hadn't sent Alex down there
to get that rug, we never would've found it.

104
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,311
No, hold on. What rug?

105
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,029
- Alex?
- Honey?

106
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,639
Alex?

107
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,878
I thought she had
the magic flying carpet.

108
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,514
What the?

109
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:41,672
Hey, so how's it going?

110
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,600
Mom, I see you have the guitar out.

111
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:49,516
You thinking about playing it now?

112
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,684
Alex, stop trying to avoid the subject.

113
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:54,716
You said I could take stuff
from the basement.

114
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:57,195
You know you're not supposed
to use magic unsupervised.

115
00:06:57,326 --> 00:07:00,238
You should've come to me as soon
as you realised that was a magic carpet.

116
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,323
Daddy, I really didn't do anything wrong.

117
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,483
It's not like I was giving people rides.

118
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,040
Yeah.

119
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:08,727
Can I go again?

120
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:11,886
That's it. I'm taking this carpet
right back to the basement.

121
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,318
And why don't you leave your guitar
down there too, honey?

122
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:18,608
Listen, if your baseball glove chair
stays above ground, so does my guitar.

123
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,121
Alex, I am really disappointed in you.

124
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,690
Daddy, the rug looks great in here.

125
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,246
- It ties the whole room together.
- Well, look around you.

126
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:29,966
Can't let you keep a magic carpet.
You don't know how to drive it.

127
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:33,005
- So you should teach me how to drive.
- No way.

128
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,252
I can't believe it.
He just said no to Daddy's little girl.

129
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:37,966
Maybe it's crazy day.

130
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:39,686
Hey, Dad, can I have a cell phone?

131
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:41,168
What? No.

132
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:43,846
It's not that day.

133
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:47,130
- Daddy, please?
- Absolutely not.

134
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:50,768
And don't look at me
with those puppy-dog eyes

135
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:53,491
and think I'm just gonna melt
in your hands.

136
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:56,617
Is that what you think I do, Daddy?

137
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,491
- Okay.
- No, no, no.

138
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,132
You are not gonna guilt me into this.

139
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,933
Just because I taught Justin,
doesn't mean I automatically have...

140
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,420
You taught Justin?

141
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,936
Well, I guess that makes sense
since he's your first-born

142
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:16,855
and he'll always have a more
special place in your heart than me.

143
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:19,702
Oh, you can't possibly think
that I love him more than you.

144
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:23,338
I love you all equally,
just not at the same time.

145
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,932
We'll talk about this in the morning.
Good night.

146
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,938
- It's only 4:00.
- Who are you? Father Time?

147
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:32,421
Daddy, give me one good reason
why I can't learn how to fly the carpet.

148
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,014
You can't fly the carpet
because you're not old enough.

149
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:37,057
- Well, how old was Justin?
- Eighteen.

150
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:38,506
I'm 16 now.

151
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,340
Oh, so you lied to me, huh?

152
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,139
Well, we'll talk about that
in the morning.

153
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,185
- Good night.
- Okay, Daddy.

154
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,185
Even though you haven't given me
a good reason,

155
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:52,907
I know you must have one, because that's
how much I respect you and love you.

156
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,182
Okay, fine.

157
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:02,189
We'll start carpet-flying lessons
tomorrow.

158
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,148
And that's how you do that.

159
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:16,311
And if you don't vacuum it
every 3000 miles, the filter gets clogged.

160
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:19,745
It makes for a very unstable ride.
Not safe.

161
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:20,984
Oh, so I get it.

162
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:24,028
Just bring it to you every 3000 miles
so you can do all that stuff,

163
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:25,430
because you're so good at it.

164
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:29,345
Yeah, well, it does relax me.

165
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,511
Okay. Moving on to the rules of the sky.

166
00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:34,316
What kind of cloud should you fly into?

167
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,758
Trick question. None of them.

168
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,797
Because it's very easy
to become confused in a cloud.

169
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,319
Which way's up? Which way's down?

170
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,635
I don't know. Crash.

171
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,716
What would you crash into in a cloud?

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,116
A confused wizard
on a carpet going the other way.

173
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:53,712
Plus, you don't want to expose fine wool
to that kind of moisture.

174
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:56,835
It's very hard to dry,
and then it starts to smell like a camel.

175
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,636
- Is that bad?
- You don't wanna know.

176
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,477
Dad, stop trying to scare me.

177
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:03,356
I'm a big girl. I can handle this.

178
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:05,156
Oh, a big girl.

179
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:07,520
You're a big girl, huh?

180
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,915
Okay, big girl, enough talk, let's walk.

181
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:11,718
- Let's take her up.
- Great, I'm ready.

182
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,040
Yeah, it's very easy to fly.

183
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,601
All you have to do
is curl left, lean right, go left,

184
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,400
curl right, lean left, go right,
curl down, go down.

185
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,803
- Got it?
- Curl what, lean who, go where?

186
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:23,883
- Just go slower.
- Go slower?

187
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:26,204
All right, enough chitchat.
You don't learn by teaching.

188
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,523
You learn by doing.

189
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,480
Let's take her up.

190
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,284
Let's go.

191
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:39,568
Hey, isn't this fun, just the two of us?

192
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,844
Why are you looking at me?
Eyes on the sky.

193
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:43,087
Not me, the sky.

194
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:44,851
Honey, come on.

195
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:46,767
All right.

196
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,446
Let's turn left here.

197
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:51,372
No, it's too jerky, too jerky.

198
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,564
It's all in the wrist.
I told you, it's in the wrist.

199
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,168
I'm barely touching it.

200
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:59,335
Look, you're thinking too much.
Don't think, just fly.

201
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,412
How can I think when you're yelling?

202
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,005
I told you not to think. Don't think, okay?

203
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:06,446
If you're not gonna hear me,
maybe I should yell louder.

204
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:08,534
I can't do anything
with you yelling like that.

205
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:11,092
Why are you yelling like that?
You never yell at me like that.

206
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:13,369
I'm not yelling. I'm just loud-teaching.

207
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,376
Watch out, watch out.

208
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:16,818
Watch where? Watch where?

209
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:18,054
Where? Everywhere.

210
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,249
Watch everywhere.

211
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,099
How can I watch everywhere?

212
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,701
Oh, hi.

213
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:38,655
- How'd it go?
- I'm not talking to him.

214
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:39,853
I'm not talking to her.

215
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,302
Or watching the big fight tonight.

216
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:45,336
No, apparently, I am.

217
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,379
She flew me right into this.

218
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,145
She's not ready for lessons.

219
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,180
I don't know why she's so anxious
to fly anyway.

220
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:54,985
She needs to be home with us.

221
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:57,542
And where are my pudding cups?

222
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:00,057
You ate them all, remember?

223
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:02,749
Where does she think she's going to
on that carpet anyway?

224
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,781
I don't know. But wherever it is, honey,
she's gonna come back.

225
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,103
Sweetie, do you think maybe
you're not upset about the flying lessons

226
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,984
as much as you are
about not wanting our little girl to grow up?

227
00:12:13,591 --> 00:12:15,024
That's ridiculous.

228
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,668
And until we solve this pudding crisis,
I can't even think straight.

229
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,383
Need more pudding.

230
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:27,191
Mom, check out
what someone was throwing out.

231
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,145
It's hard to imagine someone
not wanting that.

232
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:33,267
Why do you want that?

233
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:35,705
Something's gotta take your eye off
that girlie wallpaper.

234
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:38,111
And how can you not look at this?

235
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:41,912
Oh, gosh, it still has bad breath.

236
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:47,991
Dad's not here, right?

237
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:51,156
Why? Daddy's little girl
doesn't wanna see Daddy?

238
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:54,517
Well, that's what I wanna talk
to you about.

239
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,191
When we were on our lesson,
Dad got all tense and frustrated,

240
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,159
like how he acts
when he's around you and your dolls.

241
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,476
Action figures.

242
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:06,800
Collectibles in their original packaging.

243
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,435
Dad's never acted
that way with me before.

244
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:12,962
What should I do about it?

245
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,201
I'd love to help, but I've never been
Daddy's little favourite anything.

246
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:18,559
That's why I have girl wallpaper.

247
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:21,080
And I'm hoping that Boris here
is gonna man that up.

248
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:23,321
Wait, I really need your help.

249
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:26,518
How do I get Dad to stop being mad
at me so he'll teach me how to fly?

250
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:28,800
Okay.

251
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,844
We're gonna need to pull out
the big guns here.

252
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,878
What does Dad love even more
than pudding?

253
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:34,521
Even more than us sometimes?

254
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,400
- Breakfast for dinner.
- Exactly.

255
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,485
- You gotta make that happen.
- I can do that.

256
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,362
And you gotta get something very special
to top it off.

257
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,799
- Baked ziti from Mario's.
- Baked ziti from Mario's. Yes.

258
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,568
Now give me $10.

259
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,965
What? Why?

260
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,968
It was your great idea.

261
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:52,204
I can't afford to always be this smart.

262
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:55,528
Yeah, Boris just lost an eye.

263
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:57,803
That's okay. Boris looks even tougher.

264
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:01,010
You know why? Pig with an eye patch.

265
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:23,406
Dad, Mom and I made breakfast
for dinner. I know it's your favourite.

266
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,334
Thank you, Theresa.

267
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,457
Dad, I melted your butter
and I even went all the way uptown

268
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:39,254
to get that special blueberry syrup
you like.

269
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:43,132
No, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down on fruit.

270
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,819
I feel the same way about vegetables.

271
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:48,655
Who's with me?

272
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:56,776
And, Dad, guess what Alex got you
for dessert.

273
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:58,418
Baked ziti.

274
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,815
Jerry, you really love ziti.

275
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:04,421
I don't think you heard me.

276
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:06,936
I'm trying to cut down on my fruit.

277
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:12,221
Yes, tomato is a fruit.

278
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:16,067
I'm gonna finish my breakfast for dinner
on the terrace.

279
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:17,827
I'll come with you.

280
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,502
Alone.

281
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,064
Right, because you don't want me
to catch a cold.

282
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,147
Thanks, Dad.

283
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:35,104
I know it's all tense and everything,

284
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,588
so I don't have to take a bath tonight,
right?

285
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:51,834
Alex.

286
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,834
Alex.

287
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,191
- Alex.
- Who?

288
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,986
You scared me.

289
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:04,431
Oh, I get it. We're pulling a prank on Max
like he and I do to you sometimes.

290
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,117
You guys play pranks on me?

291
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,230
Never mind.
What are you doing in here?

292
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,432
Our dinner plan didn't work.

293
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,472
I know. And thanks for waking me up
to remind me.

294
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,000
Good night.

295
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:21,874
Look, flying lessons
weren't that easy for me either.

296
00:16:22,002 --> 00:16:23,322
Really?

297
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:26,355
And I'm guessing he's even more intense
with Daddy's little princess.

298
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:29,442
Yeah, well, Daddy's little princess
just got kicked out of the castle.

299
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:31,156
So, what you got?

300
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,597
He only sees you as his little girl.

301
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,403
You gotta show him
you're more than that.

302
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,086
I'll teach you how to fly,
so that way when you go with him next,

303
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,434
he'll see how ready you are.

304
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,878
- That's a really good idea.
- Yep.

305
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,283
That's the J-Man's plan.

306
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:45,920
Who?

307
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,039
Me. My name's Justin.

308
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:49,840
J is the first letter.

309
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,924
It's not that hard.

310
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:55,448
Thanks. Wait, what's in it for you?

311
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,320
You're my little sister. Why's there always
gotta be something in it for me?

312
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,122
Because I'm your little sister.

313
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:04,850
And I guess one day,
if you'd like to do something nice for me,

314
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:06,849
then that'd be great.

315
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,610
Okay, let's go.

316
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,207
Wait, I'm gonna do something nice for you
right now.

317
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,403
- What?
- Don't use your toothpaste tomorrow.

318
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,046
Why not?

319
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:17,567
It's not toothpaste.

320
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:27,454
Easy now, easy now.

321
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:29,931
There you go.
That's how you make a bank left turn.

322
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,615
Wow, with you, it's easy.

323
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:33,489
Curl left, lean right, go left.

324
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:36,007
I know. Now let's try a right turn.

325
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,258
That was good.

326
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:43,131
Now your other right.

327
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,489
There you go.

328
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,497
- I can totally do this.
- I knew you could.

329
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,657
And now you'll be able
to show Dad you can.

330
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,931
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

331
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,384
That was so cool.

332
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:11,984
Be glad it wasn't a hot-air balloon.

333
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:13,902
They take forever.

334
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,380
Oh, look,
we're flying over Shea Stadium.

335
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,384
- Oh, my gosh.
- I got it, I got it.

336
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,220
Yeah, you got it.

337
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,620
Hey, you ready
for something really hard?

338
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:29,859
- Like what?
- The loop de loop.

339
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:31,621
Bring it.

340
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:40,383
That was so much fun.

341
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,900
Thanks, J-Man.

342
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:44,465
Who?

343
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,548
Oh, me.

344
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:47,821
You're welcome.

345
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:51,025
Now when Dad takes you on your lesson,
you'll already know what you're doing.

346
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:53,588
Okay, but if he starts yelling,
"Up is up and down is down,"

347
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:55,306
I'm gonna say something.

348
00:18:56,794 --> 00:19:00,265
- Okay, but I can still think it.
- Good.

349
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,663
So how's your man room?

350
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:03,749
Oh, I love it. It's so great.

351
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,265
I sleep like a baby in there.

352
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,795
Mom, Mom,
guess what Justin gave me.

353
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,399
Yeah, well,
it's a little too babyish for me,

354
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,832
because the J-Man
don't do stuffed animals.

355
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,793
That thing is going right back outside.

356
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:44,439
I'm sorry, honey, but it's terrible and cruel
what they do to those animals.

357
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:48,160
Plus, when I was in Justin's room,
that thing was checking me out.

358
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:50,602
But I found his eyeball under the couch.

359
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:51,841
Can I keep that?

360
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,278
Wash it off.

361
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:58,082
Hey, Mom, are Dad and Alex back yet?

362
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:01,280
No. And it's been over an hour.

363
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:04,960
If they're not back in ten minutes,
I want you to go down to the basement

364
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:07,649
and get that broom
and go looking for them.

365
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:09,521
There's a magic flying broom?

366
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,800
No.

367
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,248
I sweep when I'm nervous.

368
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,282
And I have a special broom for it.

369
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,084
That's not this one.

370
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:26,012
- It was fun.
- Dad, you were great.

371
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,283
You're such a good teacher.
And didn't I catch on?

372
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:31,287
You know, I gotta say, honey,
I'm impressed. You did great.

373
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:33,490
Thanks. I'm sorry about the last time.

374
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:35,207
- I should've listened better.
- No.

375
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,895
You know,
it wasn't about listening at all.

376
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:41,014
I didn't wanna teach you
because I didn't want you to grow up.

377
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:42,489
You're my little girl.

378
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,254
I'll always be your little girl.

379
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,446
No, you won't.

380
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,932
You're gonna start taking on
more grown-up responsibilities

381
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:49,172
and I have to let you.

382
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:52,210
Oh, I don't wanna be a grown-up,
I just wanna fly.

383
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,927
Well, actually, I wouldn't mind
a credit card too, you know,

384
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,890
so I can stop asking you for money.

385
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,251
We'll talk later about why
that doesn't make me feel better.

386
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,214
Oh, I'm so glad you're home, honey.

387
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,172
- How'd it go?
- She did great.

388
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,532
- Yeah?
- She listened. She's getting the hang of it.

389
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:12,051
I hate to say it,
but she did a little better than Justin.

390
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:14,856
Yep, you did better than me.

391
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,781
- Why are you winking at me?
- You're ruining it.

392
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:21,417
With a couple more lessons,
you'll be ready to get your carpet licence,

393
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:23,057
and then you can fly anywhere,

394
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:25,494
including to the store
to pick me up some pudding.

395
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,900
Which we never seem
to have enough of.

396
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:30,494
- Oh, thanks, Daddy.
- Sure, sweetie.

397
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:34,862
I don't know what you did, but thanks.

398
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:36,820
I didn't do anything.

399
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,667
Really?

400
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:40,506
I was watching the Mets game
the other day,

401
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:43,666
and there was a fly ball that went up
and never came down.

402
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:46,059
You wanna tell me something
about that?

403
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,783
It's...

404
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,308
<i>Hey, I'm Selena, and you're behind
the scenes of Wizards of Waverly Place.</i>

405
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,627
This is how we fly the carpet.

406
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:01,664
Watch where? Watch where?

407
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:02,908
Where? Everywhere.

408
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,102
Watch everywhere.

409
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,907
How can I watch everywhere?
