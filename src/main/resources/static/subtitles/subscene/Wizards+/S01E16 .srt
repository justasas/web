00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:14,333
''And that's when the great Chinese
wizard Li first used dragon scales

2
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:18,014
to build an impenetrable box
for safeguarding one's wand.

3
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:20,376
And then in the 12th century,
there were nine native--''

4
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:22,260
Time.

5
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:25,749
You're supposed to keep your oral reports
under 45 minutes.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,303
Otherwise, you start losing people.

7
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,824
Okay, Alex, you're up.

8
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,948
- Alex?
- Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:37,113
Your report on crystal balls:
history, usage, and manufacturing.

10
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:40,028
Crystal balls: usage and manufacturing.

11
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,270
Oh, l did mine on how to use
the really little ones for earrings.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,470
Cute, huh?

13
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:48,599
End of report.

14
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,078
You'll try it again tomorrow.

15
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:53,038
- Max, you're up.
- Okay.

16
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,844
Cauldrons:
proper use and maintenance.

17
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,720
How did all these people
get in my room?

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,921
- Oh, Uncle Kelbo.
- Uncle Kelbo.

19
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,162
Hello, future voters.

20
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:07,405
Sorry for dropping in unexpectedly.

21
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,014
Wanted to see my niece and nephews.

22
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:12,208
Kelbo, what did l say about poofing in
when you visit?

23
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,898
Oh, right, right, right.
lt sets off the smoke alarms.

24
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:16,972
So, what are you guys up to?

25
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:19,820
We're doing boring oral reports
without magic.

26
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,341
You know you're wizards, right?

27
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:25,736
Well, lots of times, Dad wants us to study
magic without actually using magic.

28
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,982
Well, that's because he can't do magic.

29
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:29,975
You know what l say.

30
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:33,897
Those who can't take hamburger
and turn it into delicious filet mignon,

31
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:35,463
teach.

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,631
Okay, fine.
l didn't become the family wizard.

33
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:42,906
But the things l can do
with plain hamburger will blow your mind.

34
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,152
He puts cheese in the meat.

35
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:47,950
Hey, l've had many, many, many
of his inside-out cheeseburgers.

36
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:49,995
Tell me about it.

37
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,468
So, what are you working on?

38
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,911
Oh, well, l'm doing a report
on the great Chinese wizard Li.

39
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,797
Chinese wizard Li? He's in my fave five.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,201
He'll come here,
he'll teach you all about his life.

41
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,165
He'll do anything to get away
from his witch of a wife, okay?

42
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:16,564
By the way,
his wife, she really is a witch.

43
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,375
Li, baby, how's that wife of yours?

44
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:27,377
Look, l would appreciate it
if l could teach them my way.

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,176
Yeah, you're right.

46
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,980
- No more distractions.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,698
- Oh, l've got presents.
- Oh, presents.

48
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:37,136
Justin, l got you some opera gum.

49
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,939
Oh, sweet. What's it do?

50
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,581
lt's opera gum. Try singing.

51
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,942
- l think l'll save that for the talent show.
- Great.

52
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:54,992
Max, for you,
l've got the leprechaun answer blower.

53
00:02:55,516 --> 00:03:00,115
Ask it a question, blow a bubble,
bubble pops, there's your answer.

54
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,151
- Give it a drive.
- Awesome.

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,957
Come on, baby. What are the answers
to my social studies test?

56
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:14,158
Yes-or-no questions only.
But l love that you think big.

57
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:17,725
And for my favourite niece who l love.

58
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,124
l have for you an Emoto-scope.

59
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,973
Okay. Look through it,
you'll see how people are really feeling.

60
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,005
Oh, cool. l've always wanted one.

61
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:35,491
Wow, either you're really excited
or your underwear is on too tight.

62
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:44,738
And Max has no idea what's going on.
Big shocker.

63
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:51,186
Wow, you're mad inside and out.

64
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,984
Because no one wants to finish
the wizard lesson.

65
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,706
He's right. Who wants to go the zoo?

66
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:59,026
- The zoo?
- The zoo?

67
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:00,712
Let me rephrase that.

68
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,304
Who wants to go to the zoo
as a monkey?

69
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:06,871
- You're gonna turn into a monkey?
- All of us are gonna be monkeys.

70
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,117
Sorry, Kelbo.
We frown on random uses of magic.

71
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,954
Okay. Let's talk about it.

72
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:15,677
l--

73
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,312
Great conversation.

74
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:16,433
Where are they? You know,
the burgers are almost done.

75
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,430
Kelbo does this every time.

76
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:22,641
Jerry, they're out having fun
with their uncle. lt's a good thing.

77
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:25,033
Do you really trust him
to watch our children?

78
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:28,841
No. But l trust our children
to watch him.

79
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,681
- We had so much fun at the zoo.
- Oh, yeah?

80
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,723
l didn't even turn them into monkeys,
just like you asked.

81
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,003
Oh, good.
So then those aren't monkey tails.

82
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:43,291
Chocolate?

83
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:50,047
Oh, man, l wanted to find out some stuff
with my leprechaun answer blower.

84
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,608
Oh, hey, let me ask it a question.

85
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,458
Who is my secret admirer?

86
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,297
l've been getting notes in my locker every
Wednesday for the past three weeks.

87
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:07,026
Oh, you can't ask it that.
lt only answers yes, no or l don't know.

88
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:10,257
ls it Cathy Antinocci?

89
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:15,508
ls it Corrie Montanio?

90
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,832
There's, like, 300 girls in my class.
This might take a while.

91
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:24,472
Okay. But just don't suck in,
because the answer juice tastes nasty.

92
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,238
Well, l'm glad you're back in time
to watch the basketball game, honey.

93
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,674
Dad, l don't wanna watch basketball.

94
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:33,912
Basketball?

95
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:38,040
l got tickets tonight for the basketball
game, up in the wizard luxury box.

96
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,235
You wanna go, Alex?

97
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,962
- What--? The wizard luxury box?
- Yeah. The wizard luxury box.

98
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:44,000
You know the scoreboard
over centre court?

99
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,166
The wizard luxury box is in that.

100
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,325
That sounds amazing. l have to see it.
Dad, can l go?

101
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,205
Wait. You don't wanna watch
the game with me

102
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,374
but now that Kelbo is gonna take you
to some fantastic wizard box, you wanna?

103
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,448
Well, but l don't think you'll be able to,

104
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:02,618
because your mother has a lot of stuff
for you to do around the house.

105
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,613
No, l don't.

106
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:06,251
Of course, she should go.

107
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,772
Sounds like a great way
to spend some time with your uncle.

108
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:12,461
Great. We gotta get going,
because we gotta beat wizard traffic.

109
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:14,976
- Oh, wait. Let me get my sweater.
- You're a wizard.

110
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:16,942
Thanks for reminding me.

111
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:19,503
<i>Cashemerus-appearus</i>

112
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,104
Soft.

113
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:27,226
- Hey, that's my sweater.
- Oh, l'm sorry, Mom. Let's talk about it.

114
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,632
Great conversation.

115
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,192
So we're in the scoreboard
and we can see everything and everybody

116
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:42,756
and they can't see us at all?

117
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:44,795
Yeah.
That's the beauty of the wizard box.

118
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,199
Except it's got one drawback.

119
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,044
<i>- Time out on the floor.
- Cover your ears.</i>

120
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,000
We're trying to get that removed.

121
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,726
So tell me more about this whole
secret admirer thing with your brother.

122
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:58,723
- You're the secret admirer.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:01,414
For the last three weeks,
l've been dropping notes in his locker

124
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:05,085
saying that he's cute and sweet,
and a bunch of other stuff he's totally not.

125
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:07,094
- You won't tell Dad, right?
- Of course not.

126
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,412
lt's a classic gag.

127
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,609
l got a finish for you.
Here's what you do.

128
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,537
You get yourself a genie, all right?

129
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,851
Dress your genie up
like his secret admirer.

130
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:19,978
The minute he spots the genie,
you capture his soul, put it in a lamp.

131
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:21,584
l love that one.

132
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:23,860
l wasn't gonna go that far.

133
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:25,944
Well, you're young.
You got a lot to learn.

134
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:28,742
- And l bet you could teach me a lot.
- Of course l could.

135
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,184
- Really?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,507
You have so much more fun with magic
than Dad does.

137
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:36,149
Okay. Here's a good one.
Hold your head like this.

138
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:38,783
<i>Cranium revolvus</i>

139
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:46,513
l love that.
l can't wait for our next school assembly.

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,314
<i>- And that's the half.
- Cover your ears.</i>

141
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,554
You're the best, Uncle Kelbo.

142
00:08:57,326 --> 00:08:58,919
Hey, what you got there?

143
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:00,766
l got another note
from my secret admirer.

144
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,123
They're coming every day now.

145
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:05,003
Wow, that's exciting.
Do you have any idea who it might be?

146
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,088
No. But she's probably pretty cute.

147
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:10,923
You see, she dots her l's with hearts,
and that always says cute.

148
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:14,408
And perfume.

149
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:17,575
Oh, l can't even smell it,
because of my allergies.

150
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,132
Yep, you're someone's dream.

151
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,571
Someone without pets, grass,
or common house dust.

152
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,977
You know, it's too bad
you don't know who she is.

153
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:28,494
Hey, l got a great plan to figure it out.
l'm gonna--

154
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,422
You don't wanna hear
my stupid plan, do you?

155
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:32,457
Oh, no, l wanna hear
all about your stupid plan.

156
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:34,145
Okay.

157
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:37,746
l'm gonna hide in this trash can
and stake out my locker.

158
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,985
- Brilliant.
- Yep, and Max is gonna help me.

159
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,511
- He's gonna be your lookout?
- No.

160
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:45,387
He's gonna stop the wrestling team
from shoving Eugene Troobnick

161
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:47,745
into the trash can
like they do every day at 3.

162
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,392
- l thought Eugene was homeschooled.
- He is. They go home and get him.

163
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,878
Where is she? l don't wanna teach
the magic safety course twice.

164
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:03,393
We don't wanna hear it once.

165
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:08,762
Sorry, we're late. But you know
how much l love the Old West.

166
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:13,081
lt was great. We went on a cattle drive,
and we took turns branding.

167
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,129
Wanna see mine?

168
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,210
Just kidding.

169
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:21,286
l'm gonna get me a sarsaparilla
and a nice hot bath.

170
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,046
Partner, l'd love me a sarsaparilla.

171
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:27,214
Whatever that is. l hope it's root beer.

172
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:28,408
Oh, no, no, no.

173
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:30,895
No, you were late, young lady,
and we've all been waiting.

174
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,137
And we're about to start
the magic safety lesson.

175
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:36,973
Did you guys know most wizard accidents
happen within a mile of the home?

176
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,416
That's because some people
have brothers, and they're not accidents.

177
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:43,426
Daddy, it's okay that l'm late,

178
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:46,222
because Uncle Kelbo's been teaching me
magic for the last few days.

179
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:47,749
ln fact, he and l were talking,

180
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,339
and he said that he could be
my wizard trainer instead of you.

181
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:51,985
- He did?
- l did?

182
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,674
- You did.
- Hold on.

183
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:56,314
You--

184
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:02,868
l did?

185
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:09,441
- Kelbo, was this your idea?
- No.

186
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:14,686
Usually, when a guy goes to get a glass
and does a spit take, it says, ''Surprise.''

187
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:18,561
But at the basketball game,
you said you would teach me.

188
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:22,319
Yeah, but l was talking more about,
like, pranks and things like that.

189
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,127
Oh, like, Dad has those birthday candles
that never blow out.

190
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:31,333
No, more like 50 wizards' heads
spinning completely around their bodies.

191
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,096
Oh, that's way better
than the burning-candles thing.

192
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:38,052
But you guys
love the candles with the:

193
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,772
And the:

194
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,493
And the:

195
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:47,342
Look, l'm honoured that you want me to be
your teacher, but that's your dad's job.

196
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:48,978
Dad's great with Justin and Max,

197
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:51,746
but l don't think l'm reaching
my full potential with him.

198
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,706
Well, l don't wanna stand in the way
of your full potential.

199
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,468
Maybe Kelbo should teach you.

200
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,106
Maybe you'll actually show up on time
for his lessons.

201
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:02,229
l will, Dad,
because you know what l was thinking

202
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:05,028
is that l learn more by doing
than l do by learning.

203
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,429
Then it's done.

204
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:12,310
Wait a minute. We get to pick
our wizard teachers? Oh, l pick--

205
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,998
Dad.

206
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:23,437
Excuse us.
We got a reservation for this garbage can.

207
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:26,479
Oh, this one's full.

208
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,439
There's a stinkier one upstairs.

209
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,888
See you tomorrow at 3, Eugene.

210
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,131
l don't know
how much longer l can hold out.

211
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:40,574
l'm the one in the trash can.

212
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:43,734
My leg was asleep, woke up,
and now it's asleep again.

213
00:12:44,658 --> 00:12:47,253
And l'm claustrophobic.

214
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:50,891
- Someone's coming. l'll act natural.
- Oh, yeah.

215
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:54,893
Yep, standing here,
being natural, whistling.

216
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:03,738
Oh, my gosh.

217
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:06,338
The lunch lady loves you.

218
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:08,746
lt makes sense.

219
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,228
My milk's always a little bit colder
than everyone else's.

220
00:13:11,753 --> 00:13:12,869
But what are you gonna do?

221
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:15,350
l'm gonna write her a letter
and tell her l'm flattered

222
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:18,514
and if l was 20 to 30 years older
and out of options,

223
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:20,230
maybe our love could flourish.

224
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,154
Okay. Let her down easy.
You don't want warm milk.

225
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,322
Hey, thanks for doing that for me, Doris.

226
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:31,675
Here's the left-handed mashed potato
scooper you wanted.

227
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:35,482
Thanks. A lot of people think they're
the same as an ice-cream scooper.

228
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,965
Those people would be wrong.

229
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,684
That was totally an ice-cream scooper.

230
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:53,008
So that's how you disappear and reappear
ten feet away. Pretty fun, huh?

231
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:55,369
That's about as magical as walking.

232
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:01,941
See? What did l tell you?
Not as much fun as poofing in.

233
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:03,172
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Alex.

234
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:04,703
You missed a good one today.

235
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,545
We disappeared and then reappeared
ten feet away.

236
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,499
- Wasn't it fun, guys?
- Yeah.

237
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:13,338
A little more exciting
than that ripening-fruit spell you taught us.

238
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,351
Okay. Well, have a good lesson.
The lair is yours, Kelbo.

239
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:20,185
Please, leave it how you found it.

240
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:22,272
Come on, guys.

241
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:27,068
Oh, hey, Max.
Does anybody want some salted nuts?

242
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:28,790
Sure, Dad.

243
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,672
Snakes of all different colours.
lt was--

244
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:42,398
- So, what's our lesson gonna be?
- Oh, l thought we'd take a nap first.

245
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:47,202
Well, l'll tell you what it's not gonna be,
and that's fruit ripening.

246
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:48,958
Because it's easy.

247
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,770
All you do is you buy the fruit,
you go into the future,

248
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,291
fruit's ripe, you eat it.

249
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:57,168
You're gonna teach me about time travel?
l've always wanted to learn that.

250
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:59,567
Oh, look, the wizard mail's here.

251
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:04,206
Uncle Kelbo,
can we please focus on the lesson?

252
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:05,897
Look, we'll read it.

253
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,177
We'll go back in time to before we read it,
and it will be like we haven't even read it.

254
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,617
A sea chimp sample? We used to get
these all the time when we were little.

255
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,144
They're just pets you put in water

256
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,064
and you don't have to feed
or play with them.

257
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:21,704
They're great. They die before your mom
makes you throw out the smelly water.

258
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:22,978
Open them up. Come on.

259
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:24,947
l don't know.
These aren't regular sea chimps.

260
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:28,144
They came in the wizard mail and Dad
doesn't like us to open the wizard mail.

261
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:29,672
Some of the stuff
can be dangerous.

262
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:33,026
Okay, l understand.
But your dad's not your teacher, l am.

263
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:35,751
And whatever goes wrong,
we can fix with magic.

264
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:37,946
All right.

265
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,231
But don't you need water
for sea chimps?

266
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,874
Apparently, not.

267
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,401
What--?

268
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:49,595
That's not gonna work.
Fix it with magic.

269
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:52,761
Okay, okay, okay. All right. l got it.

270
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,648
Okay. That's what l use in the shower
at cheap motels.

271
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:05,527
- Sorry.
- Well, use another one.

272
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,409
l can't. l'm panicking.

273
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:11,975
Guess who l am.

274
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:18,250
l'm the lunch lady.
l'm in love with Justin.

275
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:21,022
Give me a kiss, doll face.

276
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:26,377
Hey, why is Coach Gunderson here?

277
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,462
And why does he look so mad?

278
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,542
Which one of you is Justin Russo?

279
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:38,992
l think it's you.

280
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:43,229
You don't shower after gym
because you don't sweat.

281
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:45,627
Because you walk the mile.

282
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,952
Hey, coach.

283
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,552
What are you doing writing love letters
to my girlfriend, the lunch lady?

284
00:16:56,283 --> 00:17:00,404
She was putting letters in my locker
and l was just trying to let her down gently.

285
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,438
Excuse me. What's going on here?

286
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:05,999
Your son is trying to tell me
that he's getting love letters

287
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:08,565
from my girlfriend, the lunch lady.

288
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:14,093
The lunch lady?
May l see one of these notes?

289
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:15,489
l have one.

290
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:21,252
''l love your lightsaber nightlight.''

291
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:26,652
How would the lunch lady know
you have a lightsaber nightlight?

292
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,620
Alex.

293
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,741
Alex is my 1 4-year-old daughter
and she kind of torments him.

294
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,542
Well, really all of us.

295
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:39,747
l get it.

296
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,268
You still sleep with a nightlight?

297
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,389
Good.

298
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:47,590
The dark can be very, very scary.

299
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,907
Keep walking the mile.

300
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:57,035
And sorry l barked at you.
Lunch lady says l get pretty jealous.

301
00:18:03,322 --> 00:18:04,881
Dad.

302
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:08,355
- Honey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:09,965
l don't know what happened.

304
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:12,078
l know.
There's water coming out of the lair.

305
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:14,079
Oh, who's in the lair?

306
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,400
Alex and Kelbo.
They're doing their lesson in there.

307
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,123
Somebody's gotta get into the lair.

308
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:21,529
We don't know how much water.
lf we open it, it could flood the restaurant.

309
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:24,965
l know. Hey, you remember the spell
from today, transporting ten feet?

310
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:26,370
- Come on.
- l'm on it.

311
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:30,093
Whoa, wait, wait.
l'll be right back.

312
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:34,212
Okay, okay, l'm ready.
Better safe than sorry.

313
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,491
Justin, get me in there.

314
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,813
<i>Threemetrus-movetrus</i>

315
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:41,936
Hey, why can l breathe underwater?

316
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:46,057
lt's due to the fact
that we're sea chimps.

317
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,663
Oh, right. Do something.

318
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,140
Relax. l've been in way worse situations
than this.

319
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,389
lmagine the exact same thing,
except hot lava.

320
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:56,312
Why were you in hot lava?

321
00:18:56,713 --> 00:18:59,275
Suffice it to say,
l don't know how to make hot coffee.

322
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:03,153
You opened
the magic sea chimp packet, didn't you?

323
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,677
A little.

324
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:09,360
l know a spell that will fix this.
Alex, repeat after me.

325
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,362
- l'm a big knucklehead.
- l'm a big knucklehead.

326
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:15,076
Wait a second, that's not a spell.

327
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:18,124
No, l know.
l just wanted to hear you admit it.

328
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:22,680
Hey, if anyone here's a big knucklehead,
it's this sea chimp.

329
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:26,328
Gee, who knows a spell
that will get us out of this mess?

330
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,483
Anyone? Anyone?

331
00:19:28,612 --> 00:19:30,888
Oh, wait. l do.

332
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:33,688
All right. Alex, say this:

333
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:37,446
<i>Dehydratus-lougaines, apus-escapus</i>

334
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,288
<i>Dehydratus-lougaines, apus-escapus</i>

335
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,450
l just don't get it.

336
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:48,939
Kelbo said that he could fix it,
but he couldn't and Dad could.

337
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,622
But Dad's not even a wizard anymore.

338
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:53,214
Well, your dad was always
a much better wizard than l was.

339
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:56,420
That can't be true. Only one wizard
in each family can keep their powers.

340
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:58,904
lf Dad was the better wizard,
he'd keep his powers.

341
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,829
- You never told them, huh?
- Told us what?

342
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:05,633
Honey, l think they're old enough.

343
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:08,553
We're all getting go-carts?

344
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:11,949
No.

345
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,680
When Kelbo and your father competed
to see who'd keep their wizard powers,

346
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:21,790
it was your dad who won the contest.

347
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:23,878
What?

348
00:20:24,004 --> 00:20:29,161
But wizards can't marry non-wizards,
so your dad gave Kelbo his powers

349
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,558
so that he could marry me.

350
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,924
l think that's the sweetest thing
l've ever heard in my life.

351
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:40,169
Give your powers up for a girl?

352
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,290
- Yeah, right.
- What?

353
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:45,814
l can't be--

354
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:49,094
You guys,
if Dad hadn't given up his powers,

355
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:50,538
none of us would be here.

356
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,176
Yeah, l made the right decision then,
and l stand by it.

357
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:57,261
And l should've stood by you, Dad.
Will you still be my wizard teacher?

358
00:20:57,383 --> 00:21:00,855
Please, l beg of you, okay?
Take her on.

359
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:02,419
You know me. l can't handle it.

360
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:06,336
l get distracted, and then l get careless,
and then--

361
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:09,701
This towel is so soft.

362
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:15,352
Oh, and distracted.
You know, l get distracted.

363
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,750
We get it.
Honey, honey, l'll be your teacher.

364
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:21,268
But you're still my fun Uncle Kelbo.

365
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:24,869
l mean, who else gets to say that they
were a sea chimp even for a little while?

366
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,275
Actually, everyone l know.

367
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,079
l've made them all open up
that same packet

368
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:34,880
because l just love the pretty colours
on the outside.

369
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:38,927
- The basketball game is on.
- Oh, can l watch it with you?

370
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,126
Yes. l'd love that, honey.

371
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,800
Wait, wait, wait. l've got an idea.
We can all watch it.

372
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,246
Yeah! Yeah!

373
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:53,769
Hey, guys, wanna see something cool?

374
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,411
- Hold your heads like this.
- Oh, what are you talking about?

375
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:58,210
<i>Cranium revolvus</i>

376
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,733
Oh, this is bunk.

377
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:15,147
- Okay. You remember what to say, right?
- Yeah.

378
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:19,183
Excuse me. l was just checking to see
if your refrigerator's running.

379
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:21,701
As a matter of fact,
my refrigerator is broken.

380
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:25,150
lt's not running.
What do l do if it's not running?

381
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:26,674
She's onto us. Run.
