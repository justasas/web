1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,200
Okay, before l start class,

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,740
l wanna remind you all that your
grandmother is coming for a visit.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,430
And since she's your mother's mother
and not my mother,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,540
she doesn't know anything
about all of this.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,770
You mean,
how you won't turn on the a.c. in here?

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,080
No. l'm talking about magic.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,180
And when Grandma's here,
no one uses magic or talks about magic.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,380
- Done.
- Got it.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,990
Now let's talk about magic.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,990
The spell for today, body switching.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,190
Awesome.
Alex, you and me switch seats.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,960
Max, that's not magic.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,460
Dad, she never lets me sit there.
lt would be kind of magical.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,390
Fine. Switch spots.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,900
Anything to stop this discussion.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,310
Okay, body switching is a spell

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
where two people
can switch bodies with each other.

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,070
For instance, Alex, you and Justin
could switch bodies.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,580
Why would l wanna do that?
l can already do more pull-ups than him.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,950
Yeah, well, l'd switch bodies
with Chuck Norris,

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,680
do more pull-ups
and give you a roundhouse kick.

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,850
You just admitted
l can do more pull-ups than you.

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,550
Okay.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,790
Now, this is a tricky spell

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,260
because if you don't switch back
before sundown,

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,090
you'll be trapped
in the other person's body forever

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,430
with no way out.

28
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,970
And then you'll be a vampire
and you'll have to drink blood.

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,410
You really have to start reading
the handouts.

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,380
Alex, let's give it a try with me and you.

31
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,810
Now just say the two people's names,
and then this:

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,620
All right. Alex, Jerry:

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,820
Excellent, Alex.

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,090
You executed the spell perfectly.

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,570
Maybe your mom's right.
l could drop a couple pounds.

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,640
Why is it so hot in here?

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,710
Man, you have a lot of hair.

38
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,850
Smooth. Scratchy.

39
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,510
Smooth. Scratchy.

40
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,550
Alex, leave my face alone.

41
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,810
You guys get the idea.
Now switch us back.

42
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,450
Later.

43
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,290
l've got a little shopping to do first.

44
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,050
You don't have any money.

45
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,680
No.

46
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,060
But you do.

47
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,990
Would you just--? l just put you-- Alex!

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,820
Nice try, little girl.

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,980
What? l changed us back
as soon as you caught me.

50
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,690
l caught you at the register at the mall.

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,190
- Harper, what are you doing?
- Planning your quinceañera.

52
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,870
Oh, my gosh. Am l sick ?
What's a ''quincemono'' ?

53
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,640
lt's a party
celebrating a girl's coming of age.

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,800
That's why your grandmother's
coming to town.

55
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,880
You get to wear a pink beautiful dress.

56
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,680
And it's a Latin-American tradition

57
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,580
that comes from the words quince,
meaning 15,

58
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,880
and año meaning year, and ''era''
which just makes it sound Spanish.

59
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,320
Yeah. l'm sorry.

60
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,490
Everything after ''pink dress''
was just yuck, yuck, yuck.

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,860
But there are rituals symbolizing
your becoming a woman

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,690
that you go through with your dad.

63
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,200
What? l didn't give anybody
permission to become a woman.

64
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,530
l'm with Dad. You know me,

65
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,900
l don't do anything
Dad doesn't want me to do.

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,110
Well, look, l love being half-Mexican
and half whatever he is, but--

67
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,310
ltalian.

68
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,290
ltalian. l tell you that every time
you order pineapple on your pizza.

69
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,190
The point is, look at all this stuff.
lt's all too girly and lame.

70
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,450
No, thanks.

71
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,860
You'll come around.
Because for the dress,

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,760
l've embraced
traditional Mexican embroidery.

73
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,200
The shawl will be overnighted
from Oaxaca, Mexico.

74
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,240
What do you think?

75
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,540
l think you sound like you're choking
when you say ''Oaxaca.''

76
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,010
But maybe l could spill a little paint on it
and rip it and then l'll call it a dress.

77
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,340
And when l'm done,
it'll go great with these.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,680
No, no, no.

79
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,780
There's a ritual where you change
from a flat shoe to a high-heeled shoe.

80
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,590
Well, maybe l can change from
these high tops to even higher high tops.

81
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,920
No, Alex.

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,090
There are certain things
that people do at a quinceañera,

83
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,670
and we're going to do them.

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,570
lf l can't wear my sneakers
and l have to wear that, then we're not.

85
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,940
Alex, you can't cancel.

86
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,700
A lot of work has gone into this.

87
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,570
lt's my party. l can cancel if l want to.

88
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,080
lt's not just your party. lt's our party.

89
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,710
Oh, yeah? Well, it seems
like it's mostly just about you.

90
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,220
lf l see so much as a scratch on that bike,
someone's gonna eat spokes.

91
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,290
- Grandma.
- Lexie.

92
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,730
Hey, and Harple.

93
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,840
Here we go again. lt's Harper.

94
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,240
- Hi, Grandma.
- Yeah, hi.

95
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,770
How was your bicycle tour
around New England?

96
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,900
lt was long.

97
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,510
l was worried that the next time
l saw that bicycle seat

98
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,740
was gonna be in one of my x-rays.

99
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,510
Hey, where are Justin and Max?

100
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,090
l learned a new wrestling move.
l wanna try it out on them.

101
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,690
Jerry, that's the way
l left you a year ago: eating.

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,730
Hi, Magdalena.

103
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,260
And for your information,
l lost 5 pounds.

104
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,830
Pull up your shirt. l think l found them.

105
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,600
So how's the party planning
going, girls?

106
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,880
They're very sensitive
when you make fun of my weight.

107
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,190
l talked to your mom.

108
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,130
She thinks your dad
could drop 5 pounds too.

109
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,370
She's mostly upset about you.

110
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,030
Yeah, she'll get over it.

111
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,940
Well, l haven't seen her this upset
since she was 15

112
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,010
and she asked
if she could have a quinceañera

113
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,080
and we couldn't afford it.

114
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,870
She wanted one
and she couldn't have one?

115
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,010
Yeah.

116
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,120
ls that why she wants me
to have one so bad?

117
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,750
l don't know, mi hija. Maybe you're right.

118
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,120
Maybe she figured at least
she'd get to have one for you.

119
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,690
But it's just not me.
l really don't want one.

120
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,170
But that doesn't mean
she can't have one.

121
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,040
Don't be silly.
Your mother can't have a quinceañera.

122
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,150
She'd have to be a 15-year-old girl.

123
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,610
Stranger things have happened.

124
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,310
No, seriously, they have.

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,680
Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?

126
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,810
Doing what she always does
when she's upset:

127
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,790
Venting to customers
about what's wrong with her life.

128
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,420
lt's not like l have another daughter

129
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,590
l could give my hopes and dreams to,
you know?

130
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,860
Anyway, corned beef?

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,500
Hey, Mom, good news.

132
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,600
l changed my mind.
l want a party after all.

133
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,000
What? We're not ready.

134
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,630
l thought we agreed. No womanhood.

135
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,330
Oh, my gosh, you do?

136
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,070
You really do? l'm so excited.

137
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,110
lt's gonna be perfect.

138
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,120
- As long as it's over by sundown.
- Why sundown?

139
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,480
Because l hear that you can get
the banquet rooms for cheaper.

140
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,850
Yeah, that's what l heard. Good.

141
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,090
Oh, honey. l'm so excited.

142
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,220
lt's gonna be great.
You're gonna look beautiful.

143
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,230
You're gonna have a special dance
with each one of your brothers.

144
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,000
Wait a minute.

145
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,430
l heard ''dancing'' and ''brothers.''

146
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,270
l signed you up for a couple
of ballroom dance lessons

147
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,840
so you'll be ready
for Alex's quinceañera,

148
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,540
So these two eggheads have to dance?

149
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,580
Dad made a rule
against her being a woman.

150
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,310
Well, l thought Dad made a rule
against her calling us eggheads.

151
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,950
So l guess this womanhood train
is clearly leaving without me.

152
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,420
Look, as a father,

153
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,590
l am not gonna be left behind,
so l'm on board.

154
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,200
No, l'm not.

155
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,140
Okay, class.

156
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,140
On to something
that all but two of you can do.

157
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,680
The salsa.

158
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,120
Oh, salsa.
Were we supposed to bring chips?

159
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,090
And one, two, three.

160
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,850
Five, six--

161
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,120
This door should open out.

162
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,190
Hi, boys.
l came to pick up my grandsons.

163
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,820
But, Grandma, we're about to salsa.

164
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,060
lt's not just a zesty dip.

165
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,130
So these twinkle toes
are gonna teach you how to salsa?

166
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,570
Oh, fine. l love a good comedy.

167
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,870
Richard?

168
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,680
And one, two, three.

169
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,410
And add the three-step spin.

170
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,040
Wait, wait, wait. You call that a salsa?

171
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,680
lt looks more like you're trying
to get gum off your shoe.

172
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,920
Maybe it'd be better if you all left.

173
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,560
Fine.

174
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,170
l'll teach my grandsons how to salsa.

175
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,830
But, Grandma,
Mom expects us to learn how to dance.

176
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,200
lf l can make salsa,
l can dance the salsa.

177
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,440
You've heard the saying:
You dance what you eat.

178
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,580
Grandma, it's ''you are what you eat.''

179
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,980
Do you know how to dance?

180
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,810
- No.
- Then shut up.

181
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,180
One, two, three, wrestle.

182
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,130
You look beautiful.

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,630
Yeah. Pink and puffy.

184
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,830
Really pink and puffy.

185
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,000
But it's okay, because l'm not gonna be
the one wearing it. You are.

186
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,050
- Alex, Theresa:
- Wait a minute. Are you doing magic?

187
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,580
Why am l looking at myself?

188
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,020
Well, you may be looking
at yourself on the outside,

189
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,290
but it's me on the inside.

190
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,190
Hi, Mom.

191
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,200
You're in my body?

192
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,730
Yup. And you're in my body.

193
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,700
You are grounded as soon
as you get back in this body,

194
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,930
because l am not grounding myself.

195
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,840
Alexandra Marguerita Russo,
you promised your father

196
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,280
you wouldn't do magic
while your grandmother's visiting.

197
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,510
Mom, l know you're mad,
but just hear me out.

198
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,820
This is the only way you can enjoy
the ''quincenomo'' you've always wanted.

199
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,220
And then if you're mad, well,
then punish me. lt's okay, fine.

200
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,390
lt's ''quinceañera.''

201
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,260
Oh, my gosh.

202
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,890
l love this dress. l'm so pink and fluffy.

203
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,530
l'm 15 again.

204
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,010
That's right, Mom. You're 15 again.

205
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,110
Oh, l'm sorry.

206
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,950
Don't be sorry.

207
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,780
This is fantastic.
l'm having a quinceañera.

208
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,010
You think we can pull this off?

209
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,590
Trust me, it would not be the first time
l got away with magic.

210
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,820
l mean, it would totally be the first time.

211
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,360
- Alex?
- What?

212
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,290
No. You don't mean ''what,''
l mean ''what.'' What?

213
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,360
l talked to your mom
and she decided it was okay

214
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,970
for you to wear
the shoes you wanted.

215
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,630
Oh, my gosh.
When were you gonna tell me?

216
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,740
l was gonna tell you
before the thing happened.

217
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,010
- Before the thing that just happened?
- Yes, the big thing.

218
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,910
What big thing?

219
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,750
Nothing. l just decided
that l'm very okay with wearing high heels.

220
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,290
And this tiara.

221
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,760
l look like a princess.

222
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,100
Don't you think you should teach us
how to dance?

223
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,640
We've been telling Mom
that we've been going to lessons.

224
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,300
Don't worry.
There's plenty of time for dance lessons.

225
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,100
- When?
- The quinceañera is now.

226
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,740
Time got away from me, eh?

227
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,910
l need to get Alex a present.

228
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,710
Max, you go find me some Scotch tape.

229
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,220
And, Justin,
you go find me some wrapping paper.

230
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,410
Excuse me, ma'am.

231
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,990
You know, that necklace
really doesn't go with your outfit.

232
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,430
Oh, l know.
How about l buy it off of you?

233
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,360
What are we gonna do now?

234
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,690
You know,
l didn't want it to have to come to this,

235
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,360
but there's only one way out.

236
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,730
We have to break each other's legs.

237
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,370
Okay. Me first.

238
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,100
Got it.

239
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,610
Attention, everyone.

240
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,450
l present to you my daughter,
Alex Russo.

241
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,730
Thank you so much, everyone,
for coming to my quinceañera.

242
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,230
l just love saying ''my quinceañera.''

243
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,260
Everyone, all together. My quinceañera.

244
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,700
My quinceañera!

245
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,860
Alex is really into this.

246
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,200
Not to take all the credit,
but l always knew l could change her.

247
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,310
What?
You know l just like to eat the icing.

248
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,940
So does Alex.

249
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,210
Now l know where she gets it from.

250
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,540
Yeah.

251
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,950
And now it's time
for the symbolic shoe ceremony.

252
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,700
First, l will remove Alex's flat shoes,

253
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,530
and then l will put on
these high heel shoes.

254
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,100
Get your own, mister.

255
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,250
What l meant is,
l will put these high heel shoes on Alex

256
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,150
to symbolize a girl becoming a woman.

257
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,250
Mom.

258
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,430
Yes, son?

259
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,040
We got kicked out of dance class.
We never learned how to dance.

260
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,940
We're gonna look like complete fools.

261
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,140
You eggheads.
You're gonna ruin this whole thing.

262
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,910
Wait a minute. Eggheads.

263
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,880
Eating the icing off the cupcake.
Your lip.

264
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,680
And those high tops.

265
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,290
The body-switching spell.

266
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,390
You switched bodies with Mom,
didn't you, Alex?

267
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,360
Keep it down, nimrod.

268
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,020
Nimrod?

269
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,720
Alex.

270
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,060
That means Mom's out there.

271
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,190
That means
we're gonna have to dance with her.

272
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,100
And be good.

273
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,040
Okay.

274
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,440
Okay, how about l do the robot
and you pretend to oil me?

275
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,400
No, you egghead.

276
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,110
We can switch bodies with someone too.

277
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,650
The dance instructors.

278
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,080
Attention, everyone.

279
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,620
Justin and Max
have prepared to dance with Alex.

280
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,190
- Max, Candace.
- Justin, Richard.

281
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,470
What am l doing here?

282
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,900
l don't know.

283
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,410
But like all the other trouble spots
l've gotten into in all my life,

284
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,770
l'm gonna dance my way out.

285
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,550
Do you know how to salsa?

286
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,520
Yes, l do.

287
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,530
lf you were 15 years older,
l would ask you to dinner, mi amor,

288
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,570
Okay, that's really weird.

289
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,630
lt's time for the big finale.

290
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,900
Leap into my arms.

291
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,200
- Really?
- l've got you, baby.

292
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,840
Arms out. Hold it, girl.

293
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,320
That's it. You're a swan.

294
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,790
l'm a swan.

295
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,850
We made it back by sundown.

296
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,950
Did Alex and Mom switch back yet?

297
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,990
l don't think so.

298
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,230
Alex, the sun is going down.

299
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,400
Sundown? l've gotta switch back
or l'll be stuck in Mom's body forever.

300
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,600
Thanks, bro.

301
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,330
Alex, Theresa:

302
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,000
Theresa.

303
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,940
Ma.

304
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,810
You know, your father always wanted
to give a speech at your quinceañera.

305
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,280
He even wrote one.

306
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,490
And now that we are here
at your daughter's,

307
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,180
l'm going to read it to you.

308
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,190
''My dearest daughter, Theresa.

309
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,560
When you were born at 6:02 p.m.,

310
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,960
it was a rainy, rainy day.

311
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,470
l knew
because l hadn't fixed the roof yet.''

312
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,940
- So how many pages?
- l don't know. Like 30.

313
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,910
You know,
he was always fixing that roof.

314
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,310
Always, huh?

315
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,940
l'm a klutz.

316
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,720
Oh, well, that's all right, Maxamillions,
because you know what?

317
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,340
l have it memorized.

318
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,620
l just would hold the papers for, you know,
that sort of dramatic effect.

319
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,060
Let's see, now where was l?
Where was l?

320
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,390
Oh, yes, the roof. The roof, okay.

321
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,230
And then when you started walking,

322
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,900
l heard the pitter-patter
of both your feet and rain.

323
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,130
l still hadn't fixed the roof.

324
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,910
Hey, hey, Grandma.
You wanna wrestle now?

325
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,380
No. ln a minute, okay, mi hijo?

326
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,110
This is a very important,
emotional moment.

327
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,690
Oh, so are you saying you're chicken?

328
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,520
No. l'm just gonna start
from the very top.

329
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,020
We're supposed to be crying here.
My dear--

330
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,260
Oh, it's on.

331
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,890
We'll pick this up later.

332
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,030
That's not fair.

333
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,500
Alex. Alex, the sun's going down.

334
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,970
Hurry, say it. Say it.

335
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,170
Alex, Theresa:

336
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,040
These high heels are lame.

337
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,350
Get them off me.

338
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,850
She's back.

339
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,490
Alex, l just wanna thank you,

340
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,420
because the quinceañera
was everything l hoped for.

341
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,050
You know, Grandma was reading me
this letter that Grandpa wrote for you.

342
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,530
You should really hear it.

343
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,660
Oh, the one about the leaky roof?
He read that for everything.

344
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,860
Birthdays, weddings.

He even read it when he won 10 bucks
off a lotto scratcher.

346
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,040
Well, l'm glad you liked it
and l'm glad it's over.

347
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,480
Well, it's not over yet, young lady.

348
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,980

Oh, Alex, you really are growing up.

350
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,160

l am so proud of you, honey.

354
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,210
Even when l break the rules
and use magic behind your back?

355
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,680
Even then.

356
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,510
Oh, honey, are you crying?

357
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,490

Really?

360
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,460
What if l told you
how much this quinceañera cost?

361
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, my gosh.

362
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,690
Here it comes again.

363
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,040
Well, guys,
you managed to refrain using magic

364
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,870
the whole time Grandma's been here.

365
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,840
- You're welcome.
- lt wasn't easy.

366
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,880
Took a lot of restraint.

367
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,510
Well, you should really pat
yourselves on the back.

368
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,020
Well, l've never been
in this room before.

What room do you think it is?

371
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,690
The wrestling room.

372
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,160
Best two out of three.

373
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,970
Gotcha.
