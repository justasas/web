1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,220
Hey, Mom. Okay, so you and Dad
crossed over into New Jersey, right?

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,530
Then it's official. l'm in charge.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,900
Because what if there was a tidal wave
or something?

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,980
l know, l know, l know. But if there was,
then would l be in charge?

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,910
Yes.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,720
All right. l'm in charge.

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,720
Oh, look, a tidal wave.
Now you're in charge.

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,600
Not funny, Alex.
This is my new sweater.

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,390
Justin, when you wear it every day
for a week, it's not new,

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,120
it just needs a wash.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,710
Okay, l washed it. You're welcome.

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,170
Oh, well, have a good day, guys.
l'm out of here.

13
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,580
Alex. Where do you think you're going?

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,210
- l'm meeting Riley at the street fair.
- You're not going to the street fair.

15
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,050
And you have to listen to me
because Mom and Dad left me in charge.

16
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,460
Justin, most 16-year-old boys have fun
when their parents leave town.

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,560
Being the authority figure is fun.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,460
Now, l've prepared
a wizard-training review sheet

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,540
on some spells that l feel
Dad hasn't covered enough in class.

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,770
''Murrieta-animata''? l know this one.

21
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,240
lt's the one that makes you think
you're the boss of me.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,110
No. Murrieta-animata is a spell for
making an inanimate object come to life.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,780
Thanks, that's the answer. Well,
l'm done with my review. See you later.

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,770
And then Jessica Miller
told Marianna O'Shaunnesy

25
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,240
l shouldn't be able to get out of gym
if no one else could,

26
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,780
so then Marianna said that--

27
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,880
- Riley.
- What?

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,040
You were staring
at Marianna O'Shaunnesy.

29
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,980
l wasn't staring.

30
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,520
ls it because she's got bigger hips
than l do? Because l think they're fake.

31
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,020
l was just looking, that's all.
Alex, why do you always get so jealous?

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,690
Just looking, huh? As in, just browsing?
As in, doing a little shopping around?

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,240
What are you in the market for, Riley?
A new girlfriend?

34
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,200
Hey, honey.

35
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,470
You're doing it again.

36
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,840
Honey. Honey.

37
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,180
He's giving out free honey samples.
l mean, come on, Alex, this is crazy.

38
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,550
l don't think we should go out anymore.

39
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,050
What?

40
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,050
You're breaking up with me?

41
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,890
But we're so good together.
l mean, we have so many good memories.

42
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,460
Remember, you, me and the penguins
at the zoo?

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,360
- What are you doing?
- l'm acting out our favorite memories.

44
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,330
And then that one time
when we went for a walk.

45
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,500
And then we went down the stairs.

46
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,400
Alex, l'm breaking up with you.

47
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,910
Okay, l'm not a very good mime.
l'll admit that.

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,880
No, it's because
you're constantly jealous.

49
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,150
l'm not constantly jealous.
l just really like you.

50
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,950
Well, you have a funny way
of showing it.

51
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,190
No, l don't. l'm constantly jealous.
That's how l show it.

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,430
Okay, l'm done with my wizard homework.
Can l watch TV now?

53
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,400
Sit. Let me check it.

54
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,840
Yes. You might wanna look at spell five.

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,640
l got spell five wrong?

56
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,270
No, spell five is the only one
you got right.

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,840
You're meaner than Dad.

58
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,540
Thank you.
You're dumber than l thought.

59
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,850
Well, then you should've thought
that l was dumber. Now who's dumb?

60
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,060
Okay. You need to think harder
about the murrieta-animata spell.

61
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,130
lf you leave an animated object animated
too long, then it develops emotions.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,620
You mean,
if l turned this doll into a person,

63
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,760
it'd feel bad
about being stuck in the box?

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,240
Don't touch that!

65
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,400
That's Calico Woman
in her Legion of the Superladies uniform.

66
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,010
They only made 1000
of these lovely ladies.

67
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,770
lsn't that right, Calico Woman?

68
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,110
So, what you're saying is,

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,190
there's 999 other guys
who couldn't get a girl to talk to them?

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,280
Don't listen to him.

71
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,630
- Riley broke up with you?
- Yeah.

72
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,400
- But l'm being really strong.
- Well, that's good.

73
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,440
- You want some churro?
- Sure.

74
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,760
Riley used to buy food
and let me eat some of it.

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,300
You guys were so good together.

76
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,180
Remember that time
you went to the penguins?

77
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,020
Oh, that did look weird.

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,720
Hey, Alex,
l heard that you and Riley broke up.

79
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,230
What do you say you and l go out?

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,030
Excuse me, Ken? Hi.
We're going out. Like, right now.

81
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,800
Yeah, l've been meaning
to talk with you about that.

82
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,170
This will only take a second.
Wait for me.

83
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,340
l can't believe Riley thinks l'm jealous.

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,780
You know, Riley would be jealous too
if l were looking at other guys all day.

85
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,040
You know what you should do?

86
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,480
You should have an open and honest talk
with Riley to establish trust.

87
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,180
Then you'll have a firm foundation
for the future.

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,650
That sounds like something
old couples in their 20s would do.

89
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,300
Then what are you thinking?

90
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,730
l'm thinking l'll find a boyfriend
who's cuter than Riley,

91
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,500
make him jealous, and then
he'll wanna get back together with me.

92
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,440
Yeah. What am l thinking?
We're not in our 20s.

93
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,510
We don't watch the news.

94
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,780
So see any cute guys around here?

95
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,050
l see a lot of cute guys.

96
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,920
Hey, Harper, did you see that booth

97
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,430
where they sell rock families
with the eyes glued on them?

98
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,960
- Where?
- Around the corner--

99
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,120
Did they have any with two parents,
one teenage girl

100
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,030
and a smallish, shriveled-up grandma?

101
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,530
l don't...

102
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,370
Murrieta-animata

103
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,910
That pole hurts.

104
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,210
Well, hello, handsome.

105
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,490
Hello. Hello to you.

106
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,680
Hello. Hello.

107
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
l can say hello.

108
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,160
Why can l say hello?

109
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,790
l'll explain that later.

110
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,990
The important thing is,
is l'm Alex and your name is Manny.

111
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,590
Yeah, Manny. Last name Kinn.
Manny Kinn. Okay.

112
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,040
And you're my new boyfriend.

113
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,870
Whoa, this is moving too fast.

114
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,030
- l just got off that pole.
- Let's go.

115
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,550
No.

116
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,940
You know, you look so familiar.
Where do l know you from?

117
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,480
You know, you look just like my uncle.
But they took him away a long time ago.

118
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,210
l mean, that's okay, because it was just me
in the window then for a while.

119
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,780
What did you put in there? And why?

120
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,320
- Why...?
- l don't know.

121
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,250
This is my mom, my dad,
my grandma and me.

122
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,950
Your dad's a pirate?

123
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,990
Oh, my gosh.
One of my dad's eyes fell off.

124
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,320
Nobody move. Nobody move.

125
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,900
What are you doing?

126
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,170
l'm cleaning Calico Woman
because l'm selling her on the lnternet.

127
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,900
Well, her and Man Boy.

128
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,840
Even the box has to be
in mint condition.

129
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,470
Oh, by the way, did you clean your room
or just shove everything under the bed?

130
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,180
Cleaning my room
is shoving everything under my bed.

131
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,890
That's why beds have an underneath.

132
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,320
Think.

133
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,930
Hey, everybody.
This is my new boyfriend, Manny.

134
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,030
Hey, everybody. l can say hello.

135
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,930
Hello. l'm Justin.

136
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,930
Alex, what happened to Riley?

137
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,550
We broke up like an hour ago.
Where have you been?

138
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,040
After grieving over Riley for 15 minutes,
l met Manny and it was love at first sight.

139
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,090
- Right, Manny?
- Right.

140
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,250
No,

141
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,360
l didn't even know what it was like
to feel alive until l met Alex.

142
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,290
Oh, that's so sweet.
You guys make such a cute couple.

143
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,590
Alex, it's like Manny was made for you.

144
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,130
You have no idea.

145
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,290
- Manny, this is Harper.
- Nice to meet you.

146
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
l'm looking for an eye.

147
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,760
No.

148
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,570
And my brother Max.
And my older brother, Mr. Russo.

149
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,980
And those are Mr. Russo's dolls.

150
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,110
Found it.

151
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,240
Oh, this isn't my dad's eye.
lt's a button.

152
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,490
Wait, buttons don't have legs.

153
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,320
lt's a bug!

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,800
Alex.

155
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,590
Can l talk to you for a second?

156
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,570
l don't know, Manny and l are pretty busy
talking about how l don't get jealous, but--

157
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,700
Sure.

158
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,440
l feel horrible about our breakup.

159
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,980
l was stupid.

160
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,250
l didn't know what it felt like to feel jealous
until l saw you with that guy over there.

161
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,620
His name is Manny.

162
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,960
l prefer to call him ''that guy over there.''

163
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,220
What are you saying?
You wanna get back together?

164
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,100
l would.

165
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,360
Yes.

166
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,430
Well, l don't-- Okay.

167
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,430
Really?

168
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,010
Well, what about that guy over there?

169
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Oh, don't worry.
Manny's used to being stood up.

170
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,010
lt's an inside thing.

171
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,480
Stood up.

172
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,920
You're breaking up with me?

173
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,150
Yes.

174
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,960
And you're okay with it, because
l'm gonna turn you back into a mannequin.

175
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,230
All right.

176
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,390
Garibay-immobilitay

177
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,600
Okay, one more time.

178
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,170
Garibay-immobilitay

179
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,940
Excuse me.

180
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,910
Stay.

181
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,210
Justin, a question
completely out of the blue.

182
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,260
But what's the spell to un-animate
something you've brought to life?

183
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,920
Garibay-immobilitay.

184
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,350
Well, l tried.

185
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,790
So, Manny, this is your lucky day.
You're free to live your life.

186
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,030
You'll do great out there,
a handsome kid like you. Okay.

187
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,690
- You enjoy.
- All right.

188
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,070
You know, that's too bad.
l really liked Manny.

189
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,100
And he wears the same sweater as me,
which l saw on a mannequin

190
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,730
that looked a lot like Manny Kinn.

191
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,180
Manny Kinn.

192
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,510
Manny Kinn.

193
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,740
Mannequin.

194
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,320
Yes, l animated the mannequin
from the store.

195
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,790
God.

196
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,920
What's the big deal?

197
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,360
You can't be using magic
without my permission.

198
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,230
That's complete disrespect
of my authority.

199
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,960
Hey, l tried to change him back,
but it didn't work.

200
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,260
What...?

201
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,930
lf you bring something to life
and it develops emotions,

202
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,130
you can't change it back.

203
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,330
Manny's in love with you.

204
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,610
Don't be ridiculous. He's a mannequin.
He can't be in love with me.

205
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,120
Alex, look, l brought you one flower
for every minute that l've loved you.

206
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,090
Oh, no.

207
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,980
Manny, we broke up,
don't you remember?

208
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,620
You have to stop following me.

209
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,290
l can't, Alex. l'm in love with you.

210
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,090
You get me.

211
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,170
You taught me how to drink from a straw
without poking myself in the eye.

212
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,270
Remember the time l kissed the duck?

213
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,070
But what if someone else got you?

214
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,580
And then you could have
even better times with them.

215
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,840
Really? Do you know that someone?

216
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,250
l think l do. She's a real doll.

217
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,880
She's a friend of my brother's.

218
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,460
More wizard homework?

219
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,150
Dad doesn't even make me
do homework on Friday.

220
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,990
Max, if you put it off until Sunday night,

221
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,160
then l won't be able
to put you kids to bed early.

222
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,270
Have a little quiet time for myself.

223
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,910
What are you gonna do,
light some candles and take a bath?

224
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,840
My quiet time is my quiet time.

225
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,220
Okay, so you're a teenage boy
who drinks tea

226
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,360
and likes to take baths.

227
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,290
Like l'm not gonna tell anyone about that
on the lnternet.

228
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,060
Hey. You get down here, young man.

229
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,790
That's it.

230
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,280
Okay.

231
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,650
Murrieta-animata grande

232
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,820
Oh, those twist-ties really hurt.

233
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,560
Manny, meet Calico Woman.

234
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,000
Calico Woman, meet Manny.

235
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,120
You two have a lot in common.

236
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,760
l don't have anything in common
with a superhero.

237
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,200
You're so wrong, Manny.
Who likes to say hello?

238
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,910
Hello.

239
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,270
Hello.

240
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,140
Who here is dishwasher-safe?

241
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,080
That's the only thing about me
that's safe.

242
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,150
See? You two are gonna be
so happy together.

243
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,220
l'm still in love with her.

244
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,030
When you say that,
that makes me really mad.

245
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,470
Yeah, that's called jealousy.

246
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,570
l don't like that feeling.

247
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,350
There. See? All done.
He's perfectly happy with her.

248
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,110
Now nothing could go wrong.

249
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,020
Oh, l hope l didn't jinx that.

250
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,760
And right after dinner, you have to take
a shower and then get in your pajamas.

251
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,490
Can l take a shower in my pajamas?

252
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,620
Then you would be wet,
your pajamas would be wet

253
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,660
and your entire bed would be wet.

254
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,670
But if everything's wet,
is anything really wet?

255
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,000
Like when you're totally underwater,
you're not really wet.

256
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,740
Yes, you are.

257
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,540
Calico Woman's gone. Where--?

258
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,310
Well...it says right here,
''No chains can hold her.''

259
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,880
Chains are a lot stronger
than a cardboard box.

260
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,150
Alex.

261
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,130
See?

262
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,730
Max! What are--?

263
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,630
Alex, don't leave me.
Look, look, l won you a stuffed gorilla.

264
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,670
All right, enough.
This has gotta stop, Manny. lt's over.

265
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,440
- But l'm in love with her.
- Seriously, it's over.

266
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,700
Otherwise, that pretty face
ain't gonna be so pretty no more.

267
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,940
Oh, no, you're not gonna change my head
into that featureless knob.

268
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,510
All right, that's it.

269
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,420
Wait. Wha--?

270
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,680
Riley, wait.

271
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,250
Manny!

272
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,330
Manny, l love you.

273
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,330
Okay, let's split up and find Alex.

274
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,660
Because where Alex is,
that's where my Calico Woman doll is.

275
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,060
Well, there's Manny.

276
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,970
Oh, and there's Riley.

277
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,710
Oh, found Alex.

278
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,710
Manny!

279
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,210
And Calico Woman.

280
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,740
Man, she is huge.

281
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,320
And alive.

282
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,910
Manny. Manny.

283
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,040
We were both made in China.

284
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,280
We need a volunteer.

285
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,280
Who wants to sit in this dunk tank?

286
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,320
- l'll go in.
- Excellent. Excellent.

287
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,480
Just climb right up there.

288
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,620
Okay, who would like the first shot

289
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,100
at sending this handsome fella
into this dunk tank?

290
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,190
l would.

291
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,830
Riley.

292
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,060
What are you doing?

293
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,200
l'm gonna teach Manny that no one
comes between me and my girl.

294
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,140
l know you don't like jealousy on me,
but on you, it is so hot.

295
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,320
No!

296
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,680
Oh, my God,

297
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,890
Wait up.

298
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,490
- Alex.
- Oh, no, what happened to Manny?

299
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,320
Well, it looks like he got wet.

300
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,700
You know, sometimes
water can make a spell wear off.

301
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,400
How do you know that?

302
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,340
Because the spell just wore off.

303
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,640
Manny?

304
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,220
What have they done to you?!

305
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,450
What's going on here?

306
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,110
Alex, that guy over there
just turned into giant doll pieces.

307
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,060
That's it. l'm calling Waverly Place
Street Fair security.

308
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,730
No, no, no. No need to do that, okay?

309
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,630
l have to tell you something.
l have to tell everybody something.

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,460
Ladies and gentlemen, the man
you just saw in the dunk tank is really a--

311
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,870
- Alex.
- Magician.

312
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,240
The Great Manic-keeny.

313
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,110
And for his big trick,
he has disappeared in the dunk tank,

314
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,620
leaving behind
a disassembled mannequin in his place.

315
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,650
Ta-da.

316
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,060
Oh, yeah.

317
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,700
And how about a hand
for his lovely assistant?

318
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,500
Yeah.

319
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,830
All right.

320
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,100
Watch the outfit,
you're going back in the box.

321
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,300
l never liked you.

322
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,830
Hey. Hey. Hey, you get back here.

323
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,840
l thought Manny was just a mannequin
who got turned into a person

324
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,890
and then back into a mannequin.

325
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,420
But he was really just a magician.

326
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,350
Great show. Great show. Great show.

327
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,800
Look, Alex, see what happens
when you break the rules?

328
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,990
Things end up working out for me?

329
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,200
No.

330
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,210
You almost exposed us as wizards
and l lost Calico Woman.

331
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,680
She was worth 100 bucks.

332
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,180
l got my boyfriend back,
and l'll give you 100 bucks. Who got hurt?

333
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,180
l did because you didn't respect me
being in charge.

334
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,490
Why is that so important to you?

335
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,750
What about living? Having fun?

336
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,860
Doing stuff to tell stories about?

337
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,860
Like this.
This is gonna be a great story to tell.

338
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,130
The only people you could tell the story to
would ground you.

339
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,540
lf you'd calm down every once in a while,
l would tell you stories.

340
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,440
Like, l bet you've always wondered what
happened to your lightsaber and cape.

341
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,050
Alex, how am l supposed to be calm
when you tell me stuff like that?
