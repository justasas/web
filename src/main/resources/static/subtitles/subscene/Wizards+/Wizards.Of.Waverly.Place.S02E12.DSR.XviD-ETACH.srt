1
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,737
I'd like to talk with you about
that letter of recommendation

2
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:10,139
to my alma mater,
Clementine College.

3
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:11,774
Are you gonna write me that letter?

4
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:14,460
A good recommendation from
you will guarantee me a spot

5
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,743
in that corral.

6
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:20,963
Look, Justin, I know the
teenage years are about

7
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:22,775
your search for an identity.

8
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:25,888
But the western thing, that's mine.

9
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,800
Sorry, Mr. Litate.

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,518
Now, we need a director for the
school's production of Peter Pan.

11
00:00:32,553 --> 00:00:35,730
And I think that
director should be you.

12
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:38,370
Pull it off,
and I'll write that letter.

13
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,081
Uh, no offense, but isn't
that kind of blackmail?

14
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,957
Blackmail is just the
sort of thing they teach

15
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,731
at good old Clementine College.

16
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:50,106
Except they call it "ethics."

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,979
Good luck, Mr. Director.

18
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:56,188
People are already talking about
you direing the school play.

19
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,831
That's perfect. I got the
role of Peter Pan in the can!

20
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:01,835
Uh, not so fast, Zeke.

21
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,340
I need to find the best
actor by holding auditions.

22
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:06,914
Uh, well that's perfect.
I have just the audition piece.

23
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:09,219
I took my report on
Mexico's economy,

24
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:11,722
set the whole thing to music.
Check it out.

25
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:15,762
* Mexico, Mexico *

26
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:19,268
* Is a unique and
emerging marketplace *

27
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:21,439
* Ohhh Mexico! *

28
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:22,976
* Ohhh Mexico! *

29
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:24,378
- I gotcha.
- * Mexico... *

30
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:26,783
I got it. Yeah.

31
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:29,586
Auditions will be tomorrow.

32
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,726
Please bring something else.

33
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:43,040
Tribeca Prep,

34
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:45,476
autions for a Justin Russo
production of Peter Pan

35
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,647
will be held tomorw.

36
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,318
And since I have your attention,

37
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:54,654
I'm closing in on who put my gym
clothes on the roof. Eric Winer.

38
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,357
Yeah!

39
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,967
Miss Russo. I was filing
your delinquent slip

40
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:05,570
when I noticed you hadn't fulfilled

41
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:07,940
your extracurricular requirement.

42
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:12,478
So I signed you up for
Locker Refurbish Club.

43
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:15,883
No, thanks.

44
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:20,490
Perhaps you'd like me to define
the word "requirement" for you.

45
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:24,128
- No, thanks.
- You have to!

46
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:28,636
You can't be too busy
being cute or charming,

47
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,072
and being you is not
a full-time job.

48
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:36,812
Well, the thing is...

49
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:38,548
Um...

50
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:41,552
I'm gonna be in my brother's play.

51
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:44,255
And you know how I'm
always telling you things

52
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,625
and then later on,
you find out they aren't true?

53
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,762
That's 'cause I'm a good actor.

54
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:54,501
So you're too busy
in the school play

55
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,604
to be in Locker Refurbish Club?

56
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,475
Well, I was ready to take on both,

57
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:01,878
but you make an excellent point.

58
00:03:01,913 --> 00:03:03,113
Glad we had this talk.

59
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,988
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

60
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,024
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

61
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,260
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

62
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,761
* Yes please *

63
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,765
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

64
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,900
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

65
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:21,036
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

66
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,571
* That's what I said *

67
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:26,543
* Everything is not what it seems *

68
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:29,579
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

69
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:33,283
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

70
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:37,888
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

71
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:41,191
* Everything is not what it seems *

72
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:45,163
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

73
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:48,734
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

74
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:52,905
* Because everything is not *

75
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,109
* What it seems *

76
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:00,110

77
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,416
Hey, what are you up to, Max?

78
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,353
Well, I'm the new reviewer
for the school newspaper.

79
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:07,388
I've always known you
had promise, honey.

80
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:08,890
Now I know what it was for.

81
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,294
But if only I could think
of something to review...

82
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:16,930
Hmm. - Like a movie called
Elasto-Man Snaps Back,

83
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:20,500
playing at 3:45 or 4:15.

84
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,368
You know, you're right.

85
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:25,137
A writer needs inspiration.
I'll take you.

86
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,872
Let me finish this order, OK?

87
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,010
And that is how you get your mom

88
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:35,279
to take you to the
movies before homework.

89
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:40,150
Mom, did you hear that?
He's using his school activities

90
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:41,885
to get you to take
him to the movies.

91
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:44,320
No, honey. I'm using
his school activities

92
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:46,188
to cut my shift in half.

93
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,393
Harper, you know how you
said you loved the theater?

94
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:53,128
I never said I loved the theater.

95
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:56,331
Oh, I just assumed, the way you
dress in all those costumes.

96
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,634
Costumes?

97
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:02,336
OK, let's start over.

98
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,671
I'm gonna be an understudy
in Justin's play.

99
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,007
It should be easy because I
understudy for most things.

100
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,775
But understudies only get on stage

101
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,944
if the other actor
gets sick or injured.

102
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,747
Exactly. And you have perfect school
attendance because you never get sick.

103
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,983
That's why you're gonna be Tinker
Bell and I'm gonna be your understudy.

104
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:22,086
Alex, you and I being involved in the
same activity is not a good idea.

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,887
You know how competitive I am.

106
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,024
I'll crush you like a bug,
just like I did in Skee-Ball.

107
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,393
OK, let's try this again.

108
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:34,129
You play Tinker Bell. I'm your
understudy. You'll never miss.

109
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:36,098
I'll never go on. Everyone's happy.

110
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,400
OK, I guess we're not competing.
'Cause I will crush you.

111
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,437
Why don't you go upstairs
and start my homework.

112
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:45,005
I'll make us some sandwiches.

113
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,207
Oh, thanks, Alex.
That's so generous of you.

114
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:53,681
One Italian sub and a
tuna salad on wheat.

115
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,182
Got it!

116
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:00,353
- Hey, Justin.
- Hey, what's up?

117
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,288
Oh, just makin' some sandwiches.

118
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,124
That's a nice dollhouse.

119
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,927
It's a diorama for the school play.

120
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:12,696
Ah, that's right.
I heard you were directing that.

121
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,265
So, uh, who were you thinking
for Tinker Bell's understudy?

122
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:19,600
Oh... Tinker Bell's understudy.

123
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:22,602
You want to be Tinker Bell's
understudy. Well, um...

124
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,771
You're gonna have to
audition like everyone else.

125
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:27,406
Why? You know I'm a good actor.

126
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,842
I've been acting like
I like you for years.

127
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,977
No one thinks you like me.

128
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:33,945
But I really do and
I act like I don't.

129
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:35,746
Pshh! That's acting.

130
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:39,216
Alex, your order's up. Which table?

131
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,584
Oh, I'll take those.

132
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:42,252
Aw, that's my girl, always helping.

133
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,522
Mom's helping Max.
Alex is serving sandwiches.

134
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:48,792
Where would we be
without our ladies?

135
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:53,829
Um... So, what do we
got going on here?

136
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:55,498
I'm directing the school play.

137
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:58,867
Ah, my son's a director.
That's fantastic!

138
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,601
I don't know if you
know this about me,

139
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:03,103
but I've dabbled in
the theatre arts.

140
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:04,737
- You, Dad?
- Oh, yeah.

141
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:07,538
I directed a lot of high school
plays when I was your age.

142
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:12,142
And as a fellow director,
I'm gonna make sure that you succeed.

143
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:14,778
Any questions,
you come to your old man.

144
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:18,547
I have one. Should I let Alex
be Tinker Bell's understudy?

145
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:21,416
Which one of these
is the understudy?

146
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:23,450
Uh...

147
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,186
- This one?
- Yeah.

148
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:31,057
- Got it?
- Oh, yeah.

149
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,729
I just always wanna be a
little boy and to have fun.

150
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,596
This world moves pretty fast,
you know.

151
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,797
It's not long before
you're carrying a briefcase

152
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,465
and heading to work,
day in and day out. For what?

153
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,333
These are the best
days of our lives.

154
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:49,436
Have a great summer.
I'll see you guys next year!

155
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,908
Was that your eighth
grade graduation speech?

156
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,377
I was told it was inspiring.

157
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,878
And it was!

158
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,382
The role of Peter Pan
goes to Zeke Beakerman.

159
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,118
Whoo! Yes!

160
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:13,155
Next up, reading for the
role of Tinker Bell is...

161
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:16,858
Harper Finkle.

162
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:20,228
No, it is poison!

163
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:25,265
"Oh, Tink. Did you drink
the medicine to save me?"

164
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:26,833
Yes!

165
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,869
"But, why, Tink? Now,
you don't look so good."

166
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:32,937
I think I might get well again,

167
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:36,106
if the boys and girls
believed in fairies.

168
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,517
- What was that?
- Fairy dust.

169
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,218
Cheese puff powder.

170
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:00,325
Look. Great.

171
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,560
She was pretty good.

172
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:07,831
The role of Tinker Bell
goes to Harper Finkle.

173
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:13,702
Now, the only thing left

174
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:16,138
is auditions for Tinker
Bell's understudy.

175
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:19,474
Look, Alex, um...

176
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,776
I spoke to some people in
the directing community.

177
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,844
People who are very close to me,
and they advised me

178
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:26,746
letting you anywhere near this
production would be sure disaster.

179
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:29,349
People close to you?
So that means Zeke or Dad.

180
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:31,818
Oh, it wasn't me, Alex. I swear.

181
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,487
Oh, so then,
Dad's directing this play.

182
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:37,456
No, I am. I make my own decisions.

183
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,590
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

184
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,525
- Prove it.
- Fine. Watch.

185
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,361
Alex Russo's the understudy.
There. I showed you.

186
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,596
- Well, I don't want to do it.
- You have to. I'm the director.

187
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:49,232
- OK, then fine. I'll do it.
- Good.

188
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:51,067
Ha.

189
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:52,968
Listen up, cast.

190
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:54,903
I need everyone to stay
healthy for the show.

191
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:57,839
Yes. That's right. Because I
don't want to have to step in.

192
00:09:57,873 --> 00:10:02,342
I have very little interest in this, and
I've never even been to this part of the
school.

193
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:03,810
OK, here are the ground rules.

194
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:06,211
Save your voice,
don't do anything dangerous,

195
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:08,347
and that includes tap-dancing.

196
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:09,915
- Aww.
- Hmm.

197
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,983
You got it, chief.

198
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,654
I'm gonna start being
careful right now.

199
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,356
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

200
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,658
Oh. That was close.

201
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,727
I almost slipped on my
cheddar cheese fairy dust.

202
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:26,297
Ooof!

203
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:29,266
- Harper, are you OK?
- I don't know.

204
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:31,502
Is my foot supposed
to bend this way?

205
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:37,541
Whoa. Looks like a rider
got thrown off her horse.

206
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:41,777
Sit tight, little filly.
The nurse is on her way.

207
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:46,947
She was Tinker Bell. Now, I'm gonna
have to hold auditions all over again.

208
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:48,681
Don't you have an understudy?

209
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,518
I'd rather not say.

210
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,987
Alex is my understudy.

211
00:10:56,021 --> 00:11:00,824
Alex, congratulations.
You get to saddle up for the rodeo.

212
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:04,360
Out of my way. I gotta
throw myself off the stage.

213
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:05,928
Make some room!

214
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:08,131
You're in the show, Alex.

215
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:15,736
Working on your review, Max?

216
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,905
I'm so glad you finally found
something you're half-good at.

217
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,307
Right, here it is...

218
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:24,442
"I saw Elasto-Man Snaps
Back with my mom last night,

219
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:28,044
which was a big mistake, because she
didn't put enough butter on the popcorn.

220
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,913
And that's the Max View."

221
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:37,452
Dad, I gotta talk to you about the play.
I got a big problem.

222
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:39,554
As long as it doesn't involve Alex,

223
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:41,889
there's nothing we can't solve.
Lay it on me.

224
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,458
- Never mind.
- Oh, it's Alex?

225
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:46,759
What did I say to you?

226
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,660
You made her the understudy,
didn't you?

227
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:51,496
It's not as bad as it seems.
I still got my main man, Zeke,

228
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,197
dialed in on the role of Peter Pan.

229
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:56,400
He'll just have to
carry the entire show.

230
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:58,135
Hey, Justin.

231
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,307
Uh, there's something
I gotta tell ya.

232
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:05,076
What did I say? No tap-dancing!

233
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,077
I wasn't. I went to
tap-dancing class

234
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,579
to tell them I couldn't make it.

235
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
But then clog-dancing
class started.

236
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,414
And I was like, "Oh,
man! Clogging?"

237
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,149
And I fell off my shoes.

238
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,618
All right, all right. Nobody panic.

239
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:21,522
I said I was gonna help you,
and I am gonna help you.

240
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:24,124
- I'm gonna play Peter Pan.
- Dad...

241
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,693
If I shave twice in the morning,

242
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:30,029
throw on my letterman jacket,
I can pass as a high school senior.

243
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:32,965
We'll just say I'm your cousin
visiting from the country.

244
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,333
A country of what, old dudes?

245
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,738
- I can still do it.
- Thank you.

246
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:43,676
I'll catch you at rehearsal.

247
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:46,512
This will never work.
I won't get Laritate's recommendation,

248
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,380
I'm not gonna get into
Clementine College,

249
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:51,216
and I can kiss robotic
engineering goodbye.

250
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,718
Justin, are you talking
about kissing robots again?

251
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:56,087
You're gonna get
electrocuted eventually.

252
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,290
Alex, you need to
take this seriously.

253
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:03,893
Your brother needs you to be the
best Tinker Bell you can be.

254
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:07,296
His college career
is depending on you.

255
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,664
You're right, Daddy.

256
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,266
Justin's depending on me,
and you're depending on me.

257
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,268
I gotta do whatever I need to
do to not let you guys down.

258
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:23,308
Hiring a real fairy to play your part is
less work than playing the part yourself?

259
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:25,076
Harper, there's not enough room

260
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,878
to write 27 lines of
dialogue on my hand.

261
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:33,349
Welcome to Fairy World.
May all your dreams come true.

262
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:43,157
Hi. - Look, Sparkles won't
work under these conditions!

263
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:45,525
Her wings need to be
massaged and steamed.

264
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,861
Those things are her
money-makers. Come on!

265
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:52,297
Last time I send a dwarf to do
an elf's job. How can I help?

266
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,500
I need to hire a fairy actress.

267
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,169
Well, you have come
to the right place.

268
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,803
Of all the fairy talent agencies,

269
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,573
FTA has, by far,
the fanciest offices.

270
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:06,142
I should sit down.

271
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:08,411
And some advice:
don't tile your cast.

272
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,946
It's like lugging
around a bathroom wall.

273
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,514
Don't sit there!

274
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,950
It's just for looks.

275
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:18,219
It's made entirely of
gum drops and licorice.

276
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,888
Who'd mix candy with furniture?

277
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:25,091
Oh, wait. I would.

278
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,726
Here are some pictures of fairies.

279
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,227
- OK.
- Do you see one you like?

280
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:38,233
Anyone really standing out?

281
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:41,469
Anyone popping for you?

282
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:44,904
These are pictures
of the same fairy.

283
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:46,438
You have a good eye.

284
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,673
If it's Flutter you want,
then Flutter you've got.

285
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:51,976
OK. How soon can she start?

286
00:14:57,114 --> 00:14:59,615
You're girls.

287
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,784
I'm Flutter.

288
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,286
Well, this is working out.

289
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,288
Let's all get to know each other.

290
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,256
No, Harper!

291
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:13,695
You're clumsy.

292
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:25,238
See, Harper?
She looks just like me.

293
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:29,509
OK, you're gonna play me,
playing Tinker Bell in the play.

294
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:32,445
All right. Let's try a
scene from the play.

295
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:36,615
I'm tired of playing fairies.

296
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,285
I want to play a cop.
Hands up where I can see 'em, pal!

297
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,052
Oh, she's a good actress.

298
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:44,321
- I can't see 'em.
- Oh!

299
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:50,259
Flutter, you are a fairy.
Fairies play fairies.

300
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:51,994
I don't know, Alex.

301
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:54,797
This fairy wants to play a cop,
and she's packing heat.

302
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:56,599
I say we let her.

303
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:01,770
Who's this?

304
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,507
That's Harper.

305
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,210
No. Who's the one with the wings?

306
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:13,879
Oh, that's Flutter.

307
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:18,583
You're a man, and you're a lady.

308
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:21,919
What is a fairy doing here?

309
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:26,556
She is leaving. Come on, Flutter.

310
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:27,925
A second ago,

311
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,093
you wanted me to play
the role of Tinker Bell.

312
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,261
You smuggled a fairy
across Never Land lines

313
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,229
to impersonate you in
your brother's play?

314
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:37,298
I'm no wizard,
but that sounds like a crime.

315
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:40,133
It's not a crime.

316
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,235
And I suppose you spent all
this time working on this scheme

317
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,936
instead of learning your lines?

318
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,205
I don't think I should answer that

319
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,641
until I'm assigned a
Never Land attorney.

320
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,744
Alex, we're not in a
crime drama right now.

321
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,880
Oh! But if we are,
can I play the cop?

322
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:59,349
Check this out.
Hands up pal, freeze!

323
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,519
Up against the wall.

324
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,290
Spread 'em, punk.

325
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,959
She's good.

326
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,026
Tink, no! What are you doing?

327
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,794
Peter Pan,

328
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,700
do not take your medicine.
It has been poisoned.

329
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:24,001
No! I promised Wendy I'd take it.

330
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:29,573
Ew, is this diet?

331
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,511
Ugh. Ew.

332
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:40,115
Oh, would you die already?

333
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,117
Fine.

334
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,160
I'm dead.

335
00:17:56,696 --> 00:18:00,332
Oh, Tink. Did you drink
the medicine to save me?

336
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:03,668
- Uh, yeah.
- With feeling!

337
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:05,803
Oh.

338
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:07,738
With feeling.

339
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:13,876
Dad, you're gonna have to go shave,
get on your letterman jacket.

340
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,278
Don't worry. Directors
always have a back-up plan.

341
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,947
And I'd like you to meet ours.

342
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:25,619
You're a boy.

343
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:30,891
But why, Tink? Why?

344
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:34,594
Now, you don't look so good.

345
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:38,263
I think I might get well again,
if the boys...

346
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:42,066
If the boys and girls
believed in fairies.

347
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,737
Do you believe?
Say quick that you believe!

348
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:49,272
Owww!

349
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:53,209
Clap your hands. Don't let
Tinker Bell's light go out.

350
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:01,615
This is the part where you clap for me,
and I come back to life.

351
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:07,887
Mom?

352
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:10,757
Sorry, sweetie.

353
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:15,795
OK. It's go time.

354
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:20,965
Come on, one clap? Anybody?

355
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:23,501
Anything?

356
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,536
How 'bout them Mets?

357
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:36,778
Works for me. Come on,
let's go save Wendy.

358
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:40,615
Freeze, Tinker Bell.

359
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,517
You're going downtown
for bad acting, punk.

360
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:48,654
- Flutter?
- Sergeant Flutter.

361
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,924
You're coming with me,
straight to the slammer.

362
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,594
Flutter, you have
to get out of here

363
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,029
before people start to
think you're a real fairy.

364
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:08,136
They're definitely gonna
think you're a real fairy.

365
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,714
Ow. Ow. Ow.

366
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:23,618
See that? That's how
you play a fairy.

367
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:29,222
Well, this is how you
get rid of a fairy.

368
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:44,302
I'm thinking maybe we should
leave before this is over.

369
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:46,937
- Split a cab downtown?
- Oh, yeah. Let's go.

370
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:52,508
Jerry!

371
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:02,015
All right, Sergeant Flutter.

372
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:05,684
You have the right to remain silent.
In this drawer.

373
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:09,989
Ow.

374
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,762
Boo!

375
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,254
That's good, Max.

376
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:25,654
Here he comes.

377
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:29,423
I'm sure there are plenty of
colleges that'll take you.

378
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:31,359
I can get you into my alma mater.

379
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:34,061
Mom, you went to an
all-girls college.

380
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:36,097
Wait. That could work.

381
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:39,233
Yeah, I'll come visit.

382
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:42,335
Um... I'm just trying
to help out my son.

383
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,072
Look, Justin. We wrote a letter
of recommendation for you.

384
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,609
"Dear Clementine College,

385
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:54,112
here is a review of Justin
Russo's directing debut.

386
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,246
In this ambitious production,
Tinker Bell swats down her own inner-demon
