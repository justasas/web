1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,902
Harper?
What are you doing?

2
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:10,744
Why do you have your
own Career Day booth?

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,253
Everyone's always telling me to be
myself, so that's what I'm doing.

4
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:17,658
Are you interested in a
fascinating career in being me?

5
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:21,398
I'll be you
if you be me.

6
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:23,502
Never mind.

7
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:29,111
Alex! Have you seen
the Action News booth?

8
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:32,182
I've got to find it before someone
signs Baxter Knight as their mentor.

9
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:33,986
Baxter Knight,
the weatherman?

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,990
That's who you're
choosing as a mentor?

11
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:37,492
He's not a weatherman.

12
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:41,230
He's like a weather hero.

13
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:44,101
His earmuff alerts have
saved me from many an earache.

14
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:47,107
Luckily, those earmuffs have
saved you from hearing people say

15
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,610
what a doofus you
look like with them on.

16
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:52,181
I wish I was wearing
them right now.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,289
Oh! There's Baxter.

18
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,958
So, my little friend,

19
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,261
being a weatherman
is the only career here

20
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,297
where you get
to be on TV.

21
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,968
Does that sound like
something you'd like to do?

22
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,006
Mr. Knight.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,441
I'm Justin Russo.
I'm a huge fan.

24
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:16,544
I've been following you ever
since you introduced Mr. Nimbus,

25
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,878
your cloud hand.

26
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,915
Put on your galoshes.
It's gonna be a wet one.

27
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,616
With the rain.

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,020
You remember Mr. Nimbus.
Kid, you want a mentor?

29
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:31,026
Do I have Mr. Nimbus pajamas
made out of cloud curtains?

30
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:35,631
I do.

31
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,934
Oh my gosh!

32
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:41,072
There's one of the many singing
policemen who does a lot of singing

33
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:42,507
at ball games and stuff.

34
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:47,179
Leaving, Miss Russo?

35
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:51,283
And which career counselor
have you roped in?

36
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,455
Well, Mr. Laritate,
you know what I wish?

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,625
I wish you were available
to be a mentor,

38
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,995
because you have all the qualities
I'm looking for in a mentor.

39
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:05,831
You're a "men"

40
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:09,367
which is in
the word "mentor."

41
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:14,107
And...

42
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,576
...bolo tie.

43
00:02:19,948 --> 00:02:23,552
Nice tap dancing,
Bojangles.

44
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:25,287
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

45
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:26,722
I'll take you up
on that offer.

46
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:29,292
Let's mosey on down to
the principal's office.

47
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:31,027
Deputy.

48
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,797
Well, suppose I was gonna end
up there at some point anyway.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000

50
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,389
Dad, guess what?

51
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:31,758
Someone's been putting
two pickle spears

52
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:32,760
in the to-go orders.

53
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:34,028
Not even close.

54
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:35,629
Today was Career Day
at school...

55
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:38,232
Two pickle spears?

56
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:40,568
Outrageous.
This has Mom's sloppy

57
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:43,038
but generous fingerprints
all over it.

58
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,373
That's it.

59
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,640
No more pickles.

60
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,142
She's ruined it
for everyone.

61
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,316
Baxter Knight!

62
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,218
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Justin.

63
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:59,256
I had some time before
the evening news...

64
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,095
And I wanted to come
by and tell you that

65
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,065
- I can't be your mentor.
- Why not?

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,500
You need someone
successful.

67
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,468
I haven't nailed a
forecast in months.

68
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,069
I've been letting
everyone down:

69
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:17,541
Commuters, roofers,
people with perms.

70
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:19,843
Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.

71
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:22,946
If I don't get the next forecast
right they're going to fire me.

72
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,381
Oh! Where'd you hear that?

73
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,551
One of the weathermen sitting
in the lobby with their resumes.

74
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:35,390
Look, kid, take a tip
from Mr. Nimbus.

75
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:38,426
Never love anything
too much.

76
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,096
It will eventually
disappoint you.

77
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,533
Dad, is that true?

78
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:50,236
Does everything eventually
disappoint you?

79
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:53,339
Most things.

80
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:58,110
But then you find the one thing
that doesn't and you marry her.

81
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:00,646
And then she puts two
pickles in the to-go orders.

82
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,114
And you...

83
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,483
You start to wonder.

84
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:15,395
You're absolutely
right, Max.

85
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,498
Singing and the law
are very similar.

86
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:19,133
You come in strong

87
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,802
and rely on your backups
to do most of the work.

88
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,271
Singing is just
a hobby of mine.

89
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,440
I don't mix it
with police work.

90
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:29,676
Why? But you're a great
policeman and a great singer.

91
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,778
When you find two things
that you're great at,

92
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:33,780
you got to do both.

93
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:36,883
It shows you're a genius.

94
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:39,086
Take a platypus
for example:

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,688
Great at being a duck.
Great at being a fish.

96
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,423
Well, it's not
that simple.

97
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:48,261
You see, I'm afraid
if I mixed my singing

98
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:49,696
with my police work

99
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:51,932
the other guys will never
take me seriously as a cop.

100
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,334
Yes, they will.
What's not serious about:

101
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:56,937
<i>âª You have the right âª</i>

102
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:58,005
<i>âª to remain âª</i>

103
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,075
<i>âª silent âª</i>

104
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:12,520
I have to hog-tie
a few loose ends.

105
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:15,989
Why don't you and your
ironic mug have a seat?

106
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:18,759
The place I bought it from

107
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,761
said they'd put my picture
on it for five more bucks.

108
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:22,696
You want to go
in halfsies?

109
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:26,032
No, OK.

110
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:30,269
Have you seen this
graffiti around school?

111
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,307
It seems someone
keeps writing the word

112
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,475
"salmon" under the
no smoking signs.

113
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,712
As my new deputy these
are the sort of varmints

114
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,381
I need your help
to wrangle in.

115
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:45,151
It's not that hard. Look at
the way "salmon" is written.

116
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:48,188
Remember last year when someone
wrote "Sal" on all the lunch tables?

117
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:49,789
It's the same handwriting.

118
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,525
Look, the marker smudges
mean he's left handed,

119
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,593
drags his hand across
what he's written.

120
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:57,196
Lefty Sal's your guy.

121
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,898
There's no one
named Lefty Sal.

122
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:01,834
Don't ruin my moment.
Just don't.

123
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:03,302
It's the Sal
that's left handed.

124
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:05,204
Amazing.

125
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,307
I haven't seen
detective work like this

126
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,242
<i>since Miami Vice
went off the air.</i>

127
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:12,179
Now, get to work on
this caseload, Crockett.

128
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,882
But Mr. Laritate,
I thought

129
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:20,286
mentoring might be like you and me
figuring out the new school holidays.

130
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,622
Nope.

131
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:25,291
Nowadays we let the
courts decide those.

132
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:29,996
By the way feel free
to call me Tubbs.

133
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:31,631
Don't worry, we do.

134
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,099
Excellent.

135
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,175
Oh! Baxter's on.

136
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:46,613
<i>Here's the deal, New Yorkians.</i>

137
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:50,550
<i>Tonight, there will be
a chance of snow.</i>

138
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,418
<i>Back to you, Doug.</i>

139
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:54,587
"Chance of snow?"
No. Clear and mild.

140
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,589
<i>"A chance of snow."</i>

141
00:07:56,623 --> 00:08:00,059
<i>Wow. You really put
yourself out there.</i>

142
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,261
<i>OK. You want me to put
myself out there?</i>

143
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,596
<i>Well. Fine.</i>

144
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,331
Come on, clear and mild.
Clear and mild.

145
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:09,301
<i>I've got nothing to lose.</i>

146
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:11,903
<i>There will be snow
in exactly half the city.</i>

147
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:14,306
<i>It's gonna be split
right down Waverly Place.</i>

148
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,443
Aw. He said
our street name.

149
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,548
<i>Now let me make a prediction.</i>

150
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,785
<i>We'll be looking for a
new weatherman tomorrow.</i>

151
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,302
Half of New York City?

152
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,507
OK. OK.

153
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,109
<i>If Baxter loses his job,
it will be a pity.</i>

154
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:50,477
<i>Let's have snow</i>

155
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,679
<i>over half of New York City.</i>

156
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:09,630
Congratulations,
Deputy Russo.

157
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:12,733
Thanks to you, I made quite
the round up this morning.

158
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,369
Mayonnaise in the
soap dispensers.

159
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:16,603
Clever.

160
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:18,806
But not clever enough
for Crockett and Tubbs.

161
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,776
I never knew there were kids
worse than me in school.

162
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,313
It's fun to solve crimes and
get new ideas at the same time.

163
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:28,114
Well, do you have
anything new for me?

164
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:30,550
I sure do. Underwear
on the statue. Solved.

165
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:32,219
Hallway of thumb tacks.
Solved.

166
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,421
Substitute teacher
monkey. Solved.

167
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,389
That was a hard one,
wasn't it?

168
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:37,924
Not really.

169
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,659
Once you realized
it was a wig

170
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:43,763
and he was holding
the chalk with his foot.

171
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:46,199
That was a really good wig.

172
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,836
Keep up the good work, Russo.

173
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,371
You make an excellent protÃ©gÃ©.

174
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:52,538
Thank you, Mr. Laritate.

175
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,107
Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:56,242
Thanks, Tubbs.

177
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,014
Uh, Harper?

178
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,449
What are you doing?

179
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:05,552
Oh. I'm just
showing my protÃ©gÃ©

180
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:08,655
how to rush through halls fast,
so you don't hear the laughter.

181
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:10,657
And, go.

182
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:15,862
- Hey, Russo.
- Hey, Sal.

183
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:19,232
Did you grow in between
P.E. and now?

184
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:20,934
You're so tall.

185
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:25,104
Hey. Because of you, Laritate busted
me for writing "no smoking salmon."

186
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,039
That guy hates signs.

187
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:29,341
Or salmon!

188
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:33,346
No. Mr. Laritate hates
when people break the rules.

189
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,483
I never thought I'd see the
day when Alex Russo went good.

190
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:44,791
Mr. Knight?

191
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:46,393
What's going on?

192
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:47,962
I'll tell you
what's going on.

193
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:49,363
I am back.

194
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,267
My willy nilly predictions
have been spot on.

195
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:53,935
A heat wave on
Sixty-Seventh.

196
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,004
A blizzard on
Sixty-Eighth.

197
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,373
No matter what I say, it
all turns out to be true.

198
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,708
I know.

199
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,576
I got a sun burn on the
way to my guitar lesson

200
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,912
and a cold on the way back.

201
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,347
Sorry, kid.

202
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:06,682
I don't make the weather.

203
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:07,749
I know.

204
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,551
I do.

205
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,487
- Let's do this.
- Look, Mr. Knight

206
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:15,323
I'm happy you're getting your
weather predictions right,

207
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:19,628
but don't you think you should
consult a weather satellite,

208
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:21,296
or a barometer,

209
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:24,066
or that temperature sign
above the bank? Something?

210
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,701
No need, kid.

211
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:28,438
I'm going with my gut.
Seems to be working.

212
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:29,805
Oh, I'm on. Excuse me.

213
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,145
Thanks, Doug.

214
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,814
I am here on Waverly Place

215
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:44,118
at the site of the historic
fifty-fifty snowstorm.

216
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:50,057
Tonight, friends, brace
yourselves for, uh...

217
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:51,358
...some hail.

218
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:52,860
Yeah, hail.

219
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:54,461
Why not?

220
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,896
And not just any hail.

221
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,767
It's gonna be the size
of candied yams.

222
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,171
The size of candied yams?
Seriously?

223
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:07,077
Sorry.

224
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:22,257
Don't let Baxter Knight fail.
Make me some candied yam hail.

225
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:33,268
What do you think you're doing,
messing with the weather?

226
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:34,836
Who are you?

227
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,572
Um? Mother Nature.

228
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:39,075
Mother Nature?

229
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,979
I thought you were supposed
to be all like natural,

230
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,048
with sandals and birds
flying around you?

231
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,419
I used to dress like that
but nobody took me seriously.

232
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,756
And what I wear to work
is my business.

233
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,524
I am here
to talk about you.

234
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,426
Come here.

235
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:01,764
Now, why would you mess
with the delicate balance

236
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,633
of the Earth's
weather patterns?

237
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,936
Do you know how much I work
to maintain this planet?

238
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,338
Three days a week?
I don't know.

239
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,108
It was my best guess.
You asked, I answered.

240
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,711
I was trying to help my
mentor. He's a meteorologist.

241
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:19,215
And what's with the hail?
How does that help anybody?

242
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,352
Free ice!
I'm getting free ice!

243
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,895
Mrs. Nature.

244
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,397
Mother.

245
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:36,566
- I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

246
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:38,635
- About what?
- That.

247
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:47,877
Be grateful. That could
have been a wildfire.

248
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:09,977
One of Harper's most important
jobs is delivering news to Alex.

249
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,045
Alex, do you know
what's going on?

250
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,281
They put this Good Citizenship
award on your locker.

251
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:17,551
A Good Citizenship award?

252
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:18,886
That's low.

253
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,155
Harper, you've got to help me.

254
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,723
If I don't stop
being good,

255
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:26,727
one day I'm gonna wake up and
be a doctor, or even worse,

256
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:28,996
the guy who drives the back
end of a fire truck.

257
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,265
Oh, you've got to help me.

258
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,569
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

259
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,571
I can erase your tardy sheet.

260
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:39,106
Never been tardy.

261
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:42,042
You know the end of every year
I buy myself an ice cream cake?

262
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,610
It's for no tardies.

263
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:46,413
You should be
taking notes.

264
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:50,117
How about you take this
picture of all these horses?

265
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:51,185
Oh, its a mural.

266
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:53,720
It's painted right on the wall.

267
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,867
How about you get me the key
to the teachers' bathroom?

268
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,135
Don't write that down.

269
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,105
Fine. I guess it's a start.

270
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,815
Hold on a second.

271
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,790
I don't read.

272
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:43,707
Alex, don't!

273
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,379
What do you want?

274
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:51,348
Whoa, it's just
raining on you.

275
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:55,419
Wow, I kind of wish I had
something to do with that.

276
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:58,088
I used magic to help Baxter
with his weather predictions.

277
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,491
Mother Nature caught me.
This is my punishment.

278
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,059
Wait a minute.

279
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,261
You used magic to do
something sneaky,

280
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,598
and now you're coming to me
to help you get out of it?

281
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:10,099
Feels good, doesn't it?
Except for this part right.

282
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,600
Are you gonna help me or not?

283
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,597
Listen, I don't know
how it happened,

284
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:19,866
but I've turned good.

285
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:23,036
So, you're like
a day late, buddy.

286
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:27,073
Just help me, please!
I'm begging you.

287
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:30,977
Fine. I'll help you.
Lean away from the window.

288
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:34,915
I don't want you to get stains
on Mr. Laritate's cowhide throw.

289
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:38,785
Man, the good
just doesn't stop.

290
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:45,625
How did you get Mother
Nature here before?

291
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,861
I don't know.

292
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:52,299
I just messed with the
weather and she showed up.

293
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,671
<i>What he did.</i>

294
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,577
Sweet potato hell?

295
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:05,712
Are you kidding me?
We talked about this?

296
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:09,015
I can give you your own
personal earthquake, you know?

297
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,484
Hi. You must be Mother Nature.

298
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,854
Sorry about the hail. We just
didn't know how to contact you.

299
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:18,158
Listen, Mother Nature,
love your work.

300
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,826
Big fan of this, really.

301
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,194
But I don't think
it's enough.

302
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:22,796
Oh, really?

303
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:25,799
He's sopping wet, and there's
no chance of him getting dry.

304
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,500
Sure, he's wet.

305
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,069
What's the best
we could hope for?

306
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:35,097
I just think he needs
a more severe punishment.

307
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:37,767
All right! I'm de-asking
you to help me right now!

308
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:41,170
Shh. Are you packing lightning?

309
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,539
Because I think about
thirty gazillion volts

310
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:45,608
will do him just fine.

311
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:48,978
Give me a sec.

312
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:51,480
- Is this your sister?
- Yes.

313
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:54,984
OK. I think you've
been punished enough.

314
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:01,924
Now, listen guys...

315
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:05,995
I may have overreacted
just a little bit,

316
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:10,166
but things aren't going great
with me and I need your help.

317
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,670
Is it the dating trouble? Because
I can really help you with that.

318
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:18,808
No, Alex, she's talking
about the environment.

319
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:22,578
You people need to understand
that this is a delicate system.

320
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:24,413
Every time you mess
with the weather,

321
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:26,649
it effects somewhere else.

322
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:29,785
I think I found
your dating problem.

323
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,421
It's just non-stop talking
about the weather, isn't it?

324
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:35,324
No.

325
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,627
What Mother Nature
is trying to say is that

326
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,262
instead of messing with the
Earth, we should be helping it.

327
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:43,933
Like recycling, or
carpooling for less pollution...

328
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,469
We can help you
with that stuff.

329
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:01,106
I don't know if you've heard,
but I recently turned good.

330
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,312
Hey, did you see that?

331
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,814
You stay here. I'll handle
this. This could get dangerous.

332
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,516
Use your voice baton.

333
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,652
It's your most
powerful weapon.

334
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:18,456
<i>âª Stop I know you took
Too many papers âª</i>

335
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,759
<i>âª You only get one âª</i>

336
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,262
<i>âª Don't even think
About running âª</i>

337
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,097
<i>âª You're not that cunning âª</i>

338
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,666
<i>âª You'll never
No, never âª</i>

339
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,835
<i>âª No, never
Get away âª</i>

340
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,280
Officer Bryan,
you let him get away.

341
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,383
There was no...

342
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,353
There was nothing
I could...

343
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,256
There was nothing
I could do.

344
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,191
What happened
to your voice?

345
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,527
I don't know.

346
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,329
It must have
something to do with

347
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,665
getting hit by this vegetable
shaped piece of hail.

348
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,101
And I need a mentor
that can do two things.

349
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,604
Now, if you'll excuse me,

350
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:19,774
I'm going to go to the zoo
and find me a platypus.

351
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:22,310
That guy's a real genius.

352
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:31,419
Well, there's my little deputy.

353
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:33,854
Yep. People are gonna
have to get used to it.

354
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:35,890
I'm just a good person.

355
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:37,592
Are you?

356
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:41,729
Your friend Harper, and some
seventh grader dressed just like her,

357
00:20:41,763 --> 00:20:44,932
were caught coming out
of the teachers' restroom.

358
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,735
She's in a wagonload
of trouble.

359
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:52,807
Great. Everyone's
in trouble but me.

360
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,241
Wait a minute.

361
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:56,143
I'm the one who
gave her the key.

362
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:57,545
And that's bad.

363
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,347
Everyone's in trouble
because of me.

364
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,415
I am bad again!

365
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,217
Fair enough.

366
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:07,655
You'll be getting
one month detention.

367
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,423
A month?

368
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,992
That's not fair.

369
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:13,761
Sal got a warning, and he
vandalized half the school.

370
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:17,632
Maybe it doesn't seem fair, but
there's a method to all this.

371
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,035
See, I fit the punishment
to the person not the crime.

372
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:31,635
Your method is just busting me to
the full extent of your made-up laws.

373
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,537
Oh. Alex popped her gum.

374
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:38,208
Let's make her stay back a grade
or explain email to senior citizens.

375
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:40,810
I understand how it may seem.

376
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,479
But the truth is,

377
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:45,348
there's nothing I can do to get
through to Sal and the others.

378
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,784
But you, Miss Russo,
I haven't given up on.

379
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:51,888
See, I believe there's evil.

380
00:21:51,923 --> 00:21:54,424
And there's evil genius.

381
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:58,495
Really?

382
00:21:58,529 --> 00:21:59,996
You think I'm an evil genius?

383
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:01,665
That's so sweet.

384
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:06,236
Now, you'll have to turn in
your theoretical deputy's badge.

385
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:19,282
That was weird
and meaningless.

386
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:21,518
It was symbolic.

387
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:24,920
Another one of my
methods. Now get out!

388
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:33,883
Let's see how Baxter
is doing without me.

389
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,251
<i>And in other news,</i>

390
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:38,355
<i>I am sad to report</i>

391
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:41,391
<i>that my colleague and dear,
dear friend Baxter Knight</i>

392
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:44,060
<i>has entered into a
suggested retirement.</i>

393
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:47,964
<i>If you see him and he says it
was a forced retirement...</i>

394
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,833
<i>He's a liar.</i>

395
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,670
He was fired.

396
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:55,872
There will never be anyone
as good as Baxter Knight.

397
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:58,608
And on a lighter note,
I am happy to introduce

398
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:01,644
our newest weatherperson,
Heather Nakatomi.

399
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,813
Oh, brother.

400
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:06,483
Heather Nakatomi? Wow.

401
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,818
Eh, Baxter
will be fine.
