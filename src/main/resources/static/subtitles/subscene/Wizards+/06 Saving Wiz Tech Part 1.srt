1
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:07,239
Oh, hi, alex. I'm sure you'll be happy to
hear that you and dean broke the school
record

2
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,815
By dating two months,
four days and three periods.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,568
Yep. I know. I saw your banner
in the cafeteria. Thank you.

4
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,432
Oh. You saw that?

5
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:18,923
Then I guess I wore this "check out
my banner" shirt for no reason.

6
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:22,356
Hey, you should have
told them where.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,457
"in the cafeteria." ok.

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,057
Wow, harper. Sometimes I
feel like you put more effort

9
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:30,125
Into my relationship
with dean than he does.

10
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,059
I'm sorry. Are you creeped out?

11
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:34,262
No. You haven't creeped
me out for weeks.

12
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:36,666
Oh, wait, here he comes.

13
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:39,937
Hey, russo, I got a
gift for my girlfriend.

14
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:43,004
Oh, let me guess. Something
you made in woodshop again?

15
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:46,339
- I love how you know me.
- Oh.

16
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:49,775
Oh, look. It's a birdhouse.

17
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,243
Or a mailbox.
Wait, which one is it?

18
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:53,711
Both.

19
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,879
Oh, dean.

20
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:59,315
These aren't really gifts.
They're assignments.

21
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:01,450
Just like all the other ones were.

22
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:05,454
It's just... It'd be nice if you
gave me something more special.

23
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:08,990
Well, this is my first b-minus.

24
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,892
- It's pretty special to me.
- Wait a minute.

25
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:15,797
Is that a d turned into a b?

26
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,300
Busted.

27
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:24,305
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

28
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,442
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

29
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,376
* you can fix any problem
at the slightest ease *

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,110
* yes, please *

31
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:32,012
* well, you might find out
it'll go to your head *

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,081
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

33
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:36,550
* with a snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

34
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:38,286
* that's what I said *

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,252
* everything is not what it seems *

36
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:45,016
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

37
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,852
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

38
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:53,086
* because everything
is not what it seems *

39
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:56,555
* everything is not what it seems *

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,458
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

41
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:04,194
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

42
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,163
* because everything is not *

43
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:09,132
* what it seems *

44
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:12,833

45
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:17,171
Ok, today's lesson will
be on shape shifting.

46
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:18,772
Mom, what are you doing here?

47
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:24,509
Demonstrating shape shifting.
Thank you, justin.

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,382
Yeah, could we have a lesson on how to get
your boyfriend to treat you more special?

49
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,484
Do I need to shape shift
back into your mom

50
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,753
And give you one of her
eye rolls and hip twists?

51
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,854
No, wait. I can do it.

52
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:43,693
- Work it, sister.
- Ooh.

53
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:47,297
Professor crumbs, to what do
we owe this... This honor?

54
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:49,665
I need to ask a favor
of your father.

55
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:53,701
Unfortunately, wiztech has been
completely infested with these.

56
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,169
Ooh!

57
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:59,506
A school full of wizards
can't deal with those?

58
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,741
Alex, if you had
studied your wizardry,

59
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:07,011
You would know plastic is impervious
to even the most powerful magic of all.

60
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:10,180
Because of the plastic
ball infestation,

61
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:13,015
We can't occupy the
castle or teach magic.

62
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,820
But removing plastic balls is a pricey
proposition wiztech cannot afford.

63
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:22,824
Well, why don't you sell some of those fancy
words like "proposition" and "afford"?

64
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:27,727
We need to figure out a way
to get wizworld industry's

65
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:30,096
Plastic ball removal
specialists to help us.

66
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,097
Plastic ball removal specialists?

67
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:36,168
- yes.
- Sounds dangerous.

68
00:03:36,202 --> 00:03:41,072
In the meantime, jerry, I was hoping you
could house a few of the wiztech students,

69
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:45,908
Just for the time being. - I don't see
any problem with housing a few students.

70
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,252
Hey, that's not a few.

71
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:00,654
No taksies backsies.

72
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:04,590
Wow. I barely fit
through that door.

73
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:09,660
Hugh, how many times do I have to tell you,
you're not a giant. All right? I'm bigger
than you.

74
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:13,130
Well, my overnight
bags beg to differ.

75
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,900
- Hey, hugh.
- Oh, hi, alex.

76
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:20,135
This is my friend, ronald.

77
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,739
Hello. Alex,

78
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:28,643
I'm ronald longcape, junior.

79
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,177
Ok.

80
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,479
I'm alex russo, sophomore.

81
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:35,181
I should be a junior
but I don't test well.

82
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,717
You gotta show up to not test well.

83
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:50,227
- Oh, hi. Ronald, right?
- Yes.

84
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,896
Thanks for remembering. - I didn't
really remember. That's why I was asking.

85
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,699
But I did remember your order.

86
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:00,835
Half of a chocolate shake
and two onion rings.

87
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,238
Wait, that's um...
That's not my order.

88
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:06,140
That's from the table
you just cleared.

89
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:10,911
Who can keep any of that straight,
right? - Wait, wait.

90
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:13,146
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want
me to take your order?

91
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,681
No, I just want to
keep talking to you.

92
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,449
Oh. Oh, that's sweet.

93
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:21,017
If I weren't working I would
sit down and talk for a while.

94
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:22,718
Oh, come on. You look like somebody

95
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,320
Who's always looking for an
excuse to get out of work.

96
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:26,688
What?

97
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:28,657
No, I am not.

98
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,292
Here, let's discuss it.

99
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,562
So, how's it going out here?

100
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:37,898
It's a bunch of rambunctious
teenagers with wizard powers.

101
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:39,299
How do you think it's going?

102
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,002
Sure, you're angry now.

103
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:43,906
But I promise, in a year
from now we're gonna laugh.

104
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,874
Hey, let's start now.

105
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:49,610
No.

106
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:55,850
Ah, professor crumbs.
Just the guy I'm looking for.

107
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:59,253
While you're staying with us I got
you a track suit just like mine

108
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:01,755
- So you'll fit in.
- Thanks.

109
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,458
I'm an 850-year-old wizard.

110
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:06,726
I think I know how to fit in.

111
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:10,262
- It makes you look skinny.
- Where's the dressing room?

112
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,997
No need.

113
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,572
Right, sweet. Now, when you walk the
swishy sound makes static electricity.

114
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:24,108
Go find someone to prank
and shake their hand.

115
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,583
Hey, justin, good to see you.

116
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:36,552
Oh, professor...

117
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:40,589
Swishy pants. Gotcha.

118
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:43,156
I'm glad you all think
that's so funny.

119
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:46,458
Now, what are we gonna do about the
plastic ball infestation at wiztech?

120
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:49,527
Oh, justin, don't worry.
Everything will work itself out.

121
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:52,863
- It sounds like you're doing nothing.
- I'm learning to shock people

122
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:55,899
With my pants.
I'd hardly call that nothing.

123
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:13,150
I didn't expect to
see anybody here.

124
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,618
Neither did I.

125
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:16,585
You must be doing what I'm doing.

126
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,786
Trying to figure out what's
going on with wiztech

127
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,353
And who cursed it.

128
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:24,656
That's exactly what I'm doing!

129
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,725
So, what have you found?

130
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,694
Oh! You got me!

131
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:34,296
Oh, you're one smart cookie,
figuring out that

132
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:37,065
I was the one who infested
wiztech with plastic balls.

133
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,600
You did this?

134
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:39,966
Why?

135
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,702
For a whole bunch of evil reasons.

136
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,170
Here's my list.

137
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:46,874
Color balls: Evil.

138
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,042
Check.

139
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,177
Taking over wiztech: Eviler.

140
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:52,212
Check.

141
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:54,881
Throwing the birthday
party I never had...

142
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,850
Not so evil, but I'm doing it.

143
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,486
And then what,
are you gonna open up

144
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,554
Like, a totally evil wizard school?

145
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,422
I like that!

146
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:08,491
After the birthday party.

147
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:12,628
The only bummer is, my son isn't here.
He got sent off with the wiztech students.

148
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:16,733
- Who's your son?
- I'm never gonna tell you.

149
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,602
what's your name?

150
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,670
Ronald longcape, senior.

151
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:25,941
Is your son ronald
longcape, junior?

152
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:29,310
Are you a detective? - No,
just a smart boy with a curious mind

153
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:30,978
And the power to stop you.

154
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:32,813
Spandau ballet tell me it's true

155
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,715
Take this evil man
you know what to do

156
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,821
Aren't you forgetting something?

157
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:47,758
If we weren't standing knee-deep in plastic
balls I would use magic on you so bad.

158
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,295
Don't go. I... Um...

159
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:09,208
You! You! Ronald longcape, junior.

160
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:12,377
I met your father and he's evil
and my guess is, so are you.

161
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:15,146
Ronald, have you met
my brother, justin?

162
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:19,417
It's ok, alex. Um... He's right.

163
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:24,755
My father is evil. - And you know what
he's gonna do now that wiztech is vacant?

164
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:26,956
He's gonna open up a
totally evil wizard school.

165
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:29,124
It's ok. Trust me.

166
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,693
My father always thinks big
but he can never deliver.

167
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,261
And look, I'm telling you that.

168
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:36,963
It's proof that I'm not evil.

169
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,868
Oh, good enough for me.
Justin, can we have a couple menus?

170
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:46,372
Not good enough for me. The flame
doesn't fall far from the inferno.

171
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:50,274
If you knew your father was evil then
why didn't you say anything, huh?

172
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:52,376
Well, because I was afraid.

173
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:56,546
I thought if people knew my father was evil,
they'd treat me, well,

174
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,181
Kinda like how you're treating
me now. - Yeah, justin.

175
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:00,949
You're being very rude.

176
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:02,684
And what are your specials?

177
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:07,055
We have the turkey pastrami on
rye and a philly cheese steak.

178
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:08,723
Now listen up!

179
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:11,391
I'm gonna fix the problems
your father created at wiztech

180
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:15,328
And if you try and stop me
I'm gonna know you're evil.

181
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:17,696
Come on, ronald.
I'm sure we can find a restaurant

182
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,764
Where the wait staff
won't call you evil!

183
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,972
That was a really fancy restaurant.

184
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:32,842
I mean, you got great food,
you got great bowling.

185
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:35,378
So, maybe we should go back
there again on our next date.

186
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:36,646
What?

187
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,580
Oh, no, no. This wasn't a date.

188
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:42,183
Please don't say "date" because I
have a boyfriend and his name is dean.

189
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:43,618
Oh, I'm sorry.

190
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,386
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

191
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,788
I haven't seen him around.

192
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:50,558
Well, yeah, 'cause he's probably
in shop class right now,

193
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:53,760
Making me something that won't
express his true feelings.

194
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:56,896
Well, let's see how I do.

195
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:02,433
* there's a rainbow up in heaven *

196
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,968
* and that rainbow spells alex *

197
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:07,670
* ronald really likes you, girl *

198
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:16,577
Thank you for a
wonderful day, alex.

199
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,687
Alex, what was going on
out there? Where's dean?

200
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:28,456
That boy was well inside your
"kiss or clobber" radius.

201
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:30,457
Oh, um, him? No, no.

202
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,993
That's just a family friend.
He's visiting from wiz...

203
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:37,363
Uh...Wisconsin, and he said
that we were on a date.

204
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:39,699
And I said, "no, because I
have a boyfriend, dean."

205
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,934
You do. - Who's not great
at expressing feelings.

206
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,935
- He's not.
- Doesn't mean I don't like him.

207
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,637
- You like him.
- Then ronald left.

208
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,105
- His name's ronald?
- Yes, and I was just with him

209
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,539
And now I kind of miss him.

210
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:51,874
- You do?
- I do. What am I gonna do?

211
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,909
I'll tell you what
I'm not gonna do.

212
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:56,545
Study for my history final.
My friend needs me.

213
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:57,813
Yeah.

214
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:08,170
Alex, you and dean just broke
the longest relationship record.

215
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:10,738
I don't know much
about relationships,

216
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:13,941
But I don't think dating another
guy is the way to celebrate.

217
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:16,443
I'm not dating ronald.
We just went out to dinner.

218
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:18,712
Well, it may have
started out as dinner,

219
00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:22,748
But when you guys came back you're all, "I
miss him, I love him, he's the love of my
life."

220
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:26,385
I never said he was
the love of my life.

221
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,087
I'm sending your story into
a teen magazine for advice

222
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:32,590
And if you don't let me juice
it up they'll never publish it.

223
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:34,492
You've got to break up with ronald.

224
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:37,529
I can't break up with ronald.

225
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:39,097
I'm not even going out with him.

226
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:42,166
I see the problem.

227
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:47,337
Ronald has to go away
for a long, long time.

228
00:12:47,372 --> 00:12:48,838
I'm on it.

229
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:50,973
Harper, forget that.

230
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:55,143
Dean's gonna come over so I can tell him I
made a mistake before he finds out from
somebody else

231
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:58,479
- And it becomes this whole big thing.
- Ok, but if that doesn't work,

232
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:02,882
I can still make ronald go
away for a long, long time.

233
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,250
What are you gonna do?

234
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,251
Start making him
really uncomfortable

235
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,687
With some of my staring until he goes away.
You know the stare.

236
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:14,524
Stop it.

237
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:17,027
You're uncomfortable, aren't you?

238
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,196
Please, harper, stop.

239
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,002
Oh, justin, honey, you'd really
have an easier time in school

240
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:30,337
If you just dressed
like everybody else.

241
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:31,906
Mom, please.

242
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,574
I'm dressed for success.

243
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:36,110
I'm gonna give the wizworld
industry executives

244
00:13:36,144 --> 00:13:39,580
A tour of wiztech so I can convince
them to remove the plastic balls.

245
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:42,249
Great! Who's gonna
cover your shift?

246
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:45,785
Me.

247
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:50,956
Hey, justin, where's your sister?

248
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,859
She told me to come over so I
made her this card in woodshop.

249
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:56,429
I think I'm finally getting
what she's trying to say,

250
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:59,096
So I'm trying to say something
I think she might get.

251
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,765
I don't know. She was hanging
out with some dude. Ronald.

252
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,400
Whoa. Ronald?

253
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:06,235
Yep. His name was
definitely ronald.

254
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:10,505
Thanks.

255
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:13,374
Now, 'cause I date your sister I
tell people not to laugh at you.

256
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:16,410
But you're not
helping me right now.

257
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:21,080
I'm going on a business trip.

258
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,949
We're gonna tell people you've
got a court date. - All right.

259
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:26,652
Tell those people I was defending you.
Do you do that?

260
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,789
'cause I need someone. All you have to do
now is prove there's no way I could throw
that far.

261
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:33,525
I didn't hear that.
I can't be associated with this.

262
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,465
Excuse me.
Are you looking for alex?

263
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:41,966
Who are you?

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,202
I'm ronald longcape, junior.

265
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:48,037
Dean moragardi. Supposed to be
a junior but I'm a sophomore.

266
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,471
I don't test well.

267
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:51,273
Hey, hold on.

268
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,374
Alex is off with a
guy named ronald.

269
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:56,377
- Are you him?
- Um, I'm here with you.

270
00:14:56,411 --> 00:15:00,213
Ah-ha. Exactly. You get that
I don't test well, right?

271
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:03,316
Look, I think I know where alex is.

272
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:06,921
- Why don't you come with me?
- All right. Thanks.

273
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,857
Hey, you're ok, ronald.
Let me know if you see that other ronald.

274
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:11,625
That guy's in big trouble.

275
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,762
Will do.

276
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,966
So, you say you don't
test well? - Nah.

277
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,339
now that you've seen
our wonderful facility

278
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,541
Don't you want to help us
so that we can reopen it

279
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,976
For wizards present and future?

280
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,778
Now, are there any questions?

281
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:36,913
Can we play in the balls now?

282
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:43,684
You're the executives
of wizworld industries.

283
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:46,153
We're not here to
play in the balls.

284
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:49,589
We're here to see if your company
will help us by removing them.

285
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:52,325
Ok. We'll help you
clean up the balls

286
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:55,462
If you let us put up a couple
of wizworld signs around here.

287
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,232
You mean like when sports
drinks sponsor sports arenas?

288
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,167
Yeah, exactly like that.

289
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,935
So, are we gonna play
in these balls or what?

290
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:05,536
Uh...

291
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,972
Well...

292
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:10,041
Then, yes. Sure, yes.

293
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:12,009
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

294
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,748
So does this mean we're
getting our school back? Yeah!

295
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:20,818
Make way! Ow! Ow!

296
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:22,887
This is unprofessional.

297
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:34,466
Dean, I'm glad you came over. - Me, too.
There's something I need to talk to you
about.

298
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,535
No, there's something I need to talk to
you about. I wanted to do it in person.

299
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:40,734
Oh, here, let me
text you right now.

300
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,877
"it's just not working out.
I'm breaking up with you."

301
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,880
What? Wait, what are you saying?

302
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,421
"I can't believe this, dean."

303
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,095
"well, you should,
because..." what are we doing?

304
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:14,930
You can't be breaking up with me.

305
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:18,166
Is this because somebody already told
you I was hanging out with this guy?

306
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,401
You mean ronald,
'cause I heard all about that.

307
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:23,604
Dean, it's true, but it was
just a big misunderstanding.

308
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:26,839
Ronald's a nice guy and he likes
me and he treated me special,

309
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:29,175
- But you're my boyfriend.
- Not anymore, I'm not.

310
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:32,577
Maybe you should make that ronald your
boyfriend. - What are you doing? Stop.

311
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,679
I am stopping. Stopping seeing you.

312
00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:36,347
Forever.

313
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,582
See you in school.

314
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,695
I know you. You're ronald and you better get
out of here, because dean's coming over.

315
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:57,066
I'm not too worried about dean.

316
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,936
Hey, look. I think I
know where alex is.

317
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,337
Why don't you come with me?

318
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:05,573
All right, thanks.
Hey, you're ok, ronald.

319
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,475
Let me know if you see
that other ronald.

320
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:09,076
That guy's in big trouble.

321
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,178
Will do.

322
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,448
So, you say you don't
test well? - Nah.

323
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:21,654
- Alex isn't in here.
- That's weird.

324
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:24,289
I thought she was.

325
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:27,158
Hold on a minute.
You'rehat other ronald.

326
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,994
Piggly wiggly, get in the jiggly

327
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:40,169
All right. Now, time for
my little dean impression.

328
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,740
Yeah, it's gonna go a
little something like this.

329
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,315
I'm dean. I don't test well.

330
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,051
That'll do.

331
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:07,532
- That makes me uncomfortable.
- Because it's working.

332
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,410
Guys! Guys!

333
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:22,511
Guess what?

334
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:25,448
I saved wiztech. You're welcome.

335
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:27,616
- How'd you do it, justin?
- It's complicated,

336
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:30,451
But I got wizworld industries
to remove all the plastic balls

337
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:35,123
And all we've got to do is let them put
up a few signs advertising their products.

338
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,992
Ooh, like sports drinks
do with sports arenas.

339
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:40,027
Yes.

340
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:41,329
Ahh!

341
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:43,164
Swishy pants gotcha.

342
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:49,068
You're the one with the beard
and I'm the mature one.

343
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:00,608
I just wish I could stop
thinking about dean.

344
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,372
See, I know that if I
was your boyfriend,

345
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:07,172
See, I wouldn't give you
stupid wooden gifts.

346
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,808
How did you know he
gave me wooden gifts?

347
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,044
Um...

348
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,879
It's a classic stupid guy move.

349
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:22,250
But this is what a
good guy would do.

350
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,689
"I like you. Do you like me?
Check yes or no."

351
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,226
Yes.

352
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:42,935
Oh, alex, this is perfect.

353
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:49,040
more perfect than you
could ever imagine.

354
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:53,643
Wait, why did you say it like that?

355
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,312
No reason.

356
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:01,050
Well, thanks for taking my
mind off things tonight.

357
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,751
You kinda make me feel special.

358
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:06,121
Now that your brother
saved wiztech,

359
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:08,256
And we're going back,

360
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,391
I'm gonna miss you, alex.

361
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:13,226
And I know it's only been two days,

362
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,928
But it seems like I've known you...

363
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:17,929
...At least a week.

364
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,133
I'll miss you, too.

365
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:26,236
Hey, you know what?

366
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,205
Why don't you come back
to wiztech with me?

367
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,274
Really? That seems so sudden.

368
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:36,477
Yeah, but doesn't it also
seem romantic? - Yeah.

369
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:39,447
And we can be that couple at
wiztech that everyone looks up to.

370
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:42,350
Maybe we can even break the
record for longest relationship.

371
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,652
Two months. - I know where
we could get a banner.

372
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:50,057
You know what?
Maybe change is good.

373
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,359
I'll go back to wiztech with you,

374
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:55,961
And we'll see about you and me.

375
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:57,763
That's perfect.

376
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,434
oh, more perfect than
you will ever know.

377
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:13,435
