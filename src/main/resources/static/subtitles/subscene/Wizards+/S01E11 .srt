1
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:11,044
Yeah, I still have to write an essay

2
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:13,921
so I'll get chosen to go
to the World School Summit at the U.N.

3
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:17,123
Yeah, once you said essay,
all I heard was blah, blah, blah.

4
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,724
Okay, let's talk about my day.
Like this guy who thinks of me as a friend.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,254
But not for long. I have a plan.

6
00:00:22,576 --> 00:00:24,454
Fascinating.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,656
Back to me,
I'm competing against this kiss-up

8
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:29,091
who has no right being chosen
for the World School Summit.

9
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,973
Seriously, you have to make your stories
more interesting,

10
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:35,144
because all I'm hearing
is blah, blah, blah.

11
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:38,899
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, kids.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,388
It's okay. I got this.

13
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:43,313
Okay, here's my plan.

14
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:45,472
This guy and I have gone out
in a group as friends,

15
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:46,666
never just the two of us.

16
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,473
But there's a concert in Central Park
and we're going as friends,

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,196
but coming back
as boyfriend and girlfriend.

18
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:54,116
And there he is.

19
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:56,358
My future boyfriend.

20
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:57,966
That guy?

21
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:00,399
That's Brad,
the guy I'm competing against.

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,123
Hey, Brad. Can't wait for the concert.

23
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,321
Oh, hey, Alex.

24
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:05,092
Oh, Mrs. Russo,
let me help you with that.

25
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:07,854
Now, what kind of a world
would let someone

26
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:11,335
as petite and delicate as you
carry such a heavy box?

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,935
My world.

28
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:17,023
See? He's a kiss-up.

29
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:19,382
He's not a kiss-up.
He's good at getting what he wants.

30
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:21,625
That's one of the things
we have in common.

31
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,189
That guy makes me so mad.

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,746
Another thing we have in common.
We both like making you mad.

33
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:30,105
Oh, hey, guys.

34
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:33,629
Max is trying wizard
training exercise number five. Again.

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,236
I can do it. I know I can levitate this can.

36
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,450
That's bunk. I can't do it.

37
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:48,450
Don't worry, buddy. It'll happen.

38
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:50,884
Keep working on lesson number five.

39
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:53,485
And you two,
we're on lesson number 372.

40
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,814
Now, who can guess what these are?

41
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:01,213
It's charades.

42
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,621
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yes.</i>

43
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:06,309
No. I'm showing different emotions.

44
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:10,107
Today's lesson is about potions
that make you have emotions.

45
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:11,461
Emotion potions.

46
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:14,434
Not potions
that make you move quicker or slower.

47
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:17,437
Those are motion potions.

48
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,234
Did you see what I just did?

49
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,801
Yeah. That was a crime of a rhyme.

50
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:24,598
Wow, that was lame and I'm ashamed.

51
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:27,526
Now, the most important thing
to remember

52
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,688
is when an emotion potion
is shared by two people,

53
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:33,088
they both experience
the same emotion.

54
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:35,092
Now come on, Justin,
let's give a potion a try.

55
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:36,649
Pick a potion, any potion.

56
00:02:37,977 --> 00:02:39,047
Not that one.

57
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:40,738
That one. Yeah.

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,294
Good. That was my second choice.

59
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:46,660
Here we go.

60
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,106
Bottoms up.

61
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,664
Okay.

62
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:59,514
In a few seconds, the spell will activate

63
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,474
and Justin and I will become mad
at each other for no reason at all.

64
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm feeling kind of angry.
I think it's working, Dad.

65
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:13,408
You're the best teacher ever.

66
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:15,726
Oh, no, no. Don't put that on me.

67
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:19,734
You're a great student
and I am really proud of you.

68
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:22,725
Oh, yeah? Well, you're the best dad
in the whole wide world.

69
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:24,298
How about that?

70
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,129
I love you.

71
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,530
I love you more.

72
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:29,982
Yeah.

73
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:33,220
- Look at them.
- What's the big deal?

74
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,422
I've seen them do that
over the toy in the cereal box.

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,064
Yeah.

76
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,838
- How do I look?
- Why?

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,873
Because I'm gonna see Brad at school.

78
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,995
I've stopped with the ponytail,
which says friend,

79
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,799
and I've gone to full hair,
so I can flip it like this.

80
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:41,407
Because that says girlfriend.

81
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,924
Mom, I don't feel so good.

82
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,369
Oh, honey.

83
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,369
You don't feel warm.

84
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,343
All right. Who's doing this?
Put me down.

85
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:01,615
- I'm not doing it.
- I can't.

86
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,460
Not me. Why would...?

87
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:04,908
- It's me?
- Yep.

88
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,625
It's all you.
Hey, your full powers are here.

89
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,186
You're in the competition with us.

90
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:12,193
So what? I'm still gonna win
and be the one that keeps his powers.

91
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:14,468
No, I'm the one
who's keeping his powers.

92
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:17,114
I'm taking you both down.

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,711
Now, how do I get down?

94
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:24,038
Now that your full powers are here,
it's time for the hat.

95
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,999
- Oh, the hat.
- Not the hat.

96
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:28,644
- What hat?
- Dad, that hat is so ugly.

97
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,245
What hat?

98
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:32,484
<i>I can't believe
my mijito's ready for the hat.</i>

99
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:34,891
Somebody tell me
about the hat already.

100
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,735
The hat will keep your powers
under control

101
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,770
for a few days while they settle in.

102
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:40,857
Alex, give him the hat.

103
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,699
This?

104
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:54,871
I am not wearing this thing to school.

105
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:58,431
Max, we all had to wear it.
Just do what I did.

106
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:01,232
I wore some really ugly earrings
to distract from the ugly hat.

107
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:03,831
That shirt will do.

108
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:06,919
Come on, let's go to school.

109
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:16,132
There's no way I'm wearing
this leaning tower of velvet to school.

110
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,056
Wow, what happened to our roof?
It's snowing.

111
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,410
Your hat.

112
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:29,457
Right, it will protect me from the snow.

113
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:32,183
No, it caused the snow.

114
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:33,628
Keep your hat on.

115
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,750
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Brad.

116
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:44,147
What's that all over you?

117
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,316
Dandruff. Really bad dandruff.

118
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,362
It runs in our family.

119
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,004
No, wait. It's snow.
I saw it snowing in there.

120
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,801
Oh, Brad. You're so funny.

121
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,082
If we were going in a group to the concert,
everyone would laugh at you.

122
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,283
But it's just us two.

123
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:03,326
In the park.

124
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:05,529
On Saturday.

125
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,816
Is there something wrong
with your neck?

126
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:11,736
I'm just real excited for Saturday.

127
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:14,055
You know what?
There is something wrong with my neck.

128
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,303
Could you rub it for me, please?

129
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,346
Oh, Saturday. I forgot, I can't.

130
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,024
That's the night of the World Summit.

131
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,747
What? That was the night
of the group thing with just you and me.

132
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:25,513
How are you sure
you'll go to the summit?

133
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,832
It's not all about the schmoozing.
It's about the work.

134
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:29,597
You haven't done anything to deserve it.

135
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,318
It's always about the schmoozing,
Justin.

136
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,714
- Nice haircut.
- Really?

137
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:36,914
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

138
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:40,962
I thought I might have gone too short,
but I wanted it sharp for the interviews.

139
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,361
Hey, you're schmoozing me.

140
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:45,732
What a jerk.

141
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:46,923
He is so cute.

142
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:48,455
He is...

143
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,174
Nice job on the essay, Justin.

144
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,493
Thank you, Mr. Laritate.

145
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:00,424
Does this mean I'm gonna be
the World Summit delegate?

146
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,020
Hold your horses, buckaroo.
You still have the home interview.

147
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,950
Because hospitality is an important part
of being a world delegate.

148
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,505
It's down to you and Brad Sherwood.

149
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:11,354
And you know Brad.

150
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:14,198
He has such a way with people.

151
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,232
Hey, Mr. Laritate.

152
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,513
How were those brownies I sent you?

153
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:19,918
You remembered, no nuts.

154
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:22,162
Because of your allergies.

155
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,329
- You baked brownies for Mr. Laritate?
- Yeah.

156
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,599
I was already baking a batch

157
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,371
for the group of seniors
I read to after school, so...

158
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:30,562
I read to people too.

159
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:31,763
I read to preschoolers,

160
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:35,573
because they need someone
to read to them because they can't read.

161
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,412
Kudos to you, Justin.

162
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,011
If only I weren't busy
coaching inner-city kids,

163
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:43,579
I'd do more charity work.

164
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:45,025
Compassion.

165
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:47,139
Brad, that's exactly the quality

166
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,705
I'm looking for in a delegate
to the World Summit.

167
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,429
Good luck, Justin.

168
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,870
Guess what.
It is all about the schmoozing.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,116
I know, but I have an idea

170
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,552
on how I can get Brad
to go to the concert with me.

171
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:05,197
Why is it always about you?

172
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:07,158
If Brad goes to the concert with me,

173
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:09,404
he'll drop out of the summit
and you'll be a shoo-in.

174
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:11,729
Are we on the same side?

175
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,002
It's a little creepy, but I think we are.

176
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,410
Here's the plan.
I'm gonna split a love potion with Brad.

177
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:19,449
He'll be so in love with me,
he'll be dying to go to the concert with me.

178
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,339
We can't do that. We're not supposed
to use magic unsupervised.

179
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,376
You'll supervise me, I'll supervise you.
How is that unsupervised?

180
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:27,653
Lt'll have to do for now.

181
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,228
Okay, Brad's here. Love potion time.

182
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:39,152
If I don't see it, I can say I didn't see it.

183
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:40,791
Oh, my gosh.

184
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:44,953
Made you look.

185
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:50,397
Hey, Brad. Your order's ready.

186
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:53,679
You may wanna start with the drink first
because the sandwich is a little dry.

187
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,683
I didn't order yet.

188
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,765
Yeah, but you and I just get each other.

189
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:00,965
I know what you want.
Enjoy your drink.

190
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:06,813
Quick. This guy needs a drink.

191
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,169
- No, no.
- Here, take this.

192
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:09,451
Wait. What are you doing?

193
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,899
- I thought he'd like root beer better.
- Here.

194
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:14,336
See?

195
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,220
Worked like a charm.
Enjoy your sandwich.

196
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,391
- Free refills.
- Hey, it's mine.

197
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:28,549
That was close.

198
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:32,641
Kitchen.

199
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,286
Do you realise what you just did?

200
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:39,599
Oh, my gosh.
I drank both halves of the love potion.

201
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:41,881
So if he didn't drink it,
who falls in love with you?

202
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:48,731
Oh, hello, gorgeous.

203
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,890
Who is that?

204
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:54,935
I think you fell in love with yourself.

205
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:57,738
So what?
There's a lot about me to love.

206
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,949
There's more now.

207
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,312
Oh, that's what they mean when they say
you're getting a big head.

208
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,591
Not as heavy as you think.

209
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:20,358
Okay, we're just gonna say this:

210
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,917
"Dad, completely by accident,
we mixed a love potion

211
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,006
and then completely
by a different accident,

212
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,450
Alex drank both halves of it."

213
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:28,564
- Think he'll believe that?
- Yes.

214
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,534
If I can get him to drink an
"I'll believe anything" potion.

215
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:35,860
I don't understand why Brad
doesn't think of me as a girlfriend.

216
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,216
I'm beautiful, I'm funny,
and I always smell a little bit like vanilla.

217
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:45,185
There's no way you can go out
with Brad looking like that.

218
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,107
I'm gonna have to go back
to my original plan,

219
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,028
beat Brad fair and square
with that interview.

220
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:51,303
What about me?
I thought we were on the same side.

221
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:53,586
Oh, no. That ended with the:

222
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,596
I guess I was kind of stupid
for drinking both halves of the love potion.

223
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:04,279
What did you just say?

224
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:07,366
I said, I guess I was kind of stupid.

225
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:09,444
That's it.

226
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,881
Every time you brag about yourself,
your head gets bigger.

227
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:14,209
Every time you bag on yourself,
your head gets smaller.

228
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,213
So remember, bag, don't brag.

229
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,816
Oh, I get it. Like,

230
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:21,209
I can't think of anything wrong with me.

231
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:25,544
I'm gonna work on a cheat sheet
of ways you can bag on yourself.

232
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:28,659
Bag number one: You're stupid enough
to drink both halves of a love potion.

233
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:49,646
Max. What are you doing?
Put your hat back on.

234
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:52,527
I had it on,
but people keep making fun of me.

235
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:58,209
Wear the hat for a few more days
till your powers come in.

236
00:12:58,334 --> 00:12:59,688
Jeez, you're in a mood.

237
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,408
I got a lot going on.

238
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:06,810
Brad Sherwood, you managed to outdo
yourself at the home interview last night.

239
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:08,342
- Thank you.
- You better saddle up

240
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,899
and get ready
for the World Summit, buckaroo.

241
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:14,864
Oh, hello, Justin.

242
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,743
You still want me to come over tonight?

243
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,512
Yes. It's a scheduled interview.
I'm still a finalist.

244
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:24,266
Mr. Laritate,
have you been working out, sir?

245
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:25,877
Well, you look great.

246
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:33,078
Oh, my gosh.
Someone sent me flowers.

247
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,844
I wonder who it could be.

248
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,799
Me.

249
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:44,488
Guys.

250
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:47,616
Okay, so Mr. Laritate's coming,
so no one's gonna use magic.

251
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:49,252
Are we clear?

252
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,258
You're just gonna smile
and direct conversation

253
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:54,820
to one of my many achievements,
conveniently listed on these cheat sheets.

254
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:56,664
One, two.

255
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:58,457
Wow, this is tiny.

256
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:02,106
If this was a list of my achievements,
it would be way longer.

257
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,432
- Alex.
- Sorry.

258
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,706
"Alex doesn't play well with others."

259
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:09,596
You make a lot of cheat sheets.

260
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,718
He's here.

261
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:15,922
Ready?

262
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:21,320
Hello. I'm Justin's mom, Theresa,
and it's so nice to meet you.

263
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,361
Hi, I'm Mr. Laritate.

264
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,528
Come on in.
You know Justin, of course.

265
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,653
This is my daughter, Alex,
and my other son, Max.

266
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:32,216
Jerry is out on the terrace
cooking our steaks.

267
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,213
Jerry's Justin's dad.

268
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,615
And also my husband.

269
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:37,137
I felt the need to say both

270
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:39,825
because in these modern times,
you just can't assume that.

271
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:42,896
Let's sit down.

272
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,502
Aren't you a spirited filly?

273
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,434
Speaking of spirited filly,

274
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,470
you know who rode a pony by himself
when he was 9?

275
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:55,793
My brother Justin.

276
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:00,958
Look, I believe
in being a straight shooter.

277
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:04,756
Your boy Justin
is a long shot for the World Summit.

278
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:06,567
Well, let me tell you
about my strengths.

279
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:10,481
My dedication to academics,
my interest in geopolitics.

280
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:15,372
Of course, he knows all the words
to almost all of the U2 songs.

281
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,377
Okay, we're done with this. Go. Get.

282
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,062
Look, I'm an upright hombre.

283
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:23,778
So I'd like to give you a fair shake.

284
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:25,777
How would you handle a situation

285
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:29,225
where two delegates at the summit
get into a strong disagreement?

286
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,470
Well, first, I would...

287
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:33,185
I'll tell you what I would do.

288
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:34,946
I would use my bubbly personality

289
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:38,194
to get them to both agree with me,
since I'm always right.

290
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:41,279
Hey, did I show you
my second-grade soccer trophy?

291
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,513
It's for participation.

292
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,682
I didn't play,
but I was nice to everyone. Here.

293
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,763
I do more than participate. I'm a leader.

294
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:54,123
In fact, I set fashion trends at school
on a regular basis.

295
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,173
Read this. It's the W volume.

296
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:05,657
Oh, good. The magic in that hat
keeps your head normal size.

297
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:08,582
But what about Max's powers?

298
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:10,584
I'll get it.

299
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:16,667
Brad.

300
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,704
You couldn't stay away from me,
could you?

301
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,147
Oh, Alex. You get me.

302
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:23,233
That's why I brought you
these chocolates. Here.

303
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:26,150
Wow, candy.
Like what a boyfriend would give a...

304
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,956
- Is that Mr. Laritate?
- Come on in.

305
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,597
Oh, hey, Mr. Laritate. Nice to...

306
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:32,675
You're not here for Alex.

307
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:34,605
You're here
because it's my interview night.

308
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:39,727
Is tonight the night of your interview?
Well, I had no idea.

309
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:41,685
Hey, Mr. Laritate. Check it out.

310
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:45,048
Hey, we're the bolo boys.

311
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:47,939
Bolo ties. Why didn't I think of that?

312
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,735
What are you doing with your hat off?
We've got Mr. Laritate over.

313
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,582
And that guy.

314
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,374
Who's that guy?

315
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:56,418
He's Brad. He's my new boyfriend.

316
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,301
I'll decide who your new boyfriend is.

317
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,390
Mr. Russo, did you make this salsa?
It's fresh.

318
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:03,869
You grow cilantro out on your terrace,
don't you?

319
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,474
Yes. I like your new boyfriend.

320
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:16,198
Why is your head getting bigger?

321
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:18,279
It's not.
Maybe you're standing too close.

322
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,006
Oh, nice try.

323
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:22,280
You drank both halves of a potion,
didn't you?

324
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:24,249
Yes, but it was for a good reason.

325
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:26,649
I wanted Brad to like me
more than just a friend.

326
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:30,208
So you'd be okay with a guy liking you
just because he's under a spell?

327
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:32,136
That's the best part.
He's not under a spell.

328
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,297
I messed it up,
and he still brought me chocolates.

329
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,183
Well, then I guess
everything's okay, isn't it?

330
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:39,661
I don't feel like steaks.

331
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:43,145
I've got a craving for Chinese food.

332
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,102
Wonder who that could be.

333
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:49,789
I'll just go and see.

334
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:03,319
Who ordered Chinese food?

335
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,360
I love Chinese food.

336
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:08,768
Alex, Justin,
can I show you something?

337
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:11,974
Come on. Come on.

338
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:24,619
Does this look okay to you guys?

339
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,500
Because I don't remember moving.

340
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,621
To China!

341
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:31,631
We didn't do this magic, Dad. I swear.

342
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:32,823
No, Max did.

343
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:35,151
Because he can't wear his hat,
because you have to.

344
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:38,868
And we can't fix any of this right now
because of all those people inside.

345
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:41,800
So why don't we get those people
to go home?

346
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:45,641
They're 6,000 miles away
from their homes.

347
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:48,599
So, what are we gonna do?

348
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,008
Wow, whatever Max craves,
that's where the loft moves.

349
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,691
He does love pineapple.

350
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:00,016
Oh, I've never been to Hawaii.

351
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,372
Come on. We gotta get out of here.
Come on.

352
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:05,739
Act natural.

353
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:20,111
Wow, I never expected to be entertained
with food from all over the world.

354
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:22,912
This is quite the hoedown.

355
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,314
Spectacular.

356
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,191
It's too spectacular.

357
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:28,319
There's something going on here,
Mr. Laritate.

358
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:31,438
Yeah, you better fix
that hitch in your giddyup.

359
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:34,767
What Justin did
was bring world cultures together,

360
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:38,282
demonstrating his passion
for world affairs.

361
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:39,563
You know what, Justin?

362
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:42,733
These are the qualities I'm looking for.

363
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:46,090
- You're going to the World Summit.
- Oh, my gosh.

364
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,497
That's great. I won?

365
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,181
I lost? I never lose.

366
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:51,784
I came here to make sure that I won.

367
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:53,220
That's why you came here?

368
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:55,663
I even bought this stupid bolo tie.

369
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,029
Bolo ties are not stupid.

370
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:01,428
They are the official neckwear
of Arizona.

371
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:06,309
Sloppy, sloppy work.

372
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,239
You know, I'm gonna get my wife
so we can take these lessons together.

373
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:13,195
- You can't leave. Stay.
- What's the rush?

374
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:15,681
Mr. Laritate,
could you hold on just one moment?

375
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:18,967
Brad, you didn't come here for me.

376
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,239
You came here for you.

377
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,166
I wanted us to be more than friends,
but you're not even a friend.

378
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:25,251
I think we should break up.

379
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,895
Break up? We were never going out.

380
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:33,134
Well, in my mind, we were.
But now that's all over.

381
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:35,060
How does it feel
to be theoretically dumped?

382
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:40,857
Brad, you can go.

383
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,181
And, Mr. Laritate,
thanks for stopping by.

384
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,109
Oh, I'll be back.

385
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:47,824
Better luck next time, Brad.

386
00:20:49,356 --> 00:20:51,030
And since you think it's so stupid,

387
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:54,676
you, sir, have no right to wear this.

388
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,685
Well,

389
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:05,325
I guess since I'm free Saturday night,
I can go to that concert with you.

390
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,881
I don't think so.

391
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:10,485
I'm nobody's second choice,
because I'm a prize.

392
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:12,936
I've never noticed before,

393
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:14,936
but your head's a little too big
for your body.

394
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,288
I know. Goodbye.

395
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,815
Fine. Fine.

396
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,422
There's something weird about this.

397
00:21:19,543 --> 00:21:21,775
And there's something weird
about all you Russos.

398
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,261
I'm gonna find out what it is.

399
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:27,620
Well, good luck with that, Brad.
Goodbye.

400
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:29,421
Yes.

401
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:33,150
Well, congratulations on winning
your World Summit dele-geek thing.

402
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,346
Thanks.

403
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:36,309
Sorry about what happened
with you and Brad.

404
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:37,508
Oh, it's okay.

405
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:40,679
I don't know if you noticed,
but he was a real schmoozer.

406
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:43,159
Oh, really? You just noticed?

407
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:46,120
Dad, how long do we got to live
with Big Head over here?

408
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:49,758
It could be a few weeks
before it wears off.

409
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,089
Hey, or we could try this.

410
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:56,725
Okay. There you go.

411
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:59,090
Now, clean this up.

412
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,942
Oh, that is so sweet.

413
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,944
- Where did all this come from?
- Me.

414
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:16,665
- I thought the potion wore off.
- It did.

415
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:19,789
What didn't wear off is how good I feel
about sending myself flowers.

416
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:21,716
Who's gonna be kinder to me than me?

417
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,797
Certainly not me.

418
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:26,042
Oh, my gosh.

419
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:29,238
I am so funny. I didn't see that coming.
