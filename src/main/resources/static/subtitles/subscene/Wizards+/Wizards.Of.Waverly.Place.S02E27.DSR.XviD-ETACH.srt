1
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:06,372
OK, guys, Juliet's gonna
be here any minute.

2
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,341
How do I look?

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,161
You think the boutonniere's over the top?
Is a little bit, huh?

4
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:16,627
What about my candelabrum?

5
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:19,764
It would be fine, if you had
a hunchback and a bell tower.

6
00:00:21,662 --> 00:00:24,424
Justin, relax. It's gonna be fine.

7
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:25,824
Well, it's just this
is the first meal

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,590
Juliet's having with our family

9
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:29,557
and, you know, I don't
want anything to go wrong.

10
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:31,921
Oh, what could possibly go wrong?

11
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:33,619
I think tonight might be the night

12
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:36,408
I try to eat my dinner blindfolded.

13
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:40,410
But then you wouldn't
know what you were eating.

14
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:42,510
You should do it.

15
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:45,844
Dad, give me the socks you're
wearing and some butter. Go.

16
00:00:47,644 --> 00:00:50,175
I don't need butter to eat socks.

17
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,609
Good luck not being ashamed
of all that, sweetie.

18
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:58,443
Justin's new vampire girlfriend
is coming over for dinner tonight.

19
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:00,076
I still can't get
used to saying that.

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,543
I can.

21
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,344
Justin's got a girlfriend,

22
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:04,811
a vampire girlfriend.

23
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,012
- Justin's got a girlfriend.
- Dad!

24
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:10,113
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to get out

25
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:13,213
all of my inappropriate
behavior before she gets here.

26
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:16,314
Hey, who wants to see
my appendix scar?

27
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,916
That's her.

28
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,617
Dad, I'm not opening that door
until you put your shirt down.

29
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:27,651
Good.

30
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:31,252
OK.

31
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:36,286
Hi, Justin.

32
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:39,454
Hello, Juliet.

33
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:42,756
Why, you're a vision of
loveliness and enchantment.

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,057
Oh, you're so cute when you
give me old-timey compliments.

35
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:49,224
Well, you're a vampire.
Vampires are really old, right?

36
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,460
I mean, uh, not that
you're old or look old.

37
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:57,261
You look great for your age.
Which would be...?

38
00:01:57,295 --> 00:02:00,095
Justin, I already told you,
I'm not telling you how old I am.

39
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,597
If I did, you would freak out.
Like Caesar did. Oh, shoot!

40
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:06,932
I'm narrowing it down.

41
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,934
Nobody cares.

42
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:13,502
Yoknow my family.

43
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:15,402
Hi, guys.

44
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:17,771
Wow, it smells
really great in here.

45
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,705
Well, I've prepared a special meal

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,774
in honor of our special guest.

47
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,942
It's my special...

48
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:30,711
...ten cheese enchilada surprise.

49
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:34,246
The surprise is an eleventh cheese!

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,616
Eleven cheeses in one dish? Um...

51
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,317
I'm really sorry, Mr.
and Mrs. Russo.

52
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,418
I don't think I can eat that.

53
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:44,252
I probably should've
mentioned this earlier,

54
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:47,221
but vampires are kind
of health conscious.

55
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:50,489
Juliet, you're right.

56
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:53,991
This cheesy food could
be considered unhealthy.

57
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:57,560
And my family deserves
better than that.

58
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:05,531
From now on, the Russos will
be eating much healthier.

59
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,966
Isn't that right, Jerry?

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,233
Get in there and
fight for our cake!

61
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,101
Right.

62
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:15,571
Sure, honey. You know
how I always support

63
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,638
your unpredictable whims.

64
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:20,073
Sorry.

65
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:23,409
Thank you.
Now throw that cake away.

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,854
Wow! You've only been
here for a few minutes

67
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,589
and my family's already
better off for knowing you.

68
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,657
You're incredible.

69
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,125
- No, you are, Justin.
- No, you are.

70
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,793
No, you are.

71
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,394
Butterfly kiss!

72
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:55,863
Wow. well...

73
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:57,731
This just is great.

74
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:59,298
I'm gonna go take out the trash.

75
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:08,404
I'm gonna help her.

76
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,376
<i>* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

77
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,344
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

78
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,212
<i>* You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease *</i>

79
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,047
<i>* Yes please *</i>

80
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:22,882
<i>* But you might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

81
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,884
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

82
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,386
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

83
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:28,921
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

84
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:32,091
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

85
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:35,930
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

86
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:39,732
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

87
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:43,734
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

88
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:47,303
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

89
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:51,406
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

90
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,108
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

91
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:59,278
<i>* Because everything is not... *</i>

92
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:02,548
<i>* What it seems *</i>

94
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,585
Thanks to Juliet,
I have seen the error of our ways.

95
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,220
We are throwing out
all of this junk food

96
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:10,688
and we're never lookin' back.

97
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,355
Wait, Mom. You can't do that.

98
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,056
Of course I can, sweetie.
I'm your mom.

99
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:16,091
I can do whatever I want.

100
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:19,061
Well, then I'm out.

101
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,796
I was this close

102
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,532
to eating meals with you
guys out of convenience,

103
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,734
but you, mother,
just put a stop to that.

104
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:29,103
So thank you for
ruining our family!

105
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,905
I'm just kidding.

106
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:34,307
But seriously, I'm not
gonna eat with you guys.

107
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:36,842
That... that's just so good.

108
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:42,113
Hi, Juliet.
Guess what's in this bag.

109
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:45,349
Nothing but junk food.
I could smell it from a mile away.

110
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:48,185
Vampire sense of smell.
Hey, is Justin around?

111
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:50,887
Oh, he's upstairs.

112
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:56,725
Look at you. Cloudy day so
you're out without an umbrella.

113
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,926
Excuse me?

114
00:05:58,027 --> 00:06:00,462
I know you're a vampire.

115
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:02,764
I'm Harper. And I just
want to let you know

116
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,432
that there are no hard feelings.

117
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,233
Hard feelings? About what?

118
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,435
Oh, Justin didn't tell you?

119
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,905
That is just like him,
trying to spare other people's feelings.

120
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,408
He and I have had an on-and-off
relationship for years.

121
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,110
We're off now, which is why
you guys are on. So I'm cool.

122
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,545
Whoa, whoa! What's with the garlic?

123
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,279
We were just having a conversation.

124
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:26,717
Sorry. I just wasn't sure how
this whole thing was gonna go.

125
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,586
So you made a garlic necklace.

126
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,087
No, I actually had it.

127
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:33,222
It's for this pasta outfit
that I'm working on.

128
00:06:33,256 --> 00:06:37,258
Oh, you're the
food-for-clothes girl.

129
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:41,261
Yeah, Justin has talked about you.

130
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:43,931
Yes!

131
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,641
So this is our new garden,

132
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:57,310
where we'll be growing all
sorts of exciting vegetables,

133
00:06:57,345 --> 00:07:00,980
including broccoli, which they
say has near magical qualities.

134
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:03,348
It'll be magical if
I can get it down

135
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,383
without a warm cheese sauce.

136
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:12,989
Hmm. Magical qualities, huh?

137
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:14,357
Did you say something, Max?

138
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,058
Nope. Didn't say a word.

139
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:22,063
Hmm. Magical qualities, huh.

140
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:25,866
Let's just pretend we
didn't hear it that time.

141
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:32,204
Don't let this garden go to waste.

142
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,807
Give all this food
a lot more taste.

143
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,443
Well, that was unexpected.

144
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:50,286
Man, that Pilates class was great.

145
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:53,656
I've never felt more physically
or emotionally centered

146
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,857
in all of my life.

147
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,626
Hey Alex, would you
like to join us?

148
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,160
It'd really help
strengthen your core.

149
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,963
Oh, no thanks. I like my core
loose and in front of the TV.

150
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:19,644
Uh... Dad, aren't those
shorts a little tight?

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,181
They're looser than
I thought they'd be.

152
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,753
Oh! Oh, my gosh. What is going on?

153
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,721
A total aerobic workout.
That's what's going on.

154
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,923
The perfect complement
to healthy eating.

155
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,326
- Dad, you're OK with this?
- Yeah, of course.

156
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,396
What's not to be OK with?
It's a great idea.

157
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,432
Let's start stretching, Jerry.

158
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:47,202
Another great idea.

159
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:51,339
I just...

160
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:53,008
Trying to...

161
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,078
Oh!

162
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,581
Wha...? I give up
eating with you people,

163
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:01,249
and now you're making it impossible

164
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,218
for me to watch
television in my own home?

165
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm so desperate, I'm thinking
about going to Harper's house.

166
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:12,892
Hum de dum de dum.

167
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,762
- What are you doing?
- What? Nothing.

168
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,730
Why do you ask?

169
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,865
Because it looks like
you're humming suspiciously

170
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,198
to look casual.

171
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,134
That's exactly what I was doing.

172
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:27,536
Now, let's see what
you're really up to.

173
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,374
Oh!

174
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:37,312
Max! What did you do?

175
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:39,347
Umm...

176
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:42,116
Well, I just wanted to use magic

177
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,751
to make the vegetables
taste better,

178
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:46,886
but I've made a giant pumpkin.

179
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,423
I'm going to live in it.

180
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,160
First, I need to carve a
door in the side of it.

181
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,531
Max, that's a spoon.

182
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,499
I know what it's called.

183
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:18,412
Oh.

184
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:23,050
Alex Russo and friend.
What a pleasant surprise.

185
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:25,118
What can I get for you?

186
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:27,687
Your daughter out of my house.

187
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:30,723
She's made it impossible for
me to eat anything unhealthy.

188
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:35,093
You know, with all the
time Juliet's been spending

189
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:38,596
with your brother, we could
use an extra hand around here.

190
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:40,698
What would you say
to a part-time job

191
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:42,833
here at the Late Nite Bite?

192
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:47,837
A job? Well, doesn't sound
like something I'd do,

193
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:52,039
but it would get me out
of Family Exercise Night.

194
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:55,542
Look at you. So clever and cunning.

195
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,778
Sometimes we wish
Juliet had more of that.

196
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:59,846
Yeah, in a lot of ways,

197
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,715
you're probably more like
a vampire than she is.

198
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,383
Oh, thank you.

199
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:09,320
So it's settled. You'll both
start working here immediately.

200
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:12,390
Me, too? Yes!

201
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:16,527
You know, we find
Juliet's health kicks

202
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:18,161
rather irritating, too.

203
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,897
Really? I thought all vampires
were health conscious.

204
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,900
No, it's mainly just
the younger generation.

205
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,069
They sometimes even try to
get humans to eat better

206
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,838
so they'll have
healthier blood to suck.

207
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:32,039
They're very fanatical about it.

208
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,608
What did you just say?

209
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:36,810
I said they're fanatical about it.

210
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,779
No, before that.

211
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:41,681
I said it's mainly the
younger generation.

212
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:44,149
Yes, but after that.

213
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:47,652
Oh, I think she's talking about
the part where you mentioned

214
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,254
how younger vampires try
to get humans healthier

215
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,557
before drinking their
delicious blood.

216
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:56,560
That's the one. OK, um...

217
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:58,995
Well, excuse me, just...

218
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:04,633
Oh! You've got to be kidding me.

219
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,869
But her shift just started.

220
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:09,405
I'll cover her shift.
I knew how this was gonna go.

221
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,139
I just didn't think it
would happen so soon.

222
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:26,777
Max?

223
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:31,314
There's some mail here for ya.

224
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:33,616
Hold on.

225
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,529
This is my mail slot.

226
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:50,131
Yeah, I get it.

227
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,366
I hope you're not jealous

228
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,234
that I moved out of the
house before you did.

229
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:59,207
Tell Mommy and Daddy I said,
"Hi." Loser.

230
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,845
OK. I'll tell 'em.

231
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:08,916
Mom, Dad. The kid living
in the jack-o'-lantern

232
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,085
thinks I'm the loser.

233
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:16,090
Justin, uh,
let's talk about Juliet.

234
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:18,892
Isn't she the greatest?
I could talk about her all day.

235
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:21,694
Yes, she's cute, and she's
looking past your jungle toes,

236
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:24,496
and we're all really excited
for you, but look...

237
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:26,398
She wants to drink your blood.

238
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,133
What are you talking about?

239
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,401
I got a job over at
the Late Nite Bite,

240
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,637
and while I was there I found
out that young vampires

241
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,339
like to feed on the healthiest
human blood they can find.

242
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,209
I can't believe it.

243
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:40,977
You got a job?

244
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:45,114
- I know, it's weird, huh?
- Totally. Up top!

245
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:46,649
No! Stop.

246
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,252
I think Juliet is trying
to get you healthy

247
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,254
so she can drink your blood.

248
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,856
Come on, Alex. Juliet's
a vampire with a soul,

249
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,290
so she has a conscience.

250
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:58,826
That's why she volunteers at
blood banks on the weekends.

251
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,895
Keep talkin'. You're almost there.

252
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,763
And I bet you think it's
weird that she salivates

253
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:05,399
uncontrollably around me when
I wear v-neck t-shirts, too.

254
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:07,601
On to sports.

255
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,640
Oh, my gosh! My girlfriend's
gonna suck my blood.

256
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:18,678
Well, look at that,
you stuck the landing.

257
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:23,116
Justin.

258
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:24,784
Juliet!

259
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:29,622
Vampire speed. Forgot about that.

260
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:32,791
Hey, why are you wearing a scarf?
It's like 75 degrees out.

261
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,993
I'm not wearing a scarf.

262
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:38,830
Oh, you mean this? OK,
I'm wearing a scarf.

263
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:41,398
Why are you acting so weird?

264
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:44,267
You probably have heat stroke.

265
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:46,102
Let's get that scarf off.

266
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:54,475
Hey, so, guess what?

267
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,644
I woke up this evening and
my fangs had come in. Look.

268
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,180
Stay back!

269
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:05,683
Keep your filthy fangs away
from my perfect, succulent neck!

270
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:08,852
- Justin! What are you doing?
- Trying to save my life.

271
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:10,587
Alex told me you're
trying to get me healthy

272
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,355
just so you can drink my blood.

273
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,557
What? No, you're my boyfriend.

274
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:16,191
I would never do
anything like that.

275
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:17,793
I know, but Alex said...

276
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,728
Aren't you always saying
your sister's up to no good?

277
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:21,829
Why would you believe her?

278
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:24,897
It's a complicated
relationship we have together.

279
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:31,537
I'm sorry, I should've known
better than to listen to Alex.

280
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:33,305
Just 'cause she's working
for your parents,

281
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,741
she thinks she's like
some expert on vampires.

282
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:37,176
She's working for my parents?

283
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,077
Yeah, she's over there
now with Harper.

284
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,345
Oh, my gosh. There's no
easy way to say this,

285
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,480
so I'm just gonna come
right out with it.

286
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:44,781
OK.

287
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:46,750
My parents might be planning
to drink their blood.

288
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:48,584
I love you, too. I...

289
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,289
You didn't say what I
thought you were...

290
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:55,324
Come on! Let's go
tell your parents!

291
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,661
Mom, Dad...

292
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:00,662
Juliet said she loved me.

293
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:04,799
Well, she didn't,
but I thought she was going to.

294
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,035
Justin. Blood drinking.

295
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,837
And she didn't freak
out when I said it.

296
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:11,073
- Aww.
- Thank you, Mom.

297
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,076
Alex. Harper. Danger.

298
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,012
This is an important milestone
in out relationship.

299
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:18,313
My parents are about to drink
Alex and Harper's blood.

300
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:19,480
- Oh!
- What?

301
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,683
Thank you. Someone who
understands danger.

302
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:24,718
OK, now that they know that,

303
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:26,720
can we get back to
talking about us?

304
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:29,021
We'll talk about it
on the way. Come on.

305
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,356
Did the satellite guy come?

306
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,726
I gotta tell him where
to put the dish.

307
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,794
Max, we are in the middle
of something, here.

308
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:39,296
Your sister and Harper are
about to be bitten by vampires.

309
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,631
Cool! That's even better
than the satellite.

310
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,466
Come on. Let's get over there.

311
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:47,637
Oh, my gosh. What if we
only have time to save one?

312
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:49,739
Alex is our daughter.

313
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:53,275
But Harper has so
much more potential.

314
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,143
We both know it'd be Harper

315
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:56,945
who'd take care of
us in our old age.

316
00:16:58,414 --> 00:16:59,747
We'll talk about it on our way.

317
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,820
All right...

318
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:07,588
Since it's between rushes,

319
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,459
why don't we take your
photos for your company IDs.

320
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:14,128
But there's only two employees.

321
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,764
It's a state law thing.
Just take a picture, will ya?

322
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:21,168
I'm sorry. I'm just a tad hungry,
that's all.

323
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:24,004
Alex, you first. Mmm?

324
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,907
OK, good.

325
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:31,043
Just tilt your head a little.

326
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:32,777
More.

327
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,480
More...

328
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,215
More.

329
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,717
Uh... This is a
little uncomfortable.

330
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,819
But it makes for a good picture.

331
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,589
Chin out. Chin out.
Really stretch it.

332
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:49,524
Now, Cindy, why don't
you go over there

333
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,192
and help her with
her head position?

334
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,094
But it's Alex's employee ID.

335
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:55,129
Oh, relax. Cindy's a vampire.

336
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,064
She's not going to
show up in the picture.

337
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,065
Come on, Cindy.

338
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,601
Actually, I didn't
know I was going first.

339
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:05,471
I thought I was "
taking a picture" with, uh...

340
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:08,573
...hmmm, Harper.

341
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:12,110
Uh, Heh-heh. N-n-no,
I don't think we dided that.

342
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:15,279
Yes, we did. You were going
to "take a picture" wh Alex,

343
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:18,515
who is, frankly,
slightly more bitter.

344
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,218
Would somebody take my picture?
I'm cramping up over here.

345
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:25,454
All right, fine.

346
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,357
Alex! Harper!

347
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:29,958
What are you guys doing here?

348
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,661
I'm in the middle of
getting my company ID.

349
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:37,732
Juliet, I kind of fibbed
about me and Justin.

350
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,466
- You know what? That can wait.
- Why?

351
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,568
Because those vampires are
about to suck your blood.

352
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:42,803
What?!

353
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:46,473
You're right, we can
just talk about it later.

354
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:47,974
Is this true, Cindy?

355
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:50,577
Yeah well, kind of, I mean...

356
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:53,213
It's not so bad.
It's just like a mosquito bite.

357
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:56,082
And then all your blood is gone.

358
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:58,751
Mom, Dad, you said you weren't
gonna do this anymore.

359
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:00,453
Are we gonna have to move again?

360
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:01,788
I know this embarrasses you,

361
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,857
but unfortunately, it's who we are.
We're vampires.

362
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:07,660
We can't all have the incredible
self-control that you have.

363
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:10,363
Wait a minute. So you two were
planning this the whole time?

364
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:11,931
Unbelievable.

365
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:15,768
Well, maybe this goes
without saying, but I quit.

366
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:22,374
I, uh, kinda need the job,
so I'm gonna take my chances.

367
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,042
You know what?

368
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:26,711
I haven't eaten anything in the
six months we've been here.

369
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:29,381
And maybe opening a sandwich
shop four doors down

370
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,650
from another sandwich shop
wasn't such a good idea,

371
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:35,553
so I'm cool with drinking some
blood and movin' to Phoenix.

372
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,555
Mom?

373
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,190
Dad?

374
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:43,061
Harper! Oh, we've come to save you

375
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:45,163
What about me?

376
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,900
You guys. We're here
to save you guys.

377
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:51,502
Max!

378
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:55,807
Did they bite her? Did I miss it?

379
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,608
Who is that boy?

380
00:19:57,642 --> 00:20:00,377
Get him away from us!

381
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:01,979
What's going on?

382
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,581
It's like they're afraid
of Max or something.

383
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:06,616
No, it's not Max, it's his smell.

384
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:07,917
Believe it or not,

385
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,253
this isn't even one
of his worst days.

386
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:14,056
No, it's the pumpkin.
Vampires hate pumpkin.

387
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:17,095
More than garlic. That's why
people originally put...

388
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,565
...pumpkins outside their
house on Halloween,

389
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,166
to keep away the vampires.

390
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,001
Please make it stop!

391
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:27,706
Just get that awful,
awful boy away from us!

392
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:30,342
Not until you...

393
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,812
Not until you apologize for
almost biting my daughter's neck

394
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,749
and turning her into a
vampire for all eternity.

395
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:39,118
All right, all right. We're sorry.

396
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:42,554
What if we smooth it over with
a little bit of ice cream?

397
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:46,625
Really? You were just about to
turn our daughter into a vampire

398
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:49,995
and you think you can just
smooth it over with ice cream?

399
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:51,630
So you don't want the ice cream?

400
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:53,698
- No, we want the ice cream.
- Jerry!

401
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:58,934
Um... and I think we
need more of an apology.

402
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,036
Unlimited toppings?

403
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,739
I accept your apology.
I'll take mine in a cup.

404
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:08,776
Dad, they were just about
to drink our blood.

405
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,712
That's right. This is unacceptable.

406
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:15,582
Harper was gonna be the one to
take care of us in our old age.

407
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:17,450
Yes!

408
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:21,554
Alright. I'll make dinner, too.

409
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:23,889
Who's up for some
really rare steaks?

410
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:30,261
Hey, Pumpkin Boy. Go take a shower.

411
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:33,163
And hurry back if you want a steak.

412
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:35,232
OK, listen guys,
we start out with salad.

413
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:37,867
No butter, no fries,
and water instead of soda.

414
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:40,570
Would somebody bite her?

415
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:49,757
You're totally
checking out my neck.

416
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,694
No, I'm not. I had a big breakfast.

417
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,330
- You are so cute.
- No, you are.

418
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:56,898
Nose kiss!

419
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:02,070
Ugh. We are trying to enjoy

420
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:05,640
about a ton of pumpkin
pie over here, people.

421
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:10,078
You know, we're gonna have
to eat this whole thing,

422
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:12,013
because it's not gonna
fit in the fridge.

423
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,715
Can you hand me that big spoon?

424
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:18,883
Jerry, that's a shovel.

425
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:22,886
I know what it's called.

426
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:30,887
