1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,820
''And that's when the great Chinese
wizard Li first used dragon scales

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,480
to build an impenetrable box
for safeguarding one's wand.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,780
And then in the 12th century,
there were nine native--''

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,720
Time.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,220
You're supposed to keep your oral reports
under 45 minutes.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,800
Otherwise, you start losing people.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,300
Okay, Alex, you're up.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,430
- Alex?
- Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,600
Your report on crystal balls:
history, usage, and manufacturing.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,500
Crystal balls: usage and manufacturing.

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,750
Oh, l did mine on how to use
the really little ones for earrings.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,940
Cute, huh?

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,080
End of report.

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,550
You'll try it again tomorrow.

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,520
- Max, you're up.
- Okay.

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,320
Caldrons:
proper use and maintenance.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,190
How did all these people
get in my room?

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,430
- Oh, Uncle Kelbo.
- Uncle Kelbo.

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,660
Hello, future voters.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Sorry for dropping in unexpectedly.

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,370
Wanted to see my niece and nephews.

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,640
Kelbo, what did l say about poofing in
when you visit?

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,300
Oh, right, right, right.
lt sets off the smoke alarms.

24
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,410
So, what are you guys up to?

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,250
We're doing boring oral reports
without magic.

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,780
You know you're wizards, right?

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,150
Well, lots of times, Dad wants us to study
magic without actually using magic.

28
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,420
Well, that's because he can't do magic.

29
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,420
You know what l say.

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,330
Those who can't take hamburger
and turn it into delicious filet mignon,

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,900
teach.

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,060
Okay, fine.
l didn't become the family wizard.

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,330
But the things l can do
with plain hamburger will blow your mind.

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,570
He puts cheese in the meat.

35
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,410
Hey, l've had many, many, many
of his inside-out cheeseburgers.

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,450
Tell me about it.

37
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,910
So, what are you working on?

38
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,350
Oh, well, l'm doing a report
on the great Chinese wizard Li.

39
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,250
Chinese wizard Li? He's in my fave five.

40
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,590
He'll come here,
he'll teach you all about his life.

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,570
He'll do anything to get away
from his witch of a wife, okay?

42
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,940
By the way,
his wife, she really is a witch.

43
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,770
Li, baby, how's that wife of yours?

44
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,790
Look, l would appreciate it
if l could teach them my way.

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,580
Yeah, you're right.

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,350
- No more distractions.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,080
- Oh, l've got presents.
- Oh, presents.

48
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,530
Justin, l got you some opera gum.

49
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,320
Oh, sweet. What's it do?

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,990
lt's opera gum. Try singing.

51
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,340
- l think l'll save that for the talent show.
- Great.

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,380
Max, for you,
l've got the leprechaun answer blower.

53
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,510
Ask it a question, blow a bubble,
bubble pops, there's your answer.

54
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,550
- Give it a drive.
- Awesome.

55
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,350
Come on, baby. What are the answers
to my social studies test?

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,490
Yes-or-no questions only.
But l love that you think big.

57
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,070
And for my favorite niece who l love.

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,470
l have for you an Emoto-scope.

59
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,300
Okay. Look through it,
you'll see how people are really feeling.

60
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,380
Oh, cool. l've always wanted one.

61
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,840
Wow, either you're really excited
or your underwear is on too tight.

62
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,090
And Max has no idea what's going on.
Big shocker.

63
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,530
Wow, you're mad inside and out.

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,340
Because no one wants to finish
the wizard lesson.

65
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,070
He's right. Who wants to go the zoo?

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,370
- The zoo?
- The zoo?

67
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,070
Let me rephrase that.

68
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,680
Who wants to go to the zoo
as a monkey?

69
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,180
- You're gonna turn into a monkey?
- All of us are gonna be monkeys.

70
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,410
Sorry, Kelbo.
We frown on random uses of magic.

71
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,250
Okay. Let's talk about it.

72
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,990
l--

73
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,620
Great conversation.

74
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,750
Where are they? You know,
the burgers are almost done.

75
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,750
Kelbo does this every time.

76
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,950
Jerry, they're out having fun
with their uncle. lt's a good thing.

77
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,320
Do you really trust him
to watch our children?

78
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,160
No. But l trust our children
to watch him.

79
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,990
- We had so much fun at the zoo.
- Oh, yeah?

80
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,040
l didn't even turn them into monkeys,
just like you asked.

81
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,300
Oh, good.
So then those aren't monkey tails.

82
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,610
Chocolate?

83
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,390
Oh, man, l wanted to find out some stuff
with my leprechaun answer blower.

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,920
Oh, hey, let me ask it a question.

85
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,790
Who is my secret admirer?

86
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,620
l've been getting notes in my locker every
Wednesday for the past three weeks.

87
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,270
Oh, you can't ask it that.
lt only answers yes, no or l don't know.

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,530
ls it Cathy Antinocci?

89
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,780
ls it Corrie Montanio?

90
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,080
There's, like, 300 girls in my class.
This might take a while.

91
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,750
Okay. But just don't suck in,
because the answer juice tastes nasty.

92
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,490
Well, l'm glad you're back in time
to watch the basketball game, honey.

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,960
Dad, l don't wanna watch basketball.

94
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,190
Basketball?

95
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,300
l got tickets tonight for the basketball
game, up in the wizard luxury box.

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,490
You wanna go, Alex?

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,230
- What--? The wizard luxury box?
- Yeah. The wizard luxury box.

98
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,270
You know the scoreboard
over center court?

99
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,430
The wizard luxury box is in that.

100
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,610
That sounds amazing. l have to see it.
Dad, can l go?

101
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,480
Wait. You don't wanna watch
the game with me

102
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,640
but now that Kelbo is gonna take you
to some fantastic wizard box, you wanna?

103
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,720
Well, but l don't think you'll be able to,

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,880
because your mother has a lot of stuff
for you to do around the house.

105
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,890
No, l don't.

106
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,520
Of course, she should go.

107
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,000
Sounds like a great way
to spend some time with your uncle.

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,670
Great. We gotta get going,
because we gotta beat wizard traffic.

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,200
- Oh, wait. Let me get my sweater.
- You're a wizard.

110
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,170
Thanks for reminding me.

111
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,740
Cashemerus-appearus

112
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,350
Soft.

113
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,440
- Hey, that's my sweater.
- Oh, l'm sorry, Mom. Let's talk about it.

114
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,850
Great conversation.

115
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,430
So we're in the scoreboard
and we can see everything and everybody

116
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,000
and they can't see us at all?

117
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,030
Yeah.
That's the beauty of the wizard box.

118
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,430
Except it's got one drawback.

119
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,270
- Time out on the floor,
- Cover your ears.

120
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,240
We're trying to get that removed.

121
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,970
So tell me more about this whole
secret admirer thing with your brother.

122
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,950
- You're the secret admirer.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,610
For the last three weeks,
l've been dropping notes in his locker

124
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,310
saying that he's cute and sweet,
and a bunch of other stuff he's totally not.

125
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,250
- You won't tell Dad, right?
- Of course not.

126
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,590
lt's a classic gag.

127
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,790
l got a finish for you.
Here's what you do.

128
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,730
You get yourself a genie, all right?

129
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,030
Dress your genie up
like his secret admirer.

130
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,160
The minute he spots the genie,
you capture his soul, put it in a lamp.

131
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,770
l love that one.

132
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,030
l wasn't gonna go that far.

133
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,110
Well, you're young.
You got a lot to learn.

134
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,940
- And l bet you could teach me a lot.
- Of course l could.

135
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,380
- Really?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,680
You have so much more fun with magic
than Dad does.

137
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,340
Okay. Here's a good one.
Hold your head like this.

138
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,980
Cranium revolvus

139
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,700
l love that.
l can't wait for our next school assembly.

140
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,490
- And that's the half,
- Cover your ears.

141
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,770
You're the best, Uncle Kelbo.

142
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,100
Hey, what you got there?

143
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,970
l got another note
from my secret admirer.

144
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,310
They're coming every day now.

145
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,210
Wow, that's exciting.
Do you have any idea who it might be?

146
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,220
No. But she's probably pretty cute.

147
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,050
You see, she dots her l's with hearts,
and that always says cute.

148
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,550
And perfume.

149
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,680
Oh, l can't even smell it,
because of my allergies.

150
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,260
Yep, you're someone's dream.

151
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,730
Someone without pets, grass,
or common house dust.

152
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,100
You know, it's too bad
you don't know who she is.

153
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,690
Hey, l got a great plan to figure it out.
l'm gonna--

154
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,570
You don't wanna hear
my stupid plan, do you?

155
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,610
Oh, no, l wanna hear
all about your stupid plan.

156
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,270
Okay.

157
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,870
l'm gonna hide in this trash can
and stake out my locker.

158
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,110
- Brilliant.
- Yep, and Max is gonna help me.

159
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,650
- He's gonna be your lookout?
- No.

160
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,520
He's gonna stop the wrestling team
from shoving Eugene Troobnick

161
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,890
into the trash can
like they do every day at 3.

162
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,550
- l thought Eugene was homeschooled.
- He is. They go home and get him.

163
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,030
Where is she? l don't wanna teach
the magic safety course twice.

164
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,540
We don't wanna hear it once.

165
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,900
Sorry, we're late. But you know
how much l love the Old West.

166
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,250
lt was great. We went on a cattle drive,
and we took turns branding.

167
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,280
Wanna see mine?

168
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,380
Just kidding.

169
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,450
l'm gonna get me a sarsaparilla
and a nice hot bath.

170
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,230
Partner, l'd love me a sarsaparilla.

171
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,350
Whatever that is. l hope it's root beer.

172
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,560
Oh, no, no, no.

173
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,070
No, you were late, young lady,
and we've all been waiting.

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,300
And we're about to start
the magic safety lesson.

175
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,140
Did you guys know most wizard accidents
happen within a mile of the home?

176
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,610
That's because some people
have brothers, and they're not accidents.

177
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,540
Daddy, it's okay that l'm late,

178
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,340
because Uncle Kelbo's been teaching me
magic for the last few days.

179
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,880
ln fact, he and l were talking,

180
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,490
and he said that he could be
my wizard trainer instead of you.

181
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,110
- He did?
- l did?

182
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,820
- You did.
- Hold on.

183
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,460
You--

184
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,030
l did?

185
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,500
- Kelbo, was this your idea?
- No.

186
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,770
Usually, when a guy goes to get a glass
and does a spit take, it says, ''Surprise.''

187
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,640
But at the basketball game,
you said you would teach me.

188
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,410
Yeah, but l was talking more about,
like, pranks and things like that.

189
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh, like, Dad has those birthday candles
that never blow out.

190
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,430
No, more like 50 wizards' heads
spinning completely around their bodies.

191
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,190
Oh, that's way better
than the burning-candles thing.

192
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,130
But you guys
love the candles with the:

193
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,860
And the:

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
And the:

195
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,440
Look, l'm honored that you want me to be
your teacher, but that's your dad's job.

196
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,070
Dad's great with Justin and Max,

197
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,840
but l don't think l'm reaching
my full potential with him.

198
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,780
Well, l don't wanna stand in the way
of your full potential.

199
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,550
Maybe Kelbo should teach you.

200
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,210
Maybe you'll actually show up on time
for his lessons.

201
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,290
l will, Dad,
because you know what l was thinking

202
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,120
is that l learn more by doing
than l do by learning.

203
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,530
Then it's done.

204
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,330
Wait a minute. We get to pick
our wizard teachers? Oh, l pick--

205
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,030
Dad.

206
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,480
Excuse us.
We got a reservation for this garbage can.

207
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,520
Oh, this one's full.

208
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,480
There's a stinkier one upstairs.

209
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,910
See you tomorrow at 3, Eugene.

210
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,160
l don't know
how much longer l can hold out.

211
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,630
l'm the one in the trash can.

212
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,790
My leg was asleep, woke up,
and now it's asleep again.

213
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,300
And l'm claustrophobic.

214
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,940
- Someone's coming. l'll act natural.
- Oh, yeah.

215
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,970
Yep, standing here,
being natural, whistling.

216
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,780
Oh, my gosh.

217
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,380
The lunch lady loves you.

218
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,760
lt makes sense.

219
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,230
My milk's always a little bit colder
than everyone else's.

220
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,860
But what are you gonna do?

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,330
l'm gonna write her a letter
and tell her l'm flattered

222
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,490
and if l was 20 to 30 years older
and out of options,

223
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,230
maybe our love could flourish.

224
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,140
Okay. Let her down easy.
You don't want warm milk.

225
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,340
Hey, thanks for doing that for me, Doris.

226
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,680
Here's the left-handed mashed potato
scooper you wanted.

227
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,480
Thanks. A lot of people think they're
the same as an ice-cream scooper.

228
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,990
Those people would be wrong.

229
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,690
That was totally an ice-cream scooper.

230
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,040
So that's how you disappear and reappear
ten feet away. Pretty fun, huh?

231
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,370
That's about as magical as walking.

232
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,010
See? What did l tell you?
Not as much fun as poofing in.

233
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,240
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Alex.

234
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,750
You missed a good one today.

235
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,540
We disappeared and then reappeared
ten feet away.

236
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,480
- Wasn't it fun, guys?
- Yeah.

237
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,320
A little more exciting
than that ripening-fruit spell you taught us.

238
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,350
Okay. Well, have a good lesson.
The lair is yours, Kelbo.

239
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,190
Please, leave it how you found it.

240
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,260
Come on, guys.

241
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,060
Oh, hey, Max.
Does anybody want some salted nuts?

242
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,800
Sure, Dad.

243
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,670
Snakes of all different colors.
lt was--

244
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,420
- So, what's our lesson gonna be?
- Oh, l thought we'd take a nap first.

245
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,220
Well, l'll tell you what it's not gonna be,
and that's fruit ripening.

246
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,990
Because it's easy.

247
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,750
All you do is you buy the fruit,
you go into the future,

248
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,300
fruit's ripe, you eat it.

249
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,160
You're gonna teach me about time travel?
l've always wanted to learn that.

250
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh, look, the wizard mail's here.

251
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,230
Uncle Kelbo,
can we please focus on the lesson?

252
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,900
Look, we'll read it.

253
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,110
We'll go back in time to before we read it,
and it will be like we haven't even read it.

254
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,580
A sea chimp sample? We used to get
these all the time when we were little.

255
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
They're just pets you put in water

256
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,020
and you don't have to feed
or play with them.

257
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,650
They're great. They die before your mom
makes you throw out the smelly water.

258
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,950
Open them up. Come on.

259
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,890
l don't know.
These aren't regular sea chimps.

260
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,090
They came in the wizard mail and Dad
doesn't like us to open the wizard mail.

261
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,600
Some of the stuff
can be dangerous.

262
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay, l understand.
But your dad's not your teacher, l am.

263
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,700
And whatever goes wrong,
we can fix with magic.

264
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,900
All right.

265
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,210
But don't you need water
for sea chimps?

266
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,840
Apparently, not.

267
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,380
What--?

268
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,580
That's not gonna work.
Fix it with magic.

269
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,710
Okay, okay, okay. All right. l got it.

270
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,630
Okay. That's what l use in the shower
at cheap motels.

271
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,500
- Sorry.
- Well, use another one.

272
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,330
l can't. l'm panicking.

273
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,870
Guess who l am.

274
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,170
l'm the lunch lady.
l'm in love with Justin.

275
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,940
Give me a kiss, doll face.

276
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,290
Hey, why is Coach Gunderson here?

277
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,390
And why does he look so mad?

278
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,450
Which one of you is Justin Russo?

279
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,900
l think it's you.

280
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,170
You don't shower after gym
because you don't sweat.

281
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,570
Because you walk the mile.

282
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,870
Hey, coach.

283
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:46,470
What are you doing writing love letters
to my girlfriend, the lunch lady?

284
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,320
She was putting letters in my locker
and l was just trying to let her down gently.

285
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,390
Excuse me. What's going on here?

286
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,930
Your son is trying to tell me
that he's getting love letters

287
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,430
from my girlfriend, the lunch lady.

288
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,960
The lunch lady?
May l see one of these notes?

289
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,370
l have one.

290
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,130
''l love your lightsaber nightlight.''

291
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,540
How would the lunch lady know
you have a lightsaber nightlight?

292
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,480
Alex.

293
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,610
Alex is my 1 4-year-old daughter
and she kind of torments him.

294
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,430
Well, really all of us.

295
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,620
l get it.

296
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,130
You still sleep with a nightlight?

297
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,260
Good.

298
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,460
The dark can be very, very scary.

299
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,800
Keep walking the mile.

300
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,900
And sorry l barked at you.
Lunch lady says l get pretty jealous.

301
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,740
Dad.

302
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,180
- Honey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,790
l don't know what happened.

304
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,920
l know.
There's water coming out of the lair.

305
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,930
Oh, who's in the lair?

306
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,220
Alex and Kelbo.
They're doing their lesson in there.

307
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,960
Somebody's gotta get into the lair.

308
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,370
We don't know how much water.
lf we open it, it could flood the restaurant.

309
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,800
l know. Hey, you remember the spell
from today, transporting ten feet?

310
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,200
- Come on.
- l'm on it.

311
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,940
Whoa, wait, wait.
l'll be right back.

312
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,050
Okay, okay, l'm ready.
Better safe than sorry.

313
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,350
Justin, get me in there.

314
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,650
Threemetrus-movetrus

315
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,790
Hey, why can l breathe underwater?

316
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,920
lt's due to the fact
that we're sea chimps.

317
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,500
Oh, right. Do something.

318
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,990
Relax. l've been in way worse situations
than this.

319
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,230
lmagine the exact same thing,
except hot lava.

320
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,160
Why were you in hot lava?

321
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,100
Suffice it to say,
l don't know how to make hot coffee.

322
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,010
You opened
the magic sea chimp packet, didn't you?

323
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,510
A little.

324
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,150
l know a spell that will fix this.
Alex, repeat after me.

325
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,150
- l'm a big knucklehead.
- l'm a big knucklehead.

326
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,880
Wait a second, that's not a spell.

327
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,930
No, l know.
l just wanted to hear you admit it.

328
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,460
Hey, if anyone here's a big knucklehead,
it's this sea chimp.

329
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,140
Gee, who knows a spell
that will get us out of this mess?

330
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,260
Anyone? Anyone?

331
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,670
Oh, wait. l do.

332
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,500
All right. Alex, say this:

333
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,240
Dehydratus-lougaines, apus-escapus

334
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,080
Dehydratus-lougaines, apus-escapus

335
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,250
l just don't get it.

336
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,760
Kelbo said that he could fix it,
but he couldn't and Dad could.

337
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,420
But Dad's not even a wizard anymore.

338
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,030
Well, your dad was always
a much better wizard than l was.

339
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,220
That can't be true. Only one wizard
in each family can keep their powers.

340
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,700
lf Dad was the better wizard,
he'd keep his powers.

341
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,630
- You never told them, huh?
- Told us what?

342
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,430
Honey, l think they're old enough.

343
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,340
We're all getting go-carts?

344
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,770
No.

345
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,490
When Kelbo and your father competed
to see who'd keep their wizard powers,

346
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,620
it was your dad who won the contest.

347
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,690
What?

348
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,990
But wizards can't marry non-wizards,
so your dad gave Kelbo his powers

349
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,400
so that he could marry me.

350
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,700
l think that's the sweetest thing
l've ever heard in my life.

351
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,970
Give your powers up for a girl?

352
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,080
- Yeah, right.
- What?

353
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,610
l can't be--

354
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,890
You guys,
if Dad hadn't given up his powers,

355
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,320
none of us would be here.

356
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,950
Yeah, l made the right decision then,
and l stand by it.

357
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,060
And l should've stood by you, Dad.
Will you still be my wizard teacher?

358
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,650
Please, l beg of you, okay?
Take her on.

359
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,200
You know me. l can't handle it.

360
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,130
l get distracted, and then l get careless,
and then--

361
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,430
This towel is so soft.

362
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,070
Oh, and distracted.
You know, l get distracted.

363
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,480
We get it.
Honey, honey, l'll be your teacher.

364
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,010
But you're still my fun Uncle Kelbo.

365
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,610
l mean, who else gets to say that they
were a sea chimp even for a little while?

366
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,020
Actually, everyone l know.

367
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,820
l've made them all open up
that same packet

368
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,620
because l just love the pretty colors
on the outside.

369
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,660
- The basketball game is on.
- Oh, can l watch it with you?

370
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,870
Yes. l'd love that, honey.

371
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,530
Wait, wait, wait. l've got an idea.
We can all watch it.

372
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,010
Yeah! Yeah!

373
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,510
Hey, guys, wanna see something cool?

374
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,140
- Hold your heads like this.
- Oh, what are you talking about?

375
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,980
Cranium revolvus

376
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,490
Oh, this is bunk.

377
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,830
- Okay. You remember what to say, right?
- Yeah.

378
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,870
Excuse me. l was just checking to see
if your refrigerator's running.

379
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,410
As a matter of fact,
my refrigerator is broken.

380
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,840
lt's not running.
What do l do if it's not running?

381
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,380
She's onto us. Run.
