1
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,782
Now, this is why it's great
we own a sandwich shop.

2
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:20,785
Everybody in the school caf
always bows down to this bad boy.

3
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,108
Are those mashed potatoes
on a sandwich?

4
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:26,627
On a bed of chicken strips
with a peanut-butter blanket.

5
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:31,112
- What'd you make?
- A sandwich, not a Dumpster.

6
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:32,923
Tuna fish on wheat.

7
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:37,080
Tuna fish on wheat?
That's gonna be our sandwich.

8
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,849
Do you know what our song is?

9
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:45,417
- Hey, there's my girlfriend.
- That sounds like a cute song.

10
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,536
Justin?

11
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,461
That's a nice-looking sandwich.
What do you call it?

12
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,263
- To the Max.
- Okay. I'll take one of those.

13
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:55,819
- Well...
- Sell it, dummy.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,267
You can make another one.

15
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,747
That'll be $80.

16
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:05,799
- What?
- Okay, for senior citizens, $4.

17
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:11,602
Oh, I love your family's shop.

18
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:13,960
Have you ever thought of maybe
blacking out the windows

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,247
and painting the walls,
I don't know, black?

20
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:22,216
Yeah, I think you're gonna be easy
to shop for.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,978
He's hanging out with that goth girl,
Morticia.

22
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:30,306
It's Miranda.
Look, Harper, as your best friend,

23
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:33,868
I'm gonna give it to you straight.
I think he really likes this girl.

24
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,749
Fine, but it's so totally obvious
that he's dating her

25
00:01:36,876 --> 00:01:39,268
because she looks like me.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,195
Yeah, you both have faces.

27
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:48,688
Max, you're gonna be late for school.
Come on, get out of here.

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,530
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

29
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:54,045
Hey, excuse me.
Your son made me this sandwich.

30
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,928
Oh, I'm sorry. Look, he's only 12.

31
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:59,052
No, no, no. It's terrific.

32
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:03,225
I'm Jeff Malone, concessions manager
and backup announcer for Shea Stadium.

33
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:06,147
We're considering local delis to provide
the official sandwich

34
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,187
of the New York Mets,
Mets, Mets, Mets.

35
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:14,592
I think you should submit this sandwich
for consideration.

36
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,517
Theresa, honey.
This guy is from the New York Mets,

37
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:20,364
and he wants to consider us
for their official sandwich.

38
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:21,956
Which sandwich?

39
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,650
The one your son made. To the Max.

40
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,842
- That's not really...
- A bad idea.

41
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:29,011
That's not a bad idea at all.

42
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:32,096
To the Max
is one of our most popular creations.

43
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,177
- Just get Max to make one for us later.
- Okay.

44
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:40,258
Great. My sandwich associates from
the New York Mets, Mets, Mets, Mets,

45
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:42,665
and I will be by on Saturday
for judging.

46
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,343
Great. Let's go Mets, Mets, Mets.

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,959
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,440
Unbelievable.

49
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,209
I know. Your parents are so cool.

50
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:00,671
Come on, buddy,
just picture the sandwich in your mind.

51
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,871
Yeah, Maxy.
I've seen you make it before.

52
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,276
What do you start off with?

53
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:07,125
Yeah, I don't know.
I just throw stuff together.

54
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,125
Okay, let me think.

55
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,730
I started with liquorice.

56
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,809
Liquorice on a sandwich?

57
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:17,134
No, I ate some liquorice,
and then I started my sandwich.

58
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:20,893
- It had ham.
- Okay.

59
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,333
It had bologna, yogurt.

60
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,819
- Yogurt?
- Yogurt?

61
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:26,586
On a sandwich? That's disgusting.

62
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,860
That's the point.

63
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,110
I just can't remember.

64
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:34,671
What are we gonna do, Jerry?
The New York Mets, Mets, Mets

65
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:36,915
want the sandwich that Max made.

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,480
Well, maybe we can throw a bunch
of stuff together like he does,

67
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:44,487
Max can taste it, tell us what's missing,
until we find the right combination.

68
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:48,083
- What do you say, Max?
- Okay. Whatever it takes to help Dad.

69
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:52,170
That's the spirit, son.
Let's go. Come on, grab a bun.

70
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,502
- Weren't you scared?
- A little.

71
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:02,781
Rook to queen bishop 4 is always a risk,
but that's just how I roll.

72
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,101
- Is your hand sweaty too?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:07,952
I have enormous glands.

74
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,068
I don't mind.

75
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:15,517
I don't get it. Justin's so full of life
and she's so full of Halloween.

76
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:20,524
I don't know, Harper, maybe
on Halloween, she'll dress up as you.

77
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,692
She could never pull this off.

78
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:25,611
I make a lot of my own clothes.

79
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,046
Oh, which reminds me,
I need some more egg cartons.

80
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:32,535
Is your hand still sweaty?

81
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:35,586
Yeah. But I like it.

82
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,468
So I'll see you tomorrow?

83
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,344
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:44,988
Tomorrow.

85
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:51,833
What...?

86
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:53,994
Shaking hands?

87
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:55,766
Were you saying goodbye
or closing a deal?

88
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:58,161
Why didn't you kiss her?

89
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,521
It's none of your business.

90
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:03,013
Look, Justin, you know a lot of stuff
about stuff people really don't care about,

91
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:05,209
which is great,
but I know about relationships.

92
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,774
I know how girls think.

93
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:10,818
So do I. They're right-brain dominant and
they have a slightly larger hypothalamus.

94
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:14,225
There you go again,
knowing stuff people don't care about.

95
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,784
Okay, okay. I'm saying
that I'd be open to suggestions.

96
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:19,952
Good, because Miranda
really wants you to kiss her.

97
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:22,513
I can tell because she brightens
from tragic to just gloomy

98
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,199
when she's around you.

99
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:26,995
- So?
- So if you don't do it soon,

100
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,918
she's gonna think
you're really not into her.

101
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:31,438
Then someone's gonna have to play
chess by themselves.

102
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,448
I already do that.

103
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:36,452
You ever think of this,
Miss Smarty-Pants?

104
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:37,975
Maybe I don't wanna kiss her.

105
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,776
Okay, I'll be spreading
that rumour around.

106
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,382
Look.

107
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:49,581
Okay, I know this is gonna be hard
to believe,

108
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,707
but I've never kissed a girl.

109
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:56,756
I find it hard to believe that you think
that I find that hard to believe.

110
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:58,793
Hey, I'm on it.

111
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,439
I thought if I picked a girl that I didn't like,
that it'd be less scary.

112
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:04,602
That's why I picked Miranda.

113
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:07,802
Now guess what?
I like her and I'm scared again.

114
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,047
All right, this is what we're gonna do.
First of all, take out $5.

115
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:13,892
- Why?
- I need $5. Second,

116
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,052
tomorrow, when you walk her to school,
take her by that scary, abandoned house.

117
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,783
Right, because she'll think I'm brave.

118
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:22,784
No, you'll get scared
and she'll comfort you.

119
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:26,870
- That's when you plant one on her.
- Okay, that's a great idea.

120
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:28,712
Thanks.
Do you have five ones for this 5?

121
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:33,067
Great, because my 5 was lonely.

122
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,887
Does anybody see anything?

123
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:46,852
Yeah, that little squiggly thing
in the back of your throat.

124
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:51,896
We are looking for someone
at Shea Stadium making our sandwich,

125
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,939
so we can see what's in our sandwich.

126
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:55,497
Now, concentrate.

127
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:58,904
If I go back in time
and look into a crystal ball,

128
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,140
will I see me looking
into this crystal ball?

129
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,391
Okay, that is not concentrating.

130
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:07,716
Now...

131
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,083
Now that was cool.

132
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:13,884
It's irreplaceable.

133
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:16,920
L... What am I gonna do?

134
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:18,722
I know.

135
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:23,004
Okay. Here, Justin, here.

136
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,014
Do this spell on the crystal ball.

137
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,857
When I had my powers,
it was a lifesaver.

138
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,055
Say, "Mcreary-timereary."

139
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:32,176
- Why?
- Just say it.

140
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,458
Oh, and do this:

141
00:08:38,512 --> 00:08:41,314
<i>Mcreary-timereary</i>

142
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:46,319
Did we just go back in time?
I have got to learn that.

143
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:47,876
<i>- Mcreary-time...
- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

144
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:50,315
That spell is just for emergencies.

145
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,325
It rewinds time for a few seconds

146
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,762
to give wizards a chance to correct
a dire mistake.

147
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,002
No questions.

148
00:08:57,133 --> 00:09:00,209
- You mean like a do-over spell?
- Yes.

149
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:03,333
But it's too dangerous.
Don't even think about it, all right?

150
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,613
It bends time and space,
and you're not ready for it.

151
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:06,973
No more questions.

152
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,063
Do people remember
there's been a do-over spell?

153
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:10,861
Only people in the magical world.

154
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,904
Regular people have déjà vu.
Stop asking questions.

155
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,950
So that's where déjà vu comes from.

156
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:19,673
- I said, no more questions.
- It wasn't a question.

157
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,997
Hey, I have one. What's déjà vu?

158
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:25,322
Well, it's when you feel
like something's happened before.

159
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:28,600
For example, Dad, do you have $5?

160
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,689
- Why?
- Because I need $5.

161
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,123
Déjà vu, huh, Justin?

162
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,533
So how did the big first-kiss go?

163
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,860
It didn't happen.

164
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,422
Why not?

165
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:47,628
Because when I went to pick her up,
she didn't wanna go to a scary house.

166
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,784
She wanted to go
through some dark alley instead.

167
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:52,191
But a dark alley's even better
than a scary house.

168
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:55,796
But you said scary house.
I was totally focused on the scary house.

169
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,481
The point is she wanted you to kiss her.

170
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:00,641
Why didn't you take my advice?
Lots of people do.

171
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:03,441
I'm the one that told Vice Principal
Clements to fix his dead tooth.

172
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:05,647
Now he's getting married.

173
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,447
- Okay, I panicked.
- Panicked?

174
00:10:08,935 --> 00:10:10,655
Well, now you gotta kiss her quick,
or else

175
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:13,049
all she'll think you guys will ever be
is just friends.

176
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,650
That's never gonna happen.
She's into me and I'm into her.

177
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,664
That could change in a hurry.
Plenty of other guys think she's pretty.

178
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:21,097
No way. Everyone around here knows
we're kind of going out.

179
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:23,062
- You know, people respect that.
- Oh, really?

180
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,184
- Well, let's see about that. Hey, Matt?
- Hey.

181
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:27,466
Miranda's pretty cute, right?

182
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:30,511
Yeah. You know, I got a note from her
in seventh grade, said she liked me.

183
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,315
Bet you she still does too want me.

184
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,802
That's too bad.
I hear she's going out with Justin.

185
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,045
- Who's Justin?
- I'm Justin.

186
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,239
So?

187
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,480
Okay. Thanks, Matt.

188
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:43,251
No, thank you for the heads up
on Miranda.

189
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:46,050
Yo, Miranda, wait up there a sec.

190
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:48,692
What did you just do?

191
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,055
I just proved that not only do I know girls,
but I also know guys.

192
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:54,575
No, you got Matt to ask out my girlfriend.

193
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,585
Wait, I can fix this.

194
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:01,705
Here's a cute girl. Kiss her.

195
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,468
This is my Spanish teacher.

196
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:14,922
I think I just told her
my name is Library.

197
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,604
Well, Mr. Library, you should check out
a book on kissing.

198
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,529
Thanks a lot.

199
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,986
Look, Justin, I'm really sorry,
but you have to admit,

200
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,944
Miss Gonzalez is
a young-looking teacher.

201
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,465
I don't care about Mrs. Gonzalez.

202
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:38,632
I care about how
my girlfriend's going to the movies

203
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:40,874
with a guy that my sister set her up with.

204
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:44,473
Will you relax? Lt'll all work out
because I know relationships.

205
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,073
You keep saying you know things
and you don't.

206
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:51,126
Hey, I was right about Miranda wanting
to kiss you,

207
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,448
and I was right about Matt thinking
she was pretty.

208
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:56,727
Okay, fine, you were right.
Feel better? Because I don't.

209
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:59,579
Look, Justin, the only thing
getting in the way here is you.

210
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,334
You know what, I know.

211
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:03,102
I've had a ton of chances
to kiss Miranda.

212
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,103
I'm just mad at you
because I'm mad at me.

213
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,707
You are? Yeah, you are.

214
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:08,900
And if Miranda's ready to kiss me,
you know what?

215
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,422
I should be ready to kiss her.
And it's not too late.

216
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:15,072
- Yeah, it's not too late.
- And this time, I'm gonna be ready.

217
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:24,560
What are you doing?

218
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:26,726
Starting my training montage.

219
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:41,447
It's close but this one
has too much teriyaki.

220
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:43,687
Honey, we didn't put any teriyaki on it.

221
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:46,891
Then it needs teriyaki.

222
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:50,695
This one has too much cheese,
this one needs barbecue sauce,

223
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:54,458
and this one tastes like armpit.
How do you even know that?

224
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,311
Wrestling.

225
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:01,110
Honey, calm down.
Max is doing the best he can.

226
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:04,155
Right, I know. Okay.

227
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:08,075
Buddy, I know you're trying
as hard as you can.

228
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:11,679
It's just, if we can become the official
sandwich of the New York Mets,

229
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,449
our life will be gravy.

230
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,484
That's what's missing, gravy.

231
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,406
Gravy? Then what are we doing
standing around talking about it?

232
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:23,137
Oh, come on, gravy. Come on, gravy.

233
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:25,335
Come on.

234
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:29,538
- That's it. To the Max.
- Yeah.

235
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,508
To the Max.

236
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:35,627
Tastes even better the second time.

237
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:41,752
So heard you're going out
with a guy named Justin.

238
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,440
- Right, Justin?
- I thought we were, but I don't know.

239
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:47,488
That's cool. Yeah, totally.

240
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:51,047
Do you play video games at all?
You know, with a v...?

241
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:53,731
- Do you know who makes video games?
- No.

242
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:56,168
Corporate America.
I hate corporate America.

243
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:58,975
I'm starting a school club about it.
We're looking for sponsors.

244
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:03,985
Hey, guys. Matt.

245
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:06,027
Hey, Matt, why don't you go
get us some popcorn?

246
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,621
Yeah, I'll buy. Here.

247
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:11,509
Twenty bucks? Thanks, dude.

248
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:16,238
I can go play some
"Nitro Burning Funny Cars." Oh, yeah.

249
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:21,726
Why are you here with him?
We're kind of going out.

250
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:25,971
I know we hold hands and stuff,
but you act like we're just friends.

251
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:29,050
- She was right.
- Who was right?

252
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,899
Me. I was so right.

253
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,377
I told him if he didn't kiss you soon,
you were gonna think

254
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:37,578
that he wasn't all that into you.
And that's what you were thinking, right?

255
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,581
Alex, what are you doing here?

256
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:44,069
Look, I felt bad, so I came down here
to make sure that you kiss her.

257
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,793
- You were gonna kiss me?
- Well, it's not a surprise now, is it?

258
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:51,197
Sorry. I'll be back here if you need me.

259
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:54,283
All right, just for that,
I'm leaving my cell phone on.

260
00:15:56,367 --> 00:16:00,843
Oh, look at those lovebirds.
It's so great when things work out.

261
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:03,045
Harper. What are you doing here?

262
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:06,536
I'm not Harper. I'm just a theatre seat,

263
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,811
keeping an eye on my boyfriend.

264
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,378
You made an outfit
to match the theatre seats?

265
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:14,057
Don't be freaked out
if you can't see me.

266
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,827
It's time to go to work.

267
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:29,478
You were gonna kiss me?

268
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,882
Well, only if you wanted to kiss me.
Do you?

269
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:33,721
Or is me asking
totally ruining the moment?

270
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,650
Nope.

271
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,262
- I'll go left, you go right.
- Then we'll both be going the same way.

272
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:49,026
Oh, yeah. Let's both go left.

273
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,351
Justin, I'm a little nervous.

274
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,113
This is our first kiss.

275
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:58,991
Don't worry, I'll guide you through it.

276
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:07,522
Miranda, I'm so sorry.

277
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:08,684
I'll get some napkins.

278
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,762
Where are you going?
Why didn't you kiss her yet?

279
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:13,328
I spilled soda all over her.
She's never gonna kiss me now.

280
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:16,376
- Wait, do it over.
- What do you mean?

281
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:18,934
The spell that Dad used
on the crystal ball.

282
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:22,255
No way. Dad said
that's for emergency use only.

283
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:28,469
Because you don't know
I'm your girlfriend,

284
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:31,188
doesn't mean you can sneak around
behind my back.

285
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,070
How does that do-over spell
sound now?

286
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,443
- Like it should have already happened.
- Now we're talking.

287
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:41,318
<i>Mcreary-timereary</i>

288
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,810
Justin, I'm a little nervous.

289
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,765
This is our first kiss.

290
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,164
I know.

291
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,853
I mean, let me move this.

292
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:07,312
This is gonna be a long night.

293
00:18:07,676 --> 00:18:09,430
<i>Mcreary-timereary</i>

294
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:11,999
And that's why it's called:

295
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:13,475
- To the Max.
- Right?

296
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:16,685
- Nothing like it in the city.
- Kind of a buffet on a bun.

297
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:17,956
What did I tell you?

298
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:23,213
Is this the sandwich
for the New York Mets, Mets, Mets, Mets

299
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,768
or what?

300
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:27,653
You're right. This is delicious.

301
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,379
Congratulations, Mr. And Mrs. Russo,

302
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:36,217
To the Max is now the official sandwich
of the New York...

303
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:39,110
And that's why it's called:

304
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,905
- To the Max.
- Right?

305
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:43,106
Dad, what just happened?

306
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:44,306
I don't know.

307
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:47,314
Good, but kind of familiar.

308
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:50,800
You're right. It's tasty, but familiar.

309
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:54,717
Familiar? It's a sandwich with popcorn.

310
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:59,173
And that's why it's called:

311
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:01,811
- To the Max.
- Right?

312
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:04,335
- Nothing really new here.
- You're right.

313
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,860
A better name would be Déjà Vu,

314
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:10,065
because somehow I feel like
I've tasted this before.

315
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:12,257
It's the do-over spell.

316
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:15,145
- I swear I'm not doing it.
- I know.

317
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:18,187
But I'm pretty sure I know who is.

00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,118

320
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:49,902
Gross.

321
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:53,194
Justin, that's 17 do-overs already.
What's wrong?

322
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:55,673
I'm nervous. I'll get it this time.

323
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,791
<i>Okay, fine. Mcreary-time...</i>

324
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,312
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

325
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,237
So how's the sandwich-tasting go?

326
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:05,884
I don't know, it's still going on,
and on and on.

327
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,047
Dad, what are you doing here?

328
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,610
No, the question is,
what is Alex doing the do-over spell for?

329
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:13,888
I specifically told you never to use it.

330
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:16,980
Actually, it's my fault, Dad.
I'm here with Miranda and I'm...

331
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:19,903
He's trying to have his first kiss
and he just can't get it right.

332
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:23,147
First kiss?
I thought that happened years ago.

333
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,431
- I'll just take Miranda home.
- Wait, Justin.

334
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:30,867
- How many times did you use the spell?
- I don't know. Seventeen?

335
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,315
Well, I guess if you break a rule 17 times,
an 18th doesn't make a difference.

336
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:42,159
Justin, you think you can get it right
if we do it over one more time?

337
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:44,131
- Yeah.
- Okay.

338
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:46,769
- Alex, do your magic.
- Thanks, Dad.

339
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,649
<i>Mcreary-timereary</i>

340
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:56,221
So I guess we're not the official sandwich
of the New York Mets, huh?

341
00:20:56,346 --> 00:21:00,708
The last thing they said was,
after one bite, they were tired of eating it.

342
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:02,346
Isn't that weird?

343
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,107
Yeah, weird.

344
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,751
Justin got his first kiss.
Don't make a big deal.

345
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,115
Your first kiss?

346
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,807
Oh, my baby, you're growing up.

347
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:18,480
Come here, come here.
Let me give you your second one.

348
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,012
Mom.

349
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:23,806
Hey, how about you, Alex?
What was your first kiss like?

350
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:26,814
Oh, you know, like everyone else's.

351
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,022
You already had your first kiss
and I missed it?

352
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:32,064
Oh, tell me, tell me everything.

353
00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:34,305
No, not everything. She's my little girl.

354
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:37,345
What's his name? I'll make him cry.

355
00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:38,793
Jerry.

356
00:21:38,914 --> 00:21:41,112
Tell us about it, honey.

357
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,635
It was at this place with this guy.

358
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:49,242
And it was very romantic.
Over Christmas vacation.

359
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,929
We went to see Grandma and Grandpa
over Christmas.

360
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,008
Hold on, she's lying.

361
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,648
You haven't kissed anyone.
I totally have this over you.

362
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,097
- No, you don't.
- You're right.

363
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,020
So when I go to school and tell everyone
you haven't kissed anyone,

364
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:04,457
no one will care.

365
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,464
Yeah.

366
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,228
Hey, Justin.

367
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:22,917
Now you've got nothing over me.
