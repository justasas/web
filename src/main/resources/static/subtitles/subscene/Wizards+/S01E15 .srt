1
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:16,376
Dude, close your mouth.

2
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:17,813
Your tongue is gonna dry out.

3
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:24,734
You're right.

4
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,696
Listen, man.
Why don't you just ask her out?

5
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:30,143
Kari Langsdorf?

6
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:33,658
I can't ask out Kari Langsdorf.
She's got no idea who I am.

7
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:36,176
She's never even talked to me.
I'm totally invisible to her.

8
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:40,228
- Sorry, man. I didn't see you there.
- Why would you?

9
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,586
Totally invisible to everybody.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,301
Hey, Kari, you wanna check out
a movie this weekend?

11
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:46,586
Do you play baseball?

12
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:49,063
No, but I'm quarterback
of the football team,

13
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:52,071
president of student council
and I'm a swimsuit model.

14
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,832
I only date baseball players.

15
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:01,991
Oh, sorry.

16
00:01:02,117 --> 00:01:03,870
Didn't see you there.

17
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,270
- So, Justin, do you play baseball?
- Yes.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,676
- You gonna try out for the team this year?
- I might.

19
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:13,116
You think you got a shot?

20
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:15,112
Absolutely not.

21
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:14,457
Hey, Alex, can I get a turkey sandwich?

22
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:17,864
I'm off the clock.
You know where everything is.

23
00:02:18,428 --> 00:02:20,784
Well, if you're off the clock,
then what are we doing here?

24
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,347
I've got a jean jacket at home
that's not going to sequin itself.

25
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,821
Relax, Harper, we're just waiting
for my dad to come back

26
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:29,592
with the team he's coaching
so we can see the cute guys.

27
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:33,788
All right, guys.
Root beer floats are on the house.

28
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:37,390
Hey, Justin tried out for the first time,
and even made the team.

29
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:38,711
Who knew?

30
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:42,148
Well, I know how much you love baseball,
so I figured I'd give it a shot.

31
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,712
Awesome. Then it's settled.

32
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm the Aztecs' number one fan.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,111
Let the trash talking begin.

34
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,159
Dad, he's doing it again.

35
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:52,716
Maxy, we really appreciate
the enthusiasm,

36
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:55,404
but let's not revisit
what happened on the soccer field.

37
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:56,793
What soccer field?

38
00:02:57,284 --> 00:02:59,753
The one the park police
said you can't go to anymore.

39
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:03,079
Excuse me for cheering for my brother.
Is that a crime?

40
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:06,201
According to the park police, yes.

41
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:09,638
The kid in the diaper started it.

42
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,325
Hey, Alex,
do you have an extra-long spoon?

43
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,602
Sure. Okay.

44
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,410
Here you go, Riley.

45
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:26,854
Thanks.

46
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,774
What was that?
I thought you were off the clock.

47
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:34,375
I'm always on the clock for Riley.
Isn't he so cute?

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,895
You mean Justin.

49
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,170
No, Riley.

50
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,456
Justin's cute.

51
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,422
I can't believe Justin's on Riley's team.

52
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:48,735
Finally, after years of Justin
being a bore,

53
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:51,016
I can use him
for my own personal gain.

54
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,822
- How are you going to do that?
- I have no idea.

55
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,421
But it's a nice feeling,

56
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:58,342
the kind that makes you stop
and give thanks you have a brother.

57
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,188
Here he comes. How do I look?

58
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,108
- Fine.
- Just fine?

59
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,109
Fine isn't good enough.

60
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:06,308
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

61
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,828
Hey.

62
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:10,514
Hey, Justin.
Congrats on making the team Riley's on.

63
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,671
Baseball, right?

64
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:15,552
Yep, I made the team, all right.

65
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,713
You don't sound all right.
What's the matter?

66
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:21,309
I've done a bad, bad thing, Alex.

67
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:22,514
What?

68
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:29,396
I charmed the baseball
so Dad would think I was good.

69
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:31,036
I didn't know you were into baseball.

70
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:33,154
I'm not. I'm into Kari Langsdorf.

71
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:36,641
Okay, so, what's the bad,
bad thing you did?

72
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:39,803
I cheated.
I used magic to make the baseball team.

73
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,679
If Dad knew, he would flip out.

74
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,280
Yeah, but the important thing is,

75
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:48,528
is now you're on the baseball team
with Riley.

76
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,680
What?

77
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,567
Well, Riley's the catcher,
so he can teach you some stuff.

78
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:58,369
But until then, you should probably
use magic to stay on the team.

79
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:00,690
Alex, I'm not like you.
I don't break the rules.

80
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,091
I'm ridden with guilt.
It's eating up my insides.

81
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:06,812
Pretty soon, I'll be just a shell.

82
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:10,487
You'll get over it.
And, Justin, magic is your talent.

83
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:13,339
I mean, do they make a tall
basketball player play on his knees?

84
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,529
No.

85
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,697
Do they make a fast swimmer
only do the dog paddle?

86
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:18,136
No.

87
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:20,458
Then why should a wizard
not use magic?

88
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:22,973
Hey.

89
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,824
Congratulations on making the team.
I'm Kari.

90
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:28,659
Hi, Kari. I'm Just... Just...

91
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:32,063
- I'm Just...
- Just so happy to meet you.

92
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,463
Yes, he is. And his name is Justin.

93
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,625
Well, it's nice to meet you, Justin.

94
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:38,502
I love going to the baseball games,

95
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,429
so I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot
of each other at the baseball games,

96
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:44,350
because you play
in the baseball games.

97
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,065
I love baseball.

98
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,709
She can see me.

99
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:55,032
She can totally see me.
I'm not invisible anymore.

100
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,835
No way.
You know the invisibility spell?

101
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:58,750
I'll trade you for the popularity spell.

102
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:00,756
You know what?
I am totally gonna use magic.

103
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,313
Thanks, Alex.

104
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,796
You always know
the right wrong thing to do.

105
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,677
Now go sit by Riley
and tell him how cool I am.

106
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:21,519
Here we go. Come on now.

107
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,010
Ball four. Take your base.

108
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,449
Time, ump.

109
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,209
Time.

110
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,566
Yeah, Justin!

111
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,288
He and I are gonna be going out soon.

112
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:41,414
Nice job today. Nice job.

113
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:44,895
All right, Justin.
Let's see if you can finish this thing.

114
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:51,290
Justin looks great in his uniform.

115
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,338
He slept in it last night.

116
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:56,410
I find that totally attractive.

117
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:07,306
Alex, here comes Riley.
Do you wanna talk to him alone?

118
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,702
- That would be nice.
- Got it.

119
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:12,900
If you need me, I'll be over here.
Hi, Justin.

120
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:15,145
Hey, Riley. Cute uniform.

121
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,940
Thanks. It was my idea
to go with the sleeveless jerseys.

122
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:22,070
- I'm gonna be your good luck charm.
- What?

123
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,626
Whenever I'm here, you'll win.

124
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:28,186
If this guy strikes out and we win,
I'll believe you.

125
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:30,710
You'll see.

126
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:37,234
- Good eye, baby. Good eye.
- Get the strikes.

127
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:40,989
Get this guy out and we win.
If you don't, we lose.

128
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,235
No pressure.

129
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:47,681
Come on, Justin. Good luck, Justin.

130
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:50,477
Throw a knuckleball.

131
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:54,795
Come on, Justin.

132
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:57,036
Mow this guy down. He ain't no hitter.

133
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,243
He couldn't hit it
if you threw a basketball.

134
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:02,406
Hey, kid, do you mind? That's my son.

135
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,959
Oh, I'm sorry. For you.

136
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:15,965
Lead-off hitter. Lead-off hitter.

137
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:19,007
- That's all right.
- All right, baby.

138
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,530
Strike one.

139
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:26,093
That's my brother. I'm his brother.

140
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:29,656
Together, we'll send you losers home.

141
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,255
Nice work, son. Bring in the heat.

142
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,774
Strike two.

143
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:41,539
Amazing, huh?

144
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:46,543
You feel that heat, losers?

145
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:53,419
Strike three. You're out.

146
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,510
- Game over.
- Nice.

147
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:09,915
Way to go, loser.

148
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:11,755
You should change
your first name to Lou

149
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:13,357
and your last name to Sir.

150
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:16,118
Get it? "Loser."

151
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,511
Oh, boy.
You ever seen a kid pitch like that, huh?

152
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:25,237
Come to think of it,
I've never seen a kid pitch like that either.

153
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:28,482
Something's not right.

154
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,284
You were awesome
out there today, Justin.

155
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:39,683
Those batters had no clue
what you were throwing at them.

156
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:42,369
- Like they had never seen pitches before.
- That's what I do.

157
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:44,560
Throw them the dark stuff,
turn up the heat,

158
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,568
give them a little pop-goes-the-weasel.

159
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,165
Pop-goes-the-weasel?

160
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:50,051
Is that like a baseball term?

161
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,523
Yeah, in Taiwan,

162
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:55,134
where I learned the pitch.

163
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:58,089
Oh, I'm glad we finally met.

164
00:09:58,216 --> 00:10:00,094
See you around.

165
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,330
Just, I need to talk to you.

166
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,777
As my dad or as my coach?

167
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:06,414
As your magic teacher.

168
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,179
You broke the rules.
You never break the rules.

169
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,809
Do they make a tall basketball player
do the dog paddle?

170
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,622
Do they make a fast swimmer
swim on his knees?

171
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:15,892
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,299
Alex told me to use magic.

173
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,223
Here's some advice.
Stop listening to your sister.

174
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:22,785
Got it. E-mail to self:

175
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:25,785
"Stop listening to evil sister."

176
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:29,538
Justin, I'm very disappointed in you.

177
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,786
You've always been a stickler
for the rules.

178
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,701
- All right, fine. I'll quit the team.
- No, you're not quitting the team.

179
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,426
You're gonna learn your lesson
by pitching without magic.

180
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:40,302
I'll get creamed.

181
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,868
Exactly.
That's the learning your lesson part.

182
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:51,633
I'm ready for Justin's second game.

183
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:55,073
Max, don't you think
that foam finger's a little big?

184
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,391
No, but this one might be.

185
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:05,802
Hey, if it rains,
you can mop up the infield for us.

186
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:09,523
That's a good one, Dad. Yeah.

187
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:13,399
Hey, Alex.
You ready to go to the game?

188
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:15,199
- Come on.
- Nope.

189
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,642
I'm not going today.

190
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,487
But you're Riley's good luck charm.

191
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,283
My dad's making Justin pitch
even though he can't use a spell.

192
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,162
Spell?

193
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:27,209
Yeah. Justin had a spelling test
and couldn't practise pitching.

194
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,286
Yeah, that works. Nice.

195
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:32,247
So he's gonna get clobbered
and the team's gonna lose.

196
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:34,730
But don't you wanna see Riley?

197
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,528
Yes, but not if they're gonna lose.

198
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,336
That's just gonna show Riley
that I'm not his good luck charm.

199
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,014
But he might wish you were there.

200
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:43,936
I know. That's the good part.

201
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:46,216
I won't be there,
which will reinforce the idea

202
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,332
that I am his good luck charm.

203
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,933
Okay...

204
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:53,253
But I think it would be fun to see Riley.

205
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:58,143
Let me explain this to you slowly.

206
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:21,387
- It's a run.
- Good job, crew.

207
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:55,517
Let me ask you something.

208
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:58,447
I know, I know.
I'm getting creamed out here.

209
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,521
Right, right.

210
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,962
Hey, does your sister
ever ask about me?

211
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:14,164
I know it was tough going today, Justin.

212
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:15,649
Tough going?

213
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:17,369
I gave up 26 runs.

214
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,648
Their guys kept running around
and around and around

215
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:22,293
- and around and around and around...
- Justin.

216
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,457
Justin, listen.

217
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:29,530
Only one of my kids
is gonna be able to keep his powers.

218
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:33,339
I don't want you relying on magic,
because you might not have it one day.

219
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,500
All right, all right. I get it.

220
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,257
I never liked baseball anyway.

221
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,183
Then why did you try out for the team?

222
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,978
To impress Kari Langsdorf.

223
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:44,456
I get it.

224
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:48,503
You know, when I was your age,
I tried using magic to impress a girl.

225
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,662
Turned into a total disaster.

226
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:53,347
- What happened?
- I married her.

227
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:55,303
Just kidding.

228
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,549
Seriously, I'm just kidding.

229
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,824
Don't even say I said that,
even as a joke.

230
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,713
The point is, using magic is cheating.

231
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:08,069
And cheating to impress people
ultimately fails.

232
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:10,997
So I suggest you practise hard,

233
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,111
because I've decided
to pitch you again next game.

234
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,636
Dad, without magic,
I'll get creamed again.

235
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:18,356
Not necessarily.
You have some of my natural ability.

236
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,551
We just have to find it.

237
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:21,714
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

238
00:14:21,843 --> 00:14:24,757
Look, son, you made a commitment
and you have to stick to it.

239
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,364
You think I can do better
than I did today?

240
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:30,163
Lt'd be hard to do worse.

241
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,436
All right.

242
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,877
- All right, fine. I'll give it a shot.
- No magic, right?

243
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:37,170
- No magic. Got it.
- Okay.

244
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,642
You see? They lost.

245
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:43,046
So if I'd gone to the game,

246
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:45,209
I couldn't possibly be
Riley's good luck charm.

247
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,972
And then he wouldn't be
interested in me.

248
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,931
Do you understand that?

249
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,766
Oh, I get it. Good plan.

250
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,850
Now let's talk about something
that's really important.

251
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:58,090
Your brother's baseball uniform.

252
00:14:58,218 --> 00:15:01,177
How cute is he in that?

253
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,615
Alex, where were you today?
We got smeared.

254
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,140
I've been studying.

255
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,821
She wasn't there and you lost.

256
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,737
Sounds like she's
your good luck charm.

257
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:15,937
You're welcome.

258
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:20,856
I'm sorry, Riley.

259
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,183
I didn't know you wanted me
to come to every game.

260
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:25,465
Yeah. You're our good luck charm.

261
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:27,865
And we need good luck every game.

262
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,461
Every game? I don't know.

263
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,866
I'll tell you what.

264
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,228
If you come to our next game
and we win,

265
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:35,866
I'll take you to the fall dance.

266
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:39,552
And what makes you think
I'd wanna go to the fall dance with you?

267
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:43,066
Every girl does, don't they?

268
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,473
Yeah, you're right. Okay, you got a deal.

269
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:48,348
Great. Because I'm very superstitious.

270
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,548
But with you,

271
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,558
I got a feeling we'll go all the way
to the state championship.

272
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,239
And all the way to the fall dance.

273
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:55,956
See you.

274
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:59,396
Oh, wait.

275
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,754
What are you gonna do
if Justin pitches badly next game,

276
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:04,843
they lose, and Riley realises
you're not his good luck charm?

277
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:07,402
As long as I have
something to do with it,

278
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:11,316
I'm pretty sure Justin's team
will win the next game.

279
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,004
Oh, come on, Justin.

280
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:24,330
I didn't paint my face
for a tied-up game.

281
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:28,933
This stuff is starting to burn.
Is that bad?

282
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:34,007
I sure hope Justin gets out of this jam,
otherwise you're not good luck.

283
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:37,016
And I was up half the night with my mom
trying to figure this out.

284
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,938
So when you're there, he wins,
and when you're not, he doesn't.

285
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,619
Don't worry.
I know Justin will get out of this.

286
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:01,144
Batter's out of there.

287
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,746
Good job. Good job.

288
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:08,742
- Thanks, coach.
- Nice.

289
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,985
Justin, is there something
you wanna tell me?

290
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:14,145
No. Is there something
you wanna tell me?

291
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,110
- No.
- All right.

292
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:19,274
Good talk. Good talk.

293
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:21,788
Let's play some ball.

294
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,598
Time, ump.

295
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:40,036
Time.

296
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:41,884
Justin.

297
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:45,159
You're calling timeout
to talk to a guy sitting on the bench?

298
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:47,039
There's no rule against it.

299
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,800
- I told you I didn't do it.
- I know, I know.

300
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:53,847
I was watching you.

301
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,922
There's something going on, though,

302
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:58,646
so I want you to use your powers
to counteract it.

303
00:17:58,772 --> 00:17:59,921
Keep the game fair.

304
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,212
Okay...

305
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:06,643
Un-time.

306
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:08,854
Play ball.

307
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,008
Come on, let's go.
Everybody on the bench.

308
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,780
Safe.

309
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:58,515
Timeout, ump. Timeout.

310
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:00,476
Time.

311
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,791
Alex, get over here.

312
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,593
You're calling timeout to talk to a fan?

313
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,790
Show me the rule, ump.
Show me the rule.

314
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:13,240
I know what you're doing, young lady,
and I want it to stop.

315
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,002
I was just trying to help.

316
00:19:18,964 --> 00:19:22,003
- Here, Justin, recite this spell.
- What is it?

317
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,599
It will erase everyone's memory

318
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:26,042
so they won't remember
what happened the past few minutes.

319
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,806
- Even ours?
- I don't know.

320
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:30,966
I don't remember. I've never used it.

321
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,564
All right.

322
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,409
<i>Cerebellum erasis</i>

323
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:44,888
What just happened?

324
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:47,413
We won. We won.

325
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:50,973
In your face, losers.
Go home and cry, you little babies.

326
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:55,456
I smell smoke,
because you were burned.

327
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,975
There he is. Get him. Get him.

328
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:05,574
Dad, I don't remember
how the game ended.

329
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:08,416
Neither do I.

330
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:11,419
I think Alex had something to do with it.

331
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,179
What's that piece of paper?

332
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:17,896
Hey, this could
come in handy someday.

333
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:30,546
So Alex, looks like I've got a date
for the fall dance.

334
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:33,633
Yes, you do. And Friday night too.

335
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:34,983
We're going out Friday night?

336
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:37,471
Yeah, you asked me
right after you scored the winning run.

337
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:38,746
Don't you remember?

338
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:42,712
Yeah, sure. Great.

339
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,397
Looking forward to Friday night.

340
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,033
Yes, you are.

341
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,956
I know what you did, Alex.

342
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,281
You broke the rules and used magic

343
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,599
because you wanted Riley
to ask you out.

344
00:20:56,804 --> 00:21:00,879
I did no such thing.
And it totally worked.

345
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,522
I don't think it did.

346
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,636
- What are you talking about?
- Your punishment.

347
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:09,557
- You're not going to the fall dance.
- What?

348
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,920
Justin used magic.
Where's his punishment?

349
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:14,007
Justin was already punished
on the baseball field

350
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:19,891
when the other team ran around
and around and around.

351
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:23,613
- Hi, Kari.
- Oh, hey, Justin.

352
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:26,296
- Mind if I join you?
- Please do.

353
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,376
So I was wondering, since you like
baseball players and everything

354
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:33,492
if maybe you'd not want to not go
to a movie or something?

355
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,859
Did you just ask me out?

356
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,370
I think so. I was trying to.

357
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:40,691
Okay, sure.

358
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:42,814
- I'd love to go to a movie with you.
- Excellent.

359
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:45,777
So we're on this weekend.
What movie do you wanna see?

360
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:49,256
Oh, I only date baseball players,
and I only see movies about...

361
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:52,419
- Baseball.
- No, cats.

362
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:55,706
Okay.

363
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,706
Are there any movies out right now
about cats?

364
00:21:57,869 --> 00:21:59,269
No.

365
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:02,829
Would you see a movie about dogs?

366
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:06,590
Not unless they're cats
disguised as dogs.

367
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:08,589
Farm animals?

368
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,469
Are the cats, like,
disguised as farm animals,

369
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:14,429
like, cows and stuff?

370
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:18,554
Yeah.

371
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:21,788
I'll tell you what.

372
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,115
Why don't we wait
till a cat movie comes out?

373
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,755
I'll keep an eye on the paper, real close.

374
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:29,555
Good talking to you, Kari.
