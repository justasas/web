1
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,388
Justin, way to score
on the World History exam.

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,584
Oh, thanks, Brian.

3
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:19,426
You know, this might sound kind of lame,
but I didn't think you knew my name.

4
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:20,871
Oh, I didn't.

5
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:23,307
You left your sweater in class.
It has your name in it.

6
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,229
Look, I didn't do so good on this test.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,040
I just got one right: My name.

8
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,835
Look, I was wondering if you could
help me out. You know, tutor me.

9
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:37,919
I don't know, I'm kind of busy.

10
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:40,080
I'll give you tickets
to the Tears of Blood concert.

11
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:44,084
T.O. B? Their new tour is awesome.
You got a deal.

12
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,643
- Come by the Sub Station after school.
- Awesome.

13
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,684
Oh, if any of my friends ask you,

14
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:52,880
I was all over you
for talking to my girlfriend.

15
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:57,647
And if any of my friends ask you,
your girlfriend actually talked to me.

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,318
Oh, my gosh, did you hear?

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,840
The 'Gurt Barn's handing out
free frozen yogurt samples.

18
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:07,410
- Oh, how do you know that?
- On my cell. I got a 'Gurt alert.

19
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:10,648
Well, you're gonna have to try it
without me. I have to work.

20
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:12,213
You always have to work.

21
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:15,327
A beanie?

22
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:16,935
<i>What's that? A hat?</i>

23
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,409
<i>Crazy, funky, junky hat</i>

24
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,415
<i>Overslept? Hair unsightly?
Trying to look like Keira Knightley?</i>

25
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:24,257
<i>We've been there, we've done that
We see right through your funky hat</i>

26
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,852
You were saying?

27
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,088
It's just really hard to have a friend
who's always busy.

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,372
I know. Why don't I get my parents
to give you a job at the sandwich shop?

29
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:34,777
We can hang out all the time
and even get paid for it.

30
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:37,656
Really? That'd be great.
I've never had a job before.

31
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:40,821
Well, except for the dollar Grandma
gives me for rubbing lotion on her feet.

32
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:44,260
Yeah, well, we'll just make sure
that you're wearing gloves

33
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:46,263
when you make the sandwich.

34
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,563
Good afternoon, Mr. And Mrs. Russo.

35
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:46,564
I happened to be passing by
when I noticed this "help wanted" sign.

36
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:48,086
I'd like to apply for the position.

37
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:53,084
Oh, wow, I didn't know we were hiring.
What a good idea, Mom and Dad.

38
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:55,839
Harper, we didn't put that sign
in the window.

39
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,881
Well, someone must have.

40
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,768
We're not hiring
any sandwich associates.

41
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:01,609
Or people wearing a sandwich.

42
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:06,167
Harper, there's no job available.

43
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,204
But if you can turn that sandwich
into a taco,

44
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,053
I think Raul's is hiring down the street.

45
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:15,255
But we're swamped.
We totally need more help with...

46
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,327
All of our phone orders.

47
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:21,248
Girls, I know you think it'd be fun
to work together,

48
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:24,815
but it's really hard to work
with friends, or family.

49
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:28,728
The one time you forget to wipe off
the tip of the mustard squeeze bottle

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,253
and it's suddenly three hours
of silent salami slicing.

51
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:37,498
It dries at the end and gets crusty.
It's unsightly.

52
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:38,852
But, Mom, Dad, think about it.

53
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:41,704
If Harper works here, you could
spend more time with each other.

54
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:44,499
Yeah, Jerry, we could even go
to one of those dollar movies

55
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:46,662
you're always talking about.

56
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:50,701
It's a movie for a dollar.
How could you not talk about that?

57
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,337
Let me show you.

58
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:56,701
Alex, it is a big responsibility
training a new employee.

59
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,144
Does that mean yes?

60
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,865
You can't shirk your responsibilities
while you're training her.

61
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,710
- Does that mean yes?
- And remember,

62
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:04,424
business comes before friendship.

63
00:04:04,552 --> 00:04:07,113
I'm taking this all as a yes.
Harper, you're hired.

64
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,788
I mean,
welcome to our family's business.

65
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:18,956
- This would look great on you.
- No, it'd look better on you.

66
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:21,148
- You're more of a summer.
- Speaking of Summer,

67
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,235
did you hear what happened to her
in gym today?

68
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,873
Speaking of Jim, I heard
he and Summer are going out now.

69
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,991
That's what I was gonna say.

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,752
Regis, Kelly, can I interrupt the talk show
to interest you in some actual work?

71
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:34,595
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dad.

72
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:37,396
We were just taking a little break,
but we're getting back to work.

73
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:40,641
Okay. Well, there's a customer.
Why don't you go take his order?

74
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:41,914
A cowboy hat?

75
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:43,723
<i>What's that? A hat?</i>

76
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:44,995
<i>Crazy, funky, junky hat</i>

77
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:48,005
<i>Overslept? Hair unsightly?
Trying to look like Keira Knightley?</i>

78
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,961
<i>We've been there, we've done that
We see right through your funky hat</i>

79
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:55,607
Wow, I was one away from all boys.

80
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,123
Hi, welcome to Waverly Sub Station.
I'm Alex, I'll be your server today.

81
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,929
And this is Harper,
she's our new trainee.

82
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,724
Well, I'm thrilled.

83
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:09,090
Tell you what, just give me
the Bronx-strami, a large root beer

84
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:12,366
and a slice of that coffee cake
over there, huh?

85
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:13,929
Really? Here's what I'd do.

86
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:16,695
I'd get the half order.
It's just as filling and half the price...

87
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,251
- Harper.
- What? That's what I do.

88
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:21,892
Oh, and get the small soda,
because it's free refills.

89
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:24,931
Harper, when I said, "Harper,"
I meant stop talking.

90
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,618
Yeah, I'll have what the trainee said.

91
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,530
How'd I do?

92
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:33,741
Well, you just turned a $12 order
into us owing him.

93
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:36,497
Table 4, sandwich up.

94
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:42,977
Look, why don't you just run sandwiches
while I take the orders?

95
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:46,935
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,342
Look, why don't you just clean tables
and I'll take orders

97
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,339
and run the sandwiches?

98
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:53,467
So how's Harper working out?

99
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,546
Great.
She's really getting the hang of it.

100
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,138
How much coffee do I pour
on the coffee cake?

101
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,584
That's just a joke between me and her.

102
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:06,911
None, Harper, none.

103
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:57,129
Alex, can I talk to you in the kitchen?

104
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,330
Are you sure you don't wanna
change your shirt first? It's gross.

105
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:03,285
No. Because I'm sure
she's gonna do it again.

106
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,723
Look, before you talk about
whatever you wanna talk about,

107
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,688
I have something to say.
Harper's not working out.

108
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:14,284
Oh, good.
Then we're on the same page.

109
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,695
I'm not sure where this is going,
but continue.

110
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:21,127
Right. I think we should let Harper go.

111
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:24,251
Okay. This is a lot easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

112
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,292
- Yeah, let me know how she takes it.
- Okay.

113
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,017
Now we're not on the same page.
It was your idea to hire Harper.

114
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:32,973
And we told you,
business before friendship.

115
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:34,462
So you're gonna have to fire her.

116
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:37,497
Well, now I have a problem with that.

117
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,456
You two come with me. Go.

118
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,862
What are we doing in here?

119
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:46,138
Okay, if we stay in here long enough,
Harper won't be able to find anyone

120
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,098
and she'll just leave.

121
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:50,186
And you expect that to work?

122
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,658
Well, it's how I got out
of Harper's sewing club.

123
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,545
Look, if Harper's not better
by the end of the day,

124
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,308
you're going to have to fire her.

125
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,184
And I don't know how you're gonna do it,
but I agree with your mother.

126
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,024
Fine, but this could have worked.

127
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:11,307
Waitress spell, waitress spell.

128
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:12,664
No waitress spell.

129
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,071
"Serving wrench."

130
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,792
Oh, serving wench.

131
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,471
Hey, what's a serving wench?

132
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,272
Serving wench. A young woman
usually related to an innkeeper,

133
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,517
who, during mediaeval time, would
serve grog and food to guests of the inn.

134
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,434
So like a waitress, right?

135
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,870
Well, not technically, because...

136
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,515
But like a waitress, right?

137
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:33,632
I guess. Why?

138
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,801
Did Dad say there was a pop quiz
on the mediaeval food-service industry?

139
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:39,000
Yep. Better study up.

140
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,398
- I had a diet.
- Are you sure that's not a diet?

141
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:54,160
You're right. That's not the diet.
This is the diet.

142
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,564
There. All better?

143
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,919
<i>Take this girl with the skills of a bench
And turn her into a serving wench</i>

144
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:05,324
You know, you need all new drinks.
I'll get those right away.

145
00:09:05,453 --> 00:09:08,844
- So how are you doing?
- Suddenly, a lot better.

146
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,013
Boy, Harper improved quickly.

147
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,019
Yeah, well, sometimes it just takes a while
for your skills to kick in.

148
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,413
You probably know that from coaching
since you're such a good coach.

149
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,533
I am a pretty good coach.

150
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:42,026
Okay, Greg,
it's great that you heart Cindy,

151
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:44,786
but that's not gonna help you
in algebra class.

152
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:48,705
Anthony,
you're gonna have to start all over.

153
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:51,946
Just saying that the Empire State Building
is tall and pointy is not an essay.

154
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,822
It's barely a sentence.

155
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,341
And, Natalie.

156
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,827
This is H3O.

157
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:00,744
Now it's H2O, and I have a treat.

158
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:06,385
Oh, what can I help you with,
young man?

159
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:09,552
First of all, it's what I can help you with.

160
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:14,394
This is a great tutoring business
you got here.

161
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,747
It'd be a shame
to see something happen to it.

162
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:19,951
What?

163
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,189
Looks like your world's
come tumbling down.

164
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:24,594
You owe me a new globe.

165
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,918
No, you owe me 25 percent
of your tutoring action.

166
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:32,118
I'm the tutor in this neighbourhood,
and I don't like competition.

167
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:34,154
I bet you also
don't like amusement parks,

168
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:36,434
because you're not tall enough
to ride the rides.

169
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,633
Witty comeback.

170
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,114
You know what I think
of witty comebacks?

171
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:45,760
Pick up those sticks. Get it? It's a game.

172
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,401
Look it up.

173
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,041
Good day.

174
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:00,207
You get them.
You're closer to the ground.

175
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:02,526
Because he's...

176
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:08,608
Tuna wrap Brooklyn style, burn them.

177
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,773
I need a roast beef.
Knock the wind out of it and let it walk.

178
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:14,889
Where did all these people come from?

179
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:17,213
Oh, Harper gave everyone
that was here earlier a coupon

180
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,852
to come for dinner and get a free soda
with every sandwich.

181
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:23,939
- But we already give free soda at dinner.
- I know. She's brilliant.

182
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,938
Harper is doing great.

183
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,540
I know. You know what you should do?

184
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:31,541
You should leave her in charge tomorrow
so that you and Dad could do something.

185
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:34,974
For as long as we've lived in New York,
we've never been to the Statue of Liberty.

186
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:36,253
I know.

187
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:39,616
And it's the one pencil sharpener
missing from my monument collection.

188
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:41,304
Let's go.

189
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:44,865
Order's up.

190
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,553
Oh, my gosh. Did you hear that?

191
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,950
I just talked my mom and dad
into leaving you in charge.

192
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,669
So when they leave, we can lock up
and we can do whatever we want.

193
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:12,667
Except go to the Statue of Liberty.

194
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,312
I don't think so.
We're gonna be pretty busy here.

195
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:18,510
I just e-mailed out a breakfast special,
so you should be in about 5 a.m.

196
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:22,435
- I'm not coming in at 5 a.m.
- Yeah, I think you are.

197
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,879
I need two bow-wows painted red.

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,152
And who do I have to kick in the can
to get some nachos?

199
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:29,956
- I can come in whenever I want.
- No, you can't.

200
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,199
You heard your parents.
They're leaving me in charge.

201
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:33,392
Because I told them to.

202
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:35,242
You're not my boss.
I checked with my boss.

203
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:38,721
And since I'm the boss of me,
I'm giving myself the day off.

204
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,073
I hate to do this,

205
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:43,084
but if you don't come in tomorrow,
you're fired.

206
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:49,645
You can't fire me.
It's my family's restaurant.

207
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:53,086
- You're fired.
- I'm in charge. You can't fire me.

208
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,438
My family owns the restaurant.

209
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,687
And since I'm in the family,
that makes me part-owner.

210
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:59,082
Owners can fire employees.
Do the math.

211
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:00,287
Well, fine.

212
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:03,525
If you fire me from the restaurant,
I'm firing you from being my friend.

213
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,845
I'm removing this apron
from the restaurant

214
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:11,127
and the metaphorical apron
of our friendship.

215
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:14,572
There's no apron of our friendship.

216
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,973
Not anymore there isn't.

217
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,296
So did she quit or did you fire her?
Which is it?

218
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,295
It was complicated. I guess both.

219
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:31,492
Well, make sure she quit.

220
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:34,218
That way I don't have to pay her
for the rest of the week.

221
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:37,658
- Jerry.
- Oh, I mean, I'm sorry.

222
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,736
It's hard to work with friends.

223
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:46,458
So you think you and Harper
are gonna be okay?

224
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:50,662
I don't know. I tried to fire her from the job,
but she fired me from being her friend.

225
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,863
<i>What's that? A hat?</i>

226
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:56,060
<i>Crazy, funky, junky...</i>

227
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:58,831
Oh, forget it. It's not the same.

228
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:03,386
Oh, honey, you want me to do
that crazy hat dance with you?

229
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,150
No, it'd be weird,

230
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:10,313
and it's kind of me and Harper's thing,
and sometimes it's about you.

231
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:17,786
And for our next experiment,

232
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:20,194
Chris is gonna drop a water balloon
and a Ping-Pong ball

233
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,151
from upstairs at the same time.

234
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,749
Which one do you think
is gonna hit the ground first?

235
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:29,671
Chris, you were supposed
to wait for me to say "go."

236
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,196
That guy...

237
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:34,158
Okay.

238
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:36,675
Kind of deserved that one.

239
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,243
Let's take a five and regroup.

240
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:47,080
Looks like Galileo's all wet.

241
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,406
Where's my cut?
The Answer Man's getting tired of waiting.

242
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,681
You're tired? Sounds like
it's nap time for the Answer Man.

243
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,365
Nap time. Good one.

244
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:02,691
Maybe it's nap time for you.
Enforcers, assemble.

245
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:12,047
So you got a lot of really tiny friends,
and anyone can drop down a rope and:

246
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:16,890
These two guys have black belts
in tae kwon do.

247
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:19,453
That guy brought a rope.

248
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,292
Chris, let them all go!

249
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:26,580
Retreat, retreat.

250
00:15:32,903 --> 00:15:34,462
Justin.

251
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,214
It's you.

252
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:40,702
Hey, you haven't seen like four or five
tiny little ninjas running around, have you?

253
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,342
No. Have you seen
really tall flowers that talk?

254
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:47,178
Wait, I'm not sure
what game we're playing.

255
00:15:47,308 --> 00:15:49,869
There's this kid Frankie.
Him and his little thugs are after me.

256
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:52,140
They're trying to muscle in
on my Brain Train action.

257
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,024
Oh, this isn't as fun a game
as I thought.

258
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:58,028
Hey, are you on your way
to see Harper?

259
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,984
No, why?
Where have you seen Harper?

260
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:02,024
When Frankie chased me,
I hid in the 'Gurt Barn.

261
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:03,223
She works there now.

262
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:06,233
She wouldn't let me hide in the bathroom
unless I bought something.

263
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:09,553
- So she got a job at 'Gurt Barn.
- Yeah, and she's amazing.

264
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:12,589
She had like ten waffle cones
and a couple of 'Gurt Shakes in one hand.

265
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:15,027
I did that.
I put a spell on her to make her good.

266
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,227
Wait a minute.

267
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,190
You used the serving wench spell
on her.

268
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,547
Wait another minute.

269
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,956
There's no pop quiz
on the mediaeval food-service industry.

270
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:25,952
I crammed for that.

271
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:29,357
Are you done?
Because I gotta go apologise to Harper.

272
00:16:31,243 --> 00:16:33,314
Yes, I'm done. Yeah.

273
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,961
Justin Russo.

274
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,167
You, you thought you could hide,
but you can't.

275
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,243
Enforcers, assemble.

276
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:04,924
Any last words, Russo,
besides "Mommy"?

277
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:10,409
Yeah, I got something to say.
Underachievers, assemble.

278
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:17,653
Guys, over here.

279
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,899
I'd like you to meet my friends.

280
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,089
This is Brian.

281
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,816
He's currently failing geometry,
but being recruited by Canadian football.

282
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:29,821
This is Doug, going into his third year
of 11th grade.

283
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:31,342
All-state wrestler.

284
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:34,297
And this guy? He's got a record.

285
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:39,185
You're smart enough to see
where this is going, right, Answer Man?

286
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:43,619
This is just a little back-and-forth.

287
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,742
You know, something tutors do.

288
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,544
What do you say? Friends?

289
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,822
I don't think so.

290
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:56,227
Enforcers, run.

291
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:00,748
Get them, they're getting away. Go.

292
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,630
I know you've only been working here
four hours,

293
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,955
but congratulations,
you're employee of the month.

294
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:22,397
As soon as I get some photo paper,
go home, hook it up to my printer,

295
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,197
print it, bring it back here,

296
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:29,194
I'll pin it up.

297
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:33,162
- Gee, thanks.
- It's a real honour.

298
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:39,202
I almost won it four times, but I didn't,
because I take too many breaks.

299
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:43,366
That reminds me,
it's time for my break.

300
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:50,087
Hi, welcome to the 'Gurt Barn.
How can l...?

301
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,359
What do you want?

302
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,925
For us to be friends again.
I'm not leaving here until we are.

303
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:58,409
Well, I don't need your friendship,
because I'm employee of the month.

304
00:18:58,532 --> 00:18:59,932
And I have a new friend.

305
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:02,090
- Who?
- My manager.

306
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:03,533
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

307
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:07,284
Well, I can't tell you.
She told me not to wear it out.

308
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:09,895
Look, Harper, we're best friends.

309
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,008
And because you got really bossy
at the restaurant

310
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,935
doesn't mean I don't miss you
being my friend.

311
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,411
I wasn't bossy.

312
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:17,456
You weren't respecting me
as your boss.

313
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:20,617
Because you're not my boss.
Why don't you just accept my apology?

314
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,098
Because "you got really bossy"
is not an apology.

315
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:26,497
Now, just go away.
I have to refill the machine.

316
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:33,740
- Can I hide in your bathroom?
- Not unless you buy something.

317
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:35,821
I'll pay on the way out.

318
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:40,939
- I thought he ran in here.
- Where is he?

319
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:44,378
I don't know,
but I gotta go to the bathroom.

320
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,985
Hey, Alex, how'd things go
with you and Harper?

321
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,670
- Not good.
- What are you gonna do?

322
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,704
I'm doing it.

323
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:56,905
<i>Take this girl who's a great serving wench
And give her back her skills of a bench</i>

324
00:19:57,032 --> 00:20:00,742
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I don't usually do this sort of thing.

325
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:02,273
I'm employee of the month.

326
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:05,785
Well, this is still good.
We can scoop it up.

327
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:10,314
Let me just get you
some all-new yogurt.

328
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,636
So that was your solution?
Make her look bad in front of everybody?

329
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:19,032
I don't know. I'm mad.
I just want her to be my friend.

330
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,637
Well, if you want her to be your friend,
you gotta be a friend to her.

331
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:27,317
I hate it when you're right.

332
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:31,398
- But you kind of wanna thank me.
- No.

333
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:35,200
Here, let me help you.

334
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,794
- Why do you wanna help me?
- Because I'm your friend.

335
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:41,516
You can fire me from being your friend,
but can't fire me from acting like a friend.

336
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,798
Here, go get cups.
We need cups, cups.

337
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:45,805
I just can't get this cow to turn off.

338
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,841
Okay. No, no.

339
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:58,645
We're gonna need something bigger.

340
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:11,095
Okay,
we're gonna need something bigger.

341
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:17,772
Brain freeze.

342
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,259
- It must have run out.
- Yeah.

343
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:27,854
Nope. Now it did.

344
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,497
I'm so sorry.

345
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:34,220
Why are you sorry? It's like a funky hat.

346
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:36,176
<i>What's that? A hat?</i>

347
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:37,500
<i>Crazy, funky, junky hat</i>

348
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:40,460
<i>Overslept? Hair unsightly?
Trying to look like Keira Knightley?</i>

349
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:43,665
<i>We've been there, we've done that
We see right through your funky hat</i>

350
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:50,669
I'm sorry. We had a bit of an accident.

351
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:56,269
We should get our stories straight
before the owner comes in.

352
00:21:56,952 --> 00:22:00,263
- No, no.
- Hey, wait up.

353
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,506
We'll blame him.

354
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:05,593
Perfect.
I've been blaming him my whole life.

355
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:10,712
<i>We see right through your funky hat</i>

356
00:22:10,837 --> 00:22:12,271
Mom, don't add your own moves.

357
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,471
<i>This isn't the '80s.
This isn't Footgrease music.</i>

358
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,510
<i>It's Footloose or Grease.
And those movies were great.</i>

359
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,154
Come on, take it from the top.

360
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:23,438
<i>What's that? A hat?</i>

361
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:25,393
<i>Crazy, funky, junky hat</i>

362
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:29,152
<i>Overslept? Hair unsightly?
Trying to look like Keira Knightley?</i>

363
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:34,040
And pull the cord,
pull the cord, pull the cord.
