1
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,183
Alex Russo, you kneel before
the Crystals of Justice

2
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:05,614
where you are charged with treason for
attempting to destroy the mortal world.

3
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:08,928
I'm telling you, you have the wrong wizard.

4
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,041
Silence!

5
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,344
Ok, I am right here. You
do not have to yell.

6
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:19,533
What I was trying to say is that,
ok, maybe some bad things happened,

7
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:24,700
and maybe it was because of me, but
that doesn't mean it was my fault.

8
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:26,805
I'd make a terrible lawyer.

9
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,205
Your fate has been decided.

10
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:31,530
The Crystal Cavern of Justice
hereby find you guilty!

11
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:35,401
Wait! No! Isn't there some way
we can replay what happened

12
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:36,816
so you would know I'm innocent?

13
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,906
Well, almost innocent.

14
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:41,862
Not speaking of the
time vortex, are you?

15
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:43,916
Well, if that's what you call
a rewind button, then yeah.

16
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:49,579
Very well. We will send you back
to the moment this incident began.

17
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:51,634
All right. Well, get your
popcorn and licorice

18
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:54,438
because you're going to
like how this got started.

19
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,935
I just love drive-in movies. You can
yell at the screen and nobody cares.

20
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:14,738
Hey, genius, the walls are oozing
maggots, why are you taking a shower?

21
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:17,562
Alex...

22
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:25,363
Your own personal drive-in?!
Get rid of it now.

23
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:29,156
Come on, dad. I can get you your own car
and you can watch the movie with us.

24
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:30,554
I can get you a Churro truck.

25
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:33,305
Lose it.

26
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:35,369
Fine.

27
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,197
And whose car was that?

28
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:40,535
I don't know, but there's
some guy out on Waverly Place

29
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,171
who's been looking for his car for about
an hour, show me some love, Harper.

30
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,393
- Yeah.
- Harper, don't high-five her.

31
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:47,643
What she did was wrong and
unbelievably selfish.

32
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:50,020
Well, we left the guy
half a pack of licorice.

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,243
No, we didn't.

34
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,210
Dad, what's the big deal? I've
always done stuff like this.

35
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,805
Right, but now that
you're The Family Wizard,

36
00:02:57,806 --> 00:03:00,826
it's time to stop using
magic for selfish reasons.

37
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:02,980
Now give me that popcorn.

38
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:06,817
Thank you so much, Mason.

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,173
Ok, you and Alex can hang up the banner.

40
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:11,087
Harper, get the ice cream
cake out of the freezer.

41
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,143
Jerry, stop eating popcorn off the floor.

42
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,920
Wait, did you say party? For who?

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,517
I have a fair inkling.

44
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:23,869
Another party for Justin?!

45
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:26,662
We're just so excited about
him taking over WizTech.

46
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,821
It's a big deal.

47
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,778
Yeah. I guess you're right.

48
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:32,872
It's not like, you know,
actually winning the

49
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:35,340
family competition and
becoming the full wizard.

50
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,595
Since nobody ever threw me a party.

51
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:40,923
Hey, I didn't get a party
or get to become a wizard.

52
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,173
I just got these all-you-can-eat
bologna scraps.

53
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,893
Mm-mm. Maybe I am the winner.

54
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,458
Come on, everybody. We've
got a lot of work to do.

55
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,814
Justin's going to be here soon.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,369
All right, I'm done. Where's my magazine?

57
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:01,421
Mason, rub my shoulders.
That was hard work.

58
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:04,743
Hey! I just told you,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,469
magic is not for getting what you
want or using it for selfish reasons.

60
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,398
Mason, stop rubbing her shoulders!

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,539
That's right, Mija, you should use your

62
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,925
magic to make other people's lives easier.

63
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:18,497
I know a pretty Latina who would love
to never have to do laundry again.

64
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:20,595
Theresa.

65
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:24,053
Sorry. Your father's right.
It's time to grow up.

66
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:28,634
"Grow up?" Everybody knows people
who grow up too fast are miserable.

67
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,250
I mean, look at Harper.

68
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,638
She's been doing her parents' laundry
since she was in the second grade.

69
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,777
Oh, see, the laundry I didn't mind so much.

70
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:38,586
It was rotating the tires
on the minivan that just...

71
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:41,407
Really got to me.

72
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,867
Where's Justin? He should've
been here by now.

73
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:48,130
You mean he's not here?

74
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,215
I'm so bored I thought he was here
telling one of his nerdy stories

75
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:56,196
that always ends with "hey,
wake up, everybody!"

76
00:04:57,205 --> 00:05:00,580
I'm so sorry for the intrusion.
I'm Justin's friend Dominic.

77
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,213
He asked me to give you a message.

78
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:05,486
He is too busy at WizTech and
unfortunately cannot come.

79
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:08,639
Ok. Give us the message.

80
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,760
Uh... that was the message.

81
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:14,494
Ok. Can we start from the top? Because
this guy is all over the place.

82
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:18,701
- So is Justin all right?
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Russo. Justin is fine.

83
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:22,504
It's just more difficult for someone with
his spectacular talents to get away.

84
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,573
Now, I don't usually use
the word "spectacular,"

85
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,534
but in Justin's case, spectacular.

86
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,823
Justin isn't coming? What are we
gonna do with the ice cream cake.

87
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:35,417
Oh, I'm sure you'll think
of something, Jerry.

88
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,692
Excuse me, you must be Alex Russo.

89
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:42,882
You're quite famous in the Wizard World
but I had no idea you were so...

90
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,585
Beautiful.

91
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:47,711
Oh, come on. I'm not that famous.

92
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:51,309
Dominic. Nice to meet you, mate.
I'm Mason Greyback.

93
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,951
Perhaps you've heard of me,
Alex's Werewolf boyfriend.

94
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:57,478
Boyfriend? You're a lucky man.

95
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,079
Yes, I am. A lucky Werewolf.

96
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:07,521
Well, it seems like I've made
this awkward, forgive me.

97
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:11,159
It was an honor meeting you, Alex.
So long, everyone.

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
Werewolf.

99
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:20,501
Boy, he was the most polite
wizard I have ever met.

100
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,470
And easy on the eyes.

101
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:25,951
Reminded me of a young me.

102
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:29,075
You know, I think he was into you, Alex.

103
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:30,587
Oh. No, no, no, no.

104
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:33,432
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

105
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,163
I can't believe Justin's not coming.

106
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:37,918
I wanted him to be here
for my big announcement.

107
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,903
A while ago, I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela, in Italy,

108
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:44,757
inviting us to a Russo family reunion.

109
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:47,305
It's ok, dad. What's your announcement?

110
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:51,064
- That was the announcement.
- Oh, great, now dad's all over the place.

111
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:55,138
Aw, Jerry, you're taking me on a
romantic trip to Italy, I love you.

112
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,971
Well... actually, I'm
taking the whole family.

113
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:01,748
Why? They don't know we have kids.

114
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:05,449
But, Theresa, it's a family reunion.
Or should I say...

115
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,349
Riunione di famiglia?

116
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,022
Please don't do that, dad.

117
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:14,107
It's almost as annoying as
when you say "mootsa-rella".

118
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:18,146
Well, you guys have fun.

119
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:21,682
I'll just stay here and read or something.

120
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:24,886
Yeah, and I'll just stay here
and chew up the furniture.

121
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:28,607
This couch looks pretty fruity.

122
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,458
You guys are family, too. I got
tickets for all of us to go.

123
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,695
- Oh yay!
- All right!

124
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:38,466
Tickets? Dad, if you want to go to
Italy, I can be our travel agent.

125
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:44,367
No time for that travel confusion. Show
me the door to our Italian reunion.

126
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:51,446
Ok, I don't know how to say
"Wizard Speed Pass" in Italian,

127
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:54,281
so I'm just going to go with "Mamma Mia!"

128
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:58,422
Or at least I think that's Italian.

129
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:03,161
A door to Japan? How cool.

130
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:06,226
It's Italy.

131
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:09,864
I don't know all the towns in Japan, dude.

132
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:13,551
Alex, you're not going to turn this trip
into one of your selfish shortcuts.

133
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:16,170
I want us to experience the whole journey.

134
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:18,841
Getting there is half the fun.

135
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:22,382
Now, get rid of this thing.

136
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,999
Whoa.

137
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,595
Did you just see that girl?

138
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,551
Alex, I have to get her number first.

139
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,379
Max, get back here!

140
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,160
Would you please grow up?! Max!

141
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:45,221
Ok, let's just find Max and go home.

142
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:48,519
So we can fly back here.

143
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,820
Wow! Look at this place.

144
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,775
Oh. It's beautiful.

145
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,890
Your family lives here?

146
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:05,647
Villa di Russo.

147
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:10,485
I don't know who "Villa di" is,
but Russo is definitely me.

148
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:12,355
I don't think he's mad at you anymore.

149
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:17,439
Oh, don't be fooled. He's happy
anywhere there's cheese hanging.

150
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,295
Man. I lost her.

151
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:23,199
I didn't even get her name,
but she looked like a Tomiko.

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,690
Tomiko! Tomiko!

153
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,438
Max. Forget the girl. We've
got girls back home.

154
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:32,374
Yeah, but there's no
Italians in New York, Mom.

155
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,144
Oh, come on. Can't we stay a little longer?

156
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:38,113
This is the first time Alex's magic
took me somewhere that didn't scare me.

157
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:41,150
No. We're not coming to Italy this way.

158
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:44,053
We're going to experience a
family trip the real way.

159
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,949
You mean on a discount flight in
cramped seats with bad food and

160
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,161
an obnoxious kid in front of you
saying, "peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo".

161
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:54,562
Ciao, bella.

162
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:58,000
Are you here for a tour
of the Russo vineyard?

163
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,701
Well... I, uh...

164
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:02,972
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

165
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:07,190
We're not here for the tour, paisan.
Go back to work.

166
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:10,074
And put a shirt on! All right, let's go.

167
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:12,614
Ok, fine. But you'll only
have yourself to blame

168
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:18,199
when that peek-a-boo kid uses
your lap for a barf bag.

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,800
All right, is everybody here?

170
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,131
Good. Now, Alex, get rid of this thing.

171
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:26,932
Ok.

172
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:32,133
Hmm... the spell I need is
like things in my bedroom.

173
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:35,437
It's buried under the
dirty clothes of my mind.

174
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:40,442
You see? Justin would never do a spell
that he didn't know how to undo.

175
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:43,439
Oh, I get it. I get this
whole "grown-up" thing now.

176
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,929
You think Justin should've
been The Family Wizard.

177
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,700
Honey, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean it that way.

178
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:54,404
No. I'm sorry I'm not the grown-up
Family Wizard you want me to be.

179
00:10:54,405 --> 00:11:00,305
Well, up until then, that was the best
five-minute vacation I've ever had.

180
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:22,070
Ahem, excuse me, is this Jumbotron taken?

181
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:24,022
Dominic? What are you doing here?

182
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:27,843
My night job is cleaning
the back of the Jumbotron.

183
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,583
You being here is just a bonus.

184
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:33,239
Look, you seem really nice,
but I have a boyfriend.

185
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,391
And to be honest I don't think I'd
be really good company right now.

186
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:39,799
Unless you're a fan of big,
sloppy emotional meltdowns.

187
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,491
You know, I was just saying this morning,

188
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:45,177
I haven't seen a big, sloppy
emotional meltdown in a while.

189
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:48,478
Let's see what you got.

190
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:51,086
Ah, a smile.

191
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,877
Have you ever considered
joining The Wizard Council?

192
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,812
The Wizard Council?

193
00:11:56,813 --> 00:12:01,397
Isn't that for old geezers who wear robes
because they're tired of shopping?

194
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:04,009
I just believe you have the
potential to be the most,

195
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,956
powerful wizard of your generation.

196
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:11,727
Trust me. You have no idea
what you're truly capable of.

197
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:14,032
Well, if you ask my family,

198
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm not capable of anything
except refusing to grow up.

199
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:22,150
They're mortals. They can't
understand wizards with your power.

200
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:24,473
Besides, if their opinions
really bothers you,

201
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:30,374
you're powerful enough to create your own
spell to smooth out your little edges.

202
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,739
Why are you telling me this?

203
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,140
Because where everyone else
sees trouble, I see magic.

204
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:42,596
And beauty.

205
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,847
Ok, now you're just flirting.

206
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,682
Yeah, a little bit.

207
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:52,240
- Here. It's a small gift.
- Oh, no. I can't take that.

208
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:56,201
It's simply a friendship bracelet.

209
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,395
Everything ok up here?

210
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:04,365
Oh, yeah. Mason, sorry. I just had
to get away from home, you know.

211
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,136
And I just came to check on her.
I apologize if I've overstepped.

212
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:11,139
You have, mate, and I'm here now.

213
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,300
Werewolf.

214
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:17,116
- Good-bye, Alex.
- Bye.

215
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,700
Werewolf.

216
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,986
I do not like that guy.

217
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,988
Anything I should be worried about?

218
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,156
Not a thing.

219
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,276
Good. Well, I've got a
surprise to cheer you up.

220
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,927
I thought we would have a little picnic.

221
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:37,629
Don't say Italian, because I've
had enough of that, today.

222
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,310
No. I was thinking
something sophisticated...

223
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:46,400
- Poached salmon.
- Oh, Mason...

224
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:48,542
That's so sweet.

225
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:51,046
But can I make a little tweak?

226
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,927
Of course, darling.

227
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,148
Check it out, finger food feast.
I call the wing.

228
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:01,100
No, Alex! Alex, you know
this food is bad for you.

229
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:04,964
Besides, I cooked that salmon,
two hours over a hot poacher.

230
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:09,501
Why? You know it only takes
me like two seconds.

231
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:12,806
I see. So, this is how it's
going to be from now on.

232
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:17,067
- What?
- Just you, me and your wand.

233
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:22,230
Just using your magic selfishly
no matter who it hurts.

234
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:26,450
Mason, where are you going?
I did all this for us.

235
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,731
So did I.

236
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:42,731
So you turned Mason's classy picnic
into a county fair fry-fest?

237
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:45,731
Well, everybody knows that
my favorite food comes in

238
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:49,315
cardboard containers with
some kind of dipping sauce.

239
00:14:49,316 --> 00:14:50,539
Ewe.

240
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,440
Oh, hi, Alex. Can you tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

241
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:00,388
Everything you're wearing
is from the nineties.

242
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:04,053
Oh, but if you guys wear
it, it's "vintage".

243
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:06,221
Have you figured out how to
get rid of this thing yet?

244
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:08,629
Uh, no. I've been a little busy.

245
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,530
But don't worry, I'll figure it out
something before Max can use it again.

246
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:19,835
Hey, who wants to help me
make a hot tub out of this?

247
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,461
I bet I know how he's going
to make the bubbles.

248
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:26,041
Max, stop going to Italy. And, Alex, you...

249
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,805
I know, I know. Grow up.

250
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:32,031
You're right, pop. I'll
just take this back.

251
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,982
Max, you forgot the barrel!

252
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,843
Max!

253
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:38,854
He's not coming back, is he?

254
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,757
Theresa, we have to find Max again!

255
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:45,228
What?! I was about to make dinner.

256
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:49,549
It's just Italy, we'll be right back.

257
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,600
Hey, are you ok?

258
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:04,603
It's just that, I thought once
I became The Family Wizard,

259
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:07,881
all of this pressure would be off of me.

260
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:11,851
But no, it's like everybody
still wants me to change.

261
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,953
Well, that doesn't make a lot of sense.

262
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:17,186
It's who you are in the first place
that made you The Family Wizard.

263
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:22,829
I know, but maybe growing up
would make me a better person.

264
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,731
I mean, I can't even say anything nice

265
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:26,900
about my best friend's
hideous clambake outfit.

266
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,869
I'm sorry, Harper. I held
off as long as I could.

267
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,289
But you see? That's what I mean. You
making fun of my outfit is you.

268
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,709
And me loving this outfit is me.

269
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,778
People should appreciate
you for who you are,

270
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,548
not for what they think you should be.

271
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:47,172
Right. And I am a powerful wizard
who can change if I want to.

272
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,768
Just smooth out my little edges.

273
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:51,634
Wait, hold up. Ok, so,
after my great speech,

274
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,878
you're still going to change
your personality with magic?

275
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,943
Well, just the parts that nobody likes.

276
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:59,192
So, you're going to change
your whole personality?

277
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:00,752
I owed you for the clambake comment.

278
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,237
- All right.
- Yeah, that's good.

279
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:06,343
Selfish, mean and tired of rejection.

280
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:10,904
Take these parts to a place of reflection.

281
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:13,619
Alex, are you ok?

282
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,679
I think so. Did it work?

283
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,527
I don't know. You look the same.
Here, let me test you.

284
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:21,788
What do you think of my clambake outfit?

285
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:24,726
Mm. It's horrible...

286
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:26,125
That you didn't make me one.

287
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:30,321
- Oh, it worked!
- I'm totally nice!

288
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:32,200
Wait.

289
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:35,535
If you still have all your good parts,
where did all your bad parts go?

290
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:38,839
Hey! Let me out of here, you ugly hags!

291
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,675
And I found my bad parts.

292
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:44,085
Oh, come on. She doesn't seem that bad.

293
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:47,234
I can smell that nasty outfit
all the way from here!

294
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:51,451
- Oh, I am not afraid of you!
- Well, come and get me, lobster girl!

295
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:55,292
Harper, don't let me taunt you.

296
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,916
Hey, maybe she's like a bird.

297
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,553
She'll be quiet if we cover her up.

298
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:03,494
Hey! Take this off!

299
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:12,634
Oh, Alex. You have no
idea what you've started.

300
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:27,139
Did you find Max?

301
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,940
No.

302
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,009
But I found out where my
cousins keep their cannolis.

303
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,263
Jerry, you're supposed to be
looking for your son, not dessert.

304
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:39,118
Let me have a bite of that. Come on.

305
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,059
- Oh, Max!
- Where?

306
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,759
Oh!

307
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,193
Mmm.

308
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:50,340
Let's just go home and try to
lure Max back with this cannoli.

309
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:52,437
- Ok.
- What I'm saying.

310
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:54,506
There's not going to be any left.

311
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:58,041
- Let's get a couple to go.
- Ok.

312
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:01,160
Where are you going? Thieves!

313
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:04,818
Buon giorno. We're just
looking for our son.

314
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,759
We're not stealing.

315
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:14,952
Carmela? Cousin Carmela?

316
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:16,729
Jerry Russo!

317
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,690
Bianca, Gino, put your wands down.

318
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,993
Geraldo!

319
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,574
Cugino Geraldo!

320
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,649
Look at you. You still have a baby face.
It's so smooth.

321
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,211
Oh, that's just the
grease from the cannoli.

322
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:35,821
- Carmela, this is my wife, Theresa.
- Oh, Theresa!

323
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:38,272
Nice to meet... too tight.

324
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:42,264
Too thin. This one is like a bread stick.

325
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:47,195
Hey, Geraldo, what are you doing here?
The reunion isn't for month, huh?

326
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:50,616
Oh, who cares? Let's eat.

327
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:58,294
- Benvenuto!
- Max.

328
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:01,573
I'm sorry. I just love meeting people.
Hi, Max Russo.

329
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:04,333
We have been looking all over for you.

330
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,911
This is our son, Max. I'm sorry.

331
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:10,490
He saw a pretty girl through the Wizard
Speed Pass and came to find her.

332
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:12,817
You have a Wizard Speed Pass?

333
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:15,163
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

334
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:18,757
Only the most powerful
wizards can create those.

335
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:22,460
Ah, but your Family Wizard, Alex Russo.

336
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:26,052
Yes. Alex is very powerful, and very...

337
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:28,513
Irresponsible!

338
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:35,537
Just because you say it loud and weird
doesn't make it Italian, Jerry.

339
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:38,543
There's that girl. I have to meet her.

340
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,612
She might be the future Mrs. Max Russo.

341
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,448
Mrs. Russo! Mrs. Russo!

342
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:46,749
Your son likes Francesca?

343
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:52,161
What's so funny?

344
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:55,402
Francesca is his cousin!

345
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:58,937
Ewe.

346
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,807
Theresa, did Geraldo tell you that we were
wizards in training at the same time?

347
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:07,120
We had so much fun.

348
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:11,441
Geraldo, remember I used to tickle you?

349
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:15,551
Stop, stop! Get the bread stick.
Get the bread stick.

350
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:18,192
No. No, oh no.

351
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:29,565
So, what do you think about
taking accordion lessons with me?

352
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:33,536
Well, why wouldn't I?
You're my best friend.

353
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:36,606
It's like a dream come true.

354
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:39,247
Ok. I'm ready!

355
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:43,869
- What do you think?
- I think it's missing something.

356
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,562
- Come here.
- Oh.

357
00:21:46,563 --> 00:21:50,086
- Oh, this is the best day of my life.
- Oh, I'm so happy you're happy.

358
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:52,222
Thank you, Alex. You're such a good friend.

359
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:54,444
- Now, take it off.
- What, why?

360
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:57,857
Because even though I love that you finally
appreciate something I like to do,

361
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,785
it's just not you and,
I don't need it to be.

362
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:02,828
Thank you.

363
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:05,471
Besides, I can pull off a clambake outfit.

364
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:09,132
On you, it just looks stupid.

365
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:12,075
What was that?

366
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:15,946
Oh! Something I think is going
to take up the rest of the day.

367
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:21,827
Harper, grab the fishing net.
We might need it to catch me.

368
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,624
Yup. I broke out.

369
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,568
Ok, where would a Bad Alex go?

370
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:34,587
Usually, only as far as the
couch, but that door is open.

371
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,808
Oh, gosh.

372
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:39,802
What are you doing?

373
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:45,703
You know, I really should have
made a shawl out of this net.

374
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:49,555
Carmela, this cheese is amazing.

375
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:52,449
Oh yeah, Papa Fabrizio makes it.

376
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,250
Eh.

377
00:22:56,398 --> 00:23:00,323
We need find me before
I do something bad...

378
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:03,293
Hi, Mom and dad. Guess what? I've changed.

379
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:07,494
Yeah, into a third grade art project.

380
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:10,364
No, no, no. Not that, dad. Guess what?

381
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:13,492
All the part of me that has all
of those bad things is gone.

382
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:17,213
Yup. Gone. Nowhere to be seen.

383
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:19,000
Unless of course you've seen it.

384
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:21,711
Mom, dad, from now on I promise...

385
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:26,216
To be the unselfish grown-up
you expect me to be.

386
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:28,493
I don't believe her.

387
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,153
Me neither.

388
00:23:30,154 --> 00:23:33,089
Seriously, why are you
wearing a clambake outfit?

389
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,025
Because my best friend asked me to.

390
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:40,786
Dad, sometimes you need to do
things to make others happy.

391
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:43,910
Now, I definitely don't believe her.

392
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:47,779
Look, I still don't like
the way we got here...

393
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,293
But they're feeding us. So you
might as well meet the family.

394
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:58,484
Everyone, I'd like you to meet our friend
Harper, and our Family Wizard, Alex!

395
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,415
Oh.

396
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,692
So cute.

397
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,595
Pooka-pooka-pooka!

398
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,259
Just like your father!

399
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,620
- Why is she tickling me?
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!

400
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:21,472
Excuse me, I'm looking for a girl that's
about this tall and this beautiful...

401
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,163
Hey it's you.

402
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:31,281
You know my name?

403
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:37,182
Or, wait, does it just take that
long to say my name in Italian?

404
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,121
I don't understand what
you're saying right now.

405
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:43,562
I'll try the language of love with you.

406
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:49,405
Ok, maybe you don't speak that language.

407
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,275
Oh, Max. I'll save you.

408
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,616
Not really.

409
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,920
Thanks, Alex. They kiss really weird here.

410
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:11,405
All right. I'm safe in a bracelet. Thanks.

411
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:14,106
Safe or trapped?

412
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:20,773
By that evil chuckle, I'm
going to go with "trapped".

413
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:26,695
And this is where we press the
finest grapes in all of Tuscany.

414
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:30,416
Oh, that looks like hard work.

415
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:35,367
Please. Stomping your feet isn't hard work.

416
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:38,754
Yeah, filling bread rolls
with cold cuts all day.

417
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:41,575
That's hard work.

418
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:43,878
Geraldo...

419
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:45,361
Why don't you try it?

420
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:47,602
- Oh, no. No, thanks.
- Ah...

421
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:52,103
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!
- Ha-ha-ha! Ok. Ok.

422
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:54,770
- You too, Theresa.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm ok.

423
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:56,839
- Get in.
- No, no, no.

424
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,946
- Theresa, get in.
- No thank you.

425
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:00,861
Get in!

426
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:03,202
Si, senora.

427
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,649
It's nice to appreciate my Mom and
dad doing something together.

428
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,286
Old me would've just been thinking
of ways to make fun of them.

429
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:11,654
- Oh.
- Oh.

430
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:15,315
- Oh, it's so squishy.
- Oh.

431
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:20,329
Ugh. And the worst part
is, I kind of like it.

432
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,153
Thanks a lot, Jerry. You know
what this reminds me of?

433
00:26:24,503 --> 00:26:28,630
The time the bathtub backed up and you
made us take showers in there anyway.

434
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:33,180
Don't blame me. You were the one who
said, "oh, handsome vineyard guy"...

435
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:37,727
"You're so strong, the way
you squash those grapes".

436
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,484
I never said that.

437
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:43,445
- Oh, yes, you did.
- Oh, please.

438
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:48,292
- You imagined it.
- Oh. Oh, really?

439
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:49,939
Your insecurities imagined it.

440
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,023
Aha!

441
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:52,614
Ooh.

442
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:56,367
Hey, you know, they should
really have machines for this.

443
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:58,302
- Don't you think?
- Oh!

444
00:26:58,303 --> 00:27:01,723
You know what? Yes, I do.

445
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,576
I would never disrespect you like that!

446
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:10,333
- Oh, honey, wait.
- What?

447
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,428
You love me so much you got so jealous?

448
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:15,549
- Oh, honey...
- Good!

449
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:21,993
Aw. They found a way to make it worse
for themselves without my help.

450
00:27:21,994 --> 00:27:25,114
Changing me was great.

451
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:42,780
My cousins! Where did they go?

452
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:45,802
Oh, no. Harper, do you think my bad side

453
00:27:45,803 --> 00:27:48,144
could've done something
terrible to my parents?

454
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:52,285
Hmm, let's see. All of your bad
is concentrated into one you.

455
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:58,186
- Do you want to finish where that's going?
- I get it, I did it.

456
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:04,225
Where are we?

457
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:07,204
Dad. You're not going to like this.

458
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:11,750
Oh, it's just Alex. Thank you
for cleaning me up, Mija.

459
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,585
Now, get me out of here. It's stuffy.

460
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:19,290
What's your hurry? Handsome
vineyard guy waiting for you?

461
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,766
What are you talking about?

462
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,887
You're the one who had to prove what a big
macho man you were with your cold cuts.

463
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:28,720
Yeah-ha! They're delicious!

464
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:31,485
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I can't
concentrate on the evil

465
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:34,539
plan we have going here if you
two are flappin' your yappers.

466
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,548
Evil plan?

467
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,835
You remember when I said, "you're
not going to like this?"

468
00:28:37,836 --> 00:28:40,544
This is what I was talking about.

469
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:42,945
Who's "we?"

470
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:46,688
Excellent, Alex.

471
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:49,524
Hello, Russo's.

472
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:55,425
Hey, it's that guy. Hey, did you ever
remember that message from Justin?

473
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:06,319
Just as I thought.

474
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:10,893
Alex! You don't have to do this.

475
00:29:11,313 --> 00:29:12,861
So, what's next?

476
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:18,762
How would my partner like a little
road trip to the Tower of Pisa?

477
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:27,239
Dominic is evil?

478
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,310
Is it weird he's even more attractive now?

479
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:37,211
- Harper. He took my family.
- Oh yeah, right. I won't date him.

480
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,518
Even as a young wizard I knew
that some day my dreams...

481
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,754
Though disturbing, would come true.

482
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:52,759
And so, from this high vantage point, we
will launch the final steps to my plan

483
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,428
to rid the world of mortals and then...

484
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:59,442
You know, it's really kind
of killer on the calves.

485
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:02,564
That's a nice story, can we
get to what this thing does?

486
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:05,565
Right. This device...

487
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:07,573
Replicates spells.

488
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:11,307
Once energized with
sufficient wizard power,

489
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:14,656
it will cast a spell
repeatedly across Earth.

490
00:30:14,657 --> 00:30:18,857
I call it the "Dominic One Thousand".

491
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:21,745
Is that too self-centered?

492
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:24,513
You're asking the wrong girl.

493
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:27,937
I designed the Dominic One
Thousand to imprison every mortal,

494
00:30:27,938 --> 00:30:32,162
thereby paving the way for a new
Wizard World that I will rule.

495
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,610
- Uh, that last part again?
- That we will rule.

496
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:40,715
All that is needed is a spell cast by our
generation's most powerful wizard...

497
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,517
Alex Russo.

498
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:45,320
All right. Well, then let me at it.

499
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:49,631
No offense, you're just a knock-off.
You don't have all of her powers.

500
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:54,329
I have enough powers to scorch a hole
in your little purple jacket there.

501
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,063
Point taken.

502
00:30:56,064 --> 00:31:00,408
All right. So, what if your "all
powerful" Alex doesn't come?

503
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:03,289
Oh, she'll come...

504
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:08,113
To save her family.

505
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:15,178
Wait, wait, wait. I'm confused.
Are we tiny or are they giants?

506
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,914
So if it's called the Leaning Tower
of Pisa, where is all the pizza?

507
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,835
What?

508
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:31,955
Alex, you need to come up with a plan.

509
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,511
I'm not good with heights.

510
00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:37,115
Or substandard architecture.

511
00:31:37,116 --> 00:31:40,697
You're fine, Harper. Just don't
look down, it'll make you dizzy.

512
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,957
Oh, Too late. Dizzy. Going down.

513
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,418
Wait, Harper!

514
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,044
Oh. All right then. Ha ha.

515
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,214
So, this is the top of the Tower of Pisa.

516
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,983
Woo. Would you check out that view.

517
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:02,089
That is breathtaking. My
breath has been taken...

518
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,772
- From my lungs.
- I know, right?

519
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:05,701
- We should post this on Wiz-agram.
- We should.

520
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:10,802
- Can you take a picture?
- Yeah, let's do that.

521
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,631
Ready? Say, "cheese".

522
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,632
- Harper, run!
- Ah!

523
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,674
Yes.

524
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,335
Harper has joined your family in captivity.

525
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:28,145
- You let them go right now or I'll...
- You'll what?

526
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,014
Don't forget, I have all the bad.

527
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,417
Yeah, well...

528
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,552
I look really cute in that outfit.

529
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,222
I know. I wasn't really sure
about the boots at first but...

530
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,457
Focus on the mission.

531
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,263
Yeah, I heard all about your mission.

532
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,887
Clear out the mortal world so that you
can make room to rule all evil wizards.

533
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:49,429
Good. You're up to speed.
Now, for that spell...

534
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,460
- Never.
- Why would you underestimate me, Alex?

535
00:32:53,461 --> 00:32:56,673
Perhaps you remember my
very determined uncle.

536
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,209
- He had wings.
- Gorog.

537
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,046
I came to finish what
you took from my uncle.

538
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,381
But where he failed, I will succeed.

539
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,883
My own wizard empire right here on Earth!

540
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:11,024
Ow! Why are these stupid bells here!

541
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:15,043
Maybe to knock some sense into you
because I'm never doing that spell.

542
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:17,861
My family is more important than anything.

543
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,869
Now give me the bracelet.

544
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,425
You're so stubborn with that spell.

545
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:28,246
Perhaps if I fill up one more
charm, it will convince you.

546
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:32,676
Mason!

547
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,477
No!

548
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,718
Mason. You're ok.

549
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,936
Get tired of Dominic already?

550
00:33:43,937 --> 00:33:46,172
What? I don't care about him.

551
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:51,634
He's some crazy wizard who's weaving some
sort of wicked web to take over the world.

552
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,035
Well, you're some kind of
wicked web weaver yourself.

553
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,637
What are you talking about?

554
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,488
I saw you at the Villa with Dominic,
you two looked quite chummy.

555
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:01,719
No. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

556
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,789
Dominic tricked me into
casting out my bad side.

557
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,333
That's who you saw. There's
another me walking around.

558
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:12,253
And I have to get you out of here
before she finds you. Let's go.

559
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:15,588
I knew I wasted time with that hug.

560
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:17,869
- Two Alex's?
- Mason, get away from her.

561
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,538
She's with Dominic, and they're
trying to take over the world.

562
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:23,783
Nice try, me. Mason, she's the bad one.
Let's go.

563
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:29,684
No! Don't listen to her. I'm the good one.
She's the bad one.

564
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:33,518
Well, isn't this a sticky wicket.

565
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,783
Mason, please believe me.

566
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,750
She's trying to trick you.

567
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:41,831
She doesn't even know how I dress.

568
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:45,329
That is something Harper would wear.

569
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,432
No, no, no, no. I'm wearing it
because Harper asked me to.

570
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:52,633
Ok, that doesn't even sound like me.

571
00:34:57,142 --> 00:35:00,210
Thank goodness. I hope you and Dominic rot.

572
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:02,491
Mason, no!

573
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:16,994
- Where are we?
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa.

574
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:19,815
Oh. Very romantic.

575
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:22,398
I think so.

576
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,400
Dominic.

577
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:30,073
Oh, no.

578
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:34,754
Aw. You picked the wrong Alex.

579
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,376
Oh. Now, this is what I call a
"take over the world" look.

580
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:45,897
As for you...

581
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:52,049
Max, who joined us over there?

582
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,810
Hey, it's Mason.

583
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:05,619
What have I done? I can't even
"grow up" when I try to grow up.

584
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,002
I don't even deserve to
be The Family Wizard.

585
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,403
Justin does.

586
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:15,465
And he'd know what to do.

587
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:18,047
Beep, beep, boop, beep, beep...

588
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,488
Professor Justin Vincenzo Pepe Russo is...

589
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:43,502
People should appreciate
you for who you are,

590
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:47,122
not for what they think you should be.

591
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:49,542
Harper's right.

592
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:53,446
Everybody should just get over it.

593
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:56,049
I'm not perfect, I'm just...

594
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,751
A wizard who has to save the world, again.

595
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,612
Ugh!

596
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:08,712
Ok, Dominic wants a spell?

597
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,686
I'll give him a spell...

598
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:15,587
With a little bit of a surprise.

599
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:24,977
Ok, I'm here to get my family back.
Let's do this.

600
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:26,412
Excellent.

601
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:31,693
Aw, she's here to save the family.
How sweet. Ugh.

602
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:36,829
Dominic, give me the bracelet, and
I'll do the spell for your machine.

603
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,070
Agreed. Give it to her.

604
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:43,347
Wait...

605
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:44,797
I know me.

606
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:48,433
We'll give her the bracelet and she'll
flash out without doing the spell.

607
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:52,128
Right. Spell first then the bracelet.

608
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:54,807
Nice try, but I know me, too.

609
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:57,710
I'll do the spell and you'll
keep my family anyway.

610
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:59,290
No bracelet, no spell.

611
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,341
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

612
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:03,158
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

613
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,835
- Spell first!
- Not doing anything...

614
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:06,919
Spell first! Spell first!

615
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,080
Stop it!

616
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:13,123
Tower of Pisa that hurt!

617
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:18,603
Alex will cast the spell at the same time
Bad Alex gives you the bracelet, agreed?

618
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:24,337
- That's a good idea.
- Well, why didn't you think of it first?

619
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:27,917
One wave, two waves, three waves, four.

620
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:31,218
Every mortal be no more.

621
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:41,935
Excellent. The world will now
be wiped clean of mortals.

622
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:46,483
Ow! And then we wipe it clean of bells.

623
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:06,608
Was this how you wanted it to work?

624
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:10,310
Ok, the Leaning Tower of Pisa may
not have been the ideal place

625
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:14,425
for my Dominic One Thousand,
but it's working.

626
00:39:14,426 --> 00:39:18,501
Every mortal will be
imprisoned in these beads.

627
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:21,938
Are you sure you don't want
a bucket or something?

628
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:24,939
The bracelet, please.

629
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:29,895
You know, Alex, now is the time to join us.

630
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:33,804
With your powers, we can rule
more than just this world.

631
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,644
Thank you for remembering
I'm a powerful wizard.

632
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:39,993
Powerful enough that I can
undo any spell I create.

633
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:40,998
No!

634
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:45,739
The mortals who were
gone before, can now...

635
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:53,083
What are you doing? I was
about to fix everything

636
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:55,252
before you guys swirled me out of there.

637
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:56,759
Well, if you're looking
for someone to blame,

638
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,823
you can just point your
fingers at yourself.

639
00:39:59,824 --> 00:40:01,225
If you had fingers, I mean.

640
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:04,463
- Told you it was too soon.
- It wouldn't have mattered.

641
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:06,345
She's obviously stalling.

642
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:09,833
Don't you understand? The spell
replicator is still capturing mortals.

643
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:15,039
You have to let me go, so I
can save the world, again.

644
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,880
There he is! Grab him, get him!

645
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,235
Dominic, the Crystals of Justice recognize

646
00:40:23,236 --> 00:40:25,615
you as an esteemed member of WizTech.

647
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:27,450
Do you have any testimony?

648
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:29,500
I most certainly do.

649
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:33,949
Alex Russo had no intention
to undo her spell.

650
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,083
She is a powerful, but selfish wizard.

651
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:38,976
Why does everybody keep saying that?

652
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:43,152
So powerful that she put me under her
spell to take the blame for her crime.

653
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:44,962
Spell?! He's lying!

654
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:48,966
You need look no further than the fact that
she extracted her own evil personality

655
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:52,737
and cast the spell into
the Dominic One Thous...

656
00:40:52,738 --> 00:40:55,558
Alex One Thousand.

657
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:58,115
That's what she called it.

658
00:40:58,116 --> 00:41:00,321
Alex Russo, do you deny this?

659
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:03,028
He's twisting things. He set me up.

660
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:04,385
Silence!

661
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:07,020
The evidence against you is overwhelming.

662
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:11,024
After careful deliberation,
we, the Crystals of Justice,

663
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:16,925
find you guilty as charged and
sentence you to no dessert for a week!

664
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:18,798
Oh.

665
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:21,267
Well, that's not that bad.

666
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:24,904
Oh, no, sorry. I was reading
the wrong subsection.

667
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:26,488
It's actually death.

668
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:29,240
Death by chocolate?

669
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:32,181
No! Death by death!

670
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,716
What?! No! It's Dominic you want, not me!

671
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:40,407
You will be incarcerated until
your sentence is carried out.

672
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:43,723
Wait! No! Please! You have to believe me!

673
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:48,164
I didn't do anything! He has my family!

674
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:57,195
I hope you got a last glimpse of
Alex before she meets her end.

675
00:41:57,196 --> 00:41:59,649
You won't get away with this!

676
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,485
Already have.

677
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:04,386
You have a girl's bracelet on!

678
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:07,402
No! It's a uni-bracelet.

679
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:10,466
Dominic, if you had a spine,
you'd let me out of here,

680
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:15,367
so you and I can settle
this like gentlemen.

681
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:28,718
This just in, it's been reported
that people around the world

682
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:31,386
have been mysteriously disappearing.

683
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:35,407
As of now, there is no official...

684
00:42:42,506 --> 00:42:44,426
Uh...

685
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:47,439
In other news, the people of
the world are becoming...

686
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,980
This is bad. We should eat.

687
00:42:57,789 --> 00:42:59,889
Why did I choose the Tower of Pisa?

688
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,603
I'm wondering the same thing, dude.

689
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:05,598
Nonetheless, Alex is now doomed.

690
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,499
And best of all, her loved ones had
a front row seat to her conviction.

691
00:43:12,504 --> 00:43:16,824
Dominic, one of those charms is broken.

692
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:21,154
- Mason.
- Yep.

693
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:32,477
This is ridiculous. I've got
to try to get out of here.

694
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:34,938
Hello! Hello!

695
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:43,719
I'm going to use magic to blow this
door down, so you better stand back.

696
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,590
And let me apologize in
advance for the mess I make.

697
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,411
I am really nice.

698
00:43:55,222 --> 00:43:59,182
Double-Decker bus, that was close!

699
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:02,351
Mason, I'm so glad you're here.

700
00:44:02,352 --> 00:44:04,622
Look, I just want to say
I'm so sorry for ruining

701
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:06,947
your picnic and being
selfish and immature...

702
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:10,647
Alex, there's no time for that now. You
must save humanity from Dominic and...

703
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,829
Well, you.

704
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,442
But I can't. I can't get out.
This dungeon is magic-proof.

705
00:44:16,443 --> 00:44:21,723
Well, then, let's find out
if it's Werewolf-proof.

706
00:44:34,209 --> 00:44:35,376
Thank you.

707
00:44:35,377 --> 00:44:38,446
If you're really grateful,
you'd scratch behind my ears.

708
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:40,515
Oh. That's the spot. All right.

709
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:42,350
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh.

710
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:46,287
And more people are mysteriously
disappearing around the globe.

711
00:44:46,288 --> 00:44:52,188
The government asks that everyone
remain calm and in there houses.

712
00:44:53,295 --> 00:44:55,020
And now for the sports.

713
00:44:55,021 --> 00:45:00,541
Antonio, por favor tell all
the workers to come inside.

714
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:05,368
Eh!

715
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:11,688
Tall, skinny guy, girl in a
bikini, Italian newscaster...

716
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,336
Ryan Gosling?

717
00:45:18,653 --> 00:45:23,299
Hey, guys. Don't mind me, I just
dropped by to give myself a beat down.

718
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,611
Alex?! How did you get out?

719
00:45:26,612 --> 00:45:29,075
Take a guess.

720
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:30,266
Dominic, it's over.

721
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:34,936
You're not gonna take over the world
because I'm here to save it, again.

722
00:45:34,937 --> 00:45:38,025
You're not going to be
able to save it this time.

723
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,246
Oh, yeah?

724
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,677
- Here...
- No, I got it. I got it.

725
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:50,038
You're ruining my moment.

726
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:05,338
Get her out of here before
she stops the replicator!

727
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:06,878
I'm not going anywhere.

728
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:11,658
You will to protect your family...
and your home.

729
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:13,976
Oh, no. Mason, I'll be right back.

730
00:46:13,977 --> 00:46:19,617
No worries, love. I'll just
stay here and have a snack.

731
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:24,868
What am I up to?

732
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:30,269
It's kind of hard chasing
me without my sneaky side.

733
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:44,731
Oh, I wish I could just rest here.

734
00:46:53,531 --> 00:46:59,431
Ok, maybe I don't care about the kitchen,
but now you've messed with my couch.

735
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:13,531
- That's weird, right?
- It's really weird.

736
00:47:20,928 --> 00:47:22,788
Hey!

737
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:26,233
You are a very ugly side of
me and it is time to go.

738
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:28,154
Sure.

739
00:47:29,845 --> 00:47:34,285
Oh! Why didn't I see myself doing that?

740
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,322
Watch out for the bars.

741
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:45,403
Don't get cute. I'm the cute one.

742
00:47:56,604 --> 00:48:00,024
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

743
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:09,581
You're right. This is fun.

744
00:48:54,762 --> 00:48:57,462
Psst. Over here.

745
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:08,580
I didn't think it'd be that
hard to kick my own butt.

746
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,420
Always underestimating me.

747
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:37,096
Mason! Mason, wake up! I'm so sorry.

748
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:40,903
- What did you do?
- I put your dog down.

749
00:49:40,904 --> 00:49:43,784
This is for Mason.

750
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:46,026
Guess who?

751
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:49,447
I'm back? Darn I'm good.

752
00:49:49,713 --> 00:49:51,873
Drop it.

753
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:57,324
And I'll take the bracelet.

754
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,510
Oh. Finish her.

755
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,810
Ok, that definitely got rid of me.

756
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:22,650
I think.

757
00:50:22,651 --> 00:50:26,512
All right. Now time to get rid of this.

758
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:28,329
Alex!

759
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,945
Don't you think your time would be
better served saving your family?

760
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:36,386
Hey, I think I can see Tokyo from here.

761
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:55,802
Are you guys all right?

762
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,196
- Yeah, we're ok.
- Good job Mija.

763
00:50:57,197 --> 00:51:00,321
Got a little steamy in my bead.

764
00:51:00,322 --> 00:51:05,122
Clearly I can't defeat
the great Alex Russo.

765
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:09,459
But think of the world I am creating.

766
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,980
It needs you.

767
00:51:14,307 --> 00:51:16,707
I need you.

768
00:51:24,967 --> 00:51:28,836
No surprise. You all
knew I did not like him.

769
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:32,917
Mason! I was so scared I lost you.

770
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:37,478
Mason! I was so scared I lost you.

771
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:43,379
Ugh. Wouldn't it be nice if I was
this determined in everyday stuff?

772
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:45,586
Haven't we had enough of this?

773
00:51:45,587 --> 00:51:48,085
Can we just call it a day
and get back together.

774
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:53,986
No way. Dominic went bye-bye, so that
leaves more room at the top for just me.

775
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:59,706
And thanks to this, I'm going
to take over the world.

776
00:51:59,707 --> 00:52:02,587
You're really bad.

777
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:06,828
I have no choice.

778
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:09,046
Oh. Just as I thought.

779
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:12,587
Too good for your own good.

780
00:52:14,018 --> 00:52:17,233
No one wins if we both lose everything.

781
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:21,134
What do you mean lose everything?

782
00:52:23,027 --> 00:52:25,829
By all my power is to go.

783
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,328
- No. No, no, no. You can't!
- Alex, what are you doing?

784
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:31,386
She's casting the spell
to cancel all her powers.

785
00:52:31,387 --> 00:52:35,351
A wizard's essence, spirit and soul
will be nothing but a lump of coal.

786
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,243
- Alex, stop! Don't do it!
- Honey, don't do it!

787
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:43,144
By all the power vested in me my power
be wrested out and forever free.

788
00:53:06,573 --> 00:53:08,733
Alex Russo...

789
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:13,118
Once again, you've shown immense
bravery in saving the world.

790
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,421
Consequently, your guilty
verdict is hereby overturned.

791
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:19,956
Ha! All right.

792
00:53:19,957 --> 00:53:23,095
However, we cannot ignore
the fact that this,

793
00:53:23,096 --> 00:53:25,192
as in every time in the past,

794
00:53:25,193 --> 00:53:28,033
you were involved in bringing the
world to the brink of disaster.

795
00:53:28,034 --> 00:53:32,871
Oh, come on. This was a good moment.
We don't need to dig up the past.

796
00:53:32,872 --> 00:53:37,682
How about you just give me my magic back,
and we can all go home with a warm feeling?

797
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:40,211
We have been patient, but
you have failed to show the

798
00:53:40,212 --> 00:53:43,949
maturity and responsibility needed
to handle being The Family Wizard.

799
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:47,219
Therefore, we have decided that it is in
the best interest of the Wizard World

800
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,747
that your powers not be reinstated.

801
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:54,026
Wait. Wait, please. I've been
trying to help her grow up.

802
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:58,347
Just give her another chance to change.

803
00:53:59,065 --> 00:54:00,865
No.

804
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:07,627
I'm tired of everybody wanting
me to grow up, or to change.

805
00:54:07,628 --> 00:54:10,649
Or to not be selfish.

806
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,790
No one is happy for just who I am.

807
00:54:14,883 --> 00:54:18,003
Except for one person.

808
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:22,106
This is so embarrassing.
She's talking about me.

809
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:24,147
Harper.

810
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:29,717
I'm sorry, dude. I thought
she was gonna say you.

811
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,510
You're the only one that
accepts me with all my flaws.

812
00:54:38,511 --> 00:54:41,714
And I know that I have a lot of them.

813
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:43,793
And even though that there have been times

814
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:47,280
where you wanted me to
change and I didn't...

815
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:50,521
You stood by me anyway.

816
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:55,594
So it's ok if you don't give me my magic.

817
00:54:55,595 --> 00:54:58,272
My best friend Harper is my magic.

818
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:00,493
Oh, Alex.

819
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,506
I am so proud of you, honey.

820
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:10,041
Even though you don't have your powers,

821
00:55:10,042 --> 00:55:13,702
you still deserve to be The Family Wizard.

822
00:55:13,703 --> 00:55:15,623
Here.

823
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:21,301
All right. Let's go home.

824
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:23,740
Perhaps...

825
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:28,360
The appreciation you have for
others is in itself very mature.

826
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:32,468
It seems you have other qualities
that can make a great Family Wizard.

827
00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:34,558
I don't like where this is going.

828
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,712
There still may be hope
for you, Alex Russo.

829
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:41,373
We grant you one more chance.

830
00:55:57,524 --> 00:56:00,293
I have my magic back.

831
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:02,528
Thank you.

832
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:06,909
I'll see you the next time I mess up.

833
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:13,178
Carmela, grazie for this
beautiful family reunion.

834
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:16,452
Please come visit us anytime.

835
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:18,793
Except you.

836
00:56:20,692 --> 00:56:25,072
Can I come back and visit you sometime?

837
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:31,464
"Stupido". I'm wearing her down.

838
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:38,264
Alex, before you go, please give
some advice to Bianca and Gino.

839
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:42,034
- They're our wizards in training.
- Mmm. Yep.

840
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:46,339
All right. Look, guys, there's gonna
be a lot of work ahead of you.

841
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,825
And it won't really be easy.

842
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:53,019
And one day, only one of you will
get to become The Family Wizard,

843
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:56,940
but until then, the most important
thing to remember is...

844
00:56:56,941 --> 00:57:02,161
Have as much ridiculous fun
with magic as you can.

845
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:09,195
All right. Guys, this has been a great
trip but there's no place like home.

846
00:57:09,196 --> 00:57:11,476
Let's go.

847
00:57:11,489 --> 00:57:14,267
Uh, hang on, Harper.

848
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:17,603
What happened in here?! The kitchen!
My couch!

849
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:19,428
Alex!

850
00:57:19,429 --> 00:57:23,929
I think we should stay in Italy for a while.

851
00:57:24,665 --> 00:57:26,705
Action!

852
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:30,687
You say, "here we go".

853
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:31,755
What?

854
00:57:31,756 --> 00:57:33,824
- You say, "oh, here we go".
- Oh.

855
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,865
Action!

856
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:38,801
Action!

857
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,342
Action!

858
00:57:41,343 --> 00:57:44,161
I still don't like the way we got here.

859
00:57:44,162 --> 00:57:47,402
But they're feeding us.

860
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:55,843
Your own personal drive-in?!

861
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,208
What? What did I do?

862
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:01,478
Come on, dad. I-I... I spit popcorn.
I'm sorry. Ok.

863
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:05,415
I don't know how to say wizard...

864
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:09,152
I got an invitation from
my cousin, Carmela,

865
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:13,413
in Italy, inviting us to a re-usso...

866
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:15,292
Russo.

867
00:58:15,293 --> 00:58:21,113
I got an invitation in Italy
for a re-usso family reunion.

868
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:28,205
A while ago, I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela, in Italy...

869
00:58:28,206 --> 00:58:32,175
I got an invitation from
my cousin, Carmela,

870
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,512
in Italy, inviting us to a re-usso...

871
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,679
I'm not doing it!
