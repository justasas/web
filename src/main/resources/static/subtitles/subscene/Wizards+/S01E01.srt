1
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:12,493
<i>Edgebono utoosis.</i>

2
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,694
Good. Thank you, Justin.

3
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:19,095
That is how you execute
the duplication spell properly.

4
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:21,616
Real rabbit. Duplicate rab... No.

5
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:23,497
Duplicate rabbit, real...

6
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,417
It's... Anyway, there's two now.

7
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:28,779
What's the big deal? They're rabbits.

8
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:32,140
Wait five minutes
and they'll duplicate by themselves.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,101
Remember, as with any spell,

10
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:36,742
if you don't concentrate,
it doesn't come out exactly right.

11
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,663
Cool. I've always wanted a guard rabbit.

12
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:44,585
You know, scare off the mailman.

13
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:48,905
I was thinking about dogs
when I cast the spell.

14
00:00:49,587 --> 00:00:51,907
Now, are there any questions
about the spell?

15
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,990
Anyone who doesn't look
like they're about to wreck their pants?

16
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,351
- The Crazy Ten-Minute Sale!
- The crazy what?

17
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,393
Every year this cool clothing store,
Suburban Outfitters,

18
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:08,233
has this crazy sale for ten minutes

19
00:01:08,393 --> 00:01:10,833
where they practically give stuff away
and...

20
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:14,755
- What are you doing?
- Fast-forwarding to the part

21
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,397
where this sale is more important
than the magic lesson.

22
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,597
- Well, Gigi's gonna be there.
- Who's Gigi?

23
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:21,718
Don't you remember?
My enemy since kindergarten,

24
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:24,358
when she spilled juice on my mat
during nap time

25
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,240
and told everyone I had an accident.

26
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,480
This is fascinating.

27
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:29,920
Tell me more.

28
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:34,002
Well, I'm sick of Gigi.
She's always rubbing stuff in my face.

29
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:38,083
The point is, I'm tired of her
always showing me up at school.

30
00:01:38,404 --> 00:01:41,005
Can I please skip class on Thursday
to go to the sale?

31
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,246
Let's roll the answer dice, shall we?

32
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:46,606
No. Come on.

33
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:48,887
- But, Dad...
- But nothing.

34
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:51,608
Look, you have wizard training
on Tuesdays and Thursdays

35
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:52,889
and you're not ditching.

36
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,410
You're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna totally focus on the magic.

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,251
I have a question about the spell.

38
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,691
Thank you.

39
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:02,332
How do I use it
to get cool clothes before Gigi?

40
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:05,876
Are you as excited about
the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale as I am?

41
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:08,876
I can't go.

42
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:12,518
But I drew up a game plan so we
could get into the store before Gigi.

43
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:16,199
I thought we agreed that we hate Gigi
so much we'd never say her name.

44
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,799
But you just said "Gigi."

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,081
Okay, from now on
we'll say her name backwards.

46
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:23,682
But "Gigi" backwards is still "Gigi."

47
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:28,163
That's right. We'll say "Gigi"
but only we'll know it's backwards.

48
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,924
It'll be hilarious.

49
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:33,165
I like it. Anyway, do you remember

50
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,806
that one-of-a-kind jacket
in the window you've been wanting?

51
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,407
It's gonna be in the sale.

52
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,607
It all sounds good, but I can't go.

53
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:42,128
It's on Thursday.
I have a family commitment.

54
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,409
Do you also have a commitment

55
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,730
to letting Gigi run all over you
for the rest of your life?

56
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,571
Great.
Here she comes with her copycat crew.

57
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,132
Act like we don't care.

58
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:02,056
<i>Bonjour, Alex.</i>

59
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:03,776
<i>Bonjour, Alex's friend.</i>

60
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:06,777
Nice shoes.

61
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:10,498
I mean,
I don't care about you or your shoes.

62
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:13,620
Yeah, I've had these shoes
for about a week.

63
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,300
Oh, I mean, I'd give them to you,

64
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,901
but I already promised them
to another charity.

65
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:21,782
No, you should keep them.
They go so well with your eyebrow.

66
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,823
Well, at least I don't have man hands.

67
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:26,544
I mean, how do you get those meat stubs
through your sleeves?

68
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:28,544
What happened to you two?

69
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:30,825
Pick your noses so hard they fell off?

70
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,986
They got nose jobs.

71
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,668
When they heal,
they'll be just like Gigi's.

72
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:40,109
When is Gigi's gonna heal?

73
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,550
People always take shots
at the trendsetter.

74
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,991
And by the way, I saw you looking
at that jacket at Suburban Outfitters.

75
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,032
And good for you
for knowing you need a new one.

76
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:56,875
But it's mine.
And it'll look so much better on me.

77
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,355
Not if I get it first.

78
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:01,197
Well, good luck finding it.
I already went down there and hid it.

79
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,278
Hey, that's not in the spirit
of the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale.

80
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:06,318
Yeah! Whatever.

81
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,600
Come on, girls.
Time to change your gauze.

82
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,520
Look! Alex had an accident again!

83
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:18,963
Gigi, this is silly.

84
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:20,404
How long is this gonna go on?

85
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:22,404
We've been fighting with each other
forever.

86
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:25,165
Fighting? Really? Let's see.

87
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,846
I've won, like, 300 times
and you've won none.

88
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:30,087
So it's not really a fight.

89
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,209
She has won an awful lot.

90
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:38,570
That's it. We're going to that sale
and I'm gonna show her up.

91
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,171
But I thought you had a commitment.

92
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:41,931
I'll work it out with my parents.

93
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,932
Sure, they're pretty understanding.

94
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:47,093
No, I'm just really sneaky.

95
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:55,176
Honey? Honey?

96
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:57,376
Listen.
So I need you to back me up on this.

97
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:02,058
I told Alex she couldn't miss wizard class
to go to some crazy sale on Thursday.

98
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:03,699
Okay. Wait.

99
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:05,339
Do you mean
the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale?

100
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,180
That's the one.

101
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,862
Thank you for reminding me.
I almost forgot.

102
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:13,102
It doesn't sound
like you're gonna back me up on this.

103
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:15,663
Don't worry, I am.

104
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,904
Who's not allowed to go again?

105
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:20,785
- Alex.
- Right.

106
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:22,626
Wizard mail's here.

107
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:26,387
<i>Oh, Wizards Weekly. Let's see
if they printed my letter to the editor.</i>

108
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,032
I wish they'd take those out for people
who already have subscriptions.

109
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:42,473
My wand didn't show up.

110
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,714
That's bunk.

111
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:48,075
I need my magic wand
so I don't have to learn spells anymore.

112
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:51,356
Max, you're always gonna need
to know spells.

113
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:54,637
Look, if I give you a bike,
that doesn't mean you know how to ride it.

114
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,879
Awesome. I'm getting a bike?

115
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:00,559
Look, I know how excited you are
about getting your first wand.

116
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:05,201
So until it comes, how about using
old Black Liquorice here?

117
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:09,842
Yeah, that looks like something
you get out of a cereal box.

118
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,685
Come on.
This is a 77 Wandwarp Featherlight.

119
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:15,525
They don't even make these anymore.

120
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,445
I can see why.

121
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:22,207
Look, if you're not gonna take care of it,
then I'm not gonna give it to you.

122
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,088
It has tremendous sentimental value.

123
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:27,369
This is the wand that helped me
get the goblins out of the basement

124
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,809
when I was your age.

125
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:33,011
And it's a tremendous back scratcher.
See?

126
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:34,532
Cool.

127
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:36,572
It's a little dinged up, but...

128
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:39,413
You can see where I filled it in
with black nail polish.

129
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:42,214
There's a lot of great memories
wrapped up in this wand.

130
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,535
And a lot of stories I'm tired of hearing.

131
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,817
She said it, we didn't.

132
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,020
- How do I look?
- Why?

133
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,700
Because I'm going to duplicate myself.

134
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,861
And if I look ugly,
I don't wanna look twice as ugly.

135
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,343
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:07,103
I'm talking about taking Gigi down

137
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:09,504
and it's gonna take more than one of me
to do it.

138
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:12,386
<i>Edgebono utoosis.</i>

139
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,667
Now that's cool.

140
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:21,748
I wanna make two of me
so I can give myself a wedgie.

141
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,510
Why would you wanna do that?

142
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,111
Because I wanna see what it feels like,
but I wanna get it from someone I trust.

143
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,913
Afternoon, Alex. Other Alex.

144
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,913
You're both clearly up to no good.

145
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:38,874
Max, just help me get me ready
so it looks like I'm here so I can leave.

146
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:47,839
Wow, I did a great job.

147
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,919
I look good.

148
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,041
I was thinking
about your stupid barking rabbit.

149
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,682
Yep, it's perfect, because that's
what I hear when you talk to me.

150
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:02,323
Bad girl. No barking, just pout.

151
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:04,964
Yeah, I don't see
how this could possibly go wrong.

152
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:08,325
It'll be fine.
The real me is upset with Dad,

153
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:10,606
which means I pout
and give him the silent treatment.

154
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:12,007
Yeah, but for how long?

155
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:15,008
Well, this has to pout
for the Ten-Minute Sale plus travel time,

156
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:18,329
which shouldn't be a problem,
because my pout record is, like, four days.

157
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,131
- Hello?
- Alex, are you sneaking away or not?

158
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:27,212
The doors are gonna open any minute
and Gigi's already in the front.

159
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:28,693
How did she get up front?

160
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,453
I don't know, but she's telling everybody
you shop in pre-teen.

161
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:35,135
Which I said wasn't a slam, because a lot
of their stuff is really, really cute.

162
00:09:35,294 --> 00:09:37,856
Like my sunflower top
that goes with my rainbow socks.

163
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:39,897
I'll be right there.

164
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:41,778
Wait, you're not wearing that, are you?

165
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:45,739
No.

166
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:49,460
You really think Dad'll be fooled
with this thing sitting here

167
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,542
with that glassy look in its eye,
totally disconnected during class?

168
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,383
Wow, you're right. This could work.

169
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,263
What if Dad asks you
to change seats or something?

170
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:00,745
I don't know, cover for me.

171
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:02,545
Why would I cover for you?

172
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:04,745
Because I'll buy you
a brand new pair of sneakers.

173
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,466
Sold.

174
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:07,906
Good boy. I'm off to the sale.

175
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:10,028
And Mom and Dad know nothing
about that, right?

176
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:13,309
I'm a size 5.

177
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,070
That's your price?
A new pair of sneakers?

178
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,551
Apparently.

179
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,631
But the joke's on her.

180
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:23,152
I'm gonna get some new sneakers
for doing nothing.

181
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:25,513
What are you gonna do
when she falls over?

182
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,314
That will never happen.

183
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,596
You're right. It'll never happen.

184
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:38,797
Hi, Harper.

185
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:39,958
Hi, Alex's mom.

186
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,679
Oh, my gosh, Alex's mom?

187
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,520
I know it's weird
for a grownup to be here,

188
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,601
but since Alex couldn't come,
I'm gonna get something for her.

189
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:50,802
Well, this will be fun.

190
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:53,764
It's a chance for you and me
to spend some time together, you know?

191
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,603
Chill.

192
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,570
Excuse me. There you are.

193
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,330
How did you find me
with all these people?

194
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,851
I saw your rainbow socks
from down the block.

195
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,212
Sorry I'm late.
It took a while to ditch the family.

196
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:21,173
Well, you didn't do a very good job.
Your mom's here.

197
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,453
- What?
- Relax.

198
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:24,854
I sent her down the block
to find some tappuccinos.

199
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:27,015
There's no such thing
as a tappuccino.

200
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:29,176
I know.

201
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:30,977
Wow, I'm impressed.

202
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,777
You're becoming more like me
every day.

203
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,459
- Okay, move.
- Sorry.

204
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,019
Excuse me. Sorry.

205
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:39,779
Excuse me.

206
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,621
Nice try, Gigi. But it looks like
I got in the front of the line too.

207
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:46,942
Well, I know where the jacket is
and you don't.

208
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:49,304
What's that?
You're looking for a racket?

209
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:52,945
Well, I'm looking for a jacket.
And I'm gonna get it before you do.

210
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:56,265
I can't believe you brought your grandma.
She's not gonna help you get in first.

211
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,466
She's not my grandma.
I found her at the park.

212
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:00,507
She's here to block.

213
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,352
Where is it? It was right here.

214
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:14,432
Excuse me. There was a huge pile
of clothes right there.

215
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:16,352
Where is it?

216
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:20,074
Oh, we completely rearranged the store
for the sale,

217
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:23,235
because a lot of people
sneak in early and hide stuff.

218
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:26,957
It's not really in the spirit
of the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale.

219
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,038
It's anybody's jacket now.

220
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:33,720
Harper.

221
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Harper? I found our tappuccinos.

222
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,441
It's steamed milk and tap water.

223
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,724
She's too heavy.
Can you give me a hand?

224
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:47,685
Why don't you use Dad's wand
to move her?

225
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:50,005
I can't find it.

226
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:55,967
Either I just found Dad's wand
or I cracked my butt knuckle.

227
00:12:56,247 --> 00:13:00,809
I'm no doctor, but I'm fairly certain
there's no such thing as a butt knuckle.

228
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:04,570
No. No, no, no. Dad's gonna wig out.

229
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:07,691
You know, if I wasn't getting
new sneakers, I'd be really freaked out.

230
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:10,212
Oh, I'd be really freaked out anyway.

231
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,133
Justin, will you at least help me
prop her up?

232
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:15,094
Sure, because she's done
so much for me.

233
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,820
What are you doing?

234
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:36,382
Dancing.

235
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:37,541
With my sister.

236
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:42,384
<i>Practising for that new reality show,
Dancing with my Sister.</i>

237
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:47,066
Okay, guys, before we get started today,

238
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:50,946
I just wanna point out
the good example set by your sister.

239
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,387
She really wanted to go shopping,

240
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:54,909
but instead she's right here,
ready to learn.

241
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,510
I think we're all gonna learn something
real soon.

242
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,911
Alex, I'm very proud of you.

243
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,112
So proud that I'm gonna
give you permission

244
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:06,512
to miss today's lesson
and go to that sale.

245
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:08,513
So go ahead and have fun.

246
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:11,474
Seriously. Go.

247
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:17,356
Oh, I get it. You need money.

248
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:19,917
I'm sorry. Go ahead, take it. Take it.

249
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:22,639
Yeah, Alex. Take it.

250
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:34,722
Alex used the duplication spell
and went to the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale.

251
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:36,683
Wow, looks like she did.

252
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,205
This is way worse
than me breaking your wand, right?

253
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:40,765
You...?

254
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,126
Alex, wand. Alex, wand.

255
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,046
Alex!

256
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:51,889
Wow, he didn't even care
about the wand.

257
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:54,889
That would've been a good time to tell him
I broke his new drill.

258
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,210
You broke his drill?

259
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,171
I think so. I'll find out
when I put the pieces back together.

260
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:04,213
Check it out. My new eWand.

261
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,574
Oh, an eWand. The strap is for safety.

262
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,495
Good point.

263
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:13,536
Now that we've got safety out of the way,
let's rock.

264
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:19,898
Slippery.

265
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:23,860
Wow, they should make something
that attaches to the wand

266
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,541
so that doesn't happen.

267
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,743
Alex, hide.
Your mom's right behind me.

268
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,505
What?

269
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:39,185
Harper, there you are.

270
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:43,027
I found our tappuccinos.
They're surprisingly delicious.

271
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:51,270
I'm sorry. Let's go tell a manager.

272
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,431
Eight minutes left
in the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale.

273
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,632
Eight minutes.

274
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,192
Are you kidding me?

275
00:15:57,353 --> 00:15:59,753
I've only got eight minutes
to find something for Alex.

276
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:01,154
What do you think she'd like?

277
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:02,554
For you to leave.

278
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:04,235
What?

279
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:05,636
This is your size.

280
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,676
Go try it on.

281
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:10,597
Alex, are you okay?

282
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,518
I'm fine, I'm fine. Did my mom see me?

283
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,518
No, I sent her to the dressing room.
This is our chance. Let's get out.

284
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,039
Oh, no, no, no.
I am not leaving without that jacket.

285
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,000
I have choked on too many blouses
to let Gigi get that jacket.

286
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:22,401
Harper.

287
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:24,281
I'm going back in.

288
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:30,564
Hey, what else does this thing do?

289
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:31,845
Standard magic stuff.

290
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:37,446
It opens portals, disappears objects,
levitates things, and... Oh, my gosh.

291
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:40,608
- What?
- It's an MP3 player.

292
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:43,688
It holds a trillion songs.

293
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,009
No way.

294
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,610
Oh, and it says here
it has eMimic feature.

295
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:49,370
What's that?

296
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,372
I think I just found out.

297
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,773
Hey, Alex, why are you hitting yourself?

298
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,695
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

299
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:04,457
Why are you hitting yourself?

300
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,817
I don't know.

301
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:09,899
Oh, I know what you're doing.

302
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,619
We must be getting close to the jacket.

303
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,259
You're trying to distract me.

304
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:16,620
Are you hitting yourself?
You've got problems.

305
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:18,021
Good burn.

306
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:20,622
I know, I thought it and then I said it.

307
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,104
Well, what are you doing now?

308
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,104
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm dancing like a chicken.

309
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:31,186
I don't even know
why I try to embarrass you.

310
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:33,226
I mean, you're so good at it yourself.

311
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:38,428
I don't know what's happening.

312
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:42,590
I do. You're dancing like an Egyptian.

313
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,792
Hey, everyone,
there's a freak show by the jeans rack.

314
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:49,993
Hey, Alex, I think we caught a break.

315
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,474
There's some freak show by the jeans.
Let's go look.

316
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:57,716
Harper, those are the jeans.
I'm the freak show.

317
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,557
Faster. Faster. Let's see if it'll throw up.

318
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,121
- Size 7. Perfect. Thanks, Alex.
- Help me!

319
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:15,001
Theresa. Where's Alex?

320
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,522
Jerry, she's with you.

321
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:19,683
No, she's not. She cut class.
I came down here to look for her.

322
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:21,243
Well, I haven't seen her.

323
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:28,047
I think I just did.

324
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:32,768
Alex, stop spinning wildly out of control
and get over here.

325
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:34,809
I can't!

326
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,330
What do you think's going on?

327
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,690
I think Max got his new wand.

328
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,051
I found it. I found the jacket.

329
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,053
Hey, Gigi,
guess what's in my meat hands.

330
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:47,493
- Give me the jacket. Give it to me. Give...
- No.

331
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:57,617
Well, it looks like the tinklee
became the tinkler.

332
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,978
Oh, please.
Everybody saw her spill that on me.

333
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,219
Yeah, but it's on your front.

334
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:05,339
It does look like you went.

335
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,101
But what are you two talking about?
I mean, you just saw that.

336
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:12,942
Where are you going?

337
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:15,903
We have the same noses.

338
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:18,504
They're gone, Gigi. They left you.

339
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,184
Okay, maybe you're right.

340
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,066
This has been going on for too long.

341
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,426
No, it hasn't. I'm just getting good at it.

342
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:28,188
In fact, I think it's time
for a little announcement.

343
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,909
Okay, I know I'm in trouble.
But just, like, one second.

344
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,070
Attention, shoppers.
Attention, shoppers.

345
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,191
Gigi's real name is Gertude.

346
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,833
Okay, now I can go.

347
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:45,594
These sales get crazier and crazier
every year.

348
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,397
Oh, Alex. Dad's looking for you.

349
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:55,358
And he found you.

350
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,278
Did you get your wand today, Max?

351
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,040
Yeah.

352
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,680
Because whatever you were doing
to this dummy

353
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,321
was happening to this dummy.

354
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,802
Oh, that's what the "mimic"
in eMimic means.

355
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,643
I told you
we should've read the manual.

356
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:14,044
Max, you know better than to use magic
without my permission.

357
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:16,645
You're right, Dad. You're right.
It was pretty bad what I did.

358
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:21,247
But not as bad as Alex using magic
to cut class to go to some sale.

359
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:22,608
Yes, Max. Thank you.

360
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,848
And you and I by no means
are done talking about this.

361
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:29,290
I know. But before we get into it,
I think you should know,

362
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,850
I heard Justin broke your drill.

363
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,371
My brand new drill?

364
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,852
Max broke your wand.

365
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:39,173
- Did you use magic to break my drill?
- No.

366
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:42,175
You're clear. Go.

367
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:44,815
Did you use magic to break my wand?

368
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:46,856
No, I sat on it.

369
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,177
You're clear. Go.

370
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,898
And we have a winner.

371
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:56,179
Dad, I know you're mad,
but I can explain.

372
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,500
Gigi has been making me look bad
forever,

373
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,541
and this was a huge chance
to get back at her. So I went for it.

374
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:03,863
Revenge.

375
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:05,863
- So you do get it?
- I get it.

376
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,663
But let's look at it, shall we?

377
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,745
Was revenge worth missing
your wizard training?

378
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:13,586
Was it worth having your brother
lie for you,

379
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,347
or your best friend lie to your mom
down at that store?

380
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:17,627
And speaking of your mother,

381
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:21,229
she's got me trying
to make her a tappuccino?

382
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:24,750
So what you're saying is,
by getting back at Gigi,

383
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,551
I was really hurting myself?

384
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:29,351
No, but I like that better.

385
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:33,072
So, since I figured that out,
I should pick my own punishment, right?

386
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:38,795
No. Why don't you take my punishment
and duplicate it?

387
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:42,076
- You're grounded for one week.
- Does that mean two weeks?

388
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:44,637
Oh, now it's four. I love this game.

389
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:47,118
Good talk, sweetie.

390
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, you hush up.

391
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:56,961
- So I'm glad you learned your lesson.
- Me too.

392
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:59,802
Good. Now, your mom wants me
to take her out dancing,

393
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,603
but the big game is on tonight.

394
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:04,684
Dad, that sounds like your punishment,
not mine.

395
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:06,564
Then you see what I'm getting at.

396
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:10,166
Oh, you want me to duplicate you

397
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:13,327
so you can go dancing
and watch the game.

398
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,808
A little.

399
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:21,891
Oh, well, if you have to punish me,
I guess you have to punish me.

400
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,771
<i>Edgebono utoosis.</i>

401
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,172
Have her home by 11.
