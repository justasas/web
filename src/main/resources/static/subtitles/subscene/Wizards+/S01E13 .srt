1
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,618
- How's your last day of school, Alex?
- Oh, tough.

2
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:15,383
So many people were signing
my yearbook, I ran out of room.

3
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:17,063
I had to get a second yearbook.

4
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:19,143
How'd you get a second yearbook?
They're all gone.

5
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,904
Where's my yearbook, Alex?

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,261
Come on, Justin.
Hardly anybody signed it.

7
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,030
And one of them was you.

8
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:29,592
Maybe I was saving room for friends.

9
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:30,864
Like who?

10
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:33,393
Vice Principal Clements,
Earl the crossing guard,

11
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:35,873
my biology teacher
and all the ladies in the front office.

12
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:38,195
So basically all your friends are adults.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,234
Yeah, well, I fit in best with adults.
I'm very mature.

14
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:43,719
<i>Will Justin Russo report
to Lost and Found?</i>

15
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,836
<i>We have your cape and lightsaber.</i>

16
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:52,163
I can't believe they found
where I hid those.

17
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:50,558
You know how regular wizard mail
can sometimes take up to an hour?

18
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,489
Well, we now have WIPS.

19
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:55,808
Wizard Instant Parcel Service.

20
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,084
You can send mail instantly.

21
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,772
You mean like e-mail?

22
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:02,330
No, no, no. Let me show you.

23
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,212
You do it with this.

24
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:06,898
An old key, wow.

25
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:10,698
Okay, make fun, you clowns,
but watch this.

26
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:13,942
Here, Alex, take this key
and go over there.

27
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:17,343
Now, open a portal mail slot in midair.

28
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,261
Really? Okay.

29
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:26,343
If you say "mailus-spontaneous"
followed by a name or a place,

30
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:27,543
the envelope will go there.

31
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:28,909
Here, send this to Justin.

32
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,078
Mailus-spontaneous Justin Russo.

33
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:39,600
It worked. Hey, that was fast.

34
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:44,718
It's a messenger pigeon
from Wiz Tech.

35
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:48,888
You know, in my day, these were real.

36
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,487
They've accepted me
for summer boarding school.

37
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:55,651
Well, of course they accepted you.
Who else would wanna go?

38
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:56,843
Lots of people.

39
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,934
If you get into Wiz Tech,
you're a shoo-in for Transylvania State.

40
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,571
You mean it gets better?

41
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,817
And you know the best part
about Wiz Tech?

42
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:07,092
I get a whole summer away
from you-know-who.

43
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,578
I know you mean me.
And that's totally unfair.

44
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:14,736
Awesome.
Hey, let's scare Justin again.

45
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:30,514
Okay, I think you have everything
you need for Wiz Tech.

46
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:33,517
Oh, and I packed
your new school uniform.

47
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,359
A brand-new wizard robe.

48
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,552
Oh, no, Mom.
They switched to black bathrobes.

49
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:40,721
The old robes are too formal
for these modern casual times.

50
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:43,997
Okay, then we'll just run out
and get you a bathrobe.

51
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:47,088
And we should get him
some turkey jerky for the long trip.

52
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,123
Jerry, Justin doesn't like turkey jerky.
You do.

53
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:53,292
Would it hurt us
to get a little turkey jerky?

54
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:57,012
Hey, Alex, you missed
a little spot right there.

55
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:58,330
What do you mean?

56
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:01,656
It's the only spot in this house
that doesn't have your junk all over it.

57
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:04,340
We're taking your brother shopping,
and by the time we get back,

58
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,614
I expect you to have all your stuff
back up in your room.

59
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:10,864
Okay. Come on, Max,
you got a lot of cleaning up to do.

60
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,055
No, no, no.

61
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,938
Your mess, your responsibility.

62
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,821
Man, getting all this stuff back in my room
is gonna take forever.

63
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,112
Or not.

64
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:30,907
This will be easy.

65
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:32,837
I'll just send all my stuff
back to my room.

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,318
Mailus-spontaneous
Alex Russo's bedroom.

67
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:41,276
Hey, that thing's
kind of like a big vacuum.

68
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,923
Yeah.
Let me see if I can move it around.

69
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,244
Awesome.
I'll be done in like five minutes.

70
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:52,165
Mom and Dad will never...

71
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:59,855
That's a little cleaner
than I was going for.

72
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,618
I'd run away right now,
but I don't know where to go.

73
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:06,054
Dad's gonna have a cow.

74
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,740
And a sheep and a pig and a goat
when he sees all this.

75
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,664
Hide.

76
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:14,865
Oh, never mind.

77
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,389
Boy, I really love this turkey jerky.

78
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:25,065
It sure makes me thirsty, though.

79
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:30,112
Theresa, why can't I open the fridge?

80
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,151
Because it's not there.

81
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,281
- What did you do?
- I...

82
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,482
Daddy, let me just cut to it.

83
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,445
This portal...

84
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,973
Okay, this is the last of it.

85
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:54,448
What are we gonna do with you?

86
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:57,935
You have to learn to stop using magic
as a shortcut to everything.

87
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,492
You are so undisciplined.

88
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:01,338
That's why I can't wait
to get to Wiz Tech,

89
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,101
where everyone is so much more
serious about magic.

90
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:07,381
All summer long, I'll be in classes
that focus on the craft of magic

91
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:09,895
and using it respectfully,
the way it's meant to be.

92
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:11,904
Right, Dad?

93
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:17,983
Why are you guys looking at me
like I just gave you an idea?

94
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,229
Please don't tell me
he just gave you an idea.

95
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:24,715
Can someone tell me what the idea is?

96
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,764
This is a terrible idea,
bringing Alex here to Wiz Tech.

97
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,690
I know you had your heart set
on getting away from your sister,

98
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,406
but this could really be good for her.

99
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:52,332
And good for all of us.

100
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:55,892
Don't worry, Justin.
Look at this, this is a big place.

101
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:59,091
I'm sure you and Alex
will hardly see each other.

102
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,337
Justin and Alex Russo?

103
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm Dr. Evilini.
You will both be in my class.

104
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:09,702
Here are your spectacles.

105
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,625
Oh, sweet.

106
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:16,143
You know, with those glasses and that
robe on, you remind me of someone.

107
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,750
Is it Terry something?
Barry something?

108
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,834
Larry something? Oh, never mind.

109
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:25,595
What kind of powers
do these glasses give you?

110
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:26,787
None.

111
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:29,673
They just look wonderful
with the black bathrobes.

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,234
Great. We're accessorizing ugly.

113
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,319
Mom, Dad, please don't make me stay.

114
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,162
Yeah, please don't make her stay.

115
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,156
Come on, guys. The time will fly.

116
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,357
Oh, and, Justin, here is the portal key.

117
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,878
If you get homesick,
just send us a note.

118
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:45,166
What about me? Can I use the portal key
to send you a note?

119
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,203
We've seen enough of you
and the portal key.

120
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:56,168
Don't worry, honey.
Our kids will be fine.

121
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:59,338
I'm not worried about our kids.
I'm worried about the other kids.

122
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:01,532
Alex is there.

123
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:03,617
Max, what's all this?

124
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,463
Well, now that I'm an only child,

125
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,181
we can do all that stuff
that we've been too busy to do.

126
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,226
Dad, what do you wanna start with?

127
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:12,138
Nap.

128
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:14,387
- Bike riding around Central Park?
- A nap.

129
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,392
- Well, how about...?
- A nap.

130
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:18,788
- Jerry.
- What?

131
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,589
Okay. Okay.

132
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:26,190
Max, let's start with
what you wanna do most.

133
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,510
- Camping.
- Camping?

134
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,111
That's a good one.

135
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:32,201
Give me that.

136
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:36,563
Oh, come on. You're city guys.

137
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:37,802
Your idea of roughing it

138
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:41,399
is when they deliver Chinese food
without the fortune cookies.

139
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,601
Dad, do you smell that?

140
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,453
It smells like a challenge.

141
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:50,328
With a hint
of questioning our manhood.

142
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,969
You know, we could rough it
if we wanted to.

143
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:54,167
It's just, we don't.

144
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:58,533
Because there's no wilderness
around here.

145
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:00,938
Oh, well, we can camp on the terrace.

146
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,178
Terrace?

147
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:06,219
<i>One night out there might as well be
an episode of Survivor for you two.</i>

148
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,416
Oh, yeah?

149
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,867
- We could spend one...
- Two.

150
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:12,221
- Three nights on the terrace.
- Or even a whole week.

151
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,709
I think three nights will do it, buddy.

152
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,588
Okay, campers.
Three nights on the terrace.

153
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,707
You come inside, you lose.

154
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,429
- You are on.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:23,633
Fine, boys.

156
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:27,350
Enjoy everything Mother Nature
has to offer.

157
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:33,724
You there, on the terrace.

158
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:38,205
Have you seen a stocky male, late 30s,
running with a sack full of money?

159
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:39,798
No.

160
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:42,570
- Are you locked out?
- No.

161
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,685
Has your manhood
been called into question?

162
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:47,532
- Yes.
- Yes.

163
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:51,015
Hang in there, guys.

164
00:09:57,261 --> 00:09:58,331
Anybody?

165
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:00,897
Anybody?

166
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,661
Thank you, Dr. Evilini.

167
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:07,023
That would be
the Lithuanian Lethal Lamp,

168
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:09,623
known for their anaconda-like
electrical cords.

169
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:10,819
Excellent.

170
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,069
So, everyone, beware.

171
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:16,466
That sounded scary.

172
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:19,235
Topnotch, Russo.

173
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:21,826
You really have a grasp
on venomous furniture.

174
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,677
Don't you agree, class?

175
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,313
- Nice one, Russo.
- Nice job.

176
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,672
What? Only one bar
in the wizard world?

177
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,441
This stinks.

178
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:33,520
- I'll take that.
- Okay.

179
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,877
Feel free to add your number
so we don't lose touch.

180
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:38,045
Yeah, okay.

181
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:45,290
What's with you and the tiny stuff?

182
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:49,769
Oh, I come from a family of giants,
but I'm kind of the runt of the litter.

183
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:53,050
So Mom and Dad surround me
with miniature things

184
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,689
so my self-esteem doesn't get bruised.

185
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:57,854
And you're okay with that?

186
00:10:57,982 --> 00:11:01,534
Sure, except this tiny underwear
rides up a lot.

187
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:09,704
I'm Hugh. Hugh Normous.

188
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:12,468
Not really.

189
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,909
Well, that new guy, Justin,
is pretty cool, huh?

190
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,549
Yeah, the coolest.

191
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,996
- Watch this.
- Okay.

192
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:22,555
Not only is it known
for its highly venomous vapours,

193
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,071
it also engulfs its victims.

194
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:30,759
That would be
the Brustromian Beanbag Chair.

195
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:33,195
Impressive, Russo.

196
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,453
"Love, Alex."

197
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:51,171
Yeah.

198
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:56,214
Miss Russo,
I get the feeling you're too undisciplined

199
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:59,256
to appreciate
what Wiz Tech has to offer.

200
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:04,139
And I get the feeling that you people
here at Wiz Tech don't get me.

201
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,339
Perhaps this will get your attention.

202
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:19,551
Those J's are like fishhooks.

203
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:23,791
Summer has just begun, Russo.

204
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,843
Hey, Justin.
How'd you like my exploding note?

205
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:36,358
I thought it was a blast.

206
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, no one else did.

207
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,727
Messing with me didn't turn out
like you thought, did it?

208
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:45,405
Everyone around here thinks I'm cool
and they think you're a loser.

209
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:47,016
A loser? What are you talking about?

210
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:50,370
People love hanging out with me.
Hey, who wants to have lunch with me?

211
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:52,969
- Loser.
- Loser, no.

212
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,135
I'll have lunch with you.

213
00:12:56,263 --> 00:13:01,294
I hope you like baby corn,
baby carrots and tiny mugs of juice.

214
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,984
Yeah, have fun with the really tiny giant.

215
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,951
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see how big man
on campus fits in with this.

216
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:11,541
From your chin to your toes,
an elephant trunk grows.

217
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:16,793
Russo!

218
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,793
That really wasn't meant for you. Sorry.

219
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:30,561
But clearly this is meant for me.

220
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:46,368
- Got any fours?
- Go fish.

221
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:48,768
You got any twos?

222
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,813
Go fish.

223
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:02,667
I ain't fishing in that pond.

224
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:16,709
I've summoned Justin Russo
as you requested, Dr. Evilini.

225
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:29,675
You wanted to see me?

226
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:31,844
Yes. Pick up that Bidaddle.

227
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:34,803
Why?

228
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,325
What? Wha...?

229
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,246
Just as I thought.

230
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:43,173
It has been written that great
12-ball players turn into great wizards.

231
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,210
And you just might be one.

232
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,451
What were we talking about?

233
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,490
Twelve ball.

234
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,261
What's 12 ball? It looks like Ping-Pong.

235
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:54,618
It's nothing like Ping-Pong.

236
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:57,457
These balls are added one by one

237
00:14:57,626 --> 00:15:00,825
with the objective
of 12 being played simultaneously.

238
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:04,944
Only one student has ever reached
11 balls here at Wiz Tech.

239
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,586
- Who's that?
- Jerko Phoenix.

240
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:10,991
You'll meet him in due time, my boy.

241
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,231
Due time.

242
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:16,715
That sounded mysterious.

243
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,711
What do you say? Are you up to it?

244
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:23,279
I am. I am up to the challenge.

245
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,684
Gonna get some water.

246
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:10,783
What's the big deal?

247
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,555
He's the best I've ever seen.

248
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:15,354
You're the worst best friend ever.

249
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,676
Wait up, Alex.

250
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:24,397
Mr. Russo, it's time for you
to take on the very best 12-ball player

251
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,121
here at Wiz Tech
in a non-binding scrimmage.

252
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:38,734
Justin Russo, meet...

253
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,887
Jerko Phoenix.

254
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,086
Jerko?

255
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,856
That must be a tough name
to grow up with.

256
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:45,617
I had a cousin whose name was Kim.

257
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,733
Well, Kim was a guy,
so I'm sure you can imagine people...

258
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,130
Enough.

259
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:56,781
Better warn you that I plan on winning
the title of Mr. 12 Ball.

260
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,984
What's up with your eye?

261
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,219
Twelve ball accident?

262
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:06,030
There's nothing wrong with my eye.

263
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:11,312
This gets me out of wearing
those stupid glasses.

264
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:36,173
It's been raining all night
and they're eating weeds again.

265
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,525
That's it. Game over.

266
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,294
Help! Max!

267
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:51,018
- Jerry, help!
- Mom, are you all right?

268
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:53,261
- What happened?
- I saw a rat.

269
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:55,423
It's under the couch. I saw a rat.

270
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:57,186
A rat?

271
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,904
You guys. Help, now.

272
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,793
But...

273
00:18:11,678 --> 00:18:14,194
It's under the? Okay.

274
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:21,599
Well, the tail looks like a...

275
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,836
A rat, Jerry. It's a rat.

276
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:30,006
That's it. You guys can't stay
out there anymore.

277
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,359
You guys win.

278
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:33,212
I need you in here.

279
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,372
Thanks. Max, camping trip is over.

280
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:38,452
We gotta be in here
to protect our little lady.

281
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:40,936
You know how weak women can be.

282
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:43,131
- Don't push it.
- Sorry.

283
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:50,417
I gotta put this little guy back
in his natural habitat.

284
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:52,417
The subway.

285
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,869
Hey, Mom, that was really a potato,
wasn't it?

286
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,423
Yeah.

287
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,425
Do you have any more?
Because I'm starving.

288
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:04,506
Sure, baby. How do you want your rat?
Mashed or fried?

289
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:33,933
This door is locked too?

290
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:36,331
Yes, I am.

291
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:40,691
Alex.

292
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,050
What are you doing? It's bath night.

293
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:48,255
Oh, just chitchatting with the door.

294
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:50,580
Hey, Justin,
you know the portal key Dad gave you?

295
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,538
I need it.
I wanna send something home.

296
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,260
Oh, okay.

297
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:57,429
Wait. Why do you have your suitcase?

298
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,867
I just want Mom
to do some laundry for me.

299
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,428
Hey, you're trying
to send yourself home.

300
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:06,673
Okay. So, what do you care?
You love all the work at this place.

301
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,190
I can't stand it. I'm out of here.

302
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:12,435
- Alex, you can't leave.
- Oh, yeah? Watch me.

303
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:16,876
Mailus-spontaneous Russo home.

304
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:19,120
Alex.

305
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:23,676
Here, Hugh.

306
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,680
I do appreciate the help with the mail.

307
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,649
Oh, you're welcome.
But it's a little lonely.

308
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:31,765
I wish my new friend Alex
would drop by once in a while.

309
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:38,288
Hey, everybody. I'm hosed.

310
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:40,898
- Alex.
- Alex.

311
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,693
All mail goes through Dr. Evilini.

312
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:44,653
I guess you know that now.

313
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:48,102
Alex Russo.

314
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:52,540
Trying to run away instead of facing up
to the challenges of Wiz Tech?

315
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:57,665
I can see I'm going to have to pull out
the old discipline bucket.

316
00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:00,625
The who?

317
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:09,587
Oh, she wasn't kidding.

318
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:12,599
There really is a discipline bucket.

319
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,676
I hate this place.

320
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:16,920
Keep scrubbing.

321
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,525
Are you sure you've got the message?

322
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,520
Yes.

323
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:26,124
Good.
Then take it straight to my mother.

324
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,482
She'll finally be proud of me.

325
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:30,486
Now go, messenger fish.

326
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,771
Flop like the wind.

327
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:39,176
Hey, I just scrubbed there.

328
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,934
Dear Mama, after the 12-ball tournament
reveals the best young wizard,

329
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:47,216
I will drain that wizard's powers
and take them for myself,

330
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:50,339
making me
the most powerful wizard ever.

331
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,903
Love, Mary Beth Evilini.

332
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,547
Justin's gonna get his powers drained.

333
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:03,149
This place is a freak show.

334
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:06,307
<i>Okay, let's review.</i>

335
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:08,077
They've accepted me
for summer school.

336
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,111
Please don't tell me
he just gave you an idea.

337
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,394
- Mom, Dad, please don't make me stay.
- Yeah, please don't make her stay.

338
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:17,598
Trying to run away instead of facing up
to the challenges of Wiz Tech?

339
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:22,765
It has been written that great
12-ball players turn into great wizards.

340
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,523
He's the best I've ever seen.

341
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:27,762
Justin's gonna get his powers drained.

342
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:31,171
So, everyone, beware.
