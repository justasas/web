1
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:11,361
Okay, Alex, change me back.

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,924
Oh, but Daddy,
you look so cute as a goat.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,561
Let's make him eat a tin can.

4
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:20,446
Not funny, Max. Alex, change me back.

5
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:21,846
Okay, okay.

6
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:24,168
<i>Huminoza espinoza</i>

7
00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:32,047
- We really got your goat, huh, Dad?
- Got your goat.

8
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:35,566
That's it. You just laughed your way
into one hour of study hall, starting now.

9
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:37,493
- Let's go.
- We didn't even...

10
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:39,847
And that means
working on your wizard homework

11
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:42,492
and not messing around.

12
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:45,371
Who's laughing now, huh?

13
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:51,577
There's something wrong with that spell.
Or maybe it's me.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,579
No, it's gotta be the spell. Okay.

15
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,334
What are you doing
on the wizard computer?

16
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:01,259
Yeah, we're supposed to be
doing our homework,

17
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:03,943
not surfing the World Wide Wiz Web.

18
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,337
I have to do a little shopping.

19
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:08,024
I like to look good
when I'm doing my homework.

20
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,504
Oh, this place
has the best no-trip high heels.

21
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,379
No matter how high the heels are,
it's impossible to twist your ankle.

22
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:15,740
I have to try some on.

23
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,342
They were cuter on-screen.

24
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:26,024
Oh, look, here's something for Justin.

25
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,579
Check it out. Mini-dragons for sale.

26
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,461
Okay, no. I'm getting out of here
because I don't wanna get involved.

27
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:38,552
Oh, that is the cutest little dog
I've ever seen.

28
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:41,262
Hey, boy.

29
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,466
Not only is he cute,
but he's also a dragon.

30
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:48,504
That's right,
a mythical creature and a dog combined.

31
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:50,830
Now tell me, how many would you like?

32
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:53,190
We're just looking.

33
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:56,986
What would it take for me
to get you involved

34
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:59,625
in one of these marvellous
little dragon-dogs today?

35
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:02,797
I don't get it.
Is it a dragon or is it a dog?

36
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:05,672
It was charmed to look like a dog
so it could exist in the real world.

37
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,395
Now, beat it, kid.
I'm in the middle of a sale.

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,599
Okay, how are we gonna have
a dragon-dog?

39
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,393
Mom would totally freak out.

40
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:16,001
Wait.

41
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:21,153
If you guys buy right now,
I will throw in a smoke detector,

42
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:25,197
and a small device that cuts tomatoes.

43
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:27,043
You mean, like a knife?

44
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:29,124
Kid...

45
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,838
Here's a roll of quarters.
Knock yourself out.

46
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,797
- With what?
- The quarters.

47
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:39,643
He seems friendly.
I bet you he's not much of a guard dog.

48
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:44,243
- That is awesome.
- I like him. He's feisty.

49
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:47,203
Dragon in a beagle suit,
what's the big deal?

50
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,207
I'll tell you what the big deal is.

51
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,488
This dog-dragon is on sale
for 5 million cubicks.

52
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:56,810
And because you have a coupon...
Here, take that.

53
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,804
- It's 20 percent off.

54
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,284
Dude, you should totally get him.
He's on sale.

55
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:05,406
Plus he'll throw in a "tomato" slicer.

56
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:06,803
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,529
I'm can't get another dog again.
No way.

58
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,728
- Not after what happened with Willie.
- Wait, who's Willie?

59
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:16,008
He's the dog we had
when you were a baby.

60
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:17,365
Oh, no, here comes the tears.

61
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,729
Or as Justin calls them, his "allergies."

62
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,290
When I was 7, he got lost,

63
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,332
and I swore
I'd never love another dog again.

64
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:32,697
I gotta go.
My allergies are acting up, so...

65
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:37,219
I'll take him.
Justin's gonna love me for this.

66
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,811
But Justin just said
that he doesn't want a dog.

67
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:44,296
- Trust me, Justin wants a dog.
- Trust her, Justin wants a dog.

68
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,103
Here's 5 million cubicks in U.S. Currency.
Oh, I know the exchange rate.

69
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:51,024
I order from the Abercrombie and Witch
catalogue all the time.

70
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,374
Good.

71
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:56,626
Your five-second warranty
just ended right now.

72
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:03,101
Well, let's go find a cute doggie sweater
to match that cute doggie face.

73
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,629
Come on. Come on, doggie.

74
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:13,029
My dog burnt my homework.
That'll be a new one.

75
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:16,038
Justin, you're gonna love this.
Close your eyes.

76
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,245
Okay, but I'm not gonna taste anything.

77
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,844
Ta-da.

78
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,407
Alex, what's that dragon-dog doing here?
I told you, I don't want another pet.

79
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,807
Well, I think you do,
and so did the dragon seller.

80
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:32,321
Of course he did, he's a dragon seller.

81
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:34,409
And besides,
what are you gonna tell Mom and Dad?

82
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,412
Mom and Dad don't have to know
he's a dragon. I'll say I found a dog.

83
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:41,289
Because it's a dog and it looks like a dog,
that barks fire.

84
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,168
Okay, I appreciate
what you're trying to do for me here,

85
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,775
but I can't go down this path again.

86
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,171
And besides,
you know about my allergies.

87
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,730
It's crying.

88
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:52,052
I'm allergic to sadness.

89
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:55,012
Look, I know losing Willie
broke your heart.

90
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,051
But the truth is,
he didn't run away and get lost.

91
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,648
He got out because...

92
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,459
Because I kind of let him out.

93
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:05,615
It was you?

94
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:08,691
Mom and Dad told me
it was the pizza delivery guy.

95
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:11,256
I haven't eaten pizza in, like, eight years.

96
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:13,182
Don't be mad. I was 5.

97
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:16,819
I wanted to take Willie for a walk,
and he wanted to go for a run.

98
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:18,896
You're saying you feel guilty?

99
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:20,936
Rarely, but yes.

100
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:23,144
All right.

101
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:25,177
Hey, buddy.

102
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,099
That's a good boy.

103
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:30,822
Oh, he just did that thing
with his nose like Willie did.

104
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,303
Do you like your new home, boy?

105
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:35,347
He can nod.

106
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,061
Thanks, Alex. He's awesome.

107
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,869
- I love a good lunch rush.
- Me too.

108
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,909
I just wish everyone
wouldn't show up at once.

109
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,100
What's that?

110
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,470
A dog. Just a dog.

111
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,671
Yeah, what's it doing here?

112
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:54,468
I found it wandering alone
in Waverly Place.

113
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,944
Lonely, looking for a home.
Looking for a half-Latino family.

114
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,148
It's destiny. We have to keep him.

115
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:06,627
Hey, buddy. How you doing, boy?

116
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:10,353
- Good boy. Speak.
- No, don't speak. Don't speak.

117
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,231
- Why not?
- Because if he speaks, there'll be fire.

118
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:14,997
- What?
- What?

119
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,268
What Max is trying to say,

120
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,910
is that he's saving his voice
for those barking-dog albums.

121
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,191
He does a mean Bon Jovi.

122
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:25,679
Well, see, he's multi-talented.

123
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,315
I think we should keep him, Theresa.

124
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:29,273
Oh, we can't keep a lost dog.

125
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,638
Someone's probably out of their mind
looking for him.

126
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:34,358
Oh, that is so true. You're right, Mom.

127
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:36,475
And we should probably
put fliers up in the city

128
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,124
so we can find its rightful owner.

129
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:41,078
Really? But he's so cute.

130
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:43,674
Come on, Alex.
You pick now to be responsible?

131
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:47,277
Absolutely.
We'll scour the city for the owner.

132
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,484
And on the off chance
that we come up short,

133
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,439
only then can we keep the dog.

134
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:55,362
That's very mature, Alex.
I'm proud of you.

135
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,327
Oh, so that's been your plan
all along, huh?

136
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,281
Play with my fragile heart
and then crush it?

137
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,407
What happens
if the rightful dog owner comes along

138
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:03,805
and sees the lost-dog sign?

139
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,321
No one's gonna claim it,
because it's not lost or a dog.

140
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,444
And you're the smart one?

141
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,002
You're right. I'm sorry.

142
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,887
I'm just a little panicked
over what happened with Willie.

143
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:14,806
Let it go. I was 5.

144
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,608
As long as he's here,
what should we call it?

145
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:21,204
Oh, I know, here's an idea. Spot.

146
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:23,611
No, wait, Paws.

147
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,250
Patches.

148
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,810
I think we should call it Dragon.

149
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:31,487
- What? Why would we call it that?
- Yeah, why?

150
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,297
Because it's a dragon.

151
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,256
I swear I didn't say anything.

152
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:38,736
Its name is right here on its tag.
Its name is Dragon.

153
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:42,579
The name Dragon is on its tag.

154
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,215
I love the name Dragon.
Good eye, Mom.

155
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:45,491
It's like it was meant to be.

156
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,893
Okay,
let's talk about something else now.

157
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:00,463
Hey, Charlie, can I hang one of these
found-dog signs on your stand?

158
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,577
What's in it for me, sweetheart?

159
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:04,422
Where's Charlie?

160
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:08,826
Let's just say Charlie went to the bank
to get the candy he owes me.

161
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:11,789
And by "candy," I mean money.

162
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,461
Yeah, I kind of figured that
when you said "bank."

163
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,308
Can I hang one of these signs
on your stand?

164
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,462
I'll give you a Bronxstrami Swiss on rye.

165
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,904
How about a Bronxstrami Swiss
and a kiss?

166
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:25,707
How about a Bronxstrami Swiss
and a bowl of soup?

167
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:29,070
Cup of soup, foot-long,
no cheaping out on the cheese.

168
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:30,872
And a meaningful hug.

169
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:32,586
No hug. Done.

170
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:35,149
You'll come around. They always do.

171
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:39,108
Well, I don't know who they are,
but I'm not one of them.

172
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:43,426
He's just like Willie.

173
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,595
He likes dog treats,
squeak toys and toilet water.

174
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:50,071
He ate a squeak toy.
That's okay, Dragon. You're still the best.

175
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:53,272
Oh, let me get a picture of you, boy. Sit.

176
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,000
This will go great in the activities chapter
of the photo album I'm putting together.

177
00:09:58,121 --> 00:09:59,918
Cute pup. What's his name?

178
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,270
Dragon.

179
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,994
Not because he is a dragon.

180
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:05,842
No, because there's no such thing
as dragons.

181
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:07,715
I should stop talking.

182
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:09,996
- Does he fetch?
- No, he doesn't fetch.

183
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,433
- You probably don't want to do that.
- Go get it, Dragon.

184
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,798
Were those wings?

185
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,078
Oh, yeah, good one, Frankie.

186
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:20,442
- A dog with wings.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,726
Dragon is just like Michael Jordan.

188
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:25,960
Every once in a while, a superstar comes
along and elevates the whole game.

189
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:30,203
- Why is it burnt?
- It's not burnt.

190
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,762
It's just like toast.

191
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,724
You just brush off all the black stuff,
and it's good as new, see?

192
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:39,130
All right. It works for now.

193
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,329
But something doesn't smell right
on Waverly Place.

194
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,570
You leave the borough,
you check in with me.

195
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,003
That was a close call.

196
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:52,285
We gotta train Dragon
to act like a normal dog.

197
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:55,450
Oh, there's a cat. Go get him.

198
00:10:57,496 --> 00:11:00,091
Not you, Dragon.

199
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,732
All right. Hey. Stay down.

200
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,729
He did it. But it was kind of cooler
when he would...

201
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,979
Don't say F-L-Y around him.

202
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,651
F-L-Y? Oh, fly.

203
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:21,738
- Fly.
- Boy, it's so hot out here.

204
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,012
Fly. Fly.

205
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:25,418
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

206
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:28,104
Said there's a lot of flies out here.

207
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:31,063
- Where?
- Not up there, I meant ants.

208
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:34,262
Flying ants.

209
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,297
I hate ants.

210
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:38,736
You know, there was this one time
your father fell asleep

211
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,546
with a Danish on his chest,
and in the morning...

212
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,499
We know, we know, he had an ant beard.
Go, go.

213
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:46,780
- Fly, fly.
- Go get the ant spray.

214
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:51,308
Man, we are lucky that the word "fly"
came up a lot in conversation.

215
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,230
Please tell me that was slobber.

216
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,869
Okay. That was slobber.

217
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,353
Come on, guys.
We gotta go check on Dragon.

218
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,553
Yeah, we've never left him
home alone before.

219
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:20,349
Hey, guys, I'm sure he's just fine.

220
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,594
And if anyone messed with him,
he'd just breathe fire.

221
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:24,755
- Yeah, that's what we're worried about.
- What?

222
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,598
I thought we just didn't want him
to take leaks in the house.

223
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,758
Hey, guys. Gotta go check on Dragon.

224
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,320
- Wait, Justin.
- Justin.

225
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:35,113
- I'll go tell him.
- What's the matter?

226
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,595
Those fliers you put up worked.

227
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,679
Dragon's rightful owner
came by and picked him up

228
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,236
while you kids were at school.

229
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:43,997
What rightful owner?

230
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:46,763
Hey, guys. Where's Dragon?

231
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:49,319
His owner claimed him.

232
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:52,560
- His owner?
- Honey, I'm so sorry.

233
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:54,756
I know how much you loved him.

234
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,559
He's gone?

235
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:01,725
There's so much we didn't get to do.

236
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:05,004
Justin, I'm sorry.

237
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,521
Thanks a lot.

238
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,244
This is why I didn't wanna
get close to another dog.

239
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,487
You did it to me again.

240
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,169
You lost your found dog?

241
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,452
Why don't you rest your head
on Frankie's shoulder

242
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,567
and tell him all about it?

243
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:36,766
I would, but I don't have time
for you to get a ladder.

244
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,136
This is serious.
Someone claimed Dragon.

245
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:42,250
But whoever it was
wasn't the real owner.

246
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,418
That's weird,
because he looked like a dog lover.

247
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,893
You saw him? Who was he?

248
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,136
You got a meatball sub
with my name on it?

249
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,376
I'll give you the bread now

250
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:52,935
and you'll get your meatballs
after we find the dog-napper.

251
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:55,940
The guy came out with your dog
and bought this.

252
00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:59,734
A programme
for the Hudson Dog Show.

253
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:01,775
The Hudson Dog Show? When is it?

254
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:05,053
Why don't you buy a copy and find out?

255
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:06,939
I have to buy it?

256
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:11,776
Do I come into your restaurant,
lick a sandwich and leave?

257
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,018
Zinger!

258
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:16,503
That'll be $8, please.

259
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:18,580
Okay.

260
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:22,341
It's today.

261
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:24,825
I'd like to return this for a refund.

262
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,145
Zinger!

263
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:45,388
May I help you?

264
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:49,109
Yeah, can I get a hound of corned beef.

265
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:53,071
- I'm sorry, did you say "hound"?
- No.

266
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:56,030
Man, everything reminds me of Dragon.

267
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:58,388
- Everything.
- That's rough.

268
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:00,111
"Rough."

269
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,350
That's what he used to say.

270
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,870
- A pound of corned beef coming up.
- Thank you.

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,799
Max, can you go in the back
and grab some more to-go pups?

272
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,035
- "Pups"?
- No. To-go cups.

273
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:16,399
All he can think about is Dragon.

274
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:22,594
Justin, Max, you're coming with me.
We're getting Dragon back.

275
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:25,598
- Dad, we're taking our lunch break.
- Come on, guys. Hurry.

276
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,637
"Furry." He was so furry.

277
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:29,802
I miss him.

278
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:40,686
- Three tickets for the dog show, please.
- It's sold out.

279
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,802
- What?
- Apparently, a lot of people like watching

280
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,485
dogs run around on plastic grass.

281
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,008
No dog, no way in.

282
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,804
Large fries. See if there's a toy included.
Over.

283
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,723
Alex will talk us in. She's a master.

284
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:01,528
I totally understand.
Come on, guys, it's not happening.

285
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:04,727
What? That's it?
We're not getting my dog back?

286
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:07,814
Of course we're getting your dog back.
We just need to get a dog first.

287
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:10,646
Where are we gonna find a dog
without an owner?

288
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:14,847
It worked. We're in.

289
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:17,174
- Let's get Max.
- Okay.

00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,138

00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:43,415
I can still smell everything.

- Dragon?

299
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:54,258
And the dragon seller.
He stole Dragon back.

- He's a con wizard.
- Come on, let's go get Dragon.

301

Hey, you're a thief. You sold us that dog
and then stole it back.

It's the circle of life, children.

was a lesson well learned.

You're welcome.

308
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,945
No deal. We're taking Dragon home.

309
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:20,225

00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:22,067
Look, he's gone.

00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:26,347
Oh, he's not gone.
He's still here. I can smell him.

is get Max to smell the beagles.

How do you know he's still a beagle?

00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,634

from a dragon into a beagle,

I can change him
into any dog that I want.

Bob, bring around the security trailer.
I got a sniffer.

Great,
how are we gonna find Dragon now?

Our sniffer just got thrown

If we had a cat, all the dogs would go wild
chasing it, except for Dragon.

00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:53,851
Bob, bring the catnip.

340
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,051
All of it.

341
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,970
Make sure I get extra ketchup.

342
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,420
Bob?

343
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:09,375
Bob?

344
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,935
Dragon.

345
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:14,382
Oh, good boy.

346
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,146
Okay, I left him a beagle,
and you found him.

347
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:23,178
Good work, Velma and Shaggy.

348
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,741
Come on.

349
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,461
That's scary.

350
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,510
- I still know it's you, kid.
- It's worth a shot.

351
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:42,065
<i>Huminoza espinoza</i>

352
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:49,148
Would you like to excuse yourself
to a litter box? We're kind of busy.

353
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:53,184
You know, I'd like to stay and chat,
but I've got a dog here I have to sell.

354
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:56,466
Again and again and again.

355
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,110
Not so fast. Look, you were right before.

356
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:01,227
We've learned our lesson.
No hard feelings.

357
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:03,393
I have hard feelings.

358
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,474
We're just kids, and we should probably
thank someone like you

359
00:20:07,598 --> 00:20:09,316
for giving us street smarts

360
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:12,431
and making us more cautious
with future purchases.

361
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,469
Yeah. I am a pretty good teacher.

362
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,791
So thank you, and have a good day.

363
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:22,961
But don't forget your cage.

364
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:27,240
You know, I never thought
I would say this to a customer,

365
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:32,040
but it has been a pleasure
scamming you.

366
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:36,354
What are you doing?
You let him get away with Dragon.

367
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:40,315
You're right. I'm sorry.
Now all you have is

368
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:41,921
- Dragon.
- Dragon.

369
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,560
Alex, how did you do that?

370
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:47,237
I just made him take the wrong cage,
like I do with you guys and our lunches.

371
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,245
But who'd he take?

372
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:51,722
The blow-dried rat.

373
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,806
I saw the cage right there,
I thought on my feet,

374
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,522
and I out-conned the con wizard.

375
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,523
I'm good.

376
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,170
Hairball.

377
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:04,282
Yeah, you're just that good.

378
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,843
So Dragon is really a dragon?

379
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:10,248
Amazing.

380
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:12,445
Actually,
there are a lot of secret dragons.

381
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,453
No, that in a family of wizards,
I didn't see that coming.

382
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,373
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

383
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:20,409
- So can we keep him?
- Oh, I don't know, honey.

384
00:21:20,537 --> 00:21:23,894
Max will feed him every day, and Justin
will give him a bath and walk him.

385
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,246
What will you do?

386
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,979
I'm doing it.
I'm coordinating what you guys do.

387
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,053
Actually, pets do teach responsibility.

388
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,899
Jerry, you leave wet towels
on the bed every day.

389
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,731
Fine, I'll air-dry. Can we keep him?

390
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:39,978
Well, I don't see what harm he could do.

391
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:41,899
Come on, Dragon,
let's go up to my room.

392
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,976
Man.

393
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:52,095
This time, Jerry, you can blame a dog.
This time.
