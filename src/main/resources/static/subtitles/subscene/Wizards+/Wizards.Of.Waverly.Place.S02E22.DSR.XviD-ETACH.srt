1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,533
Into thin air, send this chair.

2
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:05,934
[whirring]

3
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:09,667
Hmmm. This doesn't seem right.

4
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:12,700
Help! Somebody help!

5
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:15,534
Max? Max?

6
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:17,601
Du... Where are you?

7
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,168
[Max] I'm right here.

8
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:21,832
I was trying to make Dad's
chair disappear and...

9
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:23,765
Well, you can figure out the rest.

10
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:29,335
Yeah, and I figure...
you're holding the wand backwards.

11
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:33,155
[Max] No, well... Oh,
maybe a little.

12
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:36,994
Into thin air, send this chair.

13
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:38,494
[whirring]

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,396
I hope you know how to
get Dad's chair back.

15
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:48,231
Of course I don't.

16
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,667
Justin, I'm starting
to think Dad's right.

17
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:54,801
If I'm gonna have any chance of
winning this wizard competition,

18
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:57,103
I'm gonna need a tutor.

19
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:59,936
Dad's hiring you a wizard tutor?

20
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:03,439
The best tutor around is right here.
That's an insult to me.

21
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:05,074
I tutor tutors!

22
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,440
[door opens]

23
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:08,208
I heard yelling.

24
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:10,776
Is Justin being passionate
about knowledge again?

25
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:13,878
Max?

26
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:15,345
- Yep.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:18,447
Guess what? Dad's hiring
a wizard tutor for Max.

28
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:21,916
Wait, if Dad got Max a tutor,

29
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,084
that means I'm probably next.

30
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,589
Why am I saying,
"probably"? I'm next. Oh...

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,994
Yep, just be yourself.
That always gets rid of people.

32
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:44,097
[fake laugh] You're so funny!

33
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:49,667
Guys, I think my tutor's here.
I hope it's a wise old owl.

34
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,469
[roaring]

35
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:56,339
Hi.

36
00:01:56,373 --> 00:02:01,375
Aw. You're not an old owl,
just a cute blonde chick.

37
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,444
Get rid of her.

38
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,514
I'm Tutor Hatchback.
I'm here to tutor Max Russo.

39
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:12,282
And something tells me you're him.

40
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:15,784
Yeah, that something's right.
That's him right there. Uh-huh.

41
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,587
And that's uh... That's uh...

42
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:21,155
That's Alex, right over there.
And... I'm...

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,190
I'm... I'm...

44
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:25,592
Am I supposed to tutor him, too?

45
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:29,062
Him? No. In fact, your services
aren't really needed here at all

46
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:31,431
because my brother has a
vast knowledge of wizardry

47
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,600
that may shame you into leaving
here in disgrace, right, Justin?

48
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,568
Justin?!

49
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:46,907
We are so honored to have you
here to tutor our dear brother.

50
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:59,116
If there is anything
that you need, just ask.

51
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,718
? Is that u  t is a pretty face?

52
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:03,853
[scoffs] Guys are so easy.

53
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:06,622
Yeah, we're pretty easy. [chuckles]

54
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:10,224
* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

55
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,092
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

56
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,428
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

57
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:15,929
* Yes, please *

58
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,797
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

59
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,565
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

60
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,534
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

61
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,102
* That's what I said *

62
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,904
* Everything is not what it seems *

63
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:30,808
* When you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

64
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:34,646
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

65
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:39,150
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

66
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:42,286
* Everything is not what it seems *

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,525
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,895
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

69
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,443
* Because everything is not... *

70
00:03:51,444 --> 00:04:02,444

71
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:09,777
You'll be surprised how many
kids hold their wands backwards.

72
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,046
I'm sorry, Max.

73
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,598
You're holding your wand right,
but don't grip it so tight.

74
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,234
You're not Judy Axe-Hand.

75
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:36,244
Whoa. You...
You read Judy Axe-Hand?

76
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,312
That's like the best wizard
comic book out there.

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,815
Yeah. By "best" do you mean the
one that's not totally lame?

78
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,816
Yes! I have the whole series.

79
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,319
- I'll go get them. Hang on.
- OK.

80
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:48,754
I like you.
Hope you don't wreck it.

81
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,624
Hey, tutor. I, uh...

82
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,594
I brought you some of my personal
study aids to help you with Max.

83
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,532
Get out of here. I'm starting
a friendship thing here.

84
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,602
Friendship? Not if I make
her my girlfriend first.

85
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,305
[both groan]

86
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:13,376
Oh, my gosh!

87
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,846
You have My First Spell-Caster,
a set of training wands,

88
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,015
and even Merlin Flash Cards.

89
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,216
[whirring]

90
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,617
[both] Ooh.

91
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,220
And... Oh, OK.

92
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:28,622
I used to play with
those when I was a kid.

93
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:30,791
But you were using them last night.

94
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,759
Zip it.

95
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,896
So, uh, Tutor, um, do you ever,

96
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,866
I don't know, tutor people
on asking anyone out?

97
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,067
Well, who do you wanna ask out?

98
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:46,803
Uh, well, I... You.

99
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:51,441
You don't need a tutor.
You're doing just fine.

100
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:54,876
Um, have you ever been to The
Leprechaun Grill in the wizard world?

101
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:58,679
No. I love leprechauns,
but they make me nervous.

102
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:02,083
I try to avoid
situations that emphasize

103
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:04,918
my... awkwardness.

104
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:09,389
I'm sure you'll fit in just fine.

105
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:12,125
That's what my mom says every
day before I go to school.

106
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:15,195
[chuckles] Thank you.

107
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:21,201
So, she's a tutor named Tutor?
Isn't that weird?

108
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:24,238
Well, no, not in the
wizard world, at least.

109
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:27,674
A lot of people name their kids what
they want them to grow up to be.

110
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,442
But sometimes it doesn't work out.

111
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:32,279
My dad goes to a doctor
named Butcher. Anyway...

112
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:37,750
Tutor is great. She's into
all the same things I'm into.

113
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:39,319
Well, so am I.

114
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,555
I don't want to sound as
insecure as I really am,

115
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:44,557
but you're not trying to replace
me with that Tutor chick, are you?

116
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,193
Harper...

117
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:51,497
...you're wearing a dress
made of fruit roll snacks.

118
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,199
No one could ever replace you.
Believe me.

119
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:57,470
[sighs] Good, because I may
not be your wizard friend,

120
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,472
but I'm definitely
your best friend.

121
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,774
Got a problem with that!?

122
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:05,744
No.

123
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:10,015
Hey, Alex. There you go. Thank you.

124
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,986
Since your father is out of town,
he won't know if we close up early.

125
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:17,490
How about I treat you gu to
makeovers at the department store?

126
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,625
Makeovers?

127
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,961
Where stuck-up girls
make snooty faces at us,

128
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:24,063
while they pluck our
eyebrows until we scream,

129
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:27,534
and then tell us, "You'd be pretty
if you took care of your skin"? Pass.

130
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,505
This is not what I imagined
having a girl would be like.

131
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,409
So you think it'd be OK if I brought
my shillelagh to The Leprechaun Grill?

132
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:37,877
Where else would you take it?

133
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:42,481
Mom, this is Max's tutor.

134
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:45,117
Guess what? We're going
to The Leprechaun Grill.

135
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:46,986
Hi, I'm Theresa.

136
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,823
I'd ask you to come with us to get
makeovers, but you're already so beautiful.

137
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,325
Way to boost our
self-esteem up, Mom.

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,593
Oooh. I'd love to go.

139
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:59,229
Really? Oh, great. I'll go get
my purse. Justin, close up.

140
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:05,866
I'm disappointed in you, Tutor. I thought
we were on a nice road to friendship until
now.

141
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,002
Oh, Alex, I'm sorry.

142
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:11,838
I thought you might enjoy making fun of the
face-dance Sallys who work behind the
makeup counter.

143
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:15,774
Oh, my gosh! I totally
call them that too!

144
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:17,910
We're so back on the
road to friendship.

145
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:31,924
- This is The Leprechaun Grill?
- Yeah.

146
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,527
By the way, I love your green tuxedo,
Justin. The shillelagh really makes it.

147
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:37,962
Thanks.

148
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:39,897
What's wrong?

149
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:42,800
Nothing, I mean,
I'm glad to be here with you.

150
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:45,936
It's just I thought there'd be real
leprechauns running around here.

151
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,940
This is... Look, these workers
are just dressed as leprechauns.

152
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:54,376
Yeah, but I heard they train their
workers to act just like leprechauns.

153
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:56,511
What the hay.

154
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,149
[bored voice] Sure and Begorrah,
welcome to The Leprechaun Grill.

155
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:08,220
Would you like to try our new
Pot-'O-Gold Mini Tostadas?

156
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,924
Mini Tostadas?

157
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,027
Is there anything here
that's genuine leprechaun?

158
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,962
There's a leprechaun
in a box over there.

159
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:26,233
Whatcha be lookin' at?!

160
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,638
[whispering] Why is he in there?

161
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,741
Corporate makes us have a leprechaun
to make the place look real.

162
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,644
Plus, that one's a little grouchy
so we have to keep him in that box.

163
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,981
So, you gonna order something?

164
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,683
Hey, guys. Wow.

165
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:50,087
Only you could make a green tuxedo
stand out in a leprechaun joint.

166
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:53,223
What are you doing here, Alex?

167
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:55,058
I came to bring you your wallet.

168
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,593
I didn't forget my wallet.
I have mine right here.

169
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:00,229
Then good thing I made you check.

170
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:02,397
Hey, Tutor.

171
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:06,301
How fun was it telling that make-over
girl she had to put a bag over her head

172
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:08,302
because she was too beautiful?

173
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,870
And she did it!

174
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:13,039
It's official:
Make-over girls are dumb.

175
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:15,174
[all laugh]

176
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:18,443
Guess what? There's troll wrestling
at the Wizardome. Wanna go?

177
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:19,910
Sure.

178
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:21,411
Alex, we're on a date.

179
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:24,413
Oh, relax, Justin. Wrestling
doesn't start for another hour.

180
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:28,783
You can finish your date while I
poke that leprechaun with your stick.

181
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,024
[growling]

182
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,095
That's a lot of anger
in a tiny body.

183
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,233
A bully hippogriff is
riding off with your bike.

184
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:46,667
What do you do to stop him?

185
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:49,136
Archery and plumbing is the way

186
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,972
to keep that thief
from getting away.

187
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:54,375
Yay! Excellent! Good job!

188
00:10:58,213 --> 00:10:59,813
I caught a hippogriff.

189
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:11,358
Stop messing around, dude.
Tutor's trying to help you.

190
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:14,994
Actually, that was part of a practice quiz.
Max is doing pretty well.

191
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,630
Oh, yeah. I'm doing pretty well.

192
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:21,532
- At what?
- [door opens]

193
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:24,034
Hey, Tutor. Wanna go
to the wizard mall

194
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,536
and watch cyclopses
try on sunglasses?

195
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:29,072
First of all,
it's not "cyclopses-es-es."

196
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:32,208
It's just cyclops.

197
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,010
Who cares?

198
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:39,649
And second, I was gonna ask Tutor
to do something with me first.

199
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,518
Oh, OK. Let's go, Tutor.

200
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:45,422
Sorry, I can't go with
either of you. - Oh, come on.

201
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,558
I've got to finish
tutoring Max for this test

202
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:49,293
so I can move on
to my next student.

203
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,730
[both] You're gonna leave?

204
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:54,365
Yep.

205
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,401
Well, yeah, but we
can still be friends

206
00:11:57,436 --> 00:11:59,037
and do stuff together, right?

207
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,506
No. The Wizard Council
has a strict policy

208
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,908
about tutors hanging around
after their work is done.

209
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:07,611
Anyway, if you guys don't mind,
we've got to get back to studying.

210
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:12,349
Studying. That's what we're doing.

211
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,084
Yes!

212
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:20,157
She can't leave.

213
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:23,127
She's the first wizard girl I've
ever met who's actually normal.

214
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:26,797
Most wizard girls are all like,
"Hee hee hee, I'm a wizard!

215
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:29,799
Wizard girls don't talk like that.

216
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,801
In my mind they do.

217
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:35,005
You didn't have a chance with
her anyway, 'cause you're all,

218
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,609
[in deep voice] "I'm Alex.
I'm so tough I don't need to be nice."

219
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,178
I don't talk like that.

220
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:42,914
In my mind you do.

221
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:46,384
It doesn't matter anyway.
Max ruined it for us.

222
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:49,721
I can't believe the kid
picks now to start learning.

223
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,527
Well, you know,
the test isn't until tomorrow,

224
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:58,597
Maybe we can find a couple of
tutors to help him unlearn.

225
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:01,801
Where are we going to find a
couple of tutors at this late hour?

226
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:04,003
I know. Let me call someone.

227
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:05,037
[sighs]

228
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,372
[dialing]

229
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:10,042
[cell phone rings]

230
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:13,545
Hello?

231
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:16,480
He... Oh!

232
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:20,286
- Us.
- Yes.

233
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,103
When in doubt, inside out.

234
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,476
I did it. [chuckles] I'm going
to ace Tutor's wand quiz.

235
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:34,678
[door opens]

236
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,447
What did you do?

237
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:41,017
Oh, I released the sand
from that defective bottle.

238
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,222
Anyway, I'm gonna get some rest and
turn in early. Goodnight, guys.

239
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:54,095
Yep, turn in early.
First sign of a quitter.

240
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,364
What? I've studied hard,
I've read all my spell workbooks

241
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,534
and practiced my wand-eye
coordination. Oh...

242
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:04,370
Ha! The real key to acing
a test is not any of that.

243
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:05,772
It isn't?

244
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:10,443
It isn't. No.

245
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:13,679
Let me give you some
of my secret wand tips.

246
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:19,117
For example, you should choke up
on your wand for better control.

247
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,222
And the value of sleep is a myth.

248
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:28,092
You need to stay awake and let your brain
soak up all the studying you've done.

249
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:30,927
And the best way to do
that is to chill out

250
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:35,864
and watch the all-night
Unicorn Attack marathon

251
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:38,099
on the Wizcovery Channel.

252
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:41,702
[man on TV] We don't know
who was more surprised,

253
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:43,636
the unicorn or our cameraman.

254
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,503
[cameraman on TV grunts]

255
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,107
I know what you guys
are trying to do.

256
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,009
- I knew it wouldn't work.
- Hold on.

257
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,344
What do you think we're
trying to do, Max?

258
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:00,716
You guys... are trying
to help me pass the quiz.

259
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,818
See? False alarm. [chuckles]

260
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:11,625
OK.

261
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:17,363
You didn't get that one,
but let's try this one.

262
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:20,732
Water to stardust.

263
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,434
Wait.

264
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:31,574
OK, go.

265
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:36,410
- Stardust!
- [whirring]

266
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:38,612
[Max] Oh!

267
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,584
- Aw, man.
- [door opens]

268
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:48,255
What was that noise?

269
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:54,961
We were just outside talking about how
great Max must be doing on his quiz.

270
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,565
I don't... I don't understand.
He was making great progress.

271
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:01,969
What happened, Max? - I don't know.
Alex and Justin even helped me...

272
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,270
- Not really.
- [chuckles]

273
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,238
Well, unfortunately
he failed the quiz.

274
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:08,774
- What a shame.
- Oh, that's such... Oh, man.

275
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,509
I guess I can't leave yet.

276
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:11,743
Awesome! Tutor.

277
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,996
What's your record for sneaking into
the movies in one day? Mine's five.

278
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:19,534
Tutor, the Ancient Robe and
Hat exhibit just opened up

279
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:22,471
at the Wiz-sonian Institute.
You want to go with me to the museum?

280
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,176
Being with you is like being at a museum.
Not much to look at, and you're instantly
bored.

281
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,878
[Justin] Yeah.

282
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:30,547
Why don't you guys go.
I'm gonna think of something better.

283
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:38,092
[sighs]

284
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:42,500
[sighs loudly]

285
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:47,002
Max, why are you sighing?

286
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:49,438
I'm not. I'm just
taking a deep breath,

287
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:52,240
because I'm disappointed and sad.

288
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:55,476
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

289
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,278
Mom, I failed the wand quiz.

290
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:01,914
Oh. I'm sorry.

291
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:03,515
What happened?

292
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,584
I don't know. Alex and
Justin even helped me study.

293
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:10,253
Alex helped you study, huh?

294
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:13,622
Yeah, they showed me a
new way to hold my wand

295
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,125
and they helped me relax
by watching TV all night.

296
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,360
One question, honey.

297
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:22,863
How did Justin and Alex react
when you failed the quiz?

298
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:26,199
Happy. Then sad.

299
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:30,135
Tutor said she had to stay.
Then happy again.

300
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:32,937
Max, your brother and sister

301
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:34,705
tricked you into failing the quiz

302
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:36,473
just so Tutor wouldn't
have to leave yet.

303
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:37,974
They used me?

304
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,775
Yes, they did!

305
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,410
As your mother, I have to tell you

306
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:43,411
that taking revenge on
your brother and sister

307
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,879
is not something I wanna hear.

308
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:47,581
I didn't say revenge.

309
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:49,282
I know. I know you didn't say it.

310
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:52,351
I'm just saying if you said it,
I don't wanna hear it.

311
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,553
If only there was a way
to get back at them.

312
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:59,857
Oh, getting back at them.
That would be just fine.

313
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,626
[both laugh]

314
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,961
I can't believe it.
We snuck into seven movies.

315
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,963
Yeah, we had a blast. Tutor,
you know, you're a great friend.

316
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:12,933
You are, too. I'm sorry that soon Max won't
need me anymore. Then I'll have to leave.

317
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,702
Oh, I'm not too worried about that.

318
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:17,904
Psst! Hey!

319
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,474
Oh, hey, it's Cranky O'Shorty.

320
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:25,376
I'm famished.
I've been working all day.

321
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,511
Can you spare some of those spuds?

322
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:30,180
You mean one of these?

323
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:33,116
[chuckles] Nope.

324
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:36,119
Hey! Give it here!

325
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:40,156
Tutor, I got us the tickets to
the Wiz-sonian. There you go.

326
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,592
Too late. She already said
she wanted to be my friend.

327
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:44,828
You did?

328
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:47,497
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
you and I can't go out, too.

329
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:50,532
[Justin and Alex groan]

330
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,767
Um, look, Tutor, being my friend

331
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:55,703
and also his girlfriend
isn't gonna work for us.

332
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:58,138
We try to keep our
lives very separate.

333
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:01,941
Yeah. We find it's better
for everyone that way.

334
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,709
- Mostly me.
- [door opens]

335
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:07,146
Well, well, well.

336
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,849
If it isn't my brother and sister with
their favorite person in the world,

337
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,184
my tutor, Tutor.

338
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,619
Max, are you angry about something?

339
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:19,356
Yes, I am. Let me tell you
what that something is.

340
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,558
Your new best friend and boyfriend

341
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:23,493
messed me up on purpose so
that I would fail the test

342
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:24,727
and you wouldn't have to leave.

343
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,969
Max, Max, Max, listen to yourself.

344
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,637
Your loving brother and sister

345
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:38,173
conspiring against you
and your wizard training

346
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:41,143
just for their own selfish reasons?

347
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:44,446
Doesn't that sound ridiculous?

348
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:50,552
Well, yeah, I guess it does.

349
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:53,788
I'm sorry I accused you guys.

350
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,794
[groans] We did it!

351
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:01,662
What are you doing? I had it sold!

352
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:04,599
Living with that lie was giving
me stress-related symptoms.

353
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:08,770
OK, I can't believe it.
You back-stabbed your little brother?

354
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:12,907
Alex and I were blinded.
We wanted her all to ourselves.

355
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,543
We're sorry. Would you forgive us?

356
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:22,582
OK, but I've got to
get back at you first

357
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:24,217
'cause I kind of promised Mom.

358
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,887
What?

359
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:31,324
Yeah. And I think I'll use
something Tutor taught me.

360
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,630
When in doubt, inside out.

361
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,834
Blarney, I'm out! Thank you, lad.

362
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:44,138
Now, I can turn me wrath
on that evil lass.

363
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:47,308
[chuckles] Uh, how about
those spuds you wanted?

364
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:48,909
In fact, you can have them all.

365
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:51,812
Nah. Me thinks I'll
bite something else.

366
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:54,214
[growling]

367
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,385
You! [screams]

368
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,720
[both scream]

369
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:12,931
Ooh! Ouch! Ouch.
OK, easy. Sensitive.

370
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,433
I hate leprechauns.

371
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:17,035
And I hate what you
guys did to Max.

372
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,471
He has a lot of talent
but he can't focus it

373
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:22,274
because of all the
dysfunction in this family.

374
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:24,109
What do you mean?

375
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:26,912
We're not that dysfunctional.

376
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:30,348
Oh, no?

377
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:33,017
OK, you sabotaged
your little brother

378
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:35,418
and then your mother told
him to get back at you.

379
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:38,889
In all my years of tutoring I have
never seen anything like this.

380
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:42,560
Well, then I, uh...

381
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,763
...I guess this is goodbye.

382
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:48,833
I just feel like I'm
gonna miss you. - Me, too.

383
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,234
Of course you are. I'm part elf.

384
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:53,135
You are?

385
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,270
Yeah. I thought you knew that.

386
