<i><font color=cyan>Resync By Armiawan</font></i>

3
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:59,721
Alex Russo, you kneel before
the Crystals of Justice

4
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:05,622
where you are charged with treason for
attempting to destroy the mortal world.

5
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:08,754
I'm telling you, you have the wrong wizard.

6
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:09,766
Silence!

7
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:13,668
Ok, I am right here. You
do not have to yell.

8
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:19,389
What I was trying to say is that,
ok, maybe some bad things happened,

9
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,779
and maybe it was because of me, but
that doesn't mean it was my fault.

10
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,648
I'd make a terrible lawyer.

11
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,508
Your fate has been decided.

12
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:31,593
The Crystal Cavern of Justice
hereby find you guilty!

13
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:35,330
Wait! No! Isn't there some way
we can replay what happened

14
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:37,332
so you would know I'm innocent?

15
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,978
Well, almost innocent.

16
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,653
You're not speaking of the
time vortex, are you?

17
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:44,920
Well, if that's what you call
a rewind button, then yeah.

18
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:49,922
Very well. We will send you back
to the moment this incident began.

19
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,975
All right. Well, get your
popcorn and licorice

20
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:57,196
because you're going to
like how this got started.

21
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:10,660
I just love drive-in movies. You can
yell at the screen and nobody cares.

22
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:16,316
Hey, genius, the walls are oozing
maggots, why are you taking a shower?

23
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:18,357
Alex...

24
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:25,804
Your own personal drive-in?!
Get rid of it now.

25
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:29,139
Come on, dad. I can get you your own car
and you can watch the movie with us.

26
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,391
I can get you a Churro truck.

27
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:34,273
Lose it.

28
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:36,194
Fine.

29
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,090
And whose car was that?

30
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,293
I don't know, but there's
some guy out on Waverly Place

31
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:43,299
who's been looking for his car for about
an hour, show me some love, Harper.

32
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,154
- Yeah.
- Harper, don't high-five her.

33
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:47,900
What she did was wrong and
unbelievably selfish.

34
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,779
Well, we left the guy
half a pack of licorice.

35
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,333
No, we didn't.

36
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:54,938
Dad, what's the big deal? I've
always done stuff like this.

37
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,347
Right, but now that
you're The Family Wizard,

38
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:01,023
it's time to stop using
magic for selfish reasons.

39
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:04,139
Now give me that popcorn.

40
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,280
Thank you so much, Mason.

41
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,457
Ok, you and Alex can hang up the banner.

42
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,939
Harper, get the ice cream
cake out of the freezer.

43
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,641
Jerry, stop eating popcorn off the floor.

44
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:18,602
Wait, did you say party? For who?

45
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:21,291
I have a fair inkling.

46
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,544
Another party for Justin?!

47
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:26,308
We're just so excited about
him taking over WizTech.

48
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,619
It's a big deal.

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,425
Yeah. I guess you're right.

50
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:32,451
It's not like, you know,
actually winning the

51
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:35,058
family competition and
becoming the full wizard.

52
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:37,212
Since nobody ever threw me a party.

53
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,236
Hey, I didn't get a party
or get to become a wizard.

54
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:44,573
I just got these all-you-can-eat
bologna scraps.

55
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:48,024
Mm-mm. Maybe I am the winner.

56
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:50,671
Come on, everybody. We've
got a lot of work to do.

57
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:54,512
Justin's going to be here soon.

58
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:59,052
All right, I'm done. Where's my magazine?

59
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:01,896
Mason, rub my shoulders.
That was hard work.

60
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,358
Hey! I just told you,

61
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:07,984
magic is not for getting what you
want or using it for selfish reasons.

62
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:10,704
Mason, stop rubbing her shoulders!

63
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,385
That's right, Mija, you should use your

64
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,927
magic to make other people's lives easier.

65
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:19,154
I know a pretty Latina who would love
to never have to do laundry again.

66
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:20,308
Theresa.

67
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:23,500
Sorry. Your father's right.
It's time to grow up.

68
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:27,892
"Grow up?" Everybody knows people
who grow up too fast are miserable.

69
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,250
I mean, look at Harper.

70
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:32,638
She's been doing her parents' laundry
since she was in the second grade.

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,777
Oh, see, the laundry I didn't mind so much.

72
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:37,586
It was rotating the tires
on the minivan that just...

73
00:04:37,587 --> 00:04:40,407
Really got to me.

74
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,467
Where's Justin? He should've
been here by now.

75
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:47,730
You mean he's not here?

76
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:50,815
I'm so bored I thought he was here
telling one of his nerdy stories

77
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:55,196
that always ends with "hey,
wake up, everybody!"

78
00:04:56,805 --> 00:05:00,180
I'm so sorry for the intrusion.
I'm Justin's friend Dominic.

79
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:01,813
He asked me to give you a message.

80
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:05,086
He is too busy at WizTech and
unfortunately cannot come.

81
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:08,739
Ok. Give us the message.

82
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,860
Uh... that was the message.

83
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:14,594
Ok. Can we start from the top? Because
this guy is all over the place.

84
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:18,801
- So is Justin all right?
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Russo. Justin is fine.

85
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:22,604
It's just more difficult for someone with
his spectacular talents to get away.

86
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,673
Now, I don't usually use
the word "spectacular,"

87
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:28,634
but in Justin's case, spectacular.

88
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:31,923
Justin isn't coming? What are we
gonna do with the ice cream cake.

89
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:35,517
Oh, I'm sure you'll think
of something, Jerry.

90
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:39,292
Excuse me, you must be Alex Russo.

91
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:43,482
You're quite famous in the Wizard World
but I had no idea you were so...

92
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:45,185
Beautiful.

93
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:48,311
Oh, come on. I'm not that famous.

94
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:51,909
Dominic. Nice to meet you, mate.
I'm Mason Greyback.

95
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,551
Perhaps you've heard of me,
Alex's Werewolf boyfriend.

96
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:58,078
Boyfriend? You're a lucky man.

97
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:01,879
Yes, I am. A lucky Werewolf.

98
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:08,321
Well, it seems like I've made
this awkward, forgive me.

99
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:11,959
It was an honor meeting you, Alex.
So long, everyone.

100
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,120
Werewolf.

101
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:20,667
Boy, he was the most polite
wizard I have ever met.

102
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,636
And easy on the eyes.

103
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:26,117
Reminded me of a young me.

104
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:29,241
You know, I think he was into you, Alex.

105
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:30,753
Oh. No, no, no, no.

106
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:33,698
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

107
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,529
I can't believe Justin's not coming.

108
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,284
I wanted him to be here
for my big announcement.

109
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:42,269
A while ago, I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela, in Italy,

110
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,123
inviting us to a Russo family reunion.

111
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,671
It's ok, dad. What's your announcement?

112
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:51,430
- That was the announcement.
- Oh, great, now dad's all over the place.

113
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:55,804
Aw, Jerry, you're taking me on a
romantic trip to Italy, I love you.

114
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,637
Well... actually, I'm
taking the whole family.

115
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:02,414
Why? They don't know we have kids.

116
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:06,115
But, Theresa, it's a family reunion.
Or should I say...

117
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:09,015
Riunione di famiglia?

118
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,688
Please don't do that, dad.

119
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:14,773
It's almost as annoying as
when you say "mootsa-rella".

120
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:17,557
Well, you guys have fun.

121
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:21,093
I'll just stay here and read or something.

122
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:24,297
Yeah, and I'll just stay here
and chew up the furniture.

123
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:28,018
This couch looks pretty fruity.

124
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,669
You guys are family, too. I got
tickets for all of us to go.

125
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,606
- Oh yay!
- All right!

126
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:38,377
Tickets? Dad, if you want to go to
Italy, I can be our travel agent.

127
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:44,278
No time for that travel confusion. Show
me the door to our Italian reunion.

128
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:51,357
Ok, I don't know how to say
"Wizard Speed Pass" in Italian,

129
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:54,192
so I'm just going to go with "Mamma Mia!"

130
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:57,133
Or at least I think that's Italian.

131
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:02,572
A door to Japan? How cool.

132
00:08:03,703 --> 00:08:05,937
It's Italy.

133
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:09,575
I don't know all the towns in Japan, dude.

134
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:13,762
Alex, you're not going to turn this trip
into one of your selfish shortcuts.

135
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:16,381
I want us to experience the whole journey.

136
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:19,052
Getting there is half the fun.

137
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:22,593
Now, get rid of this thing.

138
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,710
Whoa.

139
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,306
Did you just see that girl?

140
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,262
Alex, I have to get her number first.

141
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:34,090
Max, get back here!

142
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:37,871
Would you please grow up?! Max!

143
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:44,436
Ok, let's just find Max and go home.

144
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:47,734
So we can fly back here.

145
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,035
Wow! Look at this place.

146
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,990
Oh. It's beautiful.

147
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:03,105
Your family lives here?

148
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:04,862
Villa di Russo.

149
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:09,700
I don't know who "Villa di" is,
but Russo is definitely me.

150
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,570
I don't think he's mad at you anymore.

151
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:16,654
Oh, don't be fooled. He's happy
anywhere there's cheese hanging.

152
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,510
Man. I lost her.

153
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:22,414
I didn't even get her name,
but she looked like a Tomiko.

154
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:25,405
Tomiko! Tomiko!

155
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,153
Max. Forget the girl. We've
got girls back home.

156
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:32,089
Yeah, but there's no
Italians in New York, Mom.

157
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,859
Oh, come on. Can't we stay a little longer?

158
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,828
This is the first time Alex's magic
took me somewhere that didn't scare me.

159
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,865
No. We're not coming to Italy this way.

160
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:43,768
We're going to experience a
family trip the real way.

161
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,664
You mean on a discount flight in
cramped seats with bad food and

162
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:51,876
an obnoxious kid in front of you
saying, "peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo".

163
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,277
Ciao, bella.

164
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:58,215
Are you here for a tour
of the Russo vineyard?

165
00:09:58,216 --> 00:10:00,916
Well... I, uh...

166
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:03,087
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

167
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:07,305
We're not here for the tour, paisan.
Go back to work.

168
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,189
And put a shirt on! All right, let's go.

169
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,729
Ok, fine. But you'll only
have yourself to blame

170
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,314
when that peek-a-boo kid uses
your lap for a barf bag.

171
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:21,915
All right, is everybody here?

172
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:25,746
Good. Now, Alex, get rid of this thing.

173
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:27,547
Ok.

174
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:32,548
Hmm... the spell I need is
like things in my bedroom.

175
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,852
It's buried under the
dirty clothes of my mind.

176
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:40,857
You see? Justin would never do a spell
that he didn't know how to undo.

177
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:44,354
Oh, I get it. I get this
whole "grown-up" thing now.

178
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,844
You think Justin should've
been The Family Wizard.

179
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:49,615
Honey, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean it that way.

180
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:55,319
No. I'm sorry I'm not the grown-up
Family Wizard you want me to be.

181
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,220
Well, up until then, that was the best
five-minute vacation I've ever had.

182
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:21,321
Ahem, excuse me, is this Jumbotron taken?

183
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:23,273
Dominic? What are you doing here?

184
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:27,094
My night job is cleaning
the back of the Jumbotron.

185
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,134
You being here is just a bonus.

186
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:32,790
Look, you seem really nice,
but I have a boyfriend.

187
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,942
And to be honest I don't think I'd
be really good company right now.

188
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:39,350
Unless you're a fan of big,
sloppy emotional meltdowns.

189
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:41,042
You know, I was just saying this morning,

190
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:44,728
I haven't seen a big, sloppy
emotional meltdown in a while.

191
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:48,029
Let's see what you got.

192
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,637
Ah, a smile.

193
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,928
Have you ever considered
joining The Wizard Council?

194
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,863
The Wizard Council?

195
00:11:56,864 --> 00:12:01,448
Isn't that for old geezers who wear robes
because they're tired of shopping?

196
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,060
I just believe you have the
potential to be the most,

197
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:07,007
powerful wizard of your generation.

198
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:11,778
Trust me. You have no idea
what you're truly capable of.

199
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,083
Well, if you ask my family,

200
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:17,851
I'm not capable of anything
except refusing to grow up.

201
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:22,201
They're mortals. They can't
understand wizards with your power.

202
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:24,524
Besides, if their opinions
really bothers you,

203
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:30,425
you're powerful enough to create your own
spell to smooth out your little edges.

204
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:33,790
Why are you telling me this?

205
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:39,191
Because where everyone else
sees trouble, I see magic.

206
00:12:40,307 --> 00:12:42,647
And beauty.

207
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:46,211
Ok, now you're just flirting.

208
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,046
Yeah, a little bit.

209
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,604
- Here. It's a small gift.
- Oh, no. I can't take that.

210
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:55,565
It's simply a friendship bracelet.

211
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:59,959
Everything ok up here?

212
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,929
Oh, yeah. Mason, sorry. I just had
to get away from home, you know.

213
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,700
And I just came to check on her.
I apologize if I've overstepped.

214
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,703
You have, mate, and I'm here now.

215
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:12,964
Werewolf.

216
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,780
- Good-bye, Alex.
- Bye.

217
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:19,364
Werewolf.

218
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:24,650
I do not like that guy.

219
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:26,952
Anything I should be worried about?

220
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:28,120
Not a thing.

221
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,240
Good. Well, I've got a
surprise to cheer you up.

222
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,891
I thought we would have a little picnic.

223
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:37,593
Don't say Italian, because I've
had enough of that, today.

224
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:42,274
No. I was thinking
something sophisticated...

225
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:46,364
- Poached salmon.
- Oh, Mason...

226
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:48,506
That's so sweet.

227
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:51,010
But can I make a little tweak?

228
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,891
Of course, darling.

229
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:58,112
Check it out, finger food feast.
I call the wing.

230
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:01,064
No, Alex! Alex, you know
this food is bad for you.

231
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:04,928
Besides, I cooked that salmon,
two hours over a hot poacher.

232
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:09,465
Why? You know it only takes
me like two seconds.

233
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:12,770
I see. So, this is how it's
going to be from now on.

234
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:17,031
- What?
- Just you, me and your wand.

235
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:22,194
Just using your magic selfishly
no matter who it hurts.

236
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,414
Mason, where are you going?
I did all this for us.

237
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:28,695
So did I.

238
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:42,579
So you turned Mason's classy picnic
into a county fair fry-fest?

239
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,579
Well, everybody knows that
my favorite food comes in

240
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,163
cardboard containers with
some kind of dipping sauce.

241
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,487
Ewe.

242
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:56,388
Oh, hi, Alex. Can you tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

243
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,336
Everything you're wearing
is from the nineties.

244
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:04,001
Oh, but if you guys wear
it, it's "vintage".

245
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:06,169
Have you figured out how to
get rid of this thing yet?

246
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,577
Uh, no. I've been a little busy.

247
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:14,478
But don't worry, I'll figure it out
something before Max can use it again.

248
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:19,783
Hey, who wants to help me
make a hot tub out of this?

249
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:22,409
I bet I know how he's going
to make the bubbles.

250
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,989
Max, stop going to Italy. And, Alex, you...

251
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,753
I know, I know. Grow up.

252
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:31,979
You're right, pop. I'll
just take this back.

253
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,554
rr

254
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,530
Max, you forgot the barrel!

255
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:36,391
Max!

256
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:39,402
He's not coming back, is he?

257
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,305
Theresa, we have to find Max again!

258
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,776
What?! I was about to make dinner.

259
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:50,097
It's just Italy, we'll be right back.

260
00:15:57,388 --> 00:16:00,148
Hey, are you ok?

261
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,618
It's just that, I thought once
I became The Family Wizard,

262
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:06,896
all of this pressure would be off of me.

263
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:10,866
But no, it's like everybody
still wants me to change.

264
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,968
Well, that doesn't make a lot of sense.

265
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:16,201
It's who you are in the first place
that made you The Family Wizard.

266
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:21,844
I know, but maybe growing up
would make me a better person.

267
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,246
I mean, I can't even say anything nice

268
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,415
about my best friend's
hideous clambake outfit.

269
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,384
I'm sorry, Harper. I held
off as long as I could.

270
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:32,804
But you see? That's what I mean. You
making fun of my outfit is you.

271
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:35,224
And me loving this outfit is me.

272
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,293
People should appreciate
you for who you are,

273
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:41,063
not for what they think you should be.

274
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:46,687
Right. And I am a powerful wizard
who can change if I want to.

275
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:49,283
Just smooth out my little edges.

276
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:52,149
Wait, hold up. Ok, so,
after my great speech,

277
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,993
you're still going to change
your personality with magic?

278
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,058
Well, just the parts that nobody likes.

279
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:59,307
So, you're going to change
your whole personality?

280
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:00,867
I owed you for the clambake comment.

281
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:04,352
- All right.
- Yeah, that's good.

282
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:06,458
Selfish, mean and tired of rejection.

283
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,019
Take these parts to a place of reflection.

284
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:13,834
Alex, are you ok?

285
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:16,994
I think so. Did it work?

286
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:19,942
I don't know. You look the same.
Here, let me test you.

287
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:22,203
What do you think of my clambake outfit?

288
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:25,141
Mm. It's horrible...

289
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,540
That you didn't make me one.

290
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:30,736
- Oh, it worked!
- I'm totally nice!

291
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,615
Wait.

292
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:35,950
If you still have all your good parts,
where did all your bad parts go?

293
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:39,254
Hey! Let me out of here, you ugly hags!

294
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,090
And I found my bad parts.

295
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:44,500
Oh, come on. She doesn't seem that bad.

296
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:47,649
I can smell that nasty outfit
all the way from here!

297
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,866
- Oh, I am not afraid of you!
- Well, come and get me, lobster girl!

298
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:55,707
Harper, don't let me taunt you.

299
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:58,831
Hey, maybe she's like a bird.

300
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:01,468
She'll be quiet if we cover her up.

301
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:04,409
Hey! Take this off!

302
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:13,549
Oh, Alex. You have no
idea what you've started.

303
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,554
Did you find Max?

304
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:30,355
No.

305
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,324
But I found out where my
cousins keep their cannolis.

306
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:37,578
Jerry, you're supposed to be
looking for your son, not dessert.

307
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:40,433
Let me have a bite of that. Come on.

308
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,874
- Oh, Max!
- Where?

309
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:44,674
Oh!

310
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:45,908
Mmm.

311
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,613
Let's just go home and try to
lure Max back with this cannoli.

312
00:18:49,614 --> 00:18:51,710
- Ok.
- What I'm saying.

313
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,779
There's not going to be any left.

314
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,314
- Let's get a couple to go.
- Ok.

315
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:00,433
Where are you going? Thieves!

316
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:04,091
Buon giorno. We're just
looking for our son.

317
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:07,032
We're not stealing.

318
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:13,825
Carmela? Cousin Carmela?

319
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:16,402
Jerry Russo!

320
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:20,363
Bianca, Gino, put your wands down.

321
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:22,466
Geraldo!

322
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:25,047
Cugino Geraldo!

323
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:30,122
Look at you. You still have a baby face.
It's so smooth.

324
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:32,684
Oh, that's just the
grease from the cannoli.

325
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:35,294
- Carmela, this is my wife, Theresa.
- Oh, Theresa!

326
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:37,845
Nice to meet... too tight.

327
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:41,837
Too thin. This one is like a bread stick.

328
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:46,768
Hey, Geraldo, what are you doing here?
The reunion isn't for month, huh?

329
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,189
Oh, who cares? Let's eat.

330
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,367
- Benvenuto!
- Max.

331
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,846
I'm sorry. I just love meeting people.
Hi, Max Russo.

332
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:04,606
We have been looking all over for you.

333
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:07,184
This is our son, Max. I'm sorry.

334
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,763
He saw a pretty girl through the Wizard
Speed Pass and came to find her.

335
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:13,090
You have a Wizard Speed Pass?

336
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:15,436
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

337
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:19,030
Only the most powerful
wizards can create those.

338
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:22,733
Ah, but your Family Wizard, Alex Russo.

339
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:26,325
Yes. Alex is very powerful, and very...

340
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,786
Irresponsible!

341
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:35,210
Just because you say it loud and weird
doesn't make it Italian, Jerry.

342
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:39,316
There's that girl. I have to meet her.

343
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,385
She might be the future Mrs. Max Russo.

344
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:44,221
Mrs. Russo! Mrs. Russo!

345
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:47,522
Your son likes Francesca?

346
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:52,934
What's so funny?

347
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:56,175
Francesca is his cousin!

348
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,070
Ewe.

349
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:04,440
Theresa, did Geraldo tell you that we were
wizards in training at the same time?

350
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:07,053
We had so much fun.

351
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:11,374
Geraldo, remember I used to tickle you?

352
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:15,484
Stop, stop! Get the bread stick.
Get the bread stick.

353
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:18,125
No. No, oh no.

354
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:29,498
So, what do you think about
taking accordion lessons with me?

355
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:33,469
Well, why wouldn't I?
You're my best friend.

356
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,539
It's like a dream come true.

357
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,180
Ok. I'm ready!

358
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,802
- What do you think?
- I think it's missing something.

359
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,495
- Come here.
- Oh.

360
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:50,019
- Oh, this is the best day of my life.
- Oh, I'm so happy you're happy.

361
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,155
Thank you, Alex. You're such a good friend.

362
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:54,377
- Now, take it off.
- What, why?

363
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:57,790
Because even though I love that you finally
appreciate something I like to do,

364
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,718
it's just not you and,
I don't need it to be.

365
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,761
Thank you.

366
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:05,404
Besides, I can pull off a clambake outfit.

367
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:09,065
On you, it just looks stupid.

368
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:12,008
What was that?

369
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:15,879
Oh! Something I think is going
to take up the rest of the day.

370
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,760
Harper, grab the fishing net.
We might need it to catch me.

371
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:28,557
Yup. I broke out.

372
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:30,501
Ok, where would a Bad Alex go?

373
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:34,520
Usually, only as far as the
couch, but that door is open.

374
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,741
Oh, gosh.

375
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:39,835
What are you doing?

376
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:45,736
You know, I really should have
made a shawl out of this net.

377
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,388
Carmela, this cheese is amazing.

378
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:53,282
Oh yeah, Papa Fabrizio makes it.

379
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:55,083
Eh.

380
00:22:57,231 --> 00:23:01,156
We need find me before
I do something bad...

381
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:04,126
Hi, Mom and dad. Guess what? I've changed.

382
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:08,327
Yeah, into a third grade art project.

383
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,697
No, no, no. Not that, dad. Guess what?

384
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:13,825
All the part of me that has all
of those bad things is gone.

385
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,546
Yup. Gone. Nowhere to be seen.

386
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:19,333
Unless of course you've seen it.

387
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:22,044
Mom, dad, from now on I promise...

388
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:26,549
To be the unselfish grown-up
you expect me to be.

389
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,426
I don't believe her.

390
00:23:29,427 --> 00:23:31,086
Me neither.

391
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:34,022
Seriously, why are you
wearing a clambake outfit?

392
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:35,958
Because my best friend asked me to.

393
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:41,719
Dad, sometimes you need to do
things to make others happy.

394
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:44,843
Now, I definitely don't believe her.

395
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:48,712
Look, I still don't like
the way we got here...

396
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:52,790
But they're feeding us. So you
might as well meet the family.

397
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:57,800
Everyone, I'd like you to meet our friend
Harper, and our Family Wizard, Alex!

398
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,601
Oh.

399
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:02,550
So cute.

400
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:04,453
Pooka-pooka-pooka!

401
00:24:04,454 --> 00:24:06,117
Just like your father!

402
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:10,978
- Why is she tickling me?
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!

403
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:20,330
Excuse me, I'm looking for a girl that's
about this tall and this beautiful...

404
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,921
Hey it's you.

405
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,039
You know my name?

406
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,340
Or, wait, does it just take that
long to say my name in Italian?

407
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:38,879
I don't understand what
you're saying right now.

408
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,320
I'll try the language of love with you.

409
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:49,163
Ok, maybe you don't speak that language.

410
00:24:49,164 --> 00:24:52,033
Oh, Max. I'll save you.

411
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:54,374
Not really.

412
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:07,678
Thanks, Alex. They kiss really weird here.

413
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:11,163
All right. I'm safe in a bracelet. Thanks.

414
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:13,864
Safe or trapped?

415
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:20,531
By that evil chuckle, I'm
going to go with "trapped".

416
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:26,453
And this is where we press the
finest grapes in all of Tuscany.

417
00:25:26,454 --> 00:25:30,174
Oh, that looks like hard work.

418
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:35,125
Please. Stomping your feet isn't hard work.

419
00:25:35,203 --> 00:25:38,512
Yeah, filling bread rolls
with cold cuts all day.

420
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:41,333
That's hard work.

421
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,636
Geraldo...

422
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:45,119
Why don't you try it?

423
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
- Oh, no. No, thanks.
- Ah...

424
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:51,861
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!
- Ha-ha-ha! Ok. Ok.

425
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:54,528
- You too, Theresa.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm ok.

426
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:56,597
- Get in.
- No, no, no.

427
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,704
- Theresa, get in.
- No thank you.

428
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:00,619
Get in!

429
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,960
Si, senora.

430
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,407
It's nice to appreciate my Mom and
dad doing something together.

431
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:11,044
Old me would've just been thinking
of ways to make fun of them.

432
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,412
- Oh.
- Oh.

433
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:16,073
- Oh, it's so squishy.
- Oh.

434
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:21,087
Ugh. And the worst part
is, I kind of like it.

435
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:24,090
Thanks a lot, Jerry. You know
what this reminds me of?

436
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:28,218
The time the bathtub backed up and you
made us take showers in there anyway.

437
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:32,768
Don't blame me. You were the one who
said, "oh, handsome vineyard guy"...

438
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:37,315
"You're so strong, the way
you squash those grapes".

439
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:39,072
I never said that.

440
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:43,033
- Oh, yes, you did.
- Oh, please.

441
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:47,880
- You imagined it.
- Oh. Oh, really?

442
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,527
Your insecurities imagined it.

443
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:50,611
Aha!

444
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:52,202
Ooh.

445
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:55,955
Hey, you know, they should
really have machines for this.

446
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:57,890
- Don't you think?
- Oh!

447
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:01,311
You know what? Yes, I do.

448
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:08,164
I would never disrespect you like that!

449
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:09,921
- Oh, honey, wait.
- What?

450
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,016
You love me so much you got so jealous?

451
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:15,137
- Oh, honey...
- Good!

452
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:21,581
Aw. They found a way to make it worse
for themselves without my help.

453
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:24,702
Changing me was great.

454
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,368
My cousins! Where did they go?

455
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:46,390
Oh, no. Harper, do you think my bad side

456
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:48,732
could've done something
terrible to my parents?

457
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,873
Hmm, let's see. All of your bad
is concentrated into one you.

458
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:58,774
- Do you want to finish where that's going?
- I get it, I did it.

459
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:04,813
Where are we?

460
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:07,792
Dad. You're not going to like this.

461
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:12,063
Oh, it's just Alex. Thank you
for cleaning me up, Mija.

462
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:14,899
Now, get me out of here. It's stuffy.

463
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,604
What's your hurry? Handsome
vineyard guy waiting for you?

464
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:21,080
What are you talking about?

465
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:25,201
You're the one who had to prove what a big
macho man you were with your cold cuts.

466
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:28,034
Yeah-ha! They're delicious!

467
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:30,799
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I can't
concentrate on the evil

468
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,853
plan we have going here if you
two are flappin' your yappers.

469
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:34,862
Evil plan?

470
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:37,149
You remember when I said, "you're
not going to like this?"

471
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,858
This is what I was talking about.

472
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,259
Who's "we?"

473
00:28:43,362 --> 00:28:46,002
Excellent, Alex.

474
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:48,838
Hello, Russo's.

475
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:54,739
Hey, it's that guy. Hey, did you ever
remember that message from Justin?

476
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:05,633
Just as I thought.

477
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:10,207
Alex! You don't have to do this.

478
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:12,775
So, what's next?

479
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:18,676
How would my partner like a little
road trip to the Tower of Pisa?

480
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:27,153
Dominic is evil?

481
00:29:27,154 --> 00:29:31,224
Is it weird he's even more attractive now?

482
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:37,125
- Harper. He took my family.
- Oh yeah, right. I won't date him.

483
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:44,832
Even as a young wizard I knew
that some day my dreams...

484
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:48,068
Though disturbing, would come true.

485
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:53,073
And so, from this high vantage point, we
will launch the final steps to my plan

486
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,742
to rid the world of mortals and then...

487
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:59,756
You know, it's really kind
of killer on the calves.

488
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,878
That's a nice story, can we
get to what this thing does?

489
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:05,879
Right. This device...

490
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:07,887
Replicates spells.

491
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:10,622
Once energized with
sufficient wizard power,

492
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:13,694
it will cast a spell
repeatedly across Earth.

493
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:17,895
I call it the "Dominic One Thousand".

494
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:20,783
Is that too self-centered?

495
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:23,551
You're asking the wrong girl.

496
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:26,975
I designed the Dominic One
Thousand to imprison every mortal,

497
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:31,200
thereby paving the way for a new
Wizard World that I will rule.

498
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:34,648
- Uh, that last part again?
- That we will rule.

499
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:39,753
All that is needed is a spell cast by our
generation's most powerful wizard...

500
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,555
Alex Russo.

501
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,358
All right. Well, then let me at it.

502
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,669
No offense, you're just a knock-off.
You don't have all of her powers.

503
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,367
I have enough powers to scorch a hole
in your little purple jacket there.

504
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:55,101
Point taken.

505
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:59,446
All right. So, what if your "all
powerful" Alex doesn't come?

506
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:02,327
Oh, she'll come...

507
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:07,151
To save her family.

508
00:31:08,316 --> 00:31:14,216
Wait, wait, wait. I'm confused.
Are we tiny or are they giants?

509
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,186
So if it's called the Leaning Tower
of Pisa, where is all the pizza?

510
00:31:23,787 --> 00:31:25,707
What?

511
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:31,527
Alex, you need to come up with a plan.

512
00:31:31,528 --> 00:31:34,083
I'm not good with heights.

513
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:36,687
Or substandard architecture.

514
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:40,269
You're fine, Harper. Just don't
look down, it'll make you dizzy.

515
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,529
Oh, Too late. Dizzy. Going down.

516
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,990
Wait, Harper!

517
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,616
Oh. All right then. Ha ha.

518
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:57,486
So, this is the top of the Tower of Pisa.

519
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,255
Woo. Would you check out that view.

520
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:02,361
That is breathtaking. My
breath has been taken...

521
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:04,044
- From my lungs.
- I know, right?

522
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:05,973
- We should post this on Wiz-agram.
- We should.

523
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:11,074
- Can you take a picture?
- Yeah, let's do that.

524
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,903
Ready? Say, "cheese".

525
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:17,904
- Harper, run!
- Ah!

526
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:20,946
Yes.

527
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:24,607
Harper has joined your family in captivity.

528
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:28,417
- You let them go right now or I'll...
- You'll what?

529
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:31,286
Don't forget, I have all the bad.

530
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:33,689
Yeah, well...

531
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,824
I look really cute in that outfit.

532
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:38,494
I know. I wasn't really sure
about the boots at first but...

533
00:32:38,495 --> 00:32:40,729
Focus on the mission.

534
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,535
Yeah, I heard all about your mission.

535
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:47,159
Clear out the mortal world so that you
can make room to rule all evil wizards.

536
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,701
Good. You're up to speed.
Now, for that spell...

537
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:53,732
- Never.
- Why would you underestimate me, Alex?

538
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:56,945
Perhaps you remember my
very determined uncle.

539
00:32:56,946 --> 00:32:59,481
- He had wings.
- Gorog.

540
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:02,318
I came to finish what
you took from my uncle.

541
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,653
But where he failed, I will succeed.

542
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:07,155
My own wizard empire right here on Earth!

543
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:11,296
Ow! Why are these stupid bells here!

544
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:15,315
Maybe to knock some sense into you
because I'm never doing that spell.

545
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:18,133
My family is more important than anything.

546
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:20,141
Now give me the bracelet.

547
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:22,697
You're so stubborn with that spell.

548
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:28,518
Perhaps if I fill up one more
charm, it will convince you.

549
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:32,948
Mason!

550
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:34,749
No!

551
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:43,090
Mason. You're ok.

552
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:45,308
Get tired of Dominic already?

553
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:47,544
What? I don't care about him.

554
00:33:47,545 --> 00:33:51,799
He's some crazy wizard who's weaving some
sort of wicked web to take over the world.

555
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,025
Well, you're some kind of
wicked web weaver yourself.

556
00:33:55,026 --> 00:33:56,627
What are you talking about?

557
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:59,478
I saw you at the Villa with Dominic,
you two looked quite chummy.

558
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:01,709
No. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

559
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,779
Dominic tricked me into
casting out my bad side.

560
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,323
That's who you saw. There's
another me walking around.

561
00:34:07,324 --> 00:34:12,243
And I have to get you out of here
before she finds you. Let's go.

562
00:34:12,244 --> 00:34:15,578
I knew I wasted time with that hug.

563
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:17,859
- Two Alex's?
- Mason, get away from her.

564
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,528
She's with Dominic, and they're
trying to take over the world.

565
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:23,773
Nice try, me. Mason, she's the bad one.
Let's go.

566
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:29,674
No! Don't listen to her. I'm the good one.
She's the bad one.

567
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:33,508
Well, isn't this a sticky wicket.

568
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:35,773
Mason, please believe me.

569
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,740
She's trying to trick you.

570
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:41,821
She doesn't even know how I dress.

571
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:45,319
That is something Harper would wear.

572
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,422
No, no, no, no. I'm wearing it
because Harper asked me to.

573
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:52,623
Ok, that doesn't even sound like me.

574
00:34:57,132 --> 00:35:00,200
Thank goodness. I hope you and Dominic rot.

575
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,481
Mason, no!

576
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:17,284
- Where are we?
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa.

577
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:20,105
Oh. Very romantic.

578
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:22,688
I think so.

579
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,690
Dominic.

580
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:30,363
Oh, no.

581
00:35:31,324 --> 00:35:35,044
Aw. You picked the wrong Alex.

582
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,666
Oh. Now, this is what I call a
"take over the world" look.

583
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,187
As for you...

584
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:52,339
Max, who joined us over there?

585
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,100
Hey, it's Mason.

586
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:05,609
What have I done? I can't even
"grow up" when I try to grow up.

587
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,802
I don't even deserve to
be The Family Wizard.

588
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:11,203
Justin does.

589
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:14,265
And he'd know what to do.

590
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:16,847
Beep, beep, boop, beep, beep...

591
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:21,288
Professor Justin Vincenzo Pepe Russo is...

592
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:42,302
People should appreciate
you for who you are,

593
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:45,922
not for what they think you should be.

594
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:48,342
Harper's right.

595
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:53,546
Everybody should just get over it.

596
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:56,149
I'm not perfect, I'm just...

597
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,851
A wizard who has to save the world, again.

598
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:01,712
Ugh!

599
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:08,812
Ok, Dominic wants a spell?

600
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,786
I'll give him a spell...

601
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:15,687
With a little bit of a surprise.

602
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:25,277
Ok, I'm here to get my family back.
Let's do this.

603
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:26,712
Excellent.

604
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:31,993
Aw, she's here to save the family.
How sweet. Ugh.

605
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:37,129
Dominic, give me the bracelet, and
I'll do the spell for your machine.

606
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,370
Agreed. Give it to her.

607
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:43,647
Wait...

608
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:45,097
I know me.

609
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:48,733
We'll give her the bracelet and she'll
flash out without doing the spell.

610
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,428
Right. Spell first then the bracelet.

611
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:55,107
Nice try, but I know me, too.

612
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:58,010
I'll do the spell and you'll
keep my family anyway.

613
00:37:58,011 --> 00:37:59,590
No bracelet, no spell.

614
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:01,641
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

615
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:03,458
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

616
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,135
- Spell first!
- Not doing anything...

617
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:07,219
Spell first! Spell first!

618
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,380
Stop it!

619
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:13,423
Tower of Pisa that hurt!

620
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:18,903
Alex will cast the spell at the same time
Bad Alex gives you the bracelet, agreed?

621
00:38:18,904 --> 00:38:24,637
- That's a good idea.
- Well, why didn't you think of it first?

622
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,526
One wave, two waves, three waves, four.

623
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:30,827
Every mortal be no more.

624
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:40,956
Excellent. The world will now
be wiped clean of mortals.

625
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:45,504
Ow! And then we wipe it clean of bells.

626
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:05,229
Was this how you wanted it to work?

627
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,131
Ok, the Leaning Tower of Pisa may
not have been the ideal place

628
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:14,246
for my Dominic One Thousand,
but it's working.

629
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:18,322
Every mortal will be
imprisoned in these beads.

630
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:21,759
Are you sure you don't want
a bucket or something?

631
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,760
The bracelet, please.

632
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:29,716
You know, Alex, now is the time to join us.

633
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:33,625
With your powers, we can rule
more than just this world.

634
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:36,465
Thank you for remembering
I'm a powerful wizard.

635
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:39,814
Powerful enough that I can
undo any spell I create.

636
00:39:39,815 --> 00:39:40,819
No!

637
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,560
The mortals who were
gone before, can now...

638
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,589
What are you doing? I was
about to fix everything

639
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,758
before you guys swirled me out of there.

640
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,527
Well, if you're looking
for someone to blame,

641
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:59,329
you can just point your
fingers at yourself.

642
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,731
If you had fingers, I mean.

643
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,969
- Told you it was too soon.
- It wouldn't have mattered.

644
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,851
She's obviously stalling.

645
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:09,339
Don't you understand? The spell
replicator is still capturing mortals.

646
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,545
You have to let me go, so I
can save the world, again.

647
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:18,386
There he is! Grab him, get him!

648
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:22,741
Dominic, the Crystals of Justice recognize

649
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:25,121
you as an esteemed member of WizTech.

650
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,956
Do you have any testimony?

651
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,006
I most certainly do.

652
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:33,455
Alex Russo had no intention
to undo her spell.

653
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:37,389
She is a powerful, but selfish wizard.

654
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,282
Why does everybody keep saying that?

655
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:43,458
So powerful that she put me under her
spell to take the blame for her crime.

656
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:45,268
Spell?! He's lying!

657
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:49,272
You need look no further than the fact that
she extracted her own evil personality

658
00:40:49,273 --> 00:40:53,043
and cast the spell into
the Dominic One Thous...

659
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:55,864
Alex One Thousand.

660
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:58,421
That's what she called it.

661
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,627
Alex Russo, do you deny this?

662
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:03,334
He's twisting things. He set me up.

663
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,691
Silence!

664
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:07,326
The evidence against you is overwhelming.

665
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:11,330
After careful deliberation,
we, the Crystals of Justice,

666
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:17,231
find you guilty as charged and
sentence you to no dessert for a week!

667
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:19,104
Oh.

668
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,573
Well, that's not that bad.

669
00:41:21,574 --> 00:41:25,210
Oh, no, sorry. I was reading
the wrong subsection.

670
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:26,794
It's actually death.

671
00:41:26,795 --> 00:41:29,546
Death by chocolate?

672
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:32,487
No! Death by death!

673
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:37,022
What?! No! It's Dominic you want, not me!

674
00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:40,713
You will be incarcerated until
your sentence is carried out.

675
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:44,029
Wait! No! Please! You have to believe me!

676
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:48,470
I didn't do anything! He has my family!

677
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,201
I hope you got a last glimpse of
Alex before she meets her end.

678
00:41:58,202 --> 00:42:00,655
You won't get away with this!

679
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,491
Already have.

680
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:05,392
You have a girl's bracelet on!

681
00:42:05,393 --> 00:42:08,408
No! It's a uni-bracelet.

682
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:10,572
Dominic, if you had a spine,
you'd let me out of here,

683
00:42:10,573 --> 00:42:15,373
so you and I can settle
this like gentlemen.

684
00:42:24,435 --> 00:42:28,472
This just in, it's been reported
that people around the world

685
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:30,798
have been mysteriously disappearing.

686
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:34,819
As of now, there is no official...

687
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:43,838
Uh...

688
00:42:43,946 --> 00:42:46,851
In other news, the people of
the world are becoming...

689
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:50,392
This is bad. We should eat.

690
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:59,301
Why did I choose the Tower of Pisa?

691
00:42:59,302 --> 00:43:02,015
I'm wondering the same thing, dude.

692
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:05,010
Nonetheless, Alex is now doomed.

693
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:10,911
And best of all, her loved ones had
a front row seat to her conviction.

694
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:15,236
Dominic, one of those charms is broken.

695
00:43:17,826 --> 00:43:20,466
- Mason.
- Yep.

696
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:32,489
This is ridiculous. I've got
to try to get out of here.

697
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,950
Hello! Hello!

698
00:43:40,277 --> 00:43:43,731
I'm going to use magic to blow this
door down, so you better stand back.

699
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:47,602
And let me apologize in
advance for the mess I make.

700
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:50,423
I am really nice.

701
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:59,194
Double-Decker bus, that was close!

702
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:02,363
Mason, I'm so glad you're here.

703
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:04,634
Look, I just want to say
I'm so sorry for ruining

704
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:06,959
your picnic and being
selfish and immature...

705
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,659
Alex, there's no time for that now. You
must save humanity from Dominic and...

706
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,841
Well, you.

707
00:44:12,842 --> 00:44:16,454
But I can't. I can't get out.
This dungeon is magic-proof.

708
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:21,735
Well, then, let's find out
if it's Werewolf-proof.

709
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:35,388
Thank you.

710
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:38,458
If you're really grateful,
you'd scratch behind my ears.

711
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:40,527
Oh. That's the spot. All right.

712
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:42,362
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh.

713
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:46,299
And more people are mysteriously
disappearing around the globe.

714
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,200
The government asks that everyone
remain calm and in there houses.

715
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:55,032
And now for the sports.

716
00:44:55,033 --> 00:45:00,553
Antonio, por favor tell all
the workers to come inside.

717
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,380
Eh!

718
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,700
Tall, skinny guy, girl in a
bikini, Italian newscaster...

719
00:45:11,888 --> 00:45:14,348
Ryan Gosling?

720
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:22,848
Hey, guys. Don't mind me, I just
dropped by to give myself a beat down.

721
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:25,710
Alex?! How did you get out?

722
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:28,174
Take a guess.

723
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:30,158
Dominic, it's over.

724
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:34,300
You're not gonna take over the world
because I'm here to save it, again.

725
00:45:34,301 --> 00:45:37,389
You're not going to be
able to save it this time.

726
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,610
Oh, yeah?

727
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,441
- Here...
- No, I got it. I got it.

728
00:45:46,442 --> 00:45:49,802
You're ruining my moment.

729
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:05,302
Get her out of here before
she stops the replicator!

730
00:46:05,303 --> 00:46:06,842
I'm not going anywhere.

731
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:11,622
You will to protect your family...
and your home.

732
00:46:11,623 --> 00:46:13,940
Oh, no. Mason, I'll be right back.

733
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:19,581
No worries, love. I'll just
stay here and have a snack.

734
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:24,832
What am I up to?

735
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:30,233
It's kind of hard chasing
me without my sneaky side.

736
00:46:40,615 --> 00:46:44,695
Oh, I wish I could just rest here.

737
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:58,695
Ok, maybe I don't care about the kitchen,
but now you've messed with my couch.

738
00:47:08,115 --> 00:47:12,795
- That's weird, right?
- It's really weird.

739
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,252
Hey!

740
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:26,697
You are a very ugly side of
me and it is time to go.

741
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:28,618
Sure.

742
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:34,749
Oh! Why didn't I see myself doing that?

743
00:47:39,922 --> 00:47:41,786
Watch out for the bars.

744
00:47:41,787 --> 00:47:45,867
Don't get cute. I'm the cute one.

745
00:47:57,068 --> 00:48:00,488
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

746
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:10,045
You're right. This is fun.

747
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:58,626
Psst. Over here.

748
00:49:04,104 --> 00:49:09,744
I didn't think it'd be that
hard to kick my own butt.

749
00:49:18,484 --> 00:49:21,784
Always underestimating me.

750
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,560
Mason! Mason, wake up! I'm so sorry.

751
00:49:38,636 --> 00:49:42,367
- What did you do?
- I put your dog down.

752
00:49:42,368 --> 00:49:45,248
This is for Mason.

753
00:49:45,631 --> 00:49:47,490
Guess who?

754
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:50,911
I'm back? Darn I'm good.

755
00:49:50,977 --> 00:49:53,137
Drop it.

756
00:49:54,748 --> 00:49:58,288
And I'll take the bracelet.

757
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,772
Oh. Finish her.

758
00:50:18,262 --> 00:50:20,672
Ok, that definitely got rid of me.

759
00:50:20,673 --> 00:50:22,512
I think.

760
00:50:22,513 --> 00:50:26,374
All right. Now time to get rid of this.

761
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:28,191
Alex!

762
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:31,807
Don't you think your time would be
better served saving your family?

763
00:50:31,808 --> 00:50:36,248
Hey, I think I can see Tokyo from here.

764
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:55,664
Are you guys all right?

765
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:57,058
- Yeah, we're ok.
- Good job Mija.

766
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:00,183
Got a little steamy in my bead.

767
00:51:00,184 --> 00:51:04,984
Clearly I can't defeat
the great Alex Russo.

768
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:09,321
But think of the world I am creating.

769
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:11,842
It needs you.

770
00:51:14,169 --> 00:51:16,569
I need you.

771
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:29,298
No surprise. You all
knew I did not like him.

772
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:33,379
Mason! I was so scared I lost you.

773
00:51:34,871 --> 00:51:37,940
Mason! I was so scared I lost you.

774
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:43,841
Ugh. Wouldn't it be nice if I was
this determined in everyday stuff?

775
00:51:44,147 --> 00:51:46,048
Haven't we had enough of this?

776
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:48,547
Can we just call it a day
and get back together.

777
00:51:48,548 --> 00:51:54,448
No way. Dominic went bye-bye, so that
leaves more room at the top for just me.

778
00:51:55,671 --> 00:52:00,168
And thanks to this, I'm going
to take over the world.

779
00:52:00,169 --> 00:52:03,049
You're really bad.

780
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:06,390
I have no choice.

781
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,908
Oh. Just as I thought.

782
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:12,449
Too good for your own good.

783
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,095
No one wins if we both lose everything.

784
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:20,996
What do you mean lose everything?

785
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,691
By all my power is to go.

786
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:28,190
- No. No, no, no. You can't!
- Alex, what are you doing?

787
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:31,248
She's casting the spell
to cancel all her powers.

788
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:35,213
A wizard's essence, spirit and soul
will be nothing but a lump of coal.

789
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:37,105
- Alex, stop! Don't do it!
- Honey, don't do it!

790
00:52:37,106 --> 00:52:43,006
By all the power vested in me my power
be wrested out and forever free.

791
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:07,816
Alex Russo...

792
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:12,195
Once again, you've shown immense
bravery in saving the world.

793
00:53:12,196 --> 00:53:17,498
Consequently, your guilty
verdict is hereby overturned.

794
00:53:17,499 --> 00:53:19,033
Ha! All right.

795
00:53:19,034 --> 00:53:22,172
However, we cannot ignore
the fact that this,

796
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:24,269
as in every time in the past,

797
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,110
you were involved in bringing the
world to the brink of disaster.

798
00:53:27,111 --> 00:53:31,948
Oh, come on. This was a good moment.
We don't need to dig up the past.

799
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:36,759
How about you just give me my magic back,
and we can all go home with a warm feeling?

800
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,288
We have been patient, but
you have failed to show the

801
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:43,026
maturity and responsibility needed
to handle being The Family Wizard.

802
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:46,296
Therefore, we have decided that it is in
the best interest of the Wizard World

803
00:53:46,297 --> 00:53:48,824
that your powers not be reinstated.

804
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:53,103
Wait. Wait, please. I've been
trying to help her grow up.

805
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:57,424
Just give her another chance to change.

806
00:53:58,142 --> 00:53:59,942
No.

807
00:54:01,899 --> 00:54:06,704
I'm tired of everybody wanting
me to grow up, or to change.

808
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:09,726
Or to not be selfish.

809
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:13,867
No one is happy for just who I am.

810
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,080
Except for one person.

811
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:21,183
This is so embarrassing.
She's talking about me.

812
00:54:21,184 --> 00:54:23,224
Harper.

813
00:54:23,574 --> 00:54:28,794
I'm sorry, dude. I thought
she was gonna say you.

814
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:37,587
You're the only one that
accepts me with all my flaws.

815
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:40,791
And I know that I have a lot of them.

816
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:42,870
And even though that there have been times

817
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:46,357
where you wanted me to
change and I didn't...

818
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:49,598
You stood by me anyway.

819
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:54,671
So it's ok if you don't give me my magic.

820
00:54:54,672 --> 00:54:57,349
My best friend Harper is my magic.

821
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,570
Oh, Alex.

822
00:55:03,715 --> 00:55:06,583
I am so proud of you, honey.

823
00:55:06,584 --> 00:55:09,118
Even though you don't have your powers,

824
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,779
you still deserve to be The Family Wizard.

825
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,700
Here.

826
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:20,378
All right. Let's go home.

827
00:55:21,966 --> 00:55:23,417
Perhaps...

828
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:28,037
The appreciation you have for
others is in itself very mature.

829
00:55:28,038 --> 00:55:32,145
It seems you have other qualities
that can make a great Family Wizard.

830
00:55:32,146 --> 00:55:34,235
I don't like where this is going.

831
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:37,689
There still may be hope
for you, Alex Russo.

832
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:41,350
We grant you one more chance.

833
00:55:57,501 --> 00:56:00,270
I have my magic back.

834
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:02,505
Thank you.

835
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:06,886
I'll see you the next time I mess up.

836
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:13,155
Carmela, grazie for this
beautiful family reunion.

837
00:56:13,156 --> 00:56:16,429
Please come visit us anytime.

838
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,770
Except you.

839
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:25,049
Can I come back and visit you sometime?

840
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:31,141
"Stupido". I'm wearing her down.

841
00:56:33,037 --> 00:56:37,941
Alex, before you go, please give
some advice to Bianca and Gino.

842
00:56:37,942 --> 00:56:41,711
- They're our wizards in training.
- Mmm. Yep.

843
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:46,016
All right. Look, guys, there's gonna
be a lot of work ahead of you.

844
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:48,502
And it won't really be easy.

845
00:56:48,503 --> 00:56:52,696
And one day, only one of you will
get to become The Family Wizard,

846
00:56:52,697 --> 00:56:56,617
but until then, the most important
thing to remember is...

847
00:56:56,618 --> 00:57:01,838
Have as much ridiculous fun
with magic as you can.

848
00:57:04,744 --> 00:57:08,872
All right. Guys, this has been a great
trip but there's no place like home.

849
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:11,153
Let's go.

850
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:14,244
Uh, hang on, Harper.

851
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:17,580
What happened in here?! The kitchen!
My couch!

852
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:19,405
Alex!

853
00:57:19,406 --> 00:57:23,906
I think we should stay in Italy a while.

854
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,682
Action!

855
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:30,664
You say, "here we go".

856
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:31,732
What?

857
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:33,801
- You say, "oh, here we go".
- Oh.

858
00:57:33,802 --> 00:57:35,842
Action!

859
00:57:36,738 --> 00:57:38,778
Action!

860
00:57:40,317 --> 00:57:41,319
Action!

861
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,138
I still don't like the way we got here.

862
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:47,379
But they're feeding us.

863
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,820
Your own personal drive-in?!

864
00:57:56,074 --> 00:57:58,185
What? What did I do?

865
00:57:58,186 --> 00:58:01,455
Come on, dad. I-I... I spit popcorn.
I'm sorry. Ok.

866
00:58:01,456 --> 00:58:05,392
I don't know how to say wizard...

867
00:58:05,393 --> 00:58:09,129
I got an invitation from
my cousin, Carmela,

868
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:13,390
in Italy, inviting us to a re-usso...

869
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:15,269
Russo.

870
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:21,090
I got an invitation in Italy
for a re-usso family reunion.

871
00:58:22,344 --> 00:58:28,182
A while ago, I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela, in Italy...

872
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:32,152
I got an invitation from
my cousin, Carmela,

873
00:58:32,153 --> 00:58:35,489
in Italy, inviting us to a re-usso...

874
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,656
I'm not doing it!

875
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:39,657
