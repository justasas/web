1
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:04,150
All right, which do you
think is cooler for my date?

2
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:06,452
Leather jacket or this hoodie?

3
00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:08,854
Let's see.

4
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:12,391
Nice leather, or...

5
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:14,460
...what if we...

6
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:16,062
Good.

7
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:18,264
[exclaims]

8
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:19,999
Yep, I'd go with the hoodie.

9
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,469
Take it easy. I'm a mouth-breather.

10
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:25,871
[exhales]

11
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:29,775
I can't believe you let your WizTech
buddies set you up on a blind date,

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,479
and all you know from her is what you've
learned from her profile on WizFace.

13
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:35,648
You haven't even seen her.
She's hot.

14
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:37,650
And she's into all the
same things I'm into.

15
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:40,753
Please. Listen,
everybody's hot on WizFace.

16
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:43,789
They don't show their real picture,
and lie about what they're into.

17
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,691
What picture did she see of you?

18
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:48,627
Oh, I don't think pictures
really capture my essence.

19
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:51,864
That's why I posted a complicated
mathematical equation.

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,733
Come check it out.

21
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:58,003
[computer beeps]

22
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:01,073
Oh. I get it. Because
you're hard to figure out

23
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:02,842
nobody cares enough to try.

24
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,610
[sarcastic laugh]

25
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:08,380
What other embarrassing things do
you have on your embarrassing page?

26
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:13,018
Oh my gosh. I can't believe you posted
that picture with you and that centaur.

27
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:15,988
[chuckles] Don't you wish she'd told
you she was half horse and half girl

28
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:18,757
before you asked her
to WizTech Prom?

29
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,594
I saved a lot on a limo.

30
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:25,531
I'm just saying people, or horses,

31
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:27,833
are not always honest on WizFace.

32
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:29,001
[doorbell rings]

33
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:30,703
OK, that's Isabella now.

34
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:34,507
I guarantee you she looks exactly
like her picture on WizFace.

35
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,574
[clears throat]

36
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,178
Is this the Russo residence?

37
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,551
Hi.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,554
Here's your floral wristlet.

39
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:51,457
Thanks.

40
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:54,560
And here's some mail that came
to my apartment by accident.

41
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,598
Oh, ma'am? [chuckles]

42
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,934
Take it easy.

43
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,538
- Whew.
- Ah!

44
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:09,975
I wouldn't "whew" so fast.
At least that lady only had two legs.

45
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,710
[doorbell rings]

46
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:13,612
OK. I'm sure Isabella's normal.

47
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,781
Oh! Forgot the floral wristlet.

48
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,122
Hi, I'm Isabella. Is Justin here?

49
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:26,158
Oh, well you're cute. Boo.

50
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,428
Justin?

51
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:31,530
Isabella?

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,205
Wow, you're even prettier
than your pictures on WizFace.

53
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,176
And you don't look anything like "
X equals Y squared over cosine of pi."

54
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:46,512
I know. Everyone says that.

55
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:48,914
So nice to meet you.
And even nicer for you to meet Alex,

56
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:51,684
who thinks she knows everything.

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,789
Here, take a seat. I'll go get you
some of your favorite Diet WizFizz.

58
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,057
You know, the soda?

59
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,626
I remembered from your profile.

60
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,199
Well, this was fun.

61
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:10,369
Can you pass me that
sweater, please?

62
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:12,171
[growling]

63
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,446
OK.

64
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,915
[growling]

65
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,483
[barks]

66
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:27,653
Now that was fun.

67
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:30,889
Really? 'Cause my word was "
awkward."

68
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:35,594
* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

69
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,730
* And the end will no doubt,
justify the means *

70
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,065
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

71
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,901
* Yes please But you might find
out it'll go to your head *

72
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:45,371
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

73
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:48,274
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

74
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:49,808
* That's what I said *

75
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:52,778
* Everything is not what it seems *

76
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:56,582
* When you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

77
00:03:56,616 --> 00:04:00,386
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

78
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,823
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

79
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:08,027
* Everything is not what it seems *

80
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:12,264
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

81
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,868
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

82
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:19,805
* Because everything is not... *

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,840
* What it seems *

85
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:27,646
Hey, Alfred. Are you
ready to go walk the dog?

86
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:29,915
I don't know. There are a
lot of streets to cross

87
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,986
between here and the park,
where a lot could go wrong.

88
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,922
Hey, Mom, we're going to
walk the dog in the park.

89
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:40,059
All right, honey. Wait, wait, wait.

90
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:41,627
We don't own a dog.

91
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:44,697
This is Tucker, Mrs.
Covington's dog.

92
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:46,865
She's gonna give us five
bucks a day to walk him.

93
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,001
We're saving up to buy
those cups-on-a-chain

94
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:51,470
so we won't have to keep
asking you guys for cups.

95
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,506
Oh, you know, honey, it's really
not that much of a bother.

96
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,643
We own a restaurant,
we've got hundreds of cups.

97
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:01,080
We want cups-on-a-chain.
Are you in or are you out?

98
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:03,582
All right, all right.
I guess I'm in.

99
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:06,218
You know what? I'm gonna
bake some dog biscuits

100
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:10,222
from a recipe I saw on
Dog Food Network. OK?

101
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:12,891
Why do we want
cups-on-a-chain again?

102
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,794
How many times has someone
offered you a beverage

103
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,030
and you have nothing to put it in?

104
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:19,865
Never.

105
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:22,701
Well, it'll never happen again.

106
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,675
Oh, hi. Are you one
of Alex's friends?

107
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,944
No, Dad. She's with me.
[nervous laugh]

108
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:34,580
A pretty girl can be with me.

109
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:39,184
Oh, right. Of course.

110
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:43,088
I'm Isabella.
You must be Mr. Russo.

111
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:44,189
Hi.

112
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,193
Oh, hi. I'll get Alex.

113
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:51,096
Theresa, please.

114
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,765
A pretty girl can be with Justin.

115
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,868
Oh, of course.

116
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,770
Justin and I were set up by friends

117
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,072
and we've been getting to
know each other on WizFace.

118
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:02,608
WizFace. Really?

119
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:06,111
Oh, yeah. I hear it's a fun,
social networking site

120
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:07,846
where people from
the wizard world who

121
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:10,749
don't know each other at all
can get to know each other.

122
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,019
Can you come in the kitchen?

123
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:15,721
We need help with
the salami slicing.

124
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:17,589
It's Max's turn for that.

125
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,926
Well, we need your help with
something else. - [whispers] Yeah.

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,663
- What?
- That thing.

127
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:26,732
What thing?

128
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,401
Justin, get in the
kitchen right now.

129
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:32,271
All right. Come on, Isabella,
we're going in the kitchen.

130
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:36,074
No, no! No, no. No, no,
Isabella needs to stay here, uh,

131
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:38,777
because, um, because of that thing.

132
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,813
That thing with the... Oh,
what are we doing?

133
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,715
Isabella, you stay here.
Justin, come on.

134
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:59,731
Oh... Hi, Alex.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,568
I saw that.

136
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,736
Saw what?

137
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,272
I'm not sure what I saw,
but I saw that.

138
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,345
Once again,
we have to discuss WizFace

139
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:17,015
and how dangerous it is because you never
really know who you're dealing with.

140
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,119
And how you keep buying stuff on the World
Wide Wizard Web that you don't need.

141
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:24,456
Like the Submarine-
part-of-the-month Club?

142
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:27,092
I know it seems
ridiculous right now,

143
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:31,463
but in a 128,000 months,
I'll have a complete submarine.

144
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,031
[sighs]

145
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:36,401
And there's nothing wrong with Isabella.
She's really nice.

146
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,837
Well, at least this
one's not half horse.

147
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:43,809
That centaur looked
beautiful in her prom dress.

148
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:47,346
Honey, you are missing the point.

149
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,815
You didn't know she was a
centaur before you met her.

150
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,783
She ate all the carrots
in the sub shop.

151
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,820
Our coleslaw was
flavorless for a week.

152
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:57,422
Mom, Dad, I hear what
you're saying right now,

153
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:00,225
but I think I'm old enough
to make my own decisions.

154
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,094
All right. Just do yourself a favor

155
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:05,230
and get to know her better
before you get serious.

156
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:08,100
Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.
I'm going on a date with her.

157
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:11,970
Everything's gonna be OK.
Look at her. She's fine.

158
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:17,075
[chuckles] Hey.

159
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,045
She totally just heard
everything we said.

160
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,414
We should really shut this when
we're talking about people,

161
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:24,583
and they're sitting right there.

162
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,922
So, uh, where are you
guys going again?

163
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,924
I'm taking Isabella for
a walk in the park.

164
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,393
Oh. She'll like that.

165
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,174
Hello! Hello!

166
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,576
Hello! Hello!

167
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,444
Hello! Hello!

168

[squirrel chitters]

169
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,514
Squirrel!

170
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,551
[growling]

171
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:01,653
[squirrel chitters]

172
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,855
You see I almost
caught that squirrel?

173
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,759
And that bus. And that cab.
And the guy on the bike.

174
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,494
You almost caught a lot of things.

175
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,230
I know. Isn't this
the best walk ever?

176
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,733
Yeah. I just thought
we'd walk together.

177
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:17,369
Oh, OK. Let's walk together.

178
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:19,137
And listen, if I ever
get out of sight,

179
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:20,772
all you have to do is whistle.

180
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:24,509
Hot. I like it.

181
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:26,812
Can you believe my
sister and my parents

182
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:29,348
think we don't know enough
about each other to go out?

183
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,718
I know. I can tell from your profile
that we're into all the same things,

184
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:35,954
cozy blankets,
long naps, car rides.

185
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,156
And neither one of us
likes thunder storms.

186
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,625
Or vacuum cleaners.

187
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,727
Vacuum cleaners are the worst.

188
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,295
If you don't wear
your shoes inside,

189
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,930
there's no need for a vacuum.

190
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:47,933
I love shoes.

191
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,636
Me, too! I wear them everywhere.

192
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:56,041
I can't wait for my parents to
see how perfect we are together.

193
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,085
Ow.

194
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,156
Hey, Alex, we're getting cups-on-chains
to wear around our necks.

195
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,460
[laughs] Well,
Justin's girlfriend's a dog.

196
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,230
Watch.

197
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:21,600
Hey, guys! Can I play?

198
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:23,135
Thank you.

199
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,737
Yo, Isabella! Fetch!

200
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,941
[growls]

201
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:35,714
Hey, Alex. Isn't Isabella great?

202
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:39,117
She's so athletic and friendly.

203
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:42,521
She says "hello" to
everyone in the park.

204
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:45,557
Yeah, your girlfriend's a dog.

205
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:49,261
What are you talking about?
She's beautiful.

206
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:51,463
You just hate that we're
perfect for each other.

207
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:53,999
She put my sweater in her mouth

208
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,467
and played tug-of-war with me.

209
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,169
Isabella's hiding something.

210
00:10:57,403 --> 00:11:01,473
Oh, you just don't like the
fact that I'm falling in love.

211
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:05,277
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
I'm falling in love.

212
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:12,084
She ate a dog biscuit like it was a
chocolate chip cookie right out of the oven.

213
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,885
- [scoffs]
- She jumped in the air

214
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,254
and caught a plastic
flying disc in her mouth.

215
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:20,726
We both love catching plastic
flying discs in our mouth.

216
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:27,365
That's one of the many things
that we have in common.

217
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:31,203
You can't catch a plastic
flying disc in your mouth.

218
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:33,739
You can't catch a plastic
flying disc in your hands.

219
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:35,774
Oh, yeah?

220
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:38,143
Hey, Gunnar, hit me.

221
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:45,584
Good throw!

222
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:47,552
Am I bleeding?

223
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:54,426
OK, OK, the swelling's going down,

224
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,496
you've cried it out,
you're gonna live.

225
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:02,400
Now, Isabella, did you leave out
one piece of crucial information

226
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:05,670
on your WizFace page,
like the fact that you're a dog?

227
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,607
That's ridiculous.

228
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,809
I wouldn't be ready to
commit myself to Isabella

229
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:13,678
without having a pretty
good idea of who she is.

230
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,080
You're not a dog, are you?

231
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,815
- No.
- See?

232
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,984
I'm a werewolf.

233
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:24,890
Whoa. I did not see that coming.

234
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,262
So what?

235
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:33,431
Not seeing things coming is
the roller coaster  love.

236
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,801
And I am strapped in,
ready for the ride.

237
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:39,271
Today, I found out my
girlfriend's a werewolf.

238
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:40,572
Yay!

239
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,242
How many other guys can say that?

240
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,111
Well, none, because I'm guessing

241
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,080
anybody else who could
say that has been eaten.

242
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:52,684
That's a stereotype.
We're actually very loving.

243
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:54,419
I sensed that about you.

244
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,054
Oh, Justin, come on!

245
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,356
Just admit it. You don't
know anything about her.

246
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:01,393
Oh, Alex. I can't believe
your level of jealousy.

247
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:04,629
I just hope that one day you
can be as happy as we are.

248
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:10,435
Oh, Justin, there is one more thing
that you should know about me.

249
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,404
Yes, my love?

250
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:17,209
When you kiss a werewolf,
you turn into a werewolf.

251
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:26,117
Ah. Perfect.

252
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:33,358
Oh my gosh, this is
gonna be so painful!

253
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:35,227
As my genetic
structure is changing,

254
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,062
as my spine shifts
from human to canine,

255
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,797
as my hands elongate
and become lupine,

256
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:42,133
waiting for the claws to shoot
out of my fingernails... [gasps]

257
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,935
I love you, Isabella!

258
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:49,507
That's another stereotype.
The change is pretty fast and painless.

259
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,843
Really?

260
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,217
Oh. You're right.

261
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:03,321
[growls] Nice coat.

262
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:06,491
Thanks.

263
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:10,729
Alex, what are we gonna do?

264
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,166
Well, don't ask me. I proved you guys
don't know each other. My work is done.

265
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:21,029
[barks]

266
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:27,135
OK, so I'm a werewolf.

267
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,973
There's a price to love.
Love hurts. But I didn't die.

268
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:33,075
Just a werewolf.

269
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:34,710
I'm not gonna die, am I?

270
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:39,581
No, you're good.
Just don't chase cars.

271
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:42,851
All right, that's about as
much puppy love as I can take.

272
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:45,153
Get it? Where do I come
up with these things?

273
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:49,591
Wait. Alex, you're not
gonna tell Dad, right?

274
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:51,593
No.

275
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,562
Because Dad would want to
blame this all on WizFace

276
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:55,430
and then say, "I told you so."

277
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:57,900
And then he'd want
to change me back.

278
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:04,106
And maybe I don't want
to get changed back.

279
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,309
Maybe I like enjoy seeing
everything in black and white.

280
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:10,879
Maybe I'm perfectly
happy now as a werewolf.

281
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:12,281
With Isabella.

282
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:16,084
- What is that smell?
- It's you, dude.

283
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,455
- It comes with the fur.
- Oh.

284
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,324
Well, then I like it.

285
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,493
I love having fur.

286
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,029
I'm enjoying my new lease on life.

287
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:30,098
Don't you mean leash on life? Oh, man.
That is good one.

288
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:32,267
Up top. Oh, careful
with the claw, though.

289
00:15:32,302 --> 00:15:35,604
Stop judging us with
your hurtful jokes.

290
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:39,808
Come on, Isabella.
We're obviously not accepted here.

291
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:41,376
We have to do what people in love

292
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,078
have done since the
beginning of time.

293
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:46,815
Run away to the only place
where animals can be free.

294
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,417
The park!

295
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:53,488
OK, don't forget your collars.
It's flea season!

296
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:56,725
Another one. I am on fire.

297
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,194
OK, we're actually going now.

298
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:03,699
And like I said, don't tell Dad
that we're going to the park, OK?

299
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:07,869
I'm not. Why are you still
here and not chasing a cat?

300
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,906
It's that kind of
hatred and prejudice

301
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,276
that makes us unable to stay
here for one more moment.

302
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,510
Come on, my love.

303
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:21,617
- [growling]
- [howling]

304
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,055
Hey, Alex, successful
day of dog walking.

305
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,591
I got my cup-on-a-chain.

306
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:32,327
Yep. Livin' the dream.

307
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,096
What's going on here?

308
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,233
Well, Justin's WizFace girl
turned out to be a werewolf.

309
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,235
They kissed,
he turned into a werewolf

310
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:45,107
and they away to spend the rest of their
lives together. So I guess it's just you
and me.

311
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:48,543
Well, hey, I got Justin a
cup-on-a-chain, but, uh...

312
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:50,812
His loss is your gain, right?

313
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:56,618
Let's have a race to see who can
fill theirs with spit first.

314
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:57,853
Go!

315
00:16:57,887 --> 00:17:00,489
Oh, my goodness,
I can't live like this.

316
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:02,190
Where are you going?

317
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:06,028
To tell Dad that Justin's a werewolf
and that I need him back right away.

318
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:17,472
[owl hooting]

319
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:20,676
I'm so glad we're out here
starting our new lives together,

320
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:26,314
holding paws on this bench with nobody
stopping us, including my parents.

321
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,686
I don't even care if they were looking
for me and even if they heard me.

322
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,522
[howling]

323
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:37,259
I'm Justin Russo! [howling]

324
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:40,095
Sitting on this park bench!

325
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:43,065
Next to the lamp post. [howling]

326
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:55,577
I'm getting kind of hungry.

327
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:57,813
We should go eat some
cats or something.

328
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:01,416
Werewolves don't eat cats.
That's a stereotype.

329
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:04,052
Just like how we only
change during a full moon.

330
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,821
We change every night.

331
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:09,891
Even better.

332
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,561
It's like people watch
a couple of movies

333
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:14,796
and suddenly they know
all about werewolves.

334
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:17,599
Oh, I love those movies.
Like that one: Hey, Werewolf?

335
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:21,269
about the inner-city school guidance
counselor who understands the kids,

336
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:23,772
because he knows what it
feels like to be an outsider.

337
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:27,209
I can't believe you would watch
those movies. They're demeaning.

338
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,777
I mean, Hey, Werewolf?

339
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:31,146
I didn't believe Ashton
Kutcher for one minute.

340
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,415
Those shows make us
look like animals

341
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:36,318
instead of people with a condition,
with proper diet and exercise,

342
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:38,420
can live a normal, healthy life.

343
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:41,490
[growls, howls]

344
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:45,494
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:48,063
OK. I got a little worked up.

346
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:51,366
But I had no idea you
liked werewolf movies.

347
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,936
That's the type of thing you should've
listed on your WizFace profile.

348
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:58,073
I mean, I don't really care
where you went to chess camp.

349
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:03,044
You're mad at me because I left
something out of my WizFace profile?

350
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,082
I think you left something out of your
WizFace profile that's pretty big.

351
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,416
What?

352
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,286
Hmm... let me think
about what it is

353
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,123
while I stroke my beard.
And my arms.

354
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:18,493
And my whole body because
there's hair all over it.

355
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,697
[making kissing sounds]

356
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:23,932
[ball squeaks]

357
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:28,737
Most moms have to look for their
lost kids at the department store,

358
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:32,507
but no, I have to look for
my werewolf son in the park!

359
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,343
Hey. I said we'll get
pretzels when we find him.

360
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,345
We can get pretzels anywhere.

361
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:44,152
Oh my gosh,

362
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:47,556
do you smell your mom,
your dad and your sister?

363
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,257
But mostly your dad?

364
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,961
Yeah. And I see them.

365
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:57,232
And after I specifically told
them not to come after me!

366
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,134
Boy am I mad at her.

367
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:02,204
- Over here!
- Good.

368
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,706
We'll lure them over and
then make a mad dash for it.

369
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,241
Exactly.

370
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:07,976
I'll go this way and
you go that way.

371
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,511
And no stopping and digging.

372
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:10,645
Got it!

373
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:26,761
Oh, guys, there's something
I have to tell you.

374
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:30,232
You won best in show?
Congratulations.

375
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,468
I don't have to say,
"I told you so," do I?

376
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:35,270
No.

377
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:37,505
Well, I do.

378
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,608
I told you so.

379
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:42,177
You cannot trust what
people say on WizFace.

380
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:45,847
I thought we learned that when your
prom date had matching shoes and saddle.

381
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:49,918
But apparently someone has to turn
themselves into a werewolf for the lesson
to take.

382
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:53,722
My poor baby's a werewolf!

383
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,357
What are we gonna do?

384
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,759
Well, I'm not shaving him.

385
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:01,263
It's not about shaving Justin.

386
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:03,899
I remember a recipe to a potion.

387
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,967
Thank you. I'll drink anything.

388
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:08,670
It's not exactly a drinking potion.

389
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:16,578
Dad, this is embarrassing.

390
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:20,048
I know. It's a potion and
a punishment all in one.

391
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:24,686
I don't think it's working.
He's still hairy.

392
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,656
I'm cool as long as he
doesn't use my brush.

393
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,992
Oh, maybe you do drink it.

394
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:33,461
Yep, it's a drinking potion.

395
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:35,530
[Theresa] What?!

396
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:39,267
I didn't have to scrape eggshells and
coffee grounds out of the bottom of that
thing?

397
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:42,771
Yeah, looks like we learned
a couple of things today.

398
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:45,373
Yeah, Justin learned not
to trust people on WizFace,

399
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:47,575
and you learned what the
word "ingest" means.

400
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,744
I thought it meant joking.

401
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:53,949
Am I supposed to drink
my own bath water?

402
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:56,251
[both chanting] Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

403
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:59,888
[continue chanting]

404
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:07,929
Ugh. I think I
swallowed an eggshell.

405
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,301
Hey, it's good to see you again.

406
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,538
Yeah. I felt bad that it didn't
work out so well with us.

407
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:22,607
I guess we should have gotten
to know each other first.

408
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:28,380
I know. We didn't even get to
slow dance together at the prom.

409
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,416
I'm not doing anything right now.

410
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:32,684
Me neither.

411
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,200
Cool.

412
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:41,201
