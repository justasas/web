Okay, l am right here.
You do not have to yell.

What l was trying to say is that, okay,

9
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,167
maybe some bad things happened,

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,473

Right, but now that
you're the family wizard,

using magic for selfish reasons.

Hey! l just told you,

71
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,805
magic is not for getting what you want
or using it for selfish reasons.

75

l know a pretty Latina who would love
to never have to do laundry again.

-Theresa.
-Sorry.

He should've been here by now.

86
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,443
You mean he's not here?

00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,351

telling one of his nerdy stories

''Hey, wake up, everybody!''

l'm Justin's friend, Dominic.

He asked me to give you a message.

91
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,031
He is too busy at Wiz Tech
and unfortunately cannot come.

92
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,600
Okay. Give us the message.

93
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,628
That was the message.

94
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,204
Okay. Can we start from the top?
Because this guy is all over the place.

95
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,676
So is Justin all right?

96
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,510
Yes, Mrs. Russo. Justin is fine.

97
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:20,279
lt's just more difficult for someone
with his spectacular talents to get away.

98
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,412
Now, l don't usually use
the word ''spectacular,''

99
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,184
but in Justin's case, spectacular.

100
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:27,920
Justin isn't coming?

101
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,757
What are we gonna do
with the ice cream cake?

102
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,820

And easy on the eyes.

117
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,739
Reminded me of a young me.

118
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,610
You know, l think he was into you, Alex.

119
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,176
No, no, no, no.

120
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,984

121
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,257
l can't believe Justin's not coming.

l can't believe Justin's not coming.

123
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,458
l wanted him to be here
for my big announcement.

124
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,993
A while ago, l got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela,

in ltaly, inviting us
to a Russo family reunion.

What's your announcement?

127
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,564
That was the announcement.

Oh, great, now Dad's all over the place.

129
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,337
Aw, Jerry, you're taking me
on a romantic trip to ltaly?

130
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,844
-l love you.
-Well...

131
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,074
Actually, l'm taking the whole family.

132
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,514
Why? They don't know we have kids.

133
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,216
But, Theresa, it's a family reunion.

134

135
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,254
Please don't do that, Dad.

136

as when you say ''mootsa-rella.''

Well, you guys have fun.

138

l'll just stay here and read or something.

139

Yeah, and l'll just stay here
and chew up the furniture.

140

This couch looks pretty fruity.

141
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:27,707
You guys are family, too.

142
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:30,074

-All right!

144
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:35,711
Tickets? Dad, if you want to go to ltaly,
l can be our travel agent.

145
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,688
No time for that travel confusion.

146
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,622
Show me the door to our ltalian reunion.

147
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,059
Okay, l don't know how to say
''Wizard Speed Pass'' in ltalian,

148
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,763
so l'm just going to go with
''<i>Mamma mia!</i>''

149

Or at least l think that's ltalian.

MAX: A door to Japan? How cool.

151
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,979
lt's ltaly.

152
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,984
l don't know all the towns
in Japan, dude.

153
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,511
Alex, you're not going to turn this trip

154
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:11,453
into one of your selfish shortcuts.

155
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,049
l want us to experience
the whole journey.

156
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,957
Getting there is half the fun.

157
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,526
Now, get rid of this thing.

158
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,257
Whoa.

159
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,637
Did you just see that girl?

160
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,263
Alex, l have to get her number first.

161
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,240
Max, get back here!

162
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,937
Would you please grow up?

163
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,411
Max!

164
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,219
Okay, let's just find Max and go home.

165
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,448
So we can fly back here.

166
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:48,916
Wow! Look at this place.

167
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,792
Oh, it's beautiful.

168
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,465
Your family lives here?

169
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,905
''<i>Villa di Russo</i>. ''

170
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,376
l don't know who <i>Villa di</i> is,
but Russo is definitely me.

171
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,574
l don't think he's mad at you anymore.

172
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,984
Oh, don't be fooled. He's happy
anywhere there's cheese hanging.

173
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,319
Man, l lost her.

174
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,021
l didn't get her name,
but she looked like a Tomiko.

175
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,117
Tomiko! Tomiko!

176
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:27,063
Max. Forget the girl.
We've got girls back home.

177
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,997
Yeah, but there's
no ltalians in New York, Mom.

178
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,670
Oh, come on.
Can't we stay a little longer?

179
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,296
This is the first time Alex's magic

180
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,670
took me somewhere
that didn't scare me.

181
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,767
No. We're not coming to ltaly this way.

182
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,711
We're going to experience
a family trip the real way.

183
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,044
You mean on a discount flight
in cramped seats

184
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,606
with bad food and an obnoxious kid

185
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:47,811
in front of you saying,
''Peekaboo, peekaboo.''

186
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,451
C<i>iao, bella</i>.

187
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,855
Are you here for a tour
of the Russo vineyard?

188
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,663
Well... l, uh...

189
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,858
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

190
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,061
We're not here for any tour, <i>paisan</i>.
Go back to work.

191
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,037
And put a shirt on!

192
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,232
All right, let's go.

193
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,571
Okay, fine.
But you'll only have yourself to blame

194
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,134
when that peekaboo kid
uses your lap for a barf bag.

195
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:19,144
All right, is everybody here?

196
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:24,049
-Good. Now, Alex, get rid of this thing.
-Okay.

197
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,418
Hmm... The spell l need
is like things in my bedroom.

198
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:33,292
lt's buried under the dirty
clothes of my mind.

199
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,557
You see? Justin would never do a spell
that he didn't know how to undo.

200
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,428
Oh, l get it.

201
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,133
l get this whole ''grown-up'' thing now.

202
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,368
You think Justin should've been
the family wizard.

203
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,071
Honey, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean it that way.

204
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,614
No. l'm sorry
l'm not the grown-up family wizard

205
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,671
you want me to be.

206
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,713
Well, up until then,

207
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,618
that was the best five-minute
vacation l've ever had.

208
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:15,595
(CLEARS THROAT)

209
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,369
Excuse me, is this Jumbotron taken?

210
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,011
Dominic? What are you doing here?

211
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,744
My night job is cleaning
the back of the Jumbotron.

212
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,841
You being here is just a bonus.

213
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,548
Look, you seem really nice,
but l have a boyfriend.

214
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:32,089
And to be honest,

215
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:34,022
l don't think l'd be really
good company right now.

216
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,524
Unless you're a fan of big,
sloppy emotional meltdowns.

217
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,995
You know, l was just saying
this morning,

218
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:42,864
l haven't seen a big, sloppy
emotional meltdown in a while.

219
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,334
Let's see what you got.

220
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,932
Ah, a smile.

221
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,543
Have you ever considered
joining the Wizard Council?

222
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,336
The Wizard Council?

223
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,438
lsn't that for old geezers who wear robes

224
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,880
'cause they're tired of shopping?

225
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,939
(LAUGHS)

226
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,979
l just believe you have the potential

227
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,647
to be the most powerful wizard
of your generation.

228
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,059
Trust me. You have no idea
what you're truly capable of.

229
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,956
Well, if you ask my family,

230
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,762
l'm not capable of anything
except refusing to grow up.

231
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,960
They're mortals.

232
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,594
They can't understand
wizards with your power.

233
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,498
Besides, if their opinions
really bother you,

234
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,701
you're powerful enough
to create your own spell

235
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,075
to smooth out your little edges.

236
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,008
Why are you telling me this?

237
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,445
Because where everyone else
sees trouble,

238
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,783
l see magic.

239
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,917
And beauty.

240
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:44,252
Okay, now you're just flirting.

241
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,194
Yeah, a little bit.

242
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,096
Here. lt's a small gift.

243
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,498
Oh, no. l can't take that.

244
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,092
lt's simply a friendship bracelet.

245
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:57,635
Everything okay up here?

246
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,205
Oh, yeah. Mason, sorry.

247
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,940
l just had to get away
from home, you know.

248
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,675
And l just came to check on her.

249
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,512
l apologize if l've overstepped.

250
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,553
You have, mate, and l'm here now.

251
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,917
Werewolf.

252
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,448
Good-bye, Alex.

253
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,290
Bye.

254
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,422
Werewolf.

255
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,459
l do not like that guy.

256
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,630
Anything l should be worried about?

257
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,028
Not a thing.

258
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,131
Good. Well, l've got a surprise
to cheer you up.

259
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,698
l thought we would have a little picnic.

260
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,268
Don't say ltalian,
'cause l've had enough of that today.

261
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:40,215
No. l was thinking
something sophisticated.

262
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,442
Poached salmon.

263
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,285
Oh, Mason. That's so sweet.

264
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,417
But can l make a little tweak?

265
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,254
Of course, darling.

266
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,430
Check it out, finger food feast.
l call the wing.

267
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,993
No, Alex!
Alex, you know this food is bad for you.

268
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,830
Besides, l cooked that salmon,
two hours over a hot poacher.

269
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,973
Why? You know it only
takes me like two seconds.

270
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,474
l see. So, this is how
it's going to be from now on.

271
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,174
What?

272
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,719
Just you, me and your wand.

273
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,956
Just using your magic selfishly
no matter who it hurts.

274
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:24,159
Mason, where are you going?
l did all this for us.

275
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:26,462
So did l.

276
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:40,140
So you turned Mason's classy picnic
into a county fair fry-fest?

277
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,544
Well, everybody knows
that my favorite food

278
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:46,050
comes in cardboard containers
with some sort of dipping sauce.

279
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,876
Ew.

280
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,017
Oh, hi, Alex. Can you tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

281
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,793
Everything you're wearing
is from the '90s. (LAUGHlNG)

282
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:00,328
Oh, but when you guys wear it,
it's ''vintage.''

283
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,731
Have you figured out how
to get rid of this thing yet?

284
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,232
Uh, no. l've been a little busy.

285
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,500
But don't worry, l'll figure out something

286
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,007
before Max can use it again.

287
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,565
(DOOR OPENS)

288
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:14,407
Hey, who wants to help me
make a hot tub out of this?

289
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,947
l bet l know how he's going
to make the bubbles.

290
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:23,877
Max, stop going to ltaly.
And, Alex, you...

291
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,947
l know, l know. Grow up.

292
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,352
You're right, Pop. l'll just take this back.

293
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,859
Max, you forgot the barrel!

294
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,192
Max!

295
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,699
He's not coming back, is he?

296
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:39,166
Theresa, we have to find Max again!

297
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:42,973
What? l was just about to make dinner.

298
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,206
lt's just ltaly, we'll be right back.

299
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,687
Hey, are you okay?

300
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,520
lt's just that, l thought that once
l became the family wizard,

301
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,051
all of this pressure would be off of me.

302
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,622
But no, it's like everybody
still wants me to change.

303
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,863
Well, that doesn't make a lot of sense.

304
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,598
lt's who you are in the first place
that made you the family wizard.

305
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,274
l know,

306
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,866
but maybe growing up
would make me a better person.

307
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,809
l mean, l can't even say anything nice

308
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,110
about my best friend's
hideous clambake outfit.

309
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,446
l'm sorry, Harper.
l held off as long as l could.

310
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,642
But you see? That's what l mean.

311
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,617
You making fun of my outfit is you.

312
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,919
And me loving this outfit is me.

313
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,050
People should appreciate you
for who you are,

314
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,617
not for what they think you should be.

315
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,391
Right. And l am a powerful wizard

316
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,935
who can change if l want to.

317
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,400
Just smooth out my little edges.

318
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,531
Wait, hold up.
Okay, so, after that great speech,

319
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,235
you're still going to change
your personality with magic?

320
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,437
Just the parts that nobody likes.

321
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,173
So, you're going to change
your whole personality?

322
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,642
l owed you for the clambake comment.

323
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,708
-All right.
-Yeah, that's good.

324
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:04,183
Selfish, mean and tired of rejection.

325
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,952
Take these parts to a place of reflection.

326
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,355
Alex, are you okay?

327
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:13,826
l think so. Did it work?

328
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,463
l don't know. You look the same.
Here, let me test you.

329
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,299
What do you think
of my clambake outfit?

330
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,569
Mmm. lt's horrible...

331
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,097
...that you didn't make me one.

332
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,165
Oh, it worked!

333
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:27,268
l'm totally nice! (EXCLAlMS)

334
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,244
Wait.

335
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,782
lf you still have all your good parts,

336
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,215
where did all your bad parts go?

337
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:36,985
<i>Hey! Let me out of here, you ugly hags!</i>

338
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,722
And l found my bad parts.

339
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,157
Oh, come on.
She doesn't seem that bad.

340
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,663
<i>I can smell that nasty outfit</i>
<i>all the way from here!</i>

341
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,323
Oh, l am not afraid of you!

342
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,526
<i>Well, come and get me, lobster girl!</i>

515
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,561
Ah-ha!

516
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,106
Ooh.

517
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:54,110
Hey, you know, they should
really have machines for this,

518
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,975
-don't you think?
-Oh!

519
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,948
You know what? Yes, l do.

520
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,744
(SHOUTlNG)

521
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:06,119
l would never disrespect you like that!

522
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,982
-Oh, honey, wait.
-What?

523
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,459
You love me so much
you got so jealous?

524
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,519
-Oh, honey...
-Good!

525
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,527
Aww. They found a way to make it worse
for themselves without my help.

526
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:22,131
Changing me was great.

527
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,332
(YELLlNG)

528
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,335
(LAUGHlNG)

529
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,919
My cousins! Where did they go?

530
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,026
Oh, no. Harper,
do you think my bad side

531
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,960
could've done something
terrible to my parents?

532
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,527
Hmm, let's see.

533
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:50,294
All of your bad
is concentrated into one you.

534
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,835
Do you want to finish
where that's going?

535
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,737
l get it, l did it.

536
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:02,507
Where are we?

537
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,208
Dad, you're not going to like this.

538
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,479
Oh, it's just Alex.
Thank you for cleaning me up, <i>mija</i>.

539
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,515
Now, get me out of here. lt's stuffy.

540
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,991
What's your hurry? Handsome vineyard
guy waiting for you?

541
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,986
What are you talking about?

542
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:21,725
You're the one who had to prove
what a big macho man you were

543
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,198
with your cold cuts.

544
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,269
(EXCLAlMS) They're delicious!

545
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,196
BAD ALEX: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

546
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,068
l can't concentrate on the evil plan

547
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,802
we have going here if you
two are flappin' your yappers.

548
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,934
Evil plan?

549
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,036
You remember when l said,
''You're not going to like this''?

550
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,172
This is what l was talking about.

551
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,648
Who's ''we''?

552
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,209
(CHUC<i>k</i>LES) Excellent, Alex.

553
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,846
Hello, Russos.

554
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,819
Hey, it's that guy.

555
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,020
Hey, did you ever remember
that message from Justin?

556
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,902
Just as l thought.

557
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,768
JERRY: Alex, you don't have to do this.

558
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,540
So, what's next?

559
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,209
How would my partner
like a little road trip

560
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,081
to the Tower of Pisa?

561
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,285
Dominic is evil?

562
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,661
ls it weird he's even
more attractive now?

563
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,158
Harper, he took my family.

564
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:33,100
Oh, yeah, right. l won't date him.

565
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,939
Even as a young wizard,
l knew that some day

566
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,175
my dreams, though disturbing,

567
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:45,977
would come true.

568
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,484
And so, from this high vantage point,

569
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,021
we will launch the final steps to my plan

570
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,421
to rid the world of mortals and then...

571
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,052
You know, this Leaning Tower thing is
really kind of killer on the calves.

572
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,597
That's a nice story.
Can we get to what this thing does?

573
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,195
Right. This device... (LAUGHS)

574
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:05,997
...replicates spells.

575
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,834
Once energized with
sufficient wizard power,

576
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:11,807
it will cast a spell
repeatedly across Earth.

577
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,209
l call it the Dominic One Thousand.

578
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,142
ls that too self-centered?

579
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,415
You're asking the wrong girl.

580
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:25,244
l designed the Dominic One Thousand
to imprison every mortal,

581
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,087
thereby paving a way
for a new Wizard World

582
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,683
that l will rule.

583
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,194
-That last part again?
-That we will rule.

584
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,062
All that is needed is a spell cast

585
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:40,093
by our generation's most
powerful wizard, Alex Russo.

586
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,799
All right. Well, then let me at it.

587
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,399
No offense, you're just a knock-off.

588
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,137
You don't have all the powers.

589
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:49,008
l have enough powers to scorch a hole

590
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,513
in your little purple jacket there.

591
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,482
Point taken.

592
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:57,309
All right. So, what if your
''all powerful'' Alex doesn't come?

593
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,247
Oh, she'll come...

594
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,657
...to save her family.

595
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,860
Wait, wait, wait. l'm confused.
Are we tiny or are they giants?

596
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,001
So if it's called the Leaning Tower
of Pisa, where's all the pizza?

597
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,804
What?

598
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,777
(WHlSPERS) Alex, you need
to come up with a plan.

599
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,786
l'm not good with heights.

600
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,584
Or substandard architecture.

601
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:36,218
You're fine, Harper. Just don't look
down, it'll make you dizzy.

602
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,320
Too late. Dizzy. Going down.

603
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,163
Wait, Harper! (SCREAMS)

604
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,932
Oh. All right then. Ha-ha.

605
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:53,204
So, this is the top of the Tower of Pisa.

606
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:56,107
Whoo. Would you check out that view.
That is breathtaking.

607
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,111
My breath has been taken
from my lungs.

608
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,547
ALEX: l know, right?

609
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,050
We should post this on Wiz-agram.

610
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:02,608
-We should.
-Can you take a picture?

611
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,120
HARPER: Yeah, let's do that.

612
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,556
Ready? Say, ''Cheese.''

613
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,118
-Harper, run!
-(SCREAMS)

614
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,688
Yes. (LAUGHS)

615
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:20,432
Harper has joined
your family in captivity.

616
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,472
You let them go right now or l'll...

617
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,374
You'll what?
Don't forget, l have all the bad.

618
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,844
Yeah, well...

619
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,782
l look really cute in that outfit.

620
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,215
l know. l wasn't really sure
about the boots at first, but...

621
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,718
Focus on the mission.

622
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:39,082
Yeah, l heard all about your mission.

623
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,852
Clear out the mortal world

624
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,086
so that you can make room
to rule all evil wizards.

625
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,594
Good. You're up to speed.
Now, for that spell...

626
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:46,752
Never.

627
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,130
Why would you
underestimate me, Alex?

628
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,334
Perhaps you remember
my very determined uncle.

629
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,228
He had wings.

630
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,596
Gorog?

631
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,437
l came to finish
what you took from my uncle.

632
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,207
But where he failed, l will succeed.

633
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,338
My own wizard empire
right here on Earth!

634
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,904
-(BELL TOLLS)
-Ow!

635
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,950
Why are these stupid bells here?

636
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:11,544
Maybe to knock some sense into you
because l'm never doing that spell.

637
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,489
My family is more important
than anything.

638
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:15,820
Now give me the bracelet.

639
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,394
You're so stubborn with that spell.

640
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,621
Perhaps if l fill up one more charm,

641
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,166
it will convince you.

642
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,334
(MlMlCS HOWLlNG)

643
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,699
Mason!

644
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:30,772
No!

645
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,611
Mason. You're okay.

646
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,412
Get tired of Dominic already?

647
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,148
What? l don't care about him.

648
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,551
He's some crazy wizard

649
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,284
who's weaving some sort
of wicked web to take over the world.

650
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,724
Well, you're some kind
of wicked web weaver yourself.

651
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,290
What are you talking about?

652
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,093
l saw you at the villa with Dominic,
you two looked quite chummy.

653
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,293
No. That's what l'm trying to tell you.

654
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,462
Dominic tricked me
into casting out my bad side.

655
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,300
That's who you saw.
There's another me walking around.

656
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,069
And l have to get you out of here
before she finds you.

657
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:06,507
Let's go.

658
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,612
l knew l wasted time with that hug.

659
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,541
Two Alexes?

660
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:14,083
Mason, get away from her.

661
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:16,449
She's with Dominic,
and they're trying to take over the world.

662
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,851
Nice try, me.

663
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,685
Mason, she's the bad one. Let's go.

664
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,193
No! Don't listen to her.
l'm the good one. She's the bad one.

665
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,064
Well, isn't this a sticky wicket?

666
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,667
Mason, please believe me.

667
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,863
She's trying to trick you.

668
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,701
She doesn't even know how l dress.

669
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,535
That is something Harper would wear.

670
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,670
No, no, no, no.

671
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,840
l'm wearing it
because Harper asked me to.

672
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:46,712
Okay, that doesn't even sound like me.

673
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,685
Thank goodness.
l hope you and Dominic rot.

674
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,126
Mason, no!

675
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:11,038
Where are we?

676
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,508
The Leaning Tower of Pisa.

677
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,604
Oh. Very romantic.

678
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,806
DOMlNlC: l think so.

679
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:22,211
Dominic.

680
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,082
Oh, no.

681
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:31,320
Aww. You picked the wrong Alex.

682
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:40,161
Oh. Now, this is what l call
a ''take over the world'' look.

683
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,771
As for you...

684
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,903
Max, who joined us over there?

685
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,446
Hey, it's Mason.

686
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,079
What have l done?

687
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,186
l can't even grow up
when l try to grow up.

688
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,493
l don't even deserve
to be the family wizard.

689
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,928
Justin does.

690
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,191
And he'd know what to do.

691
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:13,563
Beep, beep, boop, beep, beep...

692
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,795
WOMAN: <i>Professor Justin</i>
<i>Vincenzo Pepe Russo is</i>...

693
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:16,862
(GROANS)

694
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,492
HARPER: <i>People should appreciate</i>
<i>you for who you are</i>,

695
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:41,394
<i>not for what they think you should be</i>.

696
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,632
Harper's right.

697
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,466
Everybody should just get over it.

698
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,034
l'm not perfect. l'm just a wizard

699
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,739
who has to save the world, again.

700
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,646
Okay, Dominic wants a spell?

701
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,887
l'll give him a spell...

702
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:10,324
...with a little bit of a surprise.

703
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,267
Okay, l'm here to get my family back.
Let's do this.

704
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,903
Excellent.

705
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:27,342
Aw, she's here to save the family.
How sweet. Ugh.

706
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,649
Dominic, give me the bracelet,
and l'll do the spell for your machine.

707
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,783
Agreed. Give it to her.

708
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:41,183
Wait. l know me.

709
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,719
We'll give her the bracelet

710
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,818
and she'll flash out
without doing the spell.

711
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,860
Right. Spell first, then the bracelet.

712
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,527
Nice try, but l know me, too.

713
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,332
l'll do the spell
and you'll keep my family anyway.

714
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,702
No bracelet, no spell.

715
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,098
-Spell first!
-Bracelet first.

716
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,938
-Spell first!
-Bracelet first.

717
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,568
-Spell first!
-Not doing anything...

718
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:04,011
-Spell first! Spell first! Spell first!
-...without the bracelet.

719
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,605
-Stop it!
-(BELL TOLLS)

720
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,878
Tower of Pisa, that hurt!

721
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,651
Alex will cast the spell at the same time

722
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,691
Bad Alex gives you
the bracelet, agreed?

723
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,450
That's a good idea.

724
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,422
Well, why didn't you think of it first?

725
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,518
(MOC<i>k</i>lNG)

726
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:23,764
One wave, two waves,
three waves, four.

727
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,461
Every mortal be no more.

728
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:36,370
Excellent. The world will now
be wiped clean of mortals.

(GRUNTS)

731
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:40,978
And then we wipe it clean of bells.

732
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,399
Was this how you wanted it to work?

733
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:06,341
Okay, the Leaning Tower of Pisa may
not have been the ideal place

734
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,776
for my Dominic One Thousand,
but it's working.

735
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:13,038
Every mortal will be imprisoned
in these beads.

736
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:17,645
Are you sure you don't want
a bucket or something?

737
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,387
The bracelet, please.

738
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,921
You know, Alex,
now is the time to join us.

739
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:29,432
With your powers,
we can rule more than just this world.

740
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,297
Thank you for remembering
l'm a powerful wizard.

741
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:36,001
Powerful enough that l can undo
any spell l create.

742
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,062
No!

743
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,302
The mortals who were gone
before can now...

744
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,647
What are you doing?
l was about to fix everything

745
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,017
before you guys swirled me out of there.

746
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,578
Well, if you're looking
for someone to blame,

747
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,283
you can just point your fingers
at yourself.

748
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:57,088
lf you had fingers, l mean.

749
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,423
MAN 2: Told you it was too soon.

750
00:39:58,495 --> 00:39:59,928
MAN 1 : lt wouldn't have mattered.

751
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,760
WOMAN: She's obviously stalling.

752
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,163
Don't you understand?

753
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,463
The spell replicator
is still capturing mortals.

754
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:09,336
You have to let me go,
so l can save the world, again.

755
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,133
There he is! Grab him, get him!

756
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,280
MAN 1 : Dominic, the Crystals
of Justice recognize you

757
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:21,283
as an esteemed member of Wiz Tech.

758
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,784
Do you have any testimony?

759
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,016
l most certainly do.

760
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:29,850
Alex Russo had no intention
to undo her spell.

761
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,021
She is a powerful, but selfish, wizard.

762
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,024
Why does everybody keep saying that?

763
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,431
So powerful that she put me
under her spell

764
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,264
to take the blame for her crime.

765
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,963
Spell? He's lying!

766
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,938
You need look no further than the fact

767
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:45,065
that she extracted her
own evil personality

768
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,440
and cast the spell
into the Dominic One Thous...

769
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,143
Alex One Thousand.

770
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,282
That's what she called it.

771
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:56,445
WOMAN: Alex Russo, do you deny this?

772
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,421
He's twisting things. He set me up.

-MAN 1 : Silence!
-(GAVEL POUNDlNG)

MAN 2: The evidence
against you is overwhelming.

775
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:07,386
After careful deliberation,
we, the Crystals of Justice,

776
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,659
find you guilty as charged

777
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,464
and sentence you
to no dessert for a week!

778
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,665
Oh. Well, that's not that bad.

779

MAN 2: Oh, no, sorry.
l was reading the wrong subsection.

780
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,903
lt's actually death.

781
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,005
Death by chocolate?

782
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,474
-WOMAN: No! Death by death!
-(GAVEL POUNDlNG)

783
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:33,416
What? No!
lt's Dominic you want, not me!

until your sentence is carried out.

785
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,621
Wait! No! Please!
You have to believe me!

786
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,556
l didn't do anything! He has my family!

787
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,641
l hope you got a last glimpse of Alex
before she meets her end.

788
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:55,606
You won't get away with this!

789
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,337
Already have.

790
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:00,578
(LAUGHlNG) You have
a girl's bracelet on!

791
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,775
No! lt's a uni-bracelet.

792
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,189
Dominic, if you had a spine,
you'd let me out of here,

793
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:08,451
so you and l can
settle this like gentlemen.

794
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,561
ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) <i>This just in</i>,

<i>Uhh</i>... <i>In other news</i>...

00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:46,257
This is bad. We should eat.

800
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,329
Why did l choose the Tower of Pisa?

801
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:58,169
l'm wondering the same thing, dude.

802
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,109
Nonetheless, Alex is now doomed.

803
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:05,379
And best of all, her loved ones
had a front row seat

804
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,780
to her conviction.

805
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,383
Dominic, one of those charms is broken.

806
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:16,349
-Mason.
-Yep.

807
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:28,163
(SlGHS) This is ridiculous.
l've got to try to get out of here.

808
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,105
Hello! Hello!

809
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,009
l'm going to use magic
to blow this door down,

810
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:39,070
so you better stand back.

811
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,211
And let me apologize in advance
for the mess l make.

812
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,086
l am really nice.

Mason, l'm so glad you're here.

815
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:00,163
Look, l just want to say l'm so sorry

816
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,070
for ruining your picnic and being selfish
and immature...

817
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,471
Alex, there's no time for that now.

818
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:08,307
You must save humanity
from Dominic and, well, you.

819
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,515
But l can't. l can't get out.
This dungeon is magic-proof.

820
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:15,073
Well, then,
let's find out if it's werewolf-proof.

Thank you.

lf you're really grateful,
you'd scratch behind my ears.

Oh. That's the spot. All right.
Come on, we gotta go.

l just dropped by
to give myself a beat down.

Alex? How did you get out?

837
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,179
Take a guess.

838
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,284
Dominic, it's over.

839
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,848
You're not gonna take over the world

You're not going to be able

Oh, yeah?

842
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,333
-Here...
-No, l got it. l got it.

You're ruining my moment.

Oh, no. Mason, l'll be right back.

Oh, l wish l could just rest here.

852
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,573
Okay, maybe l don't care
about the kitchen,

853
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:53,541
