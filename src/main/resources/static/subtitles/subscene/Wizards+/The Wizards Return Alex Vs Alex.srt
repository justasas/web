1
00:00:55,918 --> 00:01:00,065
Alex Russo, you kneel before
the Crystals of Justic.

2
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:06,000
where you are charged with treason for
attempting to destroy the mortal world.

3
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,933
I'm telling you, you have the wrong wizard.

4
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:09,933
Silence!

5
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:13,833
Ok, I am right here. You
do not have to yell.

6
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:19,600
What I was trying to say is that,
ok, maybe some bad things happened,

7
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,000
and maybe it was because of me, but
that doesn't mean it was my fault.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,866
I'd make a terrible lawyer.

9
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:28,733
Your fate has been decided.

10
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,800
The Crystal Cavern of Justice
hereby find you guilty!

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,533
Wait! No! Isn't there some way
we can replay what happened

12
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:37,533
so you would know I'm innocent?

13
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:39,166
Well, almost innocent.

14
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,833
You're not speaking of the
time vortex, are you?

15
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:45,100
Well, if that's what you call
a rewind button, then yeah.

16
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,133
Very well. We will send you back
to the moment this incident began.

17
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:52,166
All right. Well, get your
popcorn and licorice

18
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:57,400
because you're going to
like how this got started.

19
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,166
I just love drive-in movies. You can
yell at the screen and nobody cares.

20
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:16,833
Hey, genius, the walls are oozing
maggots, why are you taking a shower?

21
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,866
Alex...

22
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:25,966
Your own personal drive-in?!
Get rid of it now.

23
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:29,300
Come on, dad. I can get you your own car
and you can watch the movie with us.

24
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,566
I can get you a Churro truck.

25
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,433
Lose it.

26
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,333
Fine.

27
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,366
And whose car was that?

28
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,566
I don't know, but there's
some guy out on Waverly Place

29
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,566
who's been looking for his car for about
an hour, show me some love, Harper.

30
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:45,433
- Yeah.
- Harper, don't high-five her.

31
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,166
What she did was wrong and
unbelievably selfish.

32
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,033
Well, we left the guy
half a pack of licorice.

33
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,566
No, we didn't.

34
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:55,166
Dad, what's the big deal? I've
always done stuff like this.

35
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,566
Right, but now that
you're The Family Wizard,

36
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:01,233
it's time to stop using
magic for selfish reasons.

37
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:04,333
Now give me that popcorn.

38
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,466
Thank you so much, Mason.

39
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,633
Ok, you and Alex can hang up the banner.

40
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:11,133
Harper, get the ice cream
cake out of the freezer.

41
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:15,166
Jerry, stop eating popcorn off the floor.

42
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:19,133
Wait, did you say party? For who?

43
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,666
I have a fair inkling.

44
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,100
Another party for Justin?!

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,866
We're just so excited about
him taking over WizTech.

46
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:29,166
It's a big deal.

47
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,933
Yeah. I guess you're right.

48
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,966
It's not like, you know,
actually winning the

49
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:35,566
family competition and
becoming the full wizard.

50
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,700
Since nobody ever threw me a party.

51
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,733
Hey, I didn't get a party
or get to become a wizard.

52
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:45,100
I just got these all-you-can-eat
bologna scraps.

53
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,533
Mm-mm. Maybe I am the winner.

54
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,166
Come on, everybody. We've
got a lot of work to do.

55
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:55,000
Justin's going to be here soon.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,366
All right, I'm done. Where's my magazine?

57
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:02,233
Mason, rub my shoulders.
That was hard work.

58
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,666
Hey! I just told you,

59
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:08,300
magic is not for getting what you
want or using it for selfish reasons.

60
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,033
Mason, stop rubbing her shoulders!

61
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,700
That's right, Mija, you should use your

62
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,233
magic to make other people's lives easier.

63
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:19,466
I know a pretty Latina who would love
to never have to do laundry again.

64
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,600
Theresa.

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,800
Sorry. Your father's right.
It's time to grow up.

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,200
"Grow up?" Everybody knows people
who grow up too fast are miserable.

67
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,533
I mean, look at Harper.

68
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,933
She's been doing her parents' laundry
since she was in the second grade.

69
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,066
Oh, see, the laundry I didn't mind so much.

70
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,866
It was rotating the tires
on the minivan that just...

71
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:40,700
Really got to me.

72
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:46,766
Where's Justin? He should've
been here by now.

73
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,033
You mean he's not here?

74
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:51,100
I'm so bored I thought he was here
telling one of his nerdy stories

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,100
that always ends with "hey,
wake up, everybody!"

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,566
I'm so sorry for the intrusion.
I'm Justin's friend Dominic.

77
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,200
He asked me to give you a message.

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,466
He is too busy at WizTech and
unfortunately cannot come.

79
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:08,600
Ok. Give us the message.

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,700
Uh... that was the message.

81
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,433
Ok. Can we start from the top? Because
this guy is all over the place.

82
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:18,666
- So is Justin all right?
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Russo. Justin is fine.

83
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,466
It's just more difficult for someone with
his spectacular talents to get away.

84
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,533
Now, I don't usually use
the word "spectacular,"

85
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,500
but in Justin's case, spectacular.

86
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,766
Justin isn't coming? What are we
gonna do with the ice cream cake.

87
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:35,366
Oh, I'm sure you'll think
of something, Jerry.

88
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:38,633
Excuse me, you must be Alex Russo.

89
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:42,833
You're quite famous in the Wizard World
but I had no idea you were so...

90
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,166
Beautiful.

91
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,100
Oh, come on. I'm not that famous.

92
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:52,266
Dominic. Nice to meet you, mate.
I'm Mason Greyback.

93
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:55,900
Perhaps you've heard of me,
Alex's Werewolf boyfriend.

94
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,433
Boyfriend? You're a lucky man.

95
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:02,033
Yes, I am. A lucky Werewolf.

96
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,666
Well, it seems like I've made
this awkward, forgive me.

97
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,333
It was an honor meeting you, Alex.
So long, everyone.

98
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,533
Werewolf.

99
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:20,633
Boy, he was the most polite
wizard I have ever met.

100
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,633
And easy on the eyes.

101
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:26,166
Reminded me of a young me.

102
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,300
You know, I think he was into you, Alex.

103
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,833
Oh. No, no, no, no.

104
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,733
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

105
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,466
I can't believe Justin's not coming.

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,266
I wanted him to be here
for my big announcement.

107
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,266
A while ago, I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela, in Italy,

108
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,166
inviting us to a Russo family reunion.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,733
It's ok, dad. What's your announcement?

110
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:51,533
- That was the announcement.
- Oh, great, now dad's all over the place.

111
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,666
Aw, Jerry, you're taking me on a
romantic trip to Italy, I love you.

112
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,533
Well... actually, I'm
taking the whole family.

113
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:02,333
Why? They don't know we have kids.

114
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:06,100
But, Theresa, it's a family reunion.
Or should I say...

115
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:09,000
Riunione di famiglia?

116
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:10,700
Please don't do that, dad.

117
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:14,833
It's almost as annoying as
when you say "mootsa-rella".

118
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,633
Well, you guys have fun.

119
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,233
I'll just stay here and read or something.

120
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,466
Yeah, and I'll just stay here
and chew up the furniture.

121
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:28,233
This couch looks pretty fruity.

122
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,500
You guys are family, too. I got
tickets for all of us to go.

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,700
- Oh yay!
- All right!

124
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,500
Tickets? Dad, if you want to go to
Italy, I can be our travel agent.

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,833
No time for that travel confusion. Show
me the door to our Italian reunion.

126
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,600
Ok, I don't know how to say
"Wizard Speed Pass" in Italian,

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,433
so I'm just going to go with "Mamma Mia!"

128
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,600
Or at least I think that's Italian.

129
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,233
A door to Japan? How cool.

130
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,266
It's Italy.

131
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,933
I don't know all the towns in Japan, dude.

132
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:13,666
Alex, you're not going to turn this trip
into one of your selfish shortcuts.

133
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,700
I want us to experience the whole journey.

134
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,366
Getting there is half the fun.

135
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,533
Now, get rid of this thing.

136
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,466
Whoa.

137
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,566
Did you just see that girl?

138
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,500
Alex, I have to get her number first.

139
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,333
Max, get back here!

140
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,766
Would you please grow up?! Max!

141
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,033
Ok, let's just find Max and go home.

142
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,333
So we can fly back here.

143
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,633
Wow! Look at this place.

144
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:54,600
Oh. It's beautiful.

145
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,400
Your family lives here?

146
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,733
Villa di Russo.

147
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:10,600
I don't know who "Villa di" is,
but Russo is definitely me.

148
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,466
I don't think he's mad at you anymore.

149
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:17,566
Oh, don't be fooled. He's happy
anywhere there's cheese hanging.

150
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,400
Man. I lost her.

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,333
I didn't even get her name,
but she looked like a Tomiko.

152
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,800
Tomiko! Tomiko!

153
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,566
Max. Forget the girl. We've
got girls back home.

154
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,500
Yeah, but there's no
Italians in New York, Mom.

155
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,266
Oh, come on. Can't we stay a little longer?

156
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:38,233
This is the first time Alex's magic
took me somewhere that didn't scare me.

157
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:41,266
No. We're not coming to Italy this way.

158
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:44,166
We're going to experience a
family trip the real way.

159
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,066
You mean on a discount flight in
cramped seats with bad food and

160
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:51,666
an obnoxious kid in front of you
saying, "peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo".

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,700
Ciao, bella.

162
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,900
Are you here for a tour
of the Russo vineyard?

163
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,866
Well... I, uh...

164
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,966
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

165
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,733
We're not here for the tour, paisan.
Go back to work.

166
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,600
And put a shirt on! All right, let's go.

167
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,133
Ok, fine. But you'll only
have yourself to blame

168
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:17,733
when that peek-a-boo kid uses
your lap for a barf bag.

169
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:22,633
All right, is everybody here?

170
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:26,233
Good. Now, Alex, get rid of this thing.

171
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,000
Ok.

172
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,133
Hmm... the spell I need is
like things in my bedroom.

173
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,433
It's buried under the
dirty clothes of my mind.

174
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:41,466
You see? Justin would never do a spell
that he didn't know how to undo.

175
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:44,466
Oh, I get it. I get this
whole "grown-up" thing now.

176
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,966
You think Justin should've
been The Family Wizard.

177
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:49,733
Honey, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean it that way.

178
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:55,466
No. I'm sorry I'm not the grown-up
Family Wizard you want me to be.

179
00:10:55,466 --> 00:11:01,366
Well, up until then, that was the best
five-minute vacation I've ever had.

180
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,066
Ahem, excuse me, is this Jumbotron taken?

181
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,000
Dominic? What are you doing here?

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,833
My night job is cleaning
the back of the Jumbotron.

183
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,566
You being here is just a bonus.

184
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:33,233
Look, you seem really nice,
but I have a boyfriend.

185
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,366
And to be honest I don't think I'd
be really good company right now.

186
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:39,800
Unless you're a fan of big,
sloppy emotional meltdowns.

187
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,466
You know, I was just saying this morning,

188
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:45,166
I haven't seen a big, sloppy
emotional meltdown in a while.

189
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,633
Let's see what you got.

190
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:51,333
Ah, a smile.

191
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,233
Have you ever considered
joining The Wizard Council?

192
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,200
The Wizard Council?

193
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:01,833
Isn't that for old geezers who wear robes
because they're tired of shopping?

194
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,433
I just believe you have the
potential to be the most,

195
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,366
powerful wizard of your generation.

196
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:12,166
Trust me. You have no idea
what you're truly capable of.

197
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,500
Well, if you ask my family,

198
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,266
I'm not capable of anything
except refusing to grow up.

199
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:22,633
They're mortals. They can't
understand wizards with your power.

200
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,200
Besides, if their opinions
really bothers you,

201
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,133
you're powerful enough to create your own
spell to smooth out your little edges.

202
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,500
Why are you telling me this?

203
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,900
Because where everyone else
sees trouble, I see magic.

204
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,633
And beauty.

205
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,633
Ok, now you're just flirting.

206
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,466
Yeah, a little bit.

207
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,066
- Here. It's a small gift.
- Oh, no. I can't take that.

208
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:56,033
It's simply a friendship bracelet.

209
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,433
Everything ok up here?

210
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:04,366
Oh, yeah. Mason, sorry. I just had
to get away from home, you know.

211
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,200
And I just came to check on her.
I apologize if I've overstepped.

212
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
You have, mate, and I'm here now.

213
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,333
Werewolf.

214
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,400
- Good-bye, Alex.
- Bye.

215
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,800
Werewolf.

216
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,433
I do not like that guy.

217
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,400
Anything I should be worried about?

218
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,600
Not a thing.

219
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,733
Good. Well, I've got a
surprise to cheer you up.

220
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:33,400
I thought we would have a little picnic.

221
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:38,166
Don't say Italian, because I've
had enough of that, today.

222
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,900
No. I was thinking
something sophisticated...

223
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,933
- Poached salmon.
- Oh, Mason...

224
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,100
That's so sweet.

225
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:51,633
But can I make a little tweak?

226
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,533
Of course, darling.

227
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:59,100
Check it out, finger food feast.
I call the wing.

228
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:02,100
No, Alex! Alex, you know
this food is bad for you.

229
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:06,000
Besides, I cooked that salmon,
two hours over a hot poacher.

230
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:10,600
Why? You know it only takes
me like two seconds.

231
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,933
I see. So, this is how it's
going to be from now on.

232
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:18,200
- What?
- Just you, me and your wand.

233
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,433
Just using your magic selfishly
no matter who it hurts.

234
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:27,700
Mason, where are you going?
I did all this for us.

235
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,000
So did I.

236
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:42,400
So you turned Mason's classy picnic
into a county fair fry-fest?

237
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Well, everybody knows that
my favorite food comes in

238
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,000
cardboard containers with
some kind of dipping sauce.

239
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:50,766
Ewe.

240
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:56,700
Oh, hi, Alex. Can you tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

241
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,633
Everything you're wearing
is from the nineties.

242
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,266
Oh, but if you guys wear
it, it's "vintage".

243
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,466
Have you figured out how to
get rid of this thing yet?

244
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,900
Uh, no. I've been a little busy.

245
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:14,900
But don't worry, I'll figure it out
something before Max can use it again.

246
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:20,266
Hey, who wants to help me
make a hot tub out of this?

247
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,900
I bet I know how he's going
to make the bubbles.

248
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,500
Max, stop going to Italy. And, Alex, you...

249
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:29,300
I know, I know. Grow up.

250
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,566
You're right, pop. I'll
just take this back.

251
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,500
Max, you forgot the barrel!

252
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,366
Max!

253
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:39,566
He's not coming back, is he?

254
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,500
Theresa, we have to find Max again!

255
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:46,000
What?! I was about to make dinner.

256
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:50,366
It's just Italy, we'll be right back.

257
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:00,700
Hey, are you ok?

258
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,966
It's just that, I thought once
I became The Family Wizard,

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,266
all of this pressure would be off of me.

260
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,333
But no, it's like everybody
still wants me to change.

261
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:13,433
Well, that doesn't make a lot of sense.

262
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,766
It's who you are in the first place
that made you The Family Wizard.

263
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,466
I know, but maybe growing up
would make me a better person.

264
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,400
I mean, I can't even say anything nice

265
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,633
about my best friend's
hideous clambake outfit.

266
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,666
I'm sorry, Harper. I held
off as long as I could.

267
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:33,166
But you see? That's what I mean. You
making fun of my outfit is you.

268
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,600
And me loving this outfit is me.

269
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,700
People should appreciate
you for who you are,

270
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:41,500
not for what they think you should be.

271
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:47,200
Right. And I am a powerful wizard
who can change if I want to.

272
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,833
Just smooth out my little edges.

273
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:51,700
Wait, hold up. Ok, so,
after my great speech,

274
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,966
you're still going to change
your personality with magic?

275
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,066
Well, just the parts that nobody likes.

276
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:59,366
So, you're going to change
your whole personality?

277
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:01,066
I owed you for the clambake comment.

278
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,533
- All right.
- Yeah, that's good.

279
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,666
Selfish, mean and tired of rejection.

280
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,300
Take these parts to a place of reflection.

281
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,100
Alex, are you ok?

282
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,233
I think so. Did it work?

283
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:20,066
I don't know. You look the same.
Here, let me test you.

284
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:22,333
What do you think of my clambake outfit?

285
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,333
Mm. It's horrible...

286
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,700
That you didn't make me one.

287
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,900
- Oh, it worked!
- I'm totally nice!

288
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,766
Wait.

289
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:36,300
If you still have all your good parts,
where did all your bad parts go?

290
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,700
Hey! Let me out of here, you ugly hags!

291
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,533
And I found my bad parts.

292
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,933
Oh, come on. She doesn't seem that bad.

293
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,066
I can smell that nasty outfit
all the way from here!

294
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:52,400
- Oh, I am not afraid of you!
- Well, come and get me, lobster girl!

295
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:56,233
Harper, don't let me taunt you.

296
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,800
Hey, maybe she's like a bird.

297
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,533
She'll be quiet if we cover her up.

298
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,400
Hey! Take this off!

299
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,866
Oh, Alex. You have no
idea what you've started.

300
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Did you find Max?

301
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,433
No.

302
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,466
But I found out where my
cousins keep their cannolis.

303
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,766
Jerry, you're supposed to be
looking for your son, not dessert.

304
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,666
Let me have a bite of that. Come on.

305
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,633
- Oh, Max!
- Where?

306
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,366
Oh!

307
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,833
Mmm.

308
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:50,166
Let's just go home and try to
lure Max back with this cannoli.

309
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,266
- Ok.
- What I'm saying.

310
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,366
There's not going to be any left.

311
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,900
- Let's get a couple to go.
- Ok.

312
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,066
Where are you going? Thieves!

313
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,700
Buon giorno. We're just
looking for our son.

314
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,666
We're not stealing.

315
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,333
Carmela? Cousin Carmela?

316
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:16,900
Jerry Russo!

317
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,900
Bianca, Gino, put your wands down.

318
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,166
Geraldo!

319
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,733
Cugino Geraldo!

320
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:30,866
Look at you. You still have a baby face.
It's so smooth.

321
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,433
Oh, that's just the
grease from the cannoli.

322
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:36,066
- Carmela, this is my wife, Theresa.
- Oh, Theresa!

323
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,566
Nice to meet... too tight.

324
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Too thin. This one is like a bread stick.

325
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:47,566
Hey, Geraldo, what are you doing here?
The reunion isn't for month, huh?

326
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:51,066
Oh, who cares? Let's eat.

327
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:58,833
- Benvenuto!
- Max.

328
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm sorry. I just love meeting people.
Hi, Max Russo.

329
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,300
We have been looking all over for you.

330
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,900
This is our son, Max. I'm sorry.

331
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,500
He saw a pretty girl through the Wizard
Speed Pass and came to find her.

332
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,800
You have a Wizard Speed Pass?

333
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,166
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

334
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,766
Only the most powerful
wizards can create those.

335
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:23,466
Ah, but your Family Wizard, Alex Russo.

336
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,733
Yes. Alex is very powerful, and very...

337
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:29,200
Irresponsible!

338
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:36,600
Just because you say it loud and weird
doesn't make it Italian, Jerry.

339
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,933
There's that girl. I have to meet her.

340
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:42,000
She might be the future Mrs. Max Russo.

341
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,833
Mrs. Russo! Mrs. Russo!

342
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:48,166
Your son likes Francesca?

343
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,400
What's so funny?

344
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:56,666
Francesca is his cousin!

345
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,533
Ewe.

346
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:04,400
Theresa, did Geraldo tell you that we were
wizards in training at the same time?

347
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:06,766
We had so much fun.

348
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:11,100
Geraldo, remember I used to tickle you?

349
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,466
Stop, stop! Get the bread stick.
Get the bread stick.

350
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,133
No. No, oh no.

351
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:29,633
So, what do you think about
taking accordion lessons with me?

352
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,666
Well, why wouldn't I?
You're my best friend.

353
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,766
It's like a dream come true.

354
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,433
Ok. I'm ready!

355
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,100
- What do you think?
- I think it's missing something.

356
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,833
- Come here.
- Oh.

357
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:50,400
- Oh, this is the best day of my life.
- Oh, I'm so happy you're happy.

358
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,533
Thank you, Alex. You're such a good friend.

359
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,800
- Now, take it off.
- What, why?

360
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:58,233
Because even though I love that you finally
appreciate something I like to do,

361
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:02,200
it's just not you and,
I don't need it to be.

362
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:03,266
Thank you.

363
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,933
Besides, I can pull off a clambake outfit.

364
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:09,600
On you, it just looks stupid.

365
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,566
What was that?

366
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,500
Oh! Something I think is going
to take up the rest of the day.

367
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:22,433
Harper, grab the fishing net.
We might need it to catch me.

368
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,400
Yup. I broke out.

369
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,333
Ok, where would a Bad Alex go?

370
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:35,033
Usually, only as far as the
couch, but that door is open.

371
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,233
Oh, gosh.

372
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,733
What are you doing?

373
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:45,700
You know, I really should have
made a shawl out of this net.

374
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,533
Carmela, this cheese is amazing.

375
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:53,433
Oh yeah, Papa Fabrizio makes it.

376
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,200
Eh.

377
00:22:57,433 --> 00:23:01,433
We need find me before
I do something bad...

378
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,366
Hi, Mom and dad. Guess what? I've changed.

379
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:08,566
Yeah, into a third grade art project.

380
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,466
No, no, no. Not that, dad. Guess what?

381
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,800
All the part of me that has all
of those bad things is gone.

382
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,566
Yup. Gone. Nowhere to be seen.

383
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,333
Unless of course you've seen it.

384
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,033
Mom, dad, from now on I promise...

385
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:27,566
To be the unselfish grown-up
you expect me to be.

386
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,833
I don't believe her.

387
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,466
Me neither.

388
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:34,400
Seriously, why are you
wearing a clambake outfit?

389
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,333
Because my best friend asked me to.

390
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:42,166
Dad, sometimes you need to do
things to make others happy.

391
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,400
Now, I definitely don't believe her.

392
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:49,300
Look, I still don't like
the way we got here...

393
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:53,400
But they're feeding us. So you
might as well meet the family.

394
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:58,466
Everyone, I'd like you to meet our friend
Harper, and our Family Wizard, Alex!

395
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,366
Oh.

396
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:03,266
So cute.

397
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,166
Pooka-pooka-pooka!

398
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,833
Just like your father!

399
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:11,700
- Why is she tickling me?
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!

400
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:21,033
Excuse me, I'm looking for a girl that's
about this tall and this beautiful...

401
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:29,033
Hey it's you.

402
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,066
You know my name?

403
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:37,033
Or, wait, does it just take that
long to say my name in Italian?

404
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't understand what
you're saying right now.

405
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:43,500
I'll try the language of love with you.

406
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:49,433
Ok, maybe you don't speak that language.

407
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:52,300
Oh, Max. I'll save you.

408
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,266
Not really.

409
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:08,133
Thanks, Alex. They kiss really weird here.

410
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,533
All right. I'm safe in a bracelet. Thanks.

411
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:14,233
Safe or trapped?

412
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,266
By that evil chuckle, I'm
going to go with "trapped".

413
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:27,066
And this is where we press the
finest grapes in all of Tuscany.

414
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,800
Oh, that looks like hard work.

415
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:36,200
Please. Stomping your feet isn't hard work.

416
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:39,533
Yeah, filling bread rolls
with cold cuts all day.

417
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,400
That's hard work.

418
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,666
Geraldo...

419
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:46,166
Why don't you try it?

420
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,433
- Oh, no. No, thanks.
- Ah...

421
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:52,966
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!
- Ha-ha-ha! Ok. Ok.

422
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,600
- You too, Theresa.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm ok.

423
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,700
- Get in.
- No, no, no.

424
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,800
- Theresa, get in.
- No thank you.

425
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,800
Get in!

426
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,066
Si, senora.

427
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:07,500
It's nice to appreciate my Mom and
dad doing something together.

428
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:11,200
Old me would've just been thinking
of ways to make fun of them.

429
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:12,566
- Oh.
- Oh.

430
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,266
- Oh, it's so squishy.
- Oh.

431
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:21,333
Ugh. And the worst part
is, I kind of like it.

432
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,333
Thanks a lot, Jerry. You know
what this reminds me of?

433
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:28,466
The time the bathtub backed up and you
made us take showers in there anyway.

434
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,066
Don't blame me. You were the one who
said, "oh, handsome vineyard guy"...

435
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,666
"You're so strong, the way
you squash those grapes".

436
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,466
I never said that.

437
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,466
- Oh, yes, you did.
- Oh, please.

438
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:48,600
- You imagined it.
- Oh. Oh, really?

439
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,233
Your insecurities imagined it.

440
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:51,300
Aha!

441
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:52,933
Ooh.

442
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:56,700
Hey, you know, they should
really have machines for this.

443
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,600
- Don't you think?
- Oh!

444
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,766
I would never disrespect you like that!

445
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,533
- Oh, honey, wait.
- What?

446
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:12,666
You love me so much you got so jealous?

447
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,800
- Oh, honey...
- Good!

448
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,533
Aw. They found a way to make it worse
for themselves without my help.

449
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:25,633
Changing me was great.

450
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,633
My cousins! Where did they go?

451
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:46,666
Oh, no. Harper, do you think my bad side

452
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,033
could've done something
terrible to my parents?

453
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:52,833
Hmm, let's see. All of your bad
is concentrated into one you.

454
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:58,800
- Do you want to finish where that's going?
- I get it, I did it.

455
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:05,366
Where are we?

456
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Dad. You're not going to like this.

457
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:12,700
Oh, it's just Alex. Thank you
for cleaning me up, Mija.

458
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,566
Now, get me out of here. It's stuffy.

459
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,333
What's your hurry? Handsome
vineyard guy waiting for you?

460
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,833
What are you talking about?

461
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:26,000
You're the one who had to prove what a big
macho man you were with your cold cuts.

462
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,833
Yeah-ha! They're delicious!

463
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I can't
concentrate on the evil

464
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,633
plan we have going here if you
two are flappin' your yappers.

465
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:35,666
Evil plan?

466
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,966
You remember when I said, "you're
not going to like this?"

467
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,666
This is what I was talking about.

468
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,100
Who's "we?"

469
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,833
Excellent, Alex.

470
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,766
Hello, Russo's.

471
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:55,700
Hey, it's that guy. Hey, did you ever
remember that message from Justin?

472
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:06,533
Just as I thought.

473
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:11,233
Alex! You don't have to do this.

474
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,133
So, what's next?

475
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:19,066
How would my partner like a little
road trip to the Tower of Pisa?

476
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,066
Dominic is evil?

477
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,200
Is it weird he's even more attractive now?

478
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:38,166
- Harper. He took my family.
- Oh yeah, right. I won't date him.

479
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:45,466
Even as a young wizard I knew
that some day my dreams...

480
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:48,733
Though disturbing, would come true.

481
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:53,733
And so, from this high vantage point, we
will launch the final steps to my plan

482
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:56,400
to rid the world of mortals and then...

483
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,433
You know, it's really kind
of killer on the calves.

484
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:03,566
That's a nice story, can we
get to what this thing does?

485
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:06,566
Right. This device...

486
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,566
Replicates spells.

487
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:11,300
Once energized with
sufficient wizard power,

488
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,400
it will cast a spell
repeatedly across Earth.

489
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,600
I call it the "Dominic One Thousand".

490
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:21,833
Is that too self-centered?

491
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,600
You're asking the wrong girl.

492
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:28,033
I designed the Dominic One
Thousand to imprison every mortal,

493
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:32,300
thereby paving the way for a new
Wizard World that I will rule.

494
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,733
- Uh, that last part again?
- That we will rule.

495
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:40,966
All that is needed is a spell cast by our
generation's most powerful wizard...

496
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,766
Alex Russo.

497
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:45,566
All right. Well, then let me at it.

498
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:49,866
No offense, you're just a knock-off.
You don't have all of her powers.

499
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:54,600
I have enough powers to scorch a hole
in your little purple jacket there.

500
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,300
Point taken.

501
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,733
All right. So, what if your "all
powerful" Alex doesn't come?

502
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,566
Oh, she'll come...

503
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,333
To save her family.

504
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:15,800
Wait, wait, wait. I'm confused.
Are we tiny or are they giants?

505
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,900
So if it's called the Leaning Tower
of Pisa, where is all the pizza?

506
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,900
What?

507
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,800
Alex, you need to come up with a plan.

508
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,333
I'm not good with heights.

509
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,933
Or substandard architecture.

510
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:40,533
You're fine, Harper. Just don't
look down, it'll make you dizzy.

511
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:43,800
Oh, Too late. Dizzy. Going down.

512
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:46,433
Wait, Harper!

513
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,033
Oh. All right then. Ha ha.

514
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:57,200
So, this is the top of the Tower of Pisa.

515
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,966
Woo. Would you check out that view.

516
00:31:58,966 --> 00:32:02,133
That is breathtaking. My
breath has been taken...

517
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:04,200
- From my lungs.
- I know, right?

518
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,066
- We should post this on Wiz-agram.
- We should.

519
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:11,200
- Can you take a picture?
- Yeah, let's do that.

520
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,000
Ready? Say, "cheese".

521
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
- Harper, run!
- Ah!

522
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:21,100
Yes.

523
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,766
Harper has joined your family in captivity.

524
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:28,666
- You let them go right now or I'll...
- You'll what?

525
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:31,800
Don't forget, I have all the bad.

526
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,200
Yeah, well...

527
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,366
I look really cute in that outfit.

528
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,033
I know. I wasn't really sure
about the boots at first but...

529
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:41,233
Focus on the mission.

530
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:44,033
Yeah, I heard all about your mission.

531
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:47,633
Clear out the mortal world so that you
can make room to rule all evil wizards.

532
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,166
Good. You're up to speed.
Now, for that spell...

533
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:54,233
- Never.
- Why would you underestimate me, Alex?

534
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:57,433
Perhaps you remember my
very determined uncle.

535
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,966
- He had wings.
- Gorog.

536
00:32:59,966 --> 00:33:02,866
I came to finish what
you took from my uncle.

537
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:05,133
But where he failed, I will succeed.

538
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:07,633
My own wizard empire right here on Earth!

539
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:12,266
Ow! Why are these stupid bells here!

540
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:16,033
Maybe to knock some sense into you
because I'm never doing that spell.

541
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,866
My family is more important than anything.

542
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:20,866
Now give me the bracelet.

543
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,400
You're so stubborn with that spell.

544
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:29,266
Perhaps if I fill up one more
charm, it will convince you.

545
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,700
Mason!

546
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,500
No!

547
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:43,033
Mason. You're ok.

548
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:45,266
Get tired of Dominic already?

549
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,533
What? I don't care about him.

550
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:51,833
He's some crazy wizard who's weaving some
sort of wicked web to take over the world.

551
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:55,100
Well, you're some kind of
wicked web weaver yourself.

552
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,733
What are you talking about?

553
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,566
I saw you at the Villa with Dominic,
you two looked quite chummy.

554
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:01,866
No. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

555
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:04,866
Dominic tricked me into
casting out my bad side.

556
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:07,400
That's who you saw. There's
another me walking around.

557
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:12,366
And I have to get you out of here
before she finds you. Let's go.

558
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:15,700
I knew I wasted time with that hug.

559
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:18,000
- Two Alex's?
- Mason, get away from her.

560
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:20,733
She's with Dominic, and they're
trying to take over the world.

561
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:24,000
Nice try, me. Mason, she's the bad one.
Let's go.

562
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:29,966
No! Don't listen to her. I'm the good one.
She's the bad one.

563
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:33,833
Well, isn't this a sticky wicket.

564
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:36,133
Mason, please believe me.

565
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,133
She's trying to trick you.

566
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:42,233
She doesn't even know how I dress.

567
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,933
That is something Harper would wear.

568
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,100
No, no, no, no. I'm wearing it
because Harper asked me to.

569
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:53,366
Ok, that doesn't even sound like me.

570
00:34:58,033 --> 00:35:01,166
Thank goodness. I hope you and Dominic rot.

571
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,433
Mason, no!

572
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,066
- Where are we?
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa.

573
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,866
Oh. Very romantic.

574
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:23,466
I think so.

575
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:27,566
Dominic.

576
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,233
Oh, no.

577
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,733
Aw. You picked the wrong Alex.

578
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:40,500
Oh. Now, this is what I call a
"take over the world" look.

579
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:43,033
As for you...

580
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,266
Max, who joined us over there?

581
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,666
Hey, it's Mason.

582
00:36:01,566 --> 00:36:07,133
What have I done? I can't even
"grow up" when I try to grow up.

583
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,966
I don't even deserve to
be The Family Wizard.

584
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:12,366
Justin does.

585
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,633
And he'd know what to do.

586
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,900
Beep, beep, boop, beep, beep...

587
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,100
Professor Justin Vincenzo Pepe Russo is...

588
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,100
People should appreciate
you for who you are,

589
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:47,800
not for what they think you should be.

590
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,233
Harper's right.

591
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,200
Everybody should just get over it.

592
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,766
I'm not perfect, I'm just...

593
00:36:56,766 --> 00:37:00,566
A wizard who has to save the world, again.

594
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,433
Ugh!

595
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,400
Ok, Dominic wants a spell?

596
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,366
I'll give him a spell...

597
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:16,266
With a little bit of a surprise.

598
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:25,900
Ok, I'm here to get my family back.
Let's do this.

599
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:27,333
Excellent.

600
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:32,666
Aw, she's here to save the family.
How sweet. Ugh.

601
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:37,766
Dominic, give me the bracelet, and
I'll do the spell for your machine.

602
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,033
Agreed. Give it to her.

603
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,366
Wait...

604
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,833
I know me.

605
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,466
We'll give her the bracelet and she'll
flash out without doing the spell.

606
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:53,166
Right. Spell first then the bracelet.

607
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,833
Nice try, but I know me, too.

608
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,733
I'll do the spell and you'll
keep my family anyway.

609
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:00,366
No bracelet, no spell.

610
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:02,500
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

611
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,266
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

612
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,966
- Spell first!
- Not doing anything...

613
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:08,333
Spell first! Spell first!

614
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:10,566
Stop it!

615
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,400
Tower of Pisa that hurt!

616
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:20,000
Alex will cast the spell at the same time
Bad Alex gives you the bracelet, agreed?

617
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,766
- That's a good idea.
- Well, why didn't you think of it first?

618
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:28,133
One wave, two waves, three waves, four.

619
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:31,433
Every mortal be no more.

620
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:41,766
Excellent. The world will now
be wiped clean of mortals.

621
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:46,233
Ow! And then we wipe it clean of bells.

622
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,800
Was this how you wanted it to work?

623
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,500
Ok, the Leaning Tower of Pisa may
not have been the ideal place

624
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,733
for my Dominic One Thousand,
but it's working.

625
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:18,933
Every mortal will be
imprisoned in these beads.

626
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,433
Are you sure you don't want
a bucket or something?

627
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:25,566
The bracelet, please.

628
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:30,566
You know, Alex, now is the time to join us.

629
00:39:30,566 --> 00:39:34,500
With your powers, we can rule
more than just this world.

630
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,333
Thank you for remembering
I'm a powerful wizard.

631
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,666
Powerful enough that I can
undo any spell I create.

632
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:41,500
No!

633
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,266
The mortals who were
gone before, can now...

634
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,033
What are you doing? I was
about to fix everything

635
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:55,166
before you guys swirled me out of there.

636
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,933
Well, if you're looking
for someone to blame,

637
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,733
you can just point your
fingers at yourself.

638
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,133
If you had fingers, I mean.

639
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,500
- Told you it was too soon.
- It wouldn't have mattered.

640
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,366
She's obviously stalling.

641
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:09,866
Don't you understand? The spell
replicator is still capturing mortals.

642
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:15,066
You have to let me go, so I
can save the world, again.

643
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,466
There he is! Grab him, get him!

644
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:23,400
Dominic, the Crystals of Justice recognize

645
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:25,800
you as an esteemed member of WizTech.

646
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:27,700
Do you have any testimony?

647
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,733
I most certainly do.

648
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:34,200
Alex Russo had no intention
to undo her spell.

649
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,333
She is a powerful, but selfish wizard.

650
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,233
Why does everybody keep saying that?

651
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:43,433
So powerful that she put me under her
spell to take the blame for her crime.

652
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,233
Spell?! He's lying!

653
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:49,233
You need look no further than the fact that
she extracted her own evil personality

654
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:53,033
and cast the spell into
the Dominic One Thous...

655
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,833
Alex One Thousand.

656
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:58,533
That's what she called it.

657
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,866
Alex Russo, do you deny this?

658
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:03,633
He's twisting things. He set me up.

659
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,066
Silence!

660
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:07,700
The evidence against you is overwhelming.

661
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,700
After careful deliberation,
we, the Crystals of Justice,

662
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,633
find you guilty as charged and
sentence you to no dessert for a week!

663
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:19,766
Oh.

664
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,333
Well, that's not that bad.

665
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,966
Oh, no, sorry. I was reading
the wrong subsection.

666
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,533
It's actually death.

667
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:30,333
Death by chocolate?

668
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:33,400
No! Death by death!

669
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,633
What?! No! It's Dominic you want, not me!

670
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:41,366
You will be incarcerated until
your sentence is carried out.

671
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,733
Wait! No! Please! You have to believe me!

672
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:49,233
I didn't do anything! He has my family!

673
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:58,166
I hope you got a last glimpse of
Alex before she meets her end.

674
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,700
You won't get away with this!

675
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,533
Already have.

676
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:05,333
You have a girl's bracelet on!

677
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:08,366
No! It's a uni-bracelet.

678
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:10,533
Dominic, if you had a spine,
you'd let me out of here,

679
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:15,333
so you and I can settle
this like gentlemen.

680
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:28,733
This just in, it's been reported
that people around the world

681
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:30,933
have been mysteriously disappearing.

682
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:34,966
As of now, there is no official...

683
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:44,133
Uh...

684
00:42:44,266 --> 00:42:47,166
In other news, the people of
the world are becoming...

685
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:50,700
This is bad. We should eat.

686
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,966
Why did I choose the Tower of Pisa?

687
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,766
I'm wondering the same thing, dude.

688
00:43:02,766 --> 00:43:05,700
Nonetheless, Alex is now doomed.

689
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,700
And best of all, her loved ones had
a front row seat to her conviction.

690
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:17,300
Dominic, one of those charms is broken.

691
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,233
- Mason.
- Yep.

692
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,600
This is ridiculous. I've got
to try to get out of here.

693
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,033
Hello! Hello!

694
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:44,100
I'm going to use magic to blow this
door down, so you better stand back.

695
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,966
And let me apologize in
advance for the mess I make.

696
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:50,800
I am really nice.

697
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:59,933
Double-Decker bus, that was close!

698
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:02,966
Mason, I'm so glad you're here.

699
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:05,166
Look, I just want to say
I'm so sorry for ruining

700
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,466
your picnic and being
selfish and immature...

701
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:11,166
Alex, there's no time for that now. You
must save humanity from Dominic and...

702
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:13,333
Well, you.

703
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:16,966
But I can't. I can't get out.
This dungeon is magic-proof.

704
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:22,266
Well, then, let's find out
if it's Werewolf-proof.

705
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,033
Thank you.

706
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:39,100
If you're really grateful,
you'd scratch behind my ears.

707
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,166
Oh. That's the spot. All right.

708
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:43,000
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh.

709
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:47,166
And more people are mysteriously
disappearing around the globe.

710
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:53,100
The government asks that everyone
remain calm and in there houses.

711
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:55,733
And now for the sports.

712
00:44:55,733 --> 00:45:01,333
Antonio, por favor tell all
the workers to come inside.

713
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,633
Eh!

714
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,800
Tall, skinny guy, girl in a
bikini, Italian newscaster...

715
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,266
Ryan Gosling?

716
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,566
Hey, guys. Don't mind me, I just
dropped by to give myself a beat down.

717
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:26,433
Alex?! How did you get out?

718
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:28,900
Take a guess.

719
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,866
Dominic, it's over.

720
00:45:30,866 --> 00:45:35,033
You're not gonna take over the world
because I'm here to save it, again.

721
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:38,100
You're not going to be
able to save it this time.

722
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,333
Oh, yeah?

723
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,666
- Here...
- No, I got it. I got it.

724
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:50,033
You're ruining my moment.

725
00:46:03,266 --> 00:46:05,766
Get her out of here before
she stops the replicator!

726
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,266
I'm not going anywhere.

727
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:12,066
You will to protect your family...
and your home.

728
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:14,366
Oh, no. Mason, I'll be right back.

729
00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:20,033
No worries, love. I'll just
stay here and have a snack.

730
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:25,000
What am I up to?

731
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,433
It's kind of hard chasing
me without my sneaky side.

732
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,866
Oh, I wish I could just rest here.

733
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:59,833
Ok, maybe I don't care about the kitchen,
but now you've messed with my couch.

734
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,300
- That's weird, right?
- It's really weird.

735
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,633
Hey!

736
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:27,066
You are a very ugly side of
me and it is time to go.

737
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:28,966
Sure.

738
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,866
Oh! Why didn't I see myself doing that?

739
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:42,300
Watch out for the bars.

740
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,400
Don't get cute. I'm the cute one.

741
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,900
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

742
00:48:07,066 --> 00:48:10,533
You're right. This is fun.

743
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,166
Psst. Over here.

744
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:09,933
I didn't think it'd be that
hard to kick my own butt.

745
00:49:19,866 --> 00:49:23,166
Always underestimating me.

746
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:38,833
Mason! Mason, wake up! I'm so sorry.

747
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:42,566
- What did you do?
- I put your dog down.

748
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:46,033
This is for Mason.

749
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:47,866
Guess who?

750
00:49:47,866 --> 00:49:51,300
I'm back? Darn I'm good.

751
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,966
Drop it.

752
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:59,066
And I'll take the bracelet.

753
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,300
Oh. Finish her.

754
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,800
Ok, that definitely got rid of me.

755
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,633
I think.

756
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:26,500
All right. Now time to get rid of this.

757
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,300
Alex!

758
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,933
Don't you think your time would be
better served saving your family?

759
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:36,400
Hey, I think I can see Tokyo from here.

760
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:55,966
Are you guys all right?

761
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:57,333
- Yeah, we're ok.
- Good job Mija.

762
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,533
Got a little steamy in my bead.

763
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:05,266
Clearly I can't defeat
the great Alex Russo.

764
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,633
But think of the world I am creating.

765
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,200
It needs you.

766
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:17,066
I need you.

767
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:29,233
No surprise. You all
knew I did not like him.

768
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:33,333
Mason! I was so scared I lost you.

769
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,666
Mason! I was so scared I lost you.

770
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:43,600
Ugh. Wouldn't it be nice if I was
this determined in everyday stuff?

771
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,700
Haven't we had enough of this?

772
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,033
Can we just call it a day
and get back together.

773
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:53,966
No way. Dominic went bye-bye, so that
leaves more room at the top for just me.

774
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:00,200
And thanks to this, I'm going
to take over the world.

775
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,000
You're really bad.

776
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:07,533
I have no choice.

777
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:09,733
Oh. Just as I thought.

778
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:13,266
Too good for your own good.

779
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,800
No one wins if we both lose everything.

780
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,900
What do you mean lose everything?

781
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:26,133
By all my power is to go.

782
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:28,633
- No. No, no, no. You can't!
- Alex, what are you doing?

783
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:31,666
She's casting the spell
to cancel all her powers.

784
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:35,666
A wizard's essence, spirit and soul
will be nothing but a lump of coal.

785
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,533
- Alex, stop! Don't do it!
- Honey, don't do it!

786
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:43,466
By all the power vested in me my power
be wrested out and forever free.

787
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,733
Alex Russo...

788
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:13,033
Once again, you've shown immense
bravery in saving the world.

789
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:18,366
Consequently, your guilty
verdict is hereby overturned.

790
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:19,866
Ha! All right.

791
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:23,033
However, we cannot ignore
the fact that this,

792
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,100
as in every time in the past,

793
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,933
you were involved in bringing the
world to the brink of disaster.

794
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:32,800
Oh, come on. This was a good moment.
We don't need to dig up the past.

795
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,633
How about you just give me my magic back,
and we can all go home with a warm feeling?

796
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:40,166
We have been patient, but
you have failed to show the

797
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:43,900
maturity and responsibility needed
to handle being The Family Wizard.

798
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,166
Therefore, we have decided that it is in
the best interest of the Wizard World

799
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,700
that your powers not be reinstated.

800
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:54,200
Wait. Wait, please. I've been
trying to help her grow up.

801
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,533
Just give her another chance to change.

802
00:53:59,133 --> 00:54:01,000
No.

803
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,933
I'm tired of everybody wanting
me to grow up, or to change.

804
00:54:07,933 --> 00:54:10,966
Or to not be selfish.

805
00:54:10,966 --> 00:54:15,100
No one is happy for just who I am.

806
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,233
Except for one person.

807
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:22,200
This is so embarrassing.
She's talking about me.

808
00:54:22,533 --> 00:54:24,566
Harper.

809
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:30,133
I'm sorry, dude. I thought
she was gonna say you.

810
00:54:33,866 --> 00:54:38,833
You're the only one that
accepts me with all my flaws.

811
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:42,033
And I know that I have a lot of them.

812
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,100
And even though that there have been times

813
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,600
where you wanted me to
change and I didn't...

814
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,833
You stood by me anyway.

815
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:55,933
So it's ok if you don't give me my magic.

816
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:58,600
My best friend Harper is my magic.

817
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,800
Oh, Alex.

818
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:07,900
I am so proud of you, honey.

819
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,433
Even though you don't have your powers,

820
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:14,100
you still deserve to be The Family Wizard.

821
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,000
Here.

822
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:21,833
All right. Let's go home.

823
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:24,166
Perhaps...

824
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:28,833
The appreciation you have for
others is in itself very mature.

825
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:32,933
It seems you have other qualities
that can make a great Family Wizard.

826
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:35,000
I don't like where this is going.

827
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,166
There still may be hope
for you, Alex Russo.

828
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:41,833
We grant you one more chance.

829
00:55:58,366 --> 00:56:01,133
I have my magic back.

830
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:03,366
Thank you.

831
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:07,766
I'll see you the next time I mess up.

832
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,900
Carmela, grazie for this
beautiful family reunion.

833
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,166
Please come visit us anytime.

834
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,500
Except you.

835
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:25,966
Can I come back and visit you sometime?

836
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,033
"Stupido". I'm wearing her down.

837
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,900
Alex, before you go, please give
some advice to Bianca and Gino.

838
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:42,733
- They're our wizards in training.
- Mmm. Yep.

839
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:47,066
All right. Look, guys, there's gonna
be a lot of work ahead of you.

840
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,600
And it won't really be easy.

841
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:53,833
And one day, only one of you will
get to become The Family Wizard,

842
00:56:53,866 --> 00:56:57,800
but until then, the most important
thing to remember is...

843
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:03,066
Have as much ridiculous fun

00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:12,333

846
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,833
Uh, hang on, Harper.

847
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:18,166
What happened in here?! The kitchen!
My couch!

848
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:20,300
Alex!

00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,800
