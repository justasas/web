1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,921
Hey, Mom. Okay, so you and Dad
crossed over into New Jersey, right?

2
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:18,250
Then it's official. I'm in charge.

3
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:21,565
Because what if there was a tidal wave
or something?

4
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:27,691
I know, I know, I know. But if there was,
then would I be in charge?

5
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,616
Yes.

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,417
All right. I'm in charge.

7
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:40,420
Oh, look, a tidal wave.
Now you're in charge.

8
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:45,297
Not funny, Alex.
This is my new sweater.

9
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:48,101
Justin, when you wear it every day
for a week, it's not new,

10
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:49,821
it just needs a wash.

11
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:58,392
Okay, I washed it. You're welcome.

12
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,874
Oh, well, have a good day, guys.
I'm out of here.

13
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:06,273
Alex. Where do you think you're going?

14
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:09,947
- I'm meeting Riley at the street fair.
- You're not going to the street fair.

15
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,799
And you have to listen to me
because Mom and Dad left me in charge.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,197
Justin, most 16-year-old boys have fun
when their parents leave town.

17
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,313
Being the authority figure is fun.

18
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:21,197
Now, I've prepared
a wizard-training review sheet

19
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:25,285
on some spells that I feel
Dad hasn't covered enough in class.

20
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,520
"Murrieta-animata"? I know this one.

21
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:30,957
It's the one that makes you think
you're the boss of me.

22
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:36,842
No. Murrieta-animata is a spell for
making an inanimate object come to life.

23
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,529
Thanks, that's the answer. Well,
I'm done with my review. See you later.

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,521
And then Jessica Miller
told Marianna O'Shaunnesy

25
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,997
I shouldn't be able to get out of gym
if no one else could,

26
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,556
so then Marianna said that...

27
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:44,640
- Riley.
- What?

28
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:47,796
You were staring
at Marianna O'Shaunnesy.

29
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:49,758
I wasn't staring.

30
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:54,281
Is it because she's got bigger hips
than I do? Because I think they're fake.

31
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,769
I was just looking, that's all.
Alex, why do you always get so jealous?

32
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:04,412
Just looking, huh? As in, just browsing?
As in, doing a little shopping around?

33
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:07,003
What are you in the market for, Riley?
A new girlfriend?

34
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:08,974
Hey, honey.

35
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,245
You're doing it again.

36
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:13,609
Honey. Honey.

37
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:18,931
He's giving out free honey samples.
I mean, come on, Alex, this is crazy.

38
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,333
I don't think we should go out anymore.

39
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:23,816
What?

40
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:25,821
You're breaking up with me?

41
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:28,664
But we're so good together.
I mean, we have so many good memories.

42
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:33,225
Remember, you, me and the penguins
at the zoo?

43
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:36,147
- What are you doing?
- I'm acting out our favourite memories.

44
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,105
And then that one time
when we went for a walk.

45
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:44,272
And then we went down the stairs.

46
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:46,153
Alex, I'm breaking up with you.

47
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:49,672
Okay, I'm not a very good mime.
I'll admit that.

48
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:52,632
No, it's because
you're constantly jealous.

49
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,912
I'm not constantly jealous.
I just really like you.

50
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,717
Well, you have a funny way
of showing it.

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,960
No, I don't. I'm constantly jealous.
That's how I show it.

52
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:09,238
Okay, I'm done with my wizard homework.
Can I watch TV now?

53
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,199
Sit. Let me check it.

54
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,640
Yes. You might wanna look at spell five.

55
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:22,450
I got spell five wrong?

56
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:25,087
No, spell five is the only one
you got right.

57
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:26,642
You're meaner than Dad.

58
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:28,366
Thank you.
You're dumber than I thought.

59
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:31,647
Well, then you should've thought
that I was dumber. Now who's dumb?

60
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:36,855
Okay. You need to think harder
about the murrieta-animata spell.

61
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:40,939
If you leave an animated object animated
too long, then it develops emotions.

62
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,417
You mean,
if I turned this doll into a person,

63
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,579
it'd feel bad
about being stuck in the box?

64
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,017
Don't touch that!

65
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:51,182
That's Calico Woman
in her Legion of the Superladies uniform.

66
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:53,780
They only made 1000
of these lovely ladies.

67
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:55,585
Isn't that right, Calico Woman?

68
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:58,898
So, what you're saying is,

69
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:02,990
there's 999 other guys
who couldn't get a girl to talk to them?

70
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:06,070
Don't listen to him.

71
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:16,472
- Riley broke up with you?
- Yeah.

72
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:19,238
- But I'm being really strong.
- Well, that's good.

73
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,271
- You want some churro?
- Sure.

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,598
Riley used to buy food
and let me eat some of it.

75
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,120
You guys were so good together.

76
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:30,996
Remember that time
you went to the penguins?

77
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:36,840
Oh, that did look weird.

78
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:42,558
Hey, Alex,
I heard that you and Riley broke up.

79
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,046
What do you say you and I go out?

80
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:50,852
Excuse me, Ken? Hi.
We're going out. Like, right now.

81
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:53,614
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you about that.

82
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:57,008
This will only take a second.
Wait for me.

83
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:02,169
I can't believe Riley thinks I'm jealous.

84
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,611
You know, Riley would be jealous too
if I were looking at other guys all day.

85
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,936
You know what you should do?

86
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:10,374
You should have an open and honest talk
with Riley to establish trust.

87
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:13,065
Then you'll have a firm foundation
for the future.

88
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:17,536
That sounds like something
old couples in their 20s would do.

89
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,179
Then what are you thinking?

90
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,623
I'm thinking I'll find a boyfriend
who's cuter than Riley,

91
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,390
make him jealous, and then
he'll wanna get back together with me.

92
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,301
Yeah. What am I thinking?
We're not in our 20s.

93
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,390
We don't watch the news.

94
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,628
So see any cute guys around here?

95
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:42,916
I see a lot of cute guys.

96
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:50,798
Hey, Harper, did you see that booth

97
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,279
where they sell rock families
with the eyes glued on them?

98
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:54,804
- Where?
- Around the corner...

99
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:56,996
Did they have any with two parents,
one teenage girl

100
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,879
and a smallish, shriveled-up grandma?

101
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,407
I don't...

102
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,292
<i>Murrieta-animata</i>

103
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,844
That pole hurts.

104
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,125
Well, hello, handsome.

105
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,414
Hello. Hello to you.

106
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:20,607
Hello. Hello.

107
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:22,729
I can say hello.

108
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,052
Why can I say hello?

109
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,695
I'll explain that later.

110
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,895
The important thing is,
is I'm Alex and your name is Manny.

111
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:34,494
Yeah, Manny. Last name Kinn.
Manny Kinn. Okay.

112
00:07:34,624 --> 00:07:35,944
And you're my new boyfriend.

113
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,784
Whoa, this is moving too fast.

114
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:40,944
- I just got off that pole.
- Let's go.

115
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:52,472
No.

116
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,877
You know, you look so familiar.
Where do I know you from?

117
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:17,436
You know, you look just like my uncle.
But they took him away a long time ago.

118
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:21,162
I mean, that's okay, because it was
just me in the window then for a while.

119
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,720
What did you put in there? And why?

120
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:25,282
- Why?
- I don't know.

121
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:57,181
This is my mom, my dad,
my grandma and me.

122
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,900
Your dad's a pirate?

123
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:03,904
Oh, my gosh.
One of my dad's eyes fell off.

124
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,264
Nobody move. Nobody move.

125
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:14,902
What are you doing?

126
00:09:17,354 --> 00:09:20,153
I'm cleaning Calico Woman
because I'm selling her on the Internet.

127
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:21,914
Well, her and Man Boy.

128
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,835
Even the box has to be
in mint condition.

129
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,474
Oh, by the way, did you clean your room
or just shove everything under the bed?

130
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,160
Cleaning my room
is shoving everything under my bed.

131
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:35,871
That's why beds have an underneath.

132
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:37,323
Think.

133
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,921
Hey, everybody.
This is my new boyfriend, Manny.

134
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:45,005
Hey, everybody. I can say hello.

135
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,927
Hello. I'm Justin.

136
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,928
Alex, what happened to Riley?

137
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,521
We broke up like an hour ago.
Where have you been?

138
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,008
After grieving over Riley for 15 minutes,
I met Manny and it was love at first sight.

139
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,047
- Right, Manny?
- Right.

140
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,206
<i>No.</i>

141
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:09,331
I didn't even know what it was like
to feel alive until I met Alex.

142
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:13,256
Oh, that's so sweet.
You guys make such a cute couple.

143
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,532
Alex, it's like Manny was made for you.

144
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:18,097
You have no idea.

145
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:20,260
- Manny, this is Harper.
- Nice to meet you.

146
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,534
I'm looking for an eye.

147
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,698
No.

148
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:30,543
And my brother Max.
And my older brother, Mr. Russo.

149
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,943
And those are Mr. Russo's dolls.

150
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,065
Found it.

151
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:37,183
Oh, this isn't my dad's eye.
It's a button.

152
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:39,433
Wait, buttons don't have legs.

153
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:41,272
It's a bug!

154
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,717
Alex.

155
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:50,551
Can I talk to you for a second?

156
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,516
I don't know, Manny and I are pretty busy
talking about how I don't get jealous, but...

157
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:58,638
Sure.

158
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,362
I feel horrible about our breakup.

159
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:06,961
I was stupid.

160
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:11,247
I didn't know what it felt like to feel jealous
until I saw you with that guy over there.

161
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,607
His name is Manny.

162
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,970
I prefer to call him "that guy over there."

163
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:22,204
What are you saying?
You wanna get back together?

164
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:24,087
I would.

165
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:25,365
Yes.

166
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:29,415
Well, I don't... Okay.

167
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:31,411
Really?

168
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,974
Well, what about that guy over there?

169
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,136
Oh, don't worry.
Manny's used to being stood up.

170
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:44,977
It's an inside thing.

171
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,461
Stood up.

172
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,900
You're breaking up with me?

173
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:51,143
Yes.

174
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:54,945
And you're okay with it, because
I'm gonna turn you back into a mannequin.

175
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,189
All right.

176
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,391
<i>Garibay-immobilitay</i>

177
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:04,592
Okay, one more time.

178
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:06,148
<i>Garibay-immobilitay</i>

179
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:10,990
Excuse me.

180
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:12,950
Stay.

181
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,238
Justin, a question
completely out of the blue.

182
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,274
But what's the spell to un-animate
something you've brought to life?

183
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:21,962
Garibay-immobilitay.

184
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:25,399
Well, I tried.

185
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,802
So, Manny, this is your lucky day.
You're free to live your life.

186
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:32,040
You'll do great out there,
a handsome kid like you. Okay.

187
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,727
- You enjoy.
- All right.

188
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:36,080
You know, that's too bad.
I really liked Manny.

189
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,127
And he wears the same sweater as me,
which I saw on a mannequin

190
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,767
that looked a lot like Manny Kinn.

191
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:46,206
Manny Kinn.

192
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:48,531
Manny Kinn.

193
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:49,772
Mannequin.

194
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:52,332
Yes, I animated the mannequin
from the store.

195
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,771
God.

196
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:56,929
What's the big deal?

197
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,370
You can't be using magic
without my permission.

198
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:01,220
That's complete disrespect
of my authority.

199
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,977
Hey, I tried to change him back,
but it didn't work.

200
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:07,334
What?

201
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:10,016
If you bring something to life
and it develops emotions,

202
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:12,217
you can't change it back.

203
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:13,417
Manny's in love with you.

204
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:17,665
Don't be ridiculous. He's a mannequin.
He can't be in love with me.

205
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:23,190
Alex, look, I brought you one flower
for every minute that I've loved you.

206
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,143
Oh, no.

207
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:31,032
Manny, we broke up,
don't you remember?

208
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:32,676
You have to stop following me.

209
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:35,359
I can't, Alex. I'm in love with you.

210
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,148
You get me.

211
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,239
You taught me how to drink from a straw
without poking myself in the eye.

212
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,318
Remember the time I kissed the duck?

213
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:48,122
But what if someone else got you?

214
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,641
And then you could have
even better times with them.

215
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,883
Really? Do you know that someone?

216
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:56,282
I think I do. She's a real doll.

217
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:58,925
She's a friend of my brother's.

218
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:04,492
More wizard homework?

219
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:07,248
Dad doesn't even make me
do homework on Friday.

220
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,093
Max, if you put it off until Sunday night,

221
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,252
then I won't be able
to put you kids to bed early.

222
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,375
Have a little quiet time for myself.

223
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:19,019
What are you gonna do,
light some candles and take a bath?

224
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:23,937
My quiet time is my quiet time.

225
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:30,295
Okay, so you're a teenage boy
who drinks tea

226
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,465
and likes to take baths.

227
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,385
Like I'm not gonna tell anyone about that
on the Internet.

228
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:41,149
Hey. You get down here, young man.

229
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,863
That's it.

230
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,354
Okay.

231
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:05,719
<i>Murrieta-animata grande</i>

232
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:09,960
Oh, those twist-ties really hurt.

233
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,680
Manny, meet Calico Woman.

234
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:16,116
Calico Woman, meet Manny.

235
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,286
You two have a lot in common.

236
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,878
I don't have anything in common
with a superhero.

237
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,328
You're so wrong, Manny.
Who likes to say hello?

238
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,045
Hello.

239
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:30,405
Hello.

240
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,291
Who here is dishwasher-safe?

241
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:38,210
That's the only thing about me
that's safe.

242
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,300
See? You two are gonna be
so happy together.

243
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,342
I'm still in love with her.

244
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:56,140
When you say that,
that makes me really mad.

245
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,581
Yeah, that's called jealousy.

246
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,704
I don't like that feeling.

247
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,462
There. See? All done.
He's perfectly happy with her.

248
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,311
Now nothing could go wrong.

249
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,187
Oh, I hope I didn't jinx that.

250
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:14,906
And right after dinner, you have to take
a shower and then get in your pyjamas.

251
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:17,631
Can I take a shower in my pyjamas?

252
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,789
Then you would be wet,
your pyjamas would be wet

253
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,830
and your entire bed would be wet.

254
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,840
But if everything's wet,
is anything really wet?

255
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:32,155
Like when you're totally underwater,
you're not really wet.

256
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,881
Yes, you are.

257
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,718
Calico Woman's gone. Where...?

258
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:45,480
Well... it says right here,
"No chains can hold her."

259
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:50,048
Chains are a lot stronger
than a cardboard box.

260
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,322
Alex.

261
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,285
See?

262
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:55,883
Max! What are...?

263
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:00,768
Alex, don't leave me.
Look, look, I won you a stuffed gorilla.

264
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,817
All right, enough.
This has gotta stop, Manny. It's over.

265
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:06,575
- But I'm in love with her.
- Seriously, it's over.

266
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:09,899
Otherwise, that pretty face
ain't gonna be so pretty no more.

267
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:13,141
Oh, no, you're not gonna change my head
into that featureless knob.

268
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,739
All right, that's it.

269
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:17,618
Wait. Wha...?

270
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,897
Riley, wait.

271
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,460
Manny!

272
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:25,548
Manny, I love you.

273
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,544
Okay, let's split up and find Alex.

274
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,870
Because where Alex is,
that's where my Calico Woman doll is.

275
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,268
Well, there's Manny.

276
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,149
Oh, and there's Riley.

277
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:40,907
Oh, found Alex.

278
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,917
Manny!

279
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:44,392
And Calico Woman.

280
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,911
Man, she is huge.

281
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,514
And alive.

282
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,170
Manny. Manny.

283
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,287
We were both made in China.

284
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:54,502
We need a volunteer.

285
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,512
Who wants to sit in this dunk tank?

286
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,547
- I'll go in.
- Excellent. Excellent.

287
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:03,713
Just climb right up there.

288
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:06,831
Okay, who would like the first shot

289
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:11,392
at sending this handsome fella
into this dunk tank?

290
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:14,474
I would.

291
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:16,116
Riley.

292
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:17,359
What are you doing?

293
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:21,479
I'm gonna teach Manny that no one
comes between me and my girl.

294
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:25,396
I know you don't like jealousy on me,
but on you, it is so hot.

295
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,608
No!

296
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:33,960
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

297
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,164
Wait up.

298
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:41,769
- Alex.
- Oh, no, what happened to Manny?

299
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,607
Well, it looks like he got wet.

300
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:47,970
You know, sometimes
water can make a spell wear off.

301
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:50,654
How do you know that?

302
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,614
Because the spell just wore off.

303
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:55,902
Manny?

304
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:59,460
What have they done to you?!

305
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,702
What's going on here?

306
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:06,379
Alex, that guy over there
just turned into giant doll pieces.

307
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:10,297
That's it. I'm calling Waverly Place
Street Fair security.

308
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,982
No, no, no. No need to do that, okay?

309
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:17,866
I have to tell you something.
I have to tell everybody something.

310
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:21,705
Ladies and gentlemen, the man
you just saw in the dunk tank is really a...

311
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,106
- Alex.
- Magician.

312
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:27,475
The Great Manic-keeny.

313
00:20:27,598 --> 00:20:31,354
And for his big trick,
he has disappeared in the dunk tank,

314
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,835
leaving behind
a disassembled mannequin in his place.

315
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:38,874
Ta-da.

316
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:44,275
Oh, yeah.

317
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:48,927
And how about a hand
for his lovely assistant?

318
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:51,728
Yeah.

319
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,044
All right.

320
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,327
Watch the outfit,
you're going back in the box.

321
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,521
I never liked you.

322
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:00,051
Hey. Hey. Hey, you get back here.

323
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:09,137
I thought Manny was just a mannequin
who got turned into a person

324
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:11,170
and then back into a mannequin.

325
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:13,689
But he was really just a magician.

326
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,655
Great show. Great show. Great show.

327
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:27,065
Look, Alex, see what happens
when you break the rules?

328
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,267
Things end up working out for me?

329
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:32,467
No.

330
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:35,464
You almost exposed us as wizards
and I lost Calico Woman.

331
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:36,950
She was worth 100 bucks.

332
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:40,469
I got my boyfriend back,
and I'll give you 100 bucks. Who got hurt?

333
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:43,468
I did because you didn't respect me
being in charge.

334
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:47,752
Why is that so important to you?

335
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:51,029
What about living? Having fun?

336
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:53,115
Doing stuff to tell stories about?

337
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:56,119
Like this.
This is gonna be a great story to tell.

338
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,399
The only people you could tell the story to
would ground you.

339
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:02,796
If you'd calm down every once in a while,
I would tell you stories.

340
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:07,763
Like, I bet you've always wondered what
happened to your lightsaber and cape.

341
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:13,362
Alex, how am I supposed to be calm
when you tell me stuff like that?
