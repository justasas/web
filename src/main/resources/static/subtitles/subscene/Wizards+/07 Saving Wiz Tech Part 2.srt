00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:11,574
Welcome to the grand
re-opening of wiztech.

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:20,213
We owe a big debt of gratitude to
justin russo for saving wiztech

3
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:24,551
By removing the plastic balls
from our hallowed halls.

4
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:27,689
And we know how dangerous
plastic is to wizards.

5
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:31,194
we hate plastic! We hate plastic!

6
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:35,199
Thank you, thank you. We're wizards.
We all hate plastic, right?

7
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:41,708
Saving wiztech wouldn't have been possible
without the generous financial support

8
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:44,878
Of the wizworld industries,
so let's...

9
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,851
I, uh, hope that's ok
with you, professor.

10
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,388
Of course. A few advertisements
is a small price to pay

11
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:57,725
For the reopening of
our beloved school.

12
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,828
As long as the sign
isn't made of plastic.

13
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:02,463
Ahh.

14
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:05,600
Now, I would like to invite
wiztech student, hugh normous,

15
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,502
To cut the ceremonial ribbon.

16
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:18,915
Oh, no thanks. My giant hands
will never fit in those scissors.

17
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:21,084
I'll have to use my own.

18
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:31,961
- Gee...
- Oh, are you kidding me?

19
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:44,174
Whoa. Finally.

20
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,376
Tv how I want it.

21
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,244
All commercials.

22
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:53,015
Thanks for coming
back with me, alex.

23
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:56,752
And I promise I'll make you forget about
that boyfriend who broke your heart.

24
00:01:58,188 --> 00:01:59,421
Yeah.

25
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:00,622
Dean.

26
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:02,524
Almost forgot about him.

27
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:05,360
Thanks for hitting the
reset button on that.

28
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:06,928
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,698
No, this is a new start for you.

30
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:12,100
You have no idea
what's possible here.

31
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:14,336
And you're a very special girl.

32
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:19,140
very, very special.

33
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:24,846
More special than
you will ever know!

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,750
Um, I'm sorry. I can't hear you
with all this evil thunder.

35
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,285
- Oh. I said you're special.
- Oh, thank you.

36
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:36,390
ominous thunder and
lightning brought to you by

37
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:38,225
The wizworld weather channel.

38
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:41,295
Now, that could get annoying.

39
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:44,799
You think this would look
good with my board shorts?

40
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,834
- I'm gonna get it anyway.
- Ok. You do that.

41
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,738
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

42
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,806
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

43
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,742
* you can fix any problem
at the slightest ease *

44
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,476
* yes, please *

45
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,378
* well, you might find out
it'll go to your head *

46
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,814
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

47
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,349
* with a snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

48
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:06,084
* that's what I said *

49
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:09,054
* everything is not what it seems *

50
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,825
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

51
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,662
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

52
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,899
* because everything
is not what it seems *

53
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:24,369
* everything is not what it seems *

54
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:28,272
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

55
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:32,010
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

56
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,979
* because everything is not *

57
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,948
* what it seems *

58
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:44,649

59
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,823
Junior, I cursed the castle

60
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:48,991
So I could turn the whole
place into a ball room

61
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:50,993
For the best birthday ever.

62
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:52,527
Now it's ruined.

63
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:56,164
Dad, I have a better evil plan.

64
00:03:56,198 --> 00:04:00,767
To restore our
family's evil powers.

65
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:03,569
Oh, now, that is a
fantastic birthday gift.

66
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:07,005
But you know, I'd rather have
some of those shoe skates.

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,908
Size ten.

68
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,211
Dad, focus.

69
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:14,647
- All right.
- All we need to do

70
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:18,283
Is get alex russo up to
the tower of evil with me.

71
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:21,619
And then we can turn this place
into an evil wizard school.

72
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,287
- Dad?
- Hmm?

73
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:27,255
That is a great evil plan.
I am proud of you.

74
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:31,359
yeah, well, actually,
I didn't think of that.

75
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:33,727
Justin russo gave me the idea.

76
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,729
Oh, well, take credit
for it, anyway.

77
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:37,263
And that's evil.

78
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:39,598
Now, in the meantime,

79
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:42,401
Make sure no one sees this.

80
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:51,009
Jiggly fruit dessert!

81
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:53,444
My party's back on.

82
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:54,545
No!

83
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,514
No, this is alex's boyfriend.

84
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,516
I hid him in here
in the supply closet

85
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,951
So we can get alex up
to the tower of evil.

86
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,654
That sounds delicious.

87
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:08,456
Dad, I know what you're thinking.

88
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,525
Don't eat it!

89
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:14,861
Stop it!

90
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:18,331
Oh. And, um, also,

91
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:22,067
I need you to get rid of this silly
wooden card alex's boyfriend made for her.

92
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,837
Oh, isn't that sweet?

93
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:26,839
- Dad, you're evil.
- Right.

94
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,811
Oh, hey. Cool booth. Who's this?

95
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:35,945
- My father.
- The evil one?

96
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,280
Yes, I am.

97
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,148
But defeated.

98
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:41,617
- By your brother?
- Oh, right.

99
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,319
I'm horribly defeat...
I'm terribly defeat...

100
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:47,255
I'm a mess. Just
selling t-shirts here.

101
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,324
Not hiding anything back there
in jiggly, fruity dessert.

102
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,626
You are not good at hiding things!

103
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,998
And by hiding things,

104
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:03,169
I mean hiding......What amazing
deals these t-shirts are.

105
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:07,138
- These are pretty good deals.
- Yeah.

106
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:09,974
- Do you have this in blue?
- I'll look in the supply closet.

107
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:11,742
Oh, no, no, no, no.

108
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:15,345
Let's just, uh...

109
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,982
Oh, look. It's a blue.

110
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:23,785
Thank you.

111
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,622
You better get to class. - When I was
with dean we never went to class.

112
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:30,191
Well, I'll try and be a
better influence on you.

113
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:33,094
Oh. A lot of people have tried.
Good luck with that.

114
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:36,596
Well, uh, hey,
how about after class

115
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,565
We have a picnic in this great place I know,
on top of the tower of evil.

116
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,433
Oh. I was told to never go
to places that are evil.

117
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:46,470
Oh, it was just named after...

118
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,439
...William. Evil.

119
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,008
The architect.

120
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,243
He's famous for a lot of buildings.

121
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:56,212
- Oh, yeah, I've heard of him.
- You have?

122
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:58,514
No, I was just trying
to impress you.

123
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:14,727
Hey, hugh.

124
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,061
That's funny.

125
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:18,697
It sounded like I said, "hey, you."

126
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,903
Anyway.

127
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:28,805
What are you doing there,
pulling a cereal box on a wagon?

128
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,307
No, it's not cereal.

129
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,643
- It's a massive billboard.
- Oh.

130
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:37,078
Wizworld industries picked
me to haul it around.

131
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,747
You know, 'cause I'm a giant.

132
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:44,684
Well, if I order the cool binoculars
on the back, maybi could see it.

133
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,720
You think all these advertisements
around here are a bit too much?

134
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:51,823
Well, if by "a bit too much"
you mean "a bit too terrific,"

135
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:53,924
Then yes! Check this out.

136
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,162
"why buy wizworld? Why not?"

137
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:02,731
I, uh... I wouldn't wear
that in class if I were you.

138
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:04,366
Oh, I'm wearing it for class.

139
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,335
Sign wearing 101.

140
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,603
- That's a class?
- Uh-huh.

141
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:12,573
What about learning wizardry
and spells and potions?

142
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,475
All the things that I
love about wiztech.

143
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,844
whoo!

144
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,382
Wizworld industries!

145
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,920
They've got products, yes, they do.

146
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:28,423
They've got products
to sell to you. Whoo!

147
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,991
Wizworld!

148
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:35,429
I could learn to love that.

149
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:41,566
No! All this advertising
is corrupting my school!

150
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,967
Whoo!

151
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:50,806
Oh. Sorry.

152
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,945
I'm working on this for my advertising
class, called "blimp-ertising."

153
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,412
That's it!

154
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,748
Wizworld said they'd put
up a couple of signs.

155
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:04,516
Those tiny little
executives lied to me.

156
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,586
I need to speak to
professor crumbs.

157
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:13,490
Here we are.

158
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:15,492
The entrance to the tower of evil.

159
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,428
Shall we? - I thought you
said we were gonna picnic.

160
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:22,030
- Where's your basket?
- Um...

161
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:23,731
A bear took it.

162
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:28,635
Look, if you're trying to make
me scared of some pretend bear

163
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,403
So you can put your arms around m

164
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,904
I'll play along. Watch.

165
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,539
Oh, no. A bear! Protect me.

166
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,410
Real cute. Well, come on.

167
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,512
There is a wicked view up there.

168
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:44,882
Although it's nothing
compared to this view.

169
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,019
Why are you looking at me?

170
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,821
Oh, I get it. I'm the view. Duh.

171
00:09:56,526 --> 00:10:00,861
Oh, professor crumbs, look,
I know I brought wizworld industries in,

172
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:04,398
But nobody's learning anything
except how to buy wizworld products.

173
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:08,468
Well, wizworld products are
high-quality and affordable.

174
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:12,906
Hi. This professor has been brought
to you by wizworld industries.

175
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:18,477
What was that? - Wizworld
industries is sponsoring me.

176
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:22,314
Kind of like a walk-a-thon,
except I get to keep the money.

177
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,682
This has gone too far.

178
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,050
Hey, justin!

179
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:31,588
I heard that alex went
to the tower of evil.

180
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,557
Where did you hear that?

181
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:36,559
That's what everybody's
talking about.

182
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:39,763
Well, that, and my
awesome sign flipping.

183
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,103
Not to worry.

184
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:47,637
Alex is perfectly safe

185
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,605
As long as she doesn't go up
there with ronald longcape.

186
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,206
That's exactly who she
went up there with.

187
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:57,443
- Oh, no.
- What do you mean, "oh, no?"

188
00:10:57,477 --> 00:11:01,946
I mean, if alex goes up to the tower of
evil and plays the tetherball of evil,

189
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,415
- She'll become evil.
- Oh, I love tetherball.

190
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,818
It's the only ball that
you can never lose.

191
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:11,587
If ronald and she become evil,
then they have the evil strength...

192
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,389
To take over wiztech
and make it evil.

193
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,123
I knew that guy was evil.

194
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,859
But then he talked me into
believing that he wasn't evil.

195
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:21,029
Which is totally evil of him.

196
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,898
Come on. We've got to go stop them.

197
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,733
I'll stay here.

198
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:32,205
Ooh, lovely.

199
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:36,142
This is the strangest
greeting card I've ever seen.

200
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:38,377
I like this one, yes.

201
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,479
I don't think anybody's
gonna mind that.

202
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,152
Oh, wow.

203
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:50,053
It's so romantic up here.

204
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:52,822
We should look at the stars.
It's kind of our thing.

205
00:11:52,857 --> 00:11:57,460
Yeah. And you know what else is
our thing? Playing tetherball.

206
00:11:57,494 --> 00:11:59,561
Playing tetherball? No, it isn't.

207
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:01,463
Well, can it be?

208
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:07,234
Uh, no. I think looking at the stars
is more romantic than tetherball.

209
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,370
Well, then,
how about we stand here.

210
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:15,106
Next to this pole and
look up at the stars

211
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,841
And maybe just bat the
ball around a little.

212
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,944
I gotta tell you, ronald,
I'm not all that into playground games.

213
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,679
I'm really into
just being with you.

214
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:29,149
Come on, alex. Just one game.

215
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,385
I don't even know how to play.

216
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,820
You just keep hitting it
back and forth for a while.

217
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,722
Sounds complicated. No.

218
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,458
- Hit it.
- No.

219
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:39,759
- Hit it.
- No!

220
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,160
- Hit it!
- No!

221
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:45,264
- Hey, I'm doing it.
- Good. Keep going.

222
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,836
It's glowing. It's working!

223
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:53,239
- Why is it glowing?
- This is good. This is good!

224
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,440
Why is this good?

225
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,310
- 'cause it's our thing.
- It's not our thing.

226
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,480
alex, no!

227
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:10,046
Whoo! That was a lot of stairs!

228
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:15,618
I should really run instead of
hiding under the bleachers during pe.

229
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:19,188
why didn't you guys
just take the elevator?

230
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:21,056
There's an elevator?

231
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,459
There needs to be better
signage in this tower of evil.

232
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:28,362
What are you guys even doing here?

233
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:31,865
Alex, you gotta stop playing
tetherball or you're gonna turn evil.

234
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,099
You're too late, justin.

235
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:37,102
In less than a minute,
alex and I will have turned evil,

236
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:40,972
To destroy wiztech and begin
our evil lives together.

237
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:42,607
- What?
- Oh, I heard him.

238
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,442
He said that you and
he are gonna start

239
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:46,711
Your evil lives together.
Congratulations.

240
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:49,713
It's too late to stop
the evil, justin.

241
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,046
Your sister has served her purpose.

242
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,682
Wait. Is that why you
brought me up here?

243
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:57,950
For evil? You used me to
complete your evil plan?

244
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,686
Well, it could have been any russo.

245
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,887
Come on, justin,
let's go spit over the edge.

246
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:06,855
I guess it had to be you.

247
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,124
Max, we're trying to stop evil.

248
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,660
You fight evil your way,
I'll fight it mine.

249
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:17,036
You lied to me, ronald. You told me
that I was special and I fell for it.

250
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,873
- I can't believe I broke up with dean.
- He broke up with you.

251
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:24,342
Look, the story we're telling everybody
is that I broke up with him, ok?

252
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,811
Maybe you won't turn evil.
Maybe it's not too late.

253
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,880
wizworld industries
is proud to announce

254
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:35,051
That evil will commence in three,
two, one...

255
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:37,086
Evil.

256
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,591
Yeah, it's too late.

257
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:46,828
I don't look like him, do I?

258
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:57,937
Professor, we're too late. - I would have
been here sooner, but somebody spit on me.

259
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:00,373
I had to change my robes.

260
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:03,609
Bull's eye! - yeah, well,
you didn't make it.

261
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:06,844
My evil powers have been restored.

262
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,483
I am taking over wiztech
and making it evil!

263
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,386
and professor crumbs,

264
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,288
Um, I'm firing you.

265
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:19,992
And just to prove that I am evil,

266
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:23,129
I'll take that beard.

267
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,510
Thank you.

268
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,013
Before I go, I'd like
to give alex something

269
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:48,882
That I believe belongs to her.

270
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,420
I can't get used to looking
at him without the beard!

271
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,591
It's from dean.

272
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,859
That's impossible!

273
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,527
"dear russo,

274
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,429
I was thinking, maybe I
should start calling you alex,

275
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:06,996
So here it goes.

276
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:09,532
Dear alex, I like you.

277
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:10,833
Signed, moriarti.

278
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,901
I mean, dean."

279
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:15,869
Aw, dean.

280
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:18,039
And there's not a grade on it.

281
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:20,440
It wasn't an assignment.

282
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:24,143
- Then why'd he break up with me?
- He didn't. I did.

283
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,246
And you fell for it.

284
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:31,016
I'm stopping seeing you.
See you in school.

285
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,784
It was you?

286
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:35,953
Absolutely.

287
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:40,056
And now, evil is mine.

288
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,430
Oh, my gosh, evil has taken over.
We've got to warn the others.

289
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,434
There's an elevator.

290
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,808
These things are slow.

291
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:01,644
Wait a minute.

292
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,647
There is a way evil can be undone.

293
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:07,683
If one of the tetherball
players is in love,

294
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:09,618
Then evil is cancelled.

295
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,419
- Ronald?
- Hm?

296
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:13,221
Are you in love with anyone?

297
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,057
Yes.

298
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:21,161
Is that someone yourself?

299
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:23,196
Yes.

300
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,400
Doesn't count.

301
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:31,503
Alex russo, are you
in love with someone?

302
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:32,804
Oh, my goodness.

303
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:35,039
I guess I am.

304
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,874
I'm in love with dean.

305
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:39,809
I believe you are.

306
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,217
What's happening to me?

307
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:52,520
The natural power of love!

308
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,892
Ew. I found him attractive?

309
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:04,396
Well, you can love dean,

310
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,566
- But he can't love you back!
- What are you saying, ronald?

311
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:12,169
That I have trapped your precious
dean in a jiggly fruit dessert.

312
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:16,072
And I have hidden him somewhere
you will never find him.

313
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:18,608
finally.

314
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,012
Oh, hi, son.

315
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:26,782
Having all this jiggly fruit dessert
around is just too tempting.

316
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:29,785
I thought I'd better hide
your encased boy up here.

317
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,886
Dean!

318
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,654
Oooh, no.

319
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:35,623
Dad, this is why

320
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:38,826
We've failed at being an
evil family all these years.

321
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,530
Evil is one thing but mean is
a hurt that never goes away.

322
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,766
All right!

323
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:50,636
No one try and follow
us or loverboy gets it.

324
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,306
No, wait, dean!

325
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,241
Justin, we have to take the stairs.

326
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,543
Couldn't we just wait for
the elevator to come back?

327
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:59,345
Justin, even I know
that's a bad idea.

328
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:02,848
Fine. Grab my hands.

329
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,250
We're wizards.

330
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:06,452
We'll take our own way down.

331
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:16,126
Pillows for feet spell.
Nice one, justin.

332
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,128
I know. Pillows for feet.
Never thought I'd use it.

333
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:25,167
Oh, man, I got hit
with my own spit.

334
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:28,036
not your spit. Bull's eye!

335
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:35,008
- There they are. Let's catch them.
- You'll never catch me.

336
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,446
I think we're gonna catch him.

337
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,081
Never!

338
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,785
We just caught you, dude.

339
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,387
Curses.

340
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,222
I almost got away.

341
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,623
Oh, great.

342
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:55,825
I was with a guy that
said "curses." not hot.

343
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,761
I'll take my beard back.

344
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,777
Higgly wiggly,
get out of that jiggly

345
00:20:19,046 --> 00:20:21,714
Hey, russo. I came by
to give you something.

346
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:24,450
Oh, no. I lost it.

347
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,451
- I'll go make you another one.
- No.

348
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,754
I think you dropped it.

349
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,890
Read it to me.

350
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,161
"dear russo,

351
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,729
I was thinking maybe I should
start calling you alex.

352
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:43,432
So here it goes. Dear alex,

353
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:45,500
I like you.

354
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,368
Signed, moriarti.

355
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:48,870
I mean, dean."

356
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:53,374
- Aw. I love it.
- You do?

357
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:55,242
Yes.

358
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:57,010
And I love...

359
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,881
...This card.

360
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:05,052
- You just said that.
- Well, that's how much I love it.

361
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,620
I love it so much.

362
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:10,123
more than you will ever know.

363
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,194
Why did you say it like that?

364
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:17,230
I don't know. I thought I'd give
it a shot but it's not really me.

365
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:26,538
All right. First one
down the staircase wins.

366
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,540
I'll even give you a
ten second head start.

367
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:30,208
You're on.

368
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:32,344
- Go!
- Go. One, two...

369
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:34,446
...Three...

370
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:41,787
I knew you were gonna do that
and I'm still gonna beat you.

371
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:43,455
No! No, no...

372
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,157
wait, wait!

373
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,461
No!

374
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:57,462
