1
00:00:07,062 --> 00:00:09,179
Okay. Last question.

2
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:13,777
"Bat wings, dragon scales and fruit punch
make what kind of potion?

3
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:19,302
A, invisibility. B, skin of steel.
C, a refreshing fruit smoothie."

4
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:20,829
Got it.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,908
Does he have to say "got it"
after every question?

6
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:24,904
It's throwing me off on my exam.

7
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,426
We're taking an exam?

8
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:33,711
Time. Pencils down.
Last exam section.

9
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:35,352
Grab your wands and line up.

10
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,630
You have to use
the transfiguration spell

11
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:41,119
to change one of these guinea pigs
into a white dove.

12
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:44,042
Okay, Justin, you're up.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,724
<i>This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill its slot</i>

14
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:52,282
Very good, Justin.

15
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,723
- Alex, you're up.
- Oh, okay.

16
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:01,213
<i>This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill its slot</i>

17
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:08,696
It's a pretty dove.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,817
No. It's a pretty brick.

19
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:17,260
You weren't concentrating.
Max, you're up.

20
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,379
<i>This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill with snot</i>

21
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:29,866
I said "snot," didn't I?

22
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:33,866
Okay, everybody record
your transfiguration results

23
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:36,954
in your midterm-exam text booklets.

24
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:40,914
I don't know why you guys
even bother taking the tests.

25
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,634
We all know I'm the one that's gonna win
the family wizard contest

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,280
and keep my powers.

27
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:47,199
That's not for a long while, Justin.

28
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:50,361
And what if they change the rules
so only girls keep their powers?

29
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:53,125
Oh, wait, you still might win.

30
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,879
Oh, Alex, you're so transparent. You know
that I'm better than you at magic,

31
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:58,806
so you have to lash out
and make fun of me.

32
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,967
And you don't take
any of this magic seriously.

33
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:04,244
I can't take you seriously.
You use big words like "transparent."

34
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,012
What are you, British?

35
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:10,493
No, but I am.

36
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:14,498
Professor Crumbs,
always nice to see you.

37
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:16,690
The beard is coming in nicely.

38
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,055
Jerry.

39
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,373
I knew your father when this

40
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:25,293
was just a soul patch
for the lovely witches.

41
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:33,181
I am here to collect your exams
and take them back to Wiz Tech.

42
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,509
Why doesn't Dad
just grade our papers?

43
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:38,351
So that no one will get better grades

44
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:41,547
just by batting their eyes
and trying to look cute.

45
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:44,832
Are you talking about me?

46
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,229
Alex, you're doing it right now.

47
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:45,628
Wizard report cards are here.

48
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:49,913
Oh, you sound excited.
You must feel confident you did well.

49
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:54,199
Wizard report cards are here.

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,196
You first.

51
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:04,716
Max Russo, your exam results

52
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,805
plus your coursework
equals a solid C-plus.

53
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:11,440
You are totally average. Cool.

54
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:17,692
Sweet, I got a C. Yes.

55
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:25,374
Alex Russo, your exam results
plus the homework you handed in

56
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,889
on greasy napkins
that smelled like shrimp

57
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,899
all equals... F.

58
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,060
And the... is a low F.

59
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:36,144
Excuse me.

60
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:38,302
I turned a guinea pig
into a very solid brick,

61
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:42,347
which I think is a much more effective
symbol for peace.

62
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:44,227
Please have your parents sign me,

63
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:47,388
so I can return to Wizard Tech
and receive my payment.

64
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,025
I have to make a living.

65
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:53,949
- Yeah, right, like that's gonna happen.
- No, no, no.

66
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:56,193
I got children to laminate.

67
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:59,068
What are you gonna do?
Mom and Dad need to sign that.

68
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,828
Well, they can't sign something
that never got here.

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,440
- But it got here.
- No, it didn't.

70
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,154
- Yes, it did. No, it didn't.
- It did.

71
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:06,682
- What?
- I don't know.

72
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:08,123
Perfect.

73
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,361
Oh, the report cards are here.

74
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,240
I gotta make a copy for my new frame.

75
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:24,364
Justin Russo,
your exam results plus your coursework

76
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:28,853
equals all A's
and one B-plus in rhyming charms.

77
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:30,889
You're the smart one.

78
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,292
B-plus? I can't put this in the frame.

79
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:36,850
What a shame.

80
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:40,498
See, I got game. This grade is lame.

81
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:42,934
Oh, I got a good rhyme. Corn.

82
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:44,465
And?

83
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,183
I panicked.

84
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:59,749
Oh, I love it in there.
It smells like popcorn.

85
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,707
Why don't you hush?
I thought I threw you away.

86
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:06,911
You can't throw me away.
I need a parent to sign me.

87
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,081
And preferably with a nice soft-tip pen.

88
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:14,239
See you later, honey.
I'll be back in an hour.

89
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,361
Going for a jog.

90
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,001
Are you doing the dishes?

91
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,127
Yeah, sure.

92
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:30,848
I know what you're doing.
You're afraid of what's gonna happen

93
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:33,735
when your report card gets here,
so you're trying to be extra good.

94
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:36,406
Yep. You always know
what I'm up to, Dad.

95
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,134
I'm back.

96
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:48,541
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's see if you keep talking

97
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,736
when you're full of hot sauce.

98
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,425
That is hot.

99
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,942
You know what? I feel bad for you.

100
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,190
I'm going to tell you
how to get rid of a bad report card.

101
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:03,827
Really? How?

102
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:06,150
Get good grades.

103
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:10,718
Now you pay twice. Four times.

104
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:13,399
Sixteen. Thirty-two.

105
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,512
Sixty-four.

106
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:17,441
Alex, what are you doing?

107
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,717
Mom.
That was just confetti for the parade.

108
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:25,044
There's no parade.

109
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:27,928
Not yet, but there will be.

110
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,006
And how proud are we gonna be

111
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,042
when we're the first ones
to throw the confetti?

112
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:34,640
My guess, pretty proud.

113
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:38,245
You know what?
I've got a magazine and an iced tea.

114
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,094
I'm good with whatever you're up to.

115
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,218
<i>Is that the new issue
of Urban Terrace Gardening?</i>

116
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:52,413
- I've been waiting for that.
- Alex.

117
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,624
I got to the corner,
and I realised I forgot to stretch.

118
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:00,181
And it's hot.

119
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,183
I think I'll start jogging in the fall.

120
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,113
Alex Russo,
your exam results plus the homework...

121
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,953
- What'd you say, Alex?
- Nothing.

122
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:15,306
Alex, it's not very ladylike
to talk with your mouth full.

123
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,112
Hey, what's that?

124
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:26,079
<i>- These parents are now not
- What are you doing?</i>

125
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:28,799
<i>Two guinea pigs should fill their slot</i>

126
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:35,685
What did I just do? I panicked.
I had to buy myself more time.

127
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,245
- To do what?
- To panic.

128
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,450
I still don't know
why you'd spend your entire savings

129
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:46,527
on a giant blow-up exercise ball.

130
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,454
It's for exercise?

131
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,935
Man, I was gonna blow this up,
then walk across the ocean in it.

132
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,332
That is exercise, Maxy.

133
00:08:58,143 --> 00:08:59,623
Man.

134
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,697
Cool. Guinea pigs. Can I race them?

135
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:08,299
No. I'm still working
on Dad's transfiguration spell,

136
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:10,991
and these guinea pigs
have to stay in their cage no matter what.

137
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:13,228
Fine. I'll just go ask Mom and Dad.

138
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,547
Mom and Dad aren't here,

139
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:17,946
because they went to an emergency
sandwich-shop convention.

140
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,505
Emergency sandwich-shop convention?

141
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:25,916
Yeah. You know how you were all tweaked
because sandwich wraps are tortillas,

142
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,359
and they don't get enough credit?

143
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:30,082
Well,
people are finally getting behind that.

144
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,114
Yes. My e-mail campaign worked.

145
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:36,322
Now, wait. Now get out of here, you guys.
I'm having my AP biology friends over

146
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:39,804
<i>to watch the new episode
of Volcano Discovery in high-def.</i>

147
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:41,885
And I don't want you guys
to embarrass me.

148
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,241
We are not the embarrassing part
of what you just said.

149
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:55,174
That was the best volcano special ever.

150
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:58,811
The high-def made it seem like
the volcano was right in your living room.

151
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:02,571
Oh, which, geologically speaking,
would be a statistical improbability

152
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,492
along the lines of there being
a snowstorm in the Sahara Desert.

153
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:10,456
You got me. Good nerd burn.

154
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:18,421
Well, I'm off to the park
to bury something.

155
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,190
Oh, a time capsule?

156
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:21,946
Yeah, sure, that.

157
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:24,425
I love doing that.
You should put a cell phone in it,

158
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:28,385
call it and leave a voicemail, so that way
someone in the future can pick it up.

159
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:31,592
No, actually, people take my calls now.

160
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:38,514
Harper, what are you doing here?

161
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:40,638
I heard about Justin's big party,

162
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,996
and I've been working up the nerve
to crash it.

163
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:46,366
Well, I've been working up the nerve
to leave. Oh, look, I did it.

164
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:56,169
Hey, everyone. So volcanoes, huh?
That's a hot topic. Am I right?

165
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,212
Volcanoes, they're hot.

166
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,570
We're off volcanoes.

167
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,493
Now we're debating who's smarter,

168
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,653
a 12-year-old boy
or a common guinea pig.

169
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:12,455
I'm on Justin's side.
Which side are you on, Justin?

170
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:16,542
As always, I'm on the side of science.

171
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,627
This calls for an experiment.

172
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:31,312
This was so totally worth my allowance.
I'm gonna use it forever.

173
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:34,112
Okay, when Harper says go,

174
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,833
you'll both try and make your way
to the stack of cheese slices

175
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,520
located outside the subway car.

176
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,676
Three.

177
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,079
Two. One.

178
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:46,998
Go.

179
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,401
I hate this thing.

180
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:09,251
Alex's guinea pigs are getting away.
Catch them.

181
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,333
Oh, man. We lost Alex's guinea pigs.

182
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:16,699
I knew if I had party
without parental supervision,

183
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,735
this would get out of hand.

184
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:21,705
Oh, Alex is gonna freak out.

185
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:24,496
Unless we buy two more guinea pigs
at the pet store.

186
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:28,384
Good thinking, good thinking. Let's
hide this in the lair so Alex doesn't find it.

187
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,900
Then we'll go to the pet store.
They always give me a treat.

188
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,110
Those are dog biscuits.

189
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:36,706
I know. What do you think keeps my teeth
so white and my hair so shiny?

190
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,277
Look, you change into a C now,
and I promise I'll get an A next semester.

191
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,802
And it'll all even out.

192
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:52,916
Sorry.

193
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,123
Then you leave me no choice.

194
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:04,006
Alex Russo.

195
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,053
You haven't returned
your wizard report card.

196
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:11,005
Wow, talk about a paper cut.

197
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:18,336
I need to speak to your parents
straightaway.

198
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,496
I hope that's British
for much, much later.

199
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:25,738
No? Okay, could you just
give me one minute? Yeah.

200
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:38,548
Actually, my parents took my report card
with them to a sandwich-shop convention.

201
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:42,554
I'm sure you're familiar with the tortilla
versus sandwich-wrap controversy.

202
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:45,750
<i>No? Okay.</i>

203
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:54,640
I agree.

204
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:57,038
Tortillas were cheated.

205
00:13:57,163 --> 00:14:00,841
I can see why your parents dove
into this most pressing crisis.

206
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:06,044
I'm sorry I questioned you.
Will you accept my apology?

207
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,760
Definitely. Thanks for stopping by.
Don't be a stranger.

208
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,928
Say hi to the little warlocks for me.

209
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,647
Let's wizard handshake on it.

210
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,969
The two-handed wizard handshake?

211
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:18,893
That's the one.

212
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,018
The only thing she gets an A in
is hiding and lying.

213
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,856
Be still.

214
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:34,340
You lied to me.

215
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:36,016
I can explain.

216
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:38,218
I'm not interested
in what you have to say anymore.

217
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,346
I'm coming back tonight
to see your parents,

218
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,747
and we'll decide how long
to suspend your powers.

219
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:47,024
My powers? No, you can't.
I'm gonna need those.

220
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:50,785
I'm also gonna need to know
a sound that someone could make

221
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,152
to attract a guinea pig, for instance.

222
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:59,198
I would try a sort of rabbit-y thing,
but with more saliva.

223
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:03,035
Desist.

224
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:06,723
You haven't acted
with any responsibility.

225
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:09,281
Say goodbye to your magical ability.

226
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:12,281
No.

227
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:24,725
Okay, these guinea pigs
look just like the ones we lost.

228
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,006
You think this'll trick Alex?

229
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:28,368
What are you doing
with my guinea pigs?

230
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:29,932
Yes, I do.

231
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:33,659
Mom and Dad
aren't really away for the weekend.

232
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:37,413
I had to turn them into these guinea pigs
to keep them from seeing my grades.

233
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:43,340
So the guinea pigs in the cage
were actually Mom and Dad.

234
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:46,419
Yeah, these guinea pigs
are Mom and Dad.

235
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,227
No, were, because they scurried off,
so we bought these at the pet store.

236
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:52,672
- Oh, man.
- Oh, man.

237
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:55,389
Oh, man. We've lost four guinea pigs.

238
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:58,947
How could you do something
so stupid?

239
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,194
Only a stupid person
would think that my stupid thing

240
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:03,834
was stupider than your stupid thing.

241
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,917
You don't even deserve
to have wizard powers.

242
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,637
This isn't about me right now.
This is about finding Mom and Dad.

243
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:12,883
- Who you turned into guinea pigs.
- Okay, it's a little about me.

244
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,475
Here's what we should do.

245
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,566
We'll ask these guinea pigs
where guinea pigs would run away to.

246
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,806
How are we gonna
ask these guinea pigs anything?

247
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,126
Use the transfiguration spell
to turn them into people,

248
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:23,571
and they'll be able to tell us.

249
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,809
- You use it. It's your problem.
- I can't.

250
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:29,371
Crumbs suspended my powers
until Mom and Dad sign my report card.

251
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:32,694
What? Is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

252
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,889
Yeah. There's no
emergency sandwich-shop convention.

253
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,534
Nobody cares
about your stupid tortilla movement.

254
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,615
No, Justin, look.

255
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:42,859
Will you just hurry
and say the spell, please?

256
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,622
Fine.

257
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,539
<i>These guinea pigs are small
Dumb and hairy</i>

258
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,901
<i>Make them human
To find Theresa and Jerry</i>

259
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,986
You've gotta be kidding me.
We're human.

260
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:02,030
I'm gonna use my opposable thumb
to pick stuff up.

261
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,630
Check it out.
I have things in both hands.

262
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:08,637
- Ask me if I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

263
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,751
Yes, I am.

264
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,874
Okay, settle down.

265
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:16,201
We need your help finding
a couple of guinea pigs, guinea people.

266
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:23,246
- I smell peanut butter and jelly crusts.
- And dirty socks. And orange soda.

267
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:24,802
Under Max's bed.

268
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:33,086
Oh, Max, the door opens.
You cleaned up in here. Go.

269
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,336
Is this marshmallows
smeared on asparagus?

270
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:45,850
Yes. Yes, it is, Justin.
That experiment's almost complete.

271
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:48,494
Max, what are you doing
with Mom's black dress?

272
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,981
It's a Darth Vader cape.
You people have no imagination.

273
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,183
This is where my lucky mug went.

274
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:00,062
There they are.

275
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:04,102
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

276
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:07,750
Oh, they look mad.
Maybe changing them back is a bad idea.

277
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:11,626
Yeah, it's a bad idea.
Let's just be raised by two guinea pigs.

278
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,560
Okay.

279
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:23,363
<i>These guinea pigs are now not
Mom and Dad should fill their slot</i>

280
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,318
Alex Russo, you are in so much trouble.

281
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:33,203
I can explain, but you need to know
that Professor Crumbs is coming

282
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,322
to discuss
my horrible report card with you.

283
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:40,725
Were you eavesdropping?

284
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:43,929
Mr. And Mrs. Russo, I am here...

285
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,969
What am I standing on?

286
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,289
It's marshmallow surprise.

287
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,381
The surprise is asparagus.

288
00:18:57,185 --> 00:19:00,736
Alex, do you wanna tell
Professor Crumbs where we were?

289
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:05,581
I turned them into guinea pigs
to keep them from seeing my report card.

290
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,501
And how did that work out for you?

291
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,750
Not well.

292
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:18,113
Oh, I see you have Alex's powers.
Don't let them fall into the wrong hands.

293
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:20,878
Oh, wait, they already were
in the wrong hands.

294
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,355
Yes, they were.
I am taking away her powers forever.

295
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:32,197
I have never seen such a blatant disregard
for the student wizard code of conduct.

296
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:34,841
No, please don't do this.
I've come this far. It's not fair.

297
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,849
I'm afraid it is. I shall take your powers
and be on my way.

298
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:46,087
Professor Crumbs
turned into a guinea pig.

299
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:48,527
Sweet.

300
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:52,248
Don't look at me.
I don't have my powers.

301
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,567
Justin?

302
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,736
I panicked.

303
00:19:59,262 --> 00:20:02,336
This is my problem, not yours.
Don't let me drag you down.

304
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:05,060
But you don't drag me down.
I don't want you to lose your powers.

305
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,655
Every time you mess up,
I have to think of a way to fix it.

306
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:10,228
You make me a better wizard.

307
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,023
Look, I don't know.
Professor Crumbs as a guinea pig?

308
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,347
Somebody's gonna lose their powers.

309
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:18,347
Well, I'm not a wizard, so...

310
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:20,466
What do you guys want for dinner?

311
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,991
Justin, you have to change him back.

312
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,356
Everybody just has to take
their medicine.

313
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:39,244
<i>This guinea pig is a bad dresser
Turn him now into my professor</i>

314
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:45,880
Justin Russo. How dare you?
You are supposed to be a model student.

315
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,086
I'm appalled.

316
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:48,880
I know.

317
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:53,493
I deserve whatever punishment
you're about to give me.

318
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,649
Professor, this is all my fault.

319
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,736
Justin, I heard what you said
about your sister

320
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,329
through my guinea-pig ears.

321
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:10,135
And if you could do something like that,
I can't ignore it.

322
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,461
You two bring out the best
in each other.

323
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,220
Alex.

324
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:19,548
I know I'm going to regret this,

325
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,903
but I am returning your powers

326
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,344
so that you can train
alongside your brother.

327
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,999
And to your punishment,

328
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:41,915
you both will spend the next two weeks
grooming my beard.

329
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:46,205
I'll see you in my office
Monday morning at 8:00.

330
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:48,125
Bring a comb.

331
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,330
Alex, is there something
you wanna say to your brother?

332
00:21:57,574 --> 00:22:00,294
Yeah. Thanks for sticking up for me.

333
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:03,375
Yeah. Professor Crumbs
really bought that story I laid onto him

334
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:06,013
about you making me a better wizard.

335
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:09,895
- Yeah. I really hate you.
- Yeah. I hate you too.

336
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,984
And I guess, if it means so much to you,
I'll sign your tortilla petition.

337
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,705
Thank you.

338
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,941
Well, I really hate both of you.
Now we don't have any guinea pigs.
