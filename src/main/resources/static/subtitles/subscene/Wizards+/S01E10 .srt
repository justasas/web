1
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:14,004
Hey, how was school?

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,010
Max, why are you carrying
Alex's backpack like that?

3
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,409
She told me my backpack
was bending my spine,

4
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:22,412
so she gave me hers to even it out.

5
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,649
Let's check.

6
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:29,256
There, all straight. You're welcome.

7
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,297
Alex, your brother is not your pack mule.

8
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:34,335
Yeah, I'm not your pack mule.

9
00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:36,697
I'm sorry, Maxy.

10
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:38,657
- Could you take this upstairs for me?
- Sure.

11
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:44,068
- Best day at school ever.
- Oh? They found the guy

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,792
that was putting peanut butter
in your locker?

13
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:50,665
No, but this made me forget about that.
Okay, so I'm in biology, right,

14
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,627
when Mr. Medina
has us pick lab partners,

15
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:56,513
and like always, my partner ends up
being the frog I'm dissecting.

16
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,715
I have the opposite problem.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,072
Everybody wants me
to be their lab partner.

18
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:05,437
- You don't take biology.
- That's what I keep telling those guys.

19
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,602
Anyway, in walks this brand-new girl,

20
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,367
and she is the hottest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

21
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:13,004
Eva Longoria goes to your school?

22
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,687
Eva Longoria?

23
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,692
Kids love Eva Longoria. It's...

24
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:24,089
Continue, son.

25
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:29,295
So Mr. Medina assigns the beautiful
Miranda Hampson to be my lab partner.

26
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:32,495
Miranda Hampson? Isn't she
that new goth girl in 11th grade?

27
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:35,896
She's not goth, she just likes wearing
black and dark makeup

28
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,905
and listens to bands
that are kind of scary.

29
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:42,946
Oh, so not goth, but goth.

30
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,947
You're missing my point.
I'm in the 10th grade.

31
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,954
- She's an older woman.
- Attaboy, like your mother.

32
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,910
The hot part.

33
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:56,838
Hold on, now. The story gets even better.
So me and my Miran...

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,350
That's my cute nickname for her actually.
Yeah, Miran.

35
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:03,722
- Accidentally reach for the scalpel
at the same time and our hands touch,

36
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:07,317
and she didn't pull away
for three seconds.

37
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:09,841
How's that for a great day?

38
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,440
Look, Miranda's here.
I guess your great day's still going on.

39
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:17,850
Or coming to a tragic end.
Let's watch, boys and girls.

40
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:21,215
- Hey, Miran.
- Who's Miran?

41
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:23,451
You, remember?

42
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:25,893
I called you that in the lab.

43
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,733
Oh, right. I thought you were swallowing
and talking at the same time.

44
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:35,258
He does generate a lot of saliva.

45
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,777
I have overactive glands.
We're looking into it.

46
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:44,951
It was worse when he was a baby.
We had to wrap his head in a diaper.

47
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:48,869
Excuse me one second. All right...

48
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,872
- Do you need to copy my biology notes?
- Oh, no, no.

49
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,469
I just... I came to ask you something.

50
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,955
Are you going to the junior prom?

51
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:02,321
No, I already told them
I don't wanna work lights this year.

52
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,004
Oh, you are so funny.

53
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:09,078
No, I mean,
would you like to go to the prom with me?

54
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,565
I'm new at the school
and I don't know a lot of guys,

55
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,444
and you seem very nice.

56
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,325
Me?

57
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:19,366
Well, you know,
I'll have to check the schedule and...

58
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:20,685
Are you trying to be cool?

59
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,536
- Yeah.
- Don't do that.

60
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:25,014
- Okay.
- I'm really tired of cool guys.

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,810
Don't worry, because I am so not cool.

62
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,979
<i>With the murrieta animata spell,
you can make any object come alive.</i>

63
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,178
Max, you're up.
See what you can do with that cup.

64
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,425
<i>Murrieta animata</i>

65
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:40,190
Are you picturing it with arms and legs?

66
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,380
No.

67
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:44,550
You got cheese on the board,
so I'm thinking about cheese.

68
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:48,464
No, we don't have any cheese.
We have a cup.

69
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,553
Justin, you're up.

70
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,476
Justin. Justin.

71
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,231
What? What?

72
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:58,555
- Sorry, Dad.
- You're not paying attention.

73
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,436
- That isn't like you.
- Yeah, it's like me.

74
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:02,875
And you're not even doing it right.
I completely check out.

75
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,841
This place could be burning
and I wouldn't even know it.

76
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:09,241
- What's up, Justin?
- It's Miranda. It's the junior prom.

77
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,091
There's gonna be dancing
and a lot of time to talk,

78
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,282
and I'm kind of nervous.

79
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,134
Well, I'm kind of nervous
no one is paying attention to the lesson.

80
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:18,489
I am. It's easy.

81
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:21,291
All right.
Well, put your magic where your mouth is.

82
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:24,576
<i>Murrieta animata</i>

83
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:28,731
Alex, what did you just do?

84
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:31,333
I did the spell you wanted.
You're welcome.

85
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,664
- Hello, losers.
- We're supposed to be doing it on the cup.

86
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:37,782
Well, the trophy seemed easier.
It already has legs.

87
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,107
See you at the finish line.

88
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,234
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry nothing.

89
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:57,514
That was my first place in state trophy
I got in high school.

90
00:05:57,643 --> 00:06:00,762
You'd better find that, young lady,
before your mom sees it.

91
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:03,196
You know how she hates magic
running amok.

92
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:07,767
Plus she's still mad about all that stuff
you said about Eva Longoria.

93
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,281
Yeah, Mom was pretty upset
about all that stuff.

94
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:13,764
Let's relive it. We'll play parts.
I call Mom.

95
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:15,851
Stop trying to change the subject.

96
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,615
The rest of the lesson
was gonna be about

97
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:19,535
how we un-animate stuff
we've animated,

98
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:22,049
and now we can't do that
until you find that trophy.

99
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,532
Class is over.

100
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,581
Great,
I'm already nervous about Miranda,

101
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,855
now I gotta worry
about finding this stupid trophy.

102
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,258
Sounds like you got a lot on your plate.

103
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:34,106
Let me know
how that all works out for you.

104
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:43,907
Guys, which is better for prom?

105
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,470
Well, the tux says safe boy,
but the zebra jacket says:

106
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:50,908
"Danger, danger,
stay away from my daughter."

107
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,712
Goth girl will like you for that.

108
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:55,711
Nice one.

109
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,280
You guys can never agree on anything.

110
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:04,526
Yeah, I think we pretty much agree
on that's the biggest zit we've ever seen.

111
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,118
What zit?

112
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:16,014
Okay. Well, it can't be that big, can it?

113
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,734
Yeah, maybe the mirror
is like a carnival mirror.

114
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,732
You can hardly see it.

115
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,339
<i>My baby has a zit como una montaña.</i>

116
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,059
That means "like a mountain."

117
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:31,706
This is gonna ruin everything.

118
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,058
I can't take Miranda
to the prom looking like this.

119
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,463
Why not? She does like danger.

120
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,469
If you go with that thing,
she'll never know when it's gonna blow.

121
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:45,952
What was I thinking
getting involved with an older woman?

122
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,154
<i>Papito, calm down.</i>

123
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:51,950
I've got an old Mexican remedy here
that is much safer than popping it.

124
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:54,556
My grandmother created it.
It works every time.

125
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,360
- Oh, thanks, Mom.
- We just smear a little bit of this on,

126
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:02,845
then we wrap it tight
in the banana bandana.

127
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:06,959
And voilà, in three days, gone.

128
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:09,083
Three days?

129
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:12,927
The prom is tomorrow, Mom.

130
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,890
Oh, I just remembered
a quicker remedy.

131
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:19,933
Okay, I'm gonna need rubbing alcohol,
a wire brush and a towel for you to bite on.

132
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,574
What?

133
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,380
No.

134
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:29,182
This thing keeps beeping.
The metal man must be close.

135
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:32,220
Alex, you're on a metal staircase
with a metal detector.

136
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:37,461
Oh, I just wasted an hour
going up and down these things.

137
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,106
That puppy's ginormous.

138
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:44,751
Why don't we just use the acne spell I use
to keep my skin clear and velvety smooth?

139
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:48,030
Alex, you're chasing a metal man.
I don't think magic's your thing.

140
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,388
I'm doing you a favour.

141
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,477
- Just hold your head still, okay?
- Alex, don't.

142
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:53,638
- Magic only causes trouble.
- Please, I'm working.

143
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:57,553
<i>- You got a trophy man running around...
- Murrieta animata, Murrieta animata</i>

144
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,006
What? Is it gone? Did it work?

145
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:04,200
Not exactly.

146
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,091
That is crazy. Your zit just talked to me.

147
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,851
You should hear me sing.

148
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:14,652
I'll do anything but country.

149
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,576
What did you just do?

150
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:27,499
I don't know, you were yelling at me.
I got confused. It's all your fault.

151
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:30,141
Dad said to never yell at someone
when they're doing a spell.

152
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:32,021
He said don't yell
when he's ordering takeout.

153
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:35,183
He was so peeved
when his pork dumplings didn't come.

154
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,104
He's already mad about the trophy.
If he finds out about this, we're both hosed.

155
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,907
Excuse me, you're hosed. You did this.

156
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:44,234
I'm just the guy with the
big gross talking zit on my forehead.

157
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:47,596
Hello? I'm right here.

158
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,121
Alex, get this thing off of me.

159
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,835
Come on.

160
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,003
I caught the trophy man.

161
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:57,321
It was easy.
He was on the hamster wheel.

162
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:00,087
Hamster? Not too happy about it.

163
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,085
See, Justin? You don't have to get
your boxers in a bunch.

164
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,008
Now Dad will teach us
the un-animation spell,

165
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:06,611
and your zit problem will be over.

166
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:11,246
Boy, I didn't even get a chance
to spend Christmas with you guys.

167
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:14,612
You animated Justin's zit?

168
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:15,927
Sweet, I want one.

169
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:17,538
Oh, no, you don't.

170
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,050
- Trophy man kicked me.
- Keep on trucking.

171
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,977
Whoa, hey, he's in my shirt.

172
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,459
It tickles.

173
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:30,866
Oh, boy.

174
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,461
Okay.

175
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:35,624
Okay.

176
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,224
Hey, my underwear.

177
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:45,626
Hey, you know what?
I was wearing those for 10 straight days.

178
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,719
That's it. I'm calling Miranda
and telling her I can't take her to the prom.

179
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:53,914
No, no, no, wait. I can talk to Dad.

180
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,879
I'm not gonna let my brother miss out
on what might be his only prom

181
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:59,960
because of some, what,
ugly, hideous thing on his face.

182
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:03,401
You guys are really rude to company.

183
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,569
Daddy, your bread's so good,
it's inspirational.

184
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:17,009
In fact,
it makes me wanna be a better person.

185
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,177
And I think I'm gonna start
with wizard's training.

186
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,132
Really?

187
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:25,099
Hey, here's an awesome idea
I just thought of right now.

188
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:27,178
Why don't you give me
the un-animation spell

189
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,458
you were gonna teach us,
and I'll start working on it?

190
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:31,419
Oh, yeah.

191
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,908
Why don't I give you the whole spell book,
we'll just call you a wizard?

192
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:38,627
That sounds like a lot of reading.
I'll just take the one spell for now.

193
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:43,389
Look.
With wizardry comes responsibility,

194
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:45,749
and that also means
taking care of your mistakes.

195
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,873
I'm not giving you that spell
until you find that trophy.

196
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:53,077
Where are you, trophy man?

197
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,401
Mom has a bowling trophy.
She's really cute.

198
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,006
Tight top, short skirt.

199
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,244
Please tell me
you got the un-animation spell from Dad.

200
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:05,888
- I got the un-animation spell from Dad.
- Oh, really?

201
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:08,654
No, I just felt like
I owed you some good news.

202
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,092
That thing's so big,
I can't stop looking at it.

203
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,615
But don't worry, I have a better plan.

204
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:16,617
We're just gonna pop the stupid thing.

205
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,017
Wait! I can help you with the girl.

206
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:20,940
- What?
- Don't listen to him.

207
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:24,695
No, no, no.
Oh, Justin, I can really help you.

208
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,055
How?

209
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:28,828
You were great with the girl
in biology, right?

210
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,941
What were you like outside of class?

211
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,945
Well, I don't know.

212
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:35,745
"I don't know."

213
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:38,390
Hold on. What could you do for him?

214
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:40,587
Talk him through the rough spots.

215
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:45,077
He's going with a girl
almost as pretty as you.

216
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,152
Oh, he's good.

217
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,962
I still think it's a mistake.

218
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:55,237
The mistake is not taking advice

219
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,327
from somebody who's been on
thousands of girls' faces.

220
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,322
I know what they wanna hear.

221
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,569
I know exactly what
you should say to them.

222
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,650
Give me a chance. Come on.

223
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:08,414
Maybe I could use a wing zit.

224
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:10,970
Yep, I see absolutely nothing wrong

225
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:13,733
with letting a growth on your face
tell you what to say to a girl.

226
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,452
Good luck.

227
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,908
You're gonna have to stop sweating.
It's getting into my eyes.

228
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:34,512
When are you gonna start helping me?

229
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,671
I've been talking about biology.
That's all I got.

230
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,550
I know.
She almost jumped out of the cab

231
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:44,754
when you kept going on and on
about deoxyribonucleic acid.

232
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,191
Just say what I say.

233
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:49,598
Here she comes.

234
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,398
Well, Denise says we look cute together.
And she loves your jacket.

235
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,957
- You're the one who looks great.
- Thank you.

236
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,403
Not you, the girl.

237
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,728
- You're the one who looks great.
- Well, thanks. You're sweet.

238
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:04,525
- No, you're sweet.
- That's lame.

239
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:06,805
- Don't ad-lib.
- Right.

240
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,777
- Well, you wanna dance?
- Sure.

241
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:13,217
What do you know about dancing?

242
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,332
Nothing. I'm a zit.

243
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:19,058
Put the hat down.
I don't wanna see this train wreck.

244
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:32,024
You're a really good dancer.

245
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,871
Justin's got a girlfriend.

246
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:36,988
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Girlfriend?

247
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,193
Don't panic. Hang in there.

248
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:42,275
Well, okay.

249
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,437
I'm your girlfriend.

250
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:47,677
Wow, I never thought
I'd be so grateful to a zit.

251
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:50,364
Now you got your girl.

252
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:53,684
Now it's time
for the Z-Man to have some fun.

253
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:56,721
Hey. You come with a fire extinguisher?

254
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:59,045
Because you're smoking hot.

255
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,211
What? How did you do that?

256
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:04,603
Do what?

257
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,808
I thought I heard you talk
while you were drinking.

258
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,256
That wasn't me.

259
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:12,856
Hey, baby. Have the cupcake.

260
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,331
And eat it real slow.

261
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:20,023
That was you. That's rude.

262
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,462
I'm sorry. Hold on.

263
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:28,985
- What are you doing?
- Oh, come on, dude. Lighten up.

264
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,991
I got you the girl,
now it's my turn to have some fun.

265
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:36,308
Hey, beautiful.
Can I talk to your boyfriend?

266
00:15:39,718 --> 00:15:41,118
That's it. I'm popping you.

267
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:43,880
Not so fast, lover boy.

268
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,841
Get a load of me. I'm engorged.

269
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:49,843
You pop me and we both go down.

270
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:52,839
Hey, zebra.

271
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:55,038
Were you just
making monkey sounds at me?

272
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:58,368
Oh, look who's learned his animals.

273
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,325
Hey, you caught trophy man.

274
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:07,255
Yup, nothing like a duct-tape
finish line to save the day.

275
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:09,653
Look, he's still trying to get out.

276
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,249
Oh, it's Justin.

277
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:15,052
Hey, how's prom?

278
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,459
What? Huge 11th graders?

279
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:19,702
How many? Look, I feel bad.

280
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,500
I'll get the spell from Dad
and I'll be there as fast as I can.

281
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:25,621
Max, I gotta go help Justin at prom.
Go get my jacket, the really cute one.

282
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:28,345
The one that cinches at the waist
with all the little buttons. Go.

283
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:31,552
- Oh, and my matching purse.
- I know the one.

284
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:33,307
Daddy.

285
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:35,307
- I caught the trophy man.
- Great.

286
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,833
You wanna give me
the un-animation spell now?

287
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,597
Look, before we get into that,

288
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,872
we need to sit down
and have a long, serious talk.

289
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,913
I know, I know.
I'm grounded for three weeks.

290
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:47,076
How did you come up with
three weeks?

291
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,718
One for using magic behind your back,

292
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:51,042
another for letting the trophy man
run around the house,

293
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,400
and the last one for future trouble
I'll probably be getting into.

294
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,726
Well, that's one more week
than I would have come up with,

295
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,921
but we'll go with that.

296
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:03,969
<i>Okay, say, "garibay immobilitay."</i>

297
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:06,486
<i>Garibay immobilitay</i>

298
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,971
Great.

299
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,293
Even though I don't got it anymore,
I still got it.

300
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:16,938
I like the way I deal with problems.

301
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,539
I think this purse
goes better with this jacket.

302
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,303
Now I got another problem.

303
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,908
Guys, when I implied
you didn't know your animals,

304
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:31,507
what I meant was...

305
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,546
You know,
three against one really isn't fair.

306
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:36,151
Yeah.
I don't know a lot of what you just said,

307
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:39,157
but let's see if you can say it again
without any teeth.

308
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,555
Hey, Brian.
There's some loser in the hallway

309
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,793
who says that you can't do
20 fingertip push-ups.

310
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:47,314
Everyone knows I can do 50.

311
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,641
Come on, let's go show him.

312
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,239
- Thanks, Miranda.
- Don't thank me.

313
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:55,168
I wanna know what's going on.
You're acting like two different people.

314
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,644
I'm sorry. I know I'm being weird.

315
00:17:56,771 --> 00:18:00,083
It's just that I really like you,
and nothing's going right.

316
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,253
- I like you too.
- Can we start all over?

317
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,770
Sure.

318
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:09,330
Just a hug?
I can get that from Grandma.

319
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,452
How about some lip action?

320
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:15,020
- There you go again. You're a pig.
- Miranda.

321
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:17,943
- Wait.
- Dude, help me out here.

322
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:21,299
I need a break. My hair gone a little flat.
I gotta go pump it up.

323
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:22,862
What? But...

324
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:24,708
- But I'm not...
- Don't worry.

325
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,583
Yo. Everybody listen up.

326
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:30,349
We got a guest DJ in the Kansas Room
in the Town and Country Suites.

327
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:33,548
Give it up for DJ Mad Hatter.

328
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:36,590
Yeah.

329
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,955
Justin in the hiz-house.
Let's raise the ceiling. Hoot, hoot.

330
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:46,595
And this is a fast one for all the ladies,

331
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:51,398
because I loves to watch you
shake that junk.

332
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,961
- There's nobody in the hallway.
- We must have scared him away.

333
00:18:57,092 --> 00:19:01,850
Oh, hey, look,
Justin Timberlame is up on the DJ stand.

334
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:06,176
- You know, let's take that freak down.
- Hey, guys. You wanna dance?

335
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,211
Hey.

336
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,533
Why would we wanna dance
with an eighth grader?

337
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:13,540
Get lost.

338
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:16,384
I'm in ninth grade, you big idiots.

339
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:22,537
What took you so long?

340
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,789
If you wanna know, I missed the A train.
I had to catch the bus on 4th Street,

341
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:28,826
where this guy
was selling the cutest earrings...

342
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:30,023
Just do the spell.

343
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:32,152
No. Stop.

344
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:34,835
Don't do it.

345
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:37,628
I can teach you how to drive.

346
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,355

347
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:42,352
- Did it work?
- Yup.

348
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,999
You're back to your regular,
pimple-faced dorky self.

349
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:47,996
- Thanks.
- No, I'm sorry I got you into this.

350
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,284
Now go out there
and get your older woman.

351
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,004
Excuse me.

352
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:58,723
I'd like to apologise
to Miranda Hampson for the way I acted.

353
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:00,527
Miranda?

354
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:04,177
I'm not wearing my hat, am I?

355
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:07,815
Good job. Now pop that sucker and run.
That's all you got. See you at home.

356
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,424
Hey, Justin.

357
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:20,821
Hey, Miranda.

358
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:24,068
Miranda wanted to talk to you because
I told her why you were acting so weird.

359
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:26,463
Yeah, why didn't you just tell me
you had a big zit?

360
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:30,264
I would have understood.
I've got one too.

361
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,670
Oh, man.

362
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,834
Yeah, that's a honker.

363
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,876
Sorry, you two wanna be alone.

364
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:46,565
- Look, I was so nervous about tonight.
- Why?

365
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,519
Well, because I've never been
to a junior prom

366
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,560
with an older woman that I really like.

367
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:52,043
Oh, that's okay.

368
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,005
Because I kind of like
this one younger guy right now.

369
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:58,002
Oh, that's cool.

370
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:00,696
I understand. Good luck with him.

371
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,728
She means you, stupid.

372
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,335
Right. Yeah, me.

373
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,822
Oh, okay.

374
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,385
Well, I gotta get home.

375
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:25,471
- See you in school.
- Not if I see you first.

376
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:28,469
- Stop trying to be cool.
- Okay.

377
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,029
Thank you so much
for bringing Miranda.

378
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,716
That's okay. I kind of owed it to you.

379
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:36,229
You know,
giving you the talking zit and everything.

380
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,589
But I'm kind of gonna miss him.

381
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:40,960
He was the only one around here
who was almost as clever as me.

382
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:44,402
Yup, you're so clever.
Hey, you wanna go get some ice cream?

383
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:46,040
Sure.

384
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,601
Yup, you're so clever.
Now you're locked out.

385
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:55,964
That's okay. I'll catch up with Miranda
and tell her about your doll collection.

386
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:02,935
They're action figures. They're not...

387
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,011
So how long have you been
in this line of work?

388
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:10,863
Oh, since the first Olympics.
But I was just on a medal back then.

389
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:13,739
- I've done all kinds of trophies.
- What about tennis?

390
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:18,628
World's fastest typist?

391
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:23,549
Yeah. Oh, you know
what other trophy I've done?

392
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:24,742
World's greatest kisser.

393
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:27,548
All right, all right.
It's past everybody's bedtime.

394
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:30,271
It's time for you
to get back on the pedestal. Alex?
