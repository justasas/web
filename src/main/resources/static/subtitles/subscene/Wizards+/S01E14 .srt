1
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:16,319
Did my messenger fish
just tell you my evil plan?

2
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,121
No.

3
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:20,484
All right. This time, pay attention.

4
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,361
Dear Mama, you'll be proud to know

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,450
that after the 12-ball tournament
reveals the best young wizard,

6
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:28,803
I will drain...

7
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:33,725
Okay, maybe he did tell me.

8
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:37,771
She is not my mother, you stupid fish.

9
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:40,538
Hey, at least I didn't tell her
about Volcanoland.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,531
I never said anything
about Volcanoland.

11
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:47,861
Well, you have to go to an undersea
volcano to drain a wizard's powers.

12
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:50,783
And Volcanoland is the only...

13
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:57,740
We have a problem.
You just heard my plan.

14
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,705
And I love your plan.

15
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,346
I think it'd be great for me
if Justin wins the tournament

16
00:01:03,472 --> 00:01:05,225
and you drain his powers.

17
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:07,029
How so?

18
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:09,673
Because without his powers,

19
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,946
there's no way he'll end up being
the family wizard.

20
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:13,152
I will.

21
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:14,433
Well, of course there's Max,

22
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:17,596
but he thinks
microwave popcorn's magic, so...

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,155
Well, it looks like we're
on the same side.

24
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,837
Care to seal it with a diabolical laugh?

25
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:26,841
I'll try.

26
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,681
Needs more bass.

27
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,848
I thought I heard voices.

28
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,680
Good evening, Headmaster Crumbs.
Just here with one of my prized students.

29
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,325
Really?

30
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:44,365
Alex Russo
is one of your prized students?

31
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:47,612
All the other teachers say
she's remarkably slack.

32
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,931
And you know how we feel
about slackers.

33
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:53,095
We don't like slackers.

34
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:58,050
Perhaps they don't know Ms. Russo
as well as I do.

35
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,581
Well, then.

36
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:02,541
Perhaps I should stick around
and get to know you too.

37
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:04,336
Now, what are we talking about?

38
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:06,784
Just girl talk.

39
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,817
Bras and stuff.

40
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:11,098
Oh, well, then, I've got to go.

41
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,012
Forget the Waverly Sub Station.
They use day-old bread.

42
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,176
Beautiful people eat at The Salad Bowl.

43
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,260
Lots of attractive women
eat salads these days.

44
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:27,060
Look at this.
No wonder we had such a slow day.

45
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:28,538
Excuse me.

46
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,898
What do you think you're doing?

47
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,911
It's not Halloween, and you're a little
too old to be trick-or-treating anyway.

48
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,787
If you don't mind, why don't you
stand in front of the clown supply.

49
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:40,065
I think you'd fit in better over there.

50
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:42,951
I have to stand here
because I'm stealing your customers

51
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:46,913
with my crisp lettuce
and crunchy cucumbers.

52
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,108
You can't do that.

53
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,039
That's what the hot-dog guy
in Washington Square Park said.

54
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:54,599
Now he's holding the arrow toward
cheap furniture going out of business.

55
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:57,079
So back off, meat eaters.

56
00:03:57,564 --> 00:04:01,036
Listen, you talking bowl of freak.

57
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,123
You are not gonna steal our customers.

58
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:05,968
Submarine sandwiches
have a long history in New York City.

59
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:09,640
And I know New Yorkers,
and New Yorkers love sandwiches.

60
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,650
They're not just gonna give them up
for tomatoes, carrots and...

61
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:14,850
What are those, snails?

62
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,892
They're porcini mushrooms.

63
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,847
Oh, I love porcini mushrooms.

64
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:20,332
Jerry.

65
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:22,688
- L...
- Get inside.

66
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:28,855
Okay, look, all we have to do is advertise
our shop like she advertises hers.

67
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,413
Where are we gonna find a goof
to wear a ridiculous costume for us?

68
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,024
It's time for the serve-and-volley drill.

69
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:51,950
You serve, I volley.

70
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:54,031
You cry for mercy.

71
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:03,188
I wasn't ready.

72
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,150
Justin, can I talk to you?

73
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:08,716
I need to practise.
I'm playing in the semifinals tomorrow.

74
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,553
No, you're not. Dr. Evilini is gonna drain
the champion's powers at Volcanoland.

75
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:15,564
- I can't let you win this thing.
- I'm sorry, volcano what?

76
00:05:15,686 --> 00:05:16,802
Her messenger fish told me.

77
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,839
She wants to become
the most powerful wizard.

78
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:22,679
So there's a volcano
and a messenger fish.

79
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,162
We need to focus on Evilini.

80
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,044
I don't know if you know, but she's evil.

81
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:28,765
No. Her name's Evilini.

82
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,328
And how much clearer could it be?

83
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:32,649
Okay, if she was really evil,

84
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:35,496
don't you think she would've changed
her name to Really-Friendly-ini

85
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:39,897
or Nice-ini or Totally-Not-Evil-ini?

86
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,901
All right, we're not getting anywhere.
You need to listen to me.

87
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:45,297
This is exactly why I didn't want you
to come to Wiz Tech.

88
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:47,818
Stop bothering me.
I need to focus and concentrate.

89
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,262
If I could focus, I would've hit those.

90
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:13,111
There she is, working the streets.

91
00:06:13,277 --> 00:06:14,677
Go get her, Max.

92
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:17,151
Max.

93
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,750
Hey, how'd you get it
to smell like onions?

94
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:27,595
Oh, that's you.

95
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:30,115
Jerry, it needs more ventilation holes.

96
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:32,403
That's why we went with Swiss cheese.

97
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:35,726
Now, go get those customers.

98
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,209
Yeah...

99
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,530
Maxy, are you okay?

100
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,726
Sorry, buddy.

101
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:44,728
Just get me up
before the three-second rule kicks in.

102
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,128
Get your Bronx-Strami.

103
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,928
Central Pork Sandwich
right here at the Sub Station.

104
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,180
Hey, it's working.

105
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,621
That's my boy.

106
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:02,574
Salads make you perky.

107
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:04,740
Sandwiches make you sleepy.

108
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,501
You know why people eat salad
with a roll?

109
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:10,824
Because it makes a sandwich
in their stomachs.

110
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:13,144
You have to eat sandwiches
with your hands.

111
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,543
Like savages.

112
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,541
Salads are un-American.

113
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:21,142
All right. You won this lunch rush.

114
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:24,074
But if you're here tomorrow,
you're gonna get it.

115
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,074
I am scared of lettuce.

116
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,916
It's high in vitamins and fibre.

117
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:39,074
Headmaster Crumbs, I need your help.

118
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,718
What seems to be the problem?

119
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,965
Dr. Evilini's gonna drain the 12-ball
champion's powers at Volcanoland.

120
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:50,847
And I think my brother
may end up champion.

121
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,038
You have to do something.

122
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,366
I can't. My hands are tied.

123
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,165
You don't believe me either?

124
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:58,972
No, my hands are really tied.

125
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:02,685
I lost a bet with Evilini.

126
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,376
Professor Maloney and I
got into a beard contest,

127
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:08,689
of which I had no business
being part of.

128
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,057
Don't you see? That bet was a setup.

129
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,741
Evilini has tied your hands
so you can't do anything about it.

130
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,375
You may be onto something.

131
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:19,093
But I can't confront Evilini.
She'd only deny it.

132
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:22,058
If you want to protect Justin,
it's up to you.

133
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:24,542
Get him to back out of the tournament.

134
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,979
I already tried, but once I mentioned
Volcanoland and the talking fish,

135
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,548
he thought I was messing with him.

136
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,107
Sounds like you need some hard evidence
to convince your brother.

137
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:36,782
I suggest you knuckle down
and go to the library.

138
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:38,792
Sure, I'll go to the library.

139
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:40,264
Oh, really?

140
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,705
- Is that the truth?
- Sure.

141
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:46,433
<i>Some are evil, some are kind
But now all must speak their mind</i>

142
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,396
I hate libraries. What am I saying?

143
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,071
There's no way I'm going to a library.
What am I saying?

144
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:56,992
I put a truth spell on you to see
if you're really on your way to help Justin

145
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:59,633
or if you're just going to slack off again.

146
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:02,565
I wanna help, but not at a boring library.

147
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:05,282
Well, then go someplace
where it isn't boring.

148
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:08,482
Like Volcanoland.

149
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,885
How do I get to Volcanoland?

150
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:11,525
I can't tell you that.

151
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,611
- Then why did you tell me to go there?
- I didn't. I would never say that.

152
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,523
I'm the headmaster.

153
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:19,614
I can't send a student off campus
to Volcanoland.

154
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:22,847
- What?
- You should never go to Volcanoland.

155
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,935
It could be dangerous.

156
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,214
So just to be clear,
you want me to go to Volcanoland?

157
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,612
I didn't say that.

158
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:32,057
But you did say Volcanoland.

159
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:34,662
I will admit to that.

160
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:44,263
Nice.

161
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:45,459
What's happening?

162
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,819
Justin's fallen behind.

163
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,420
Oh, good.
Maybe I don't have to go to Volcanoland.

164
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,828
The only way he can win now
is if he hits the tattler.

165
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:54,425
- The tattler?
- Yeah, it's an obscure rule.

166
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:56,592
If you hit the tattler,
it's an automatic win.

167
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:59,595
But the tattler isn't even in here,
so there's no chance.

168
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:02,917
- Yeah.
- There she is.

169
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,110
What's she doing?

170
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,961
She's tattling. She's the tattler.

171
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:09,755
It's obvious.

172
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,957
He did it. He hit the tattler.

173
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:28,841
I won. I'm going to the finals.

174
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,246
Well played, Russo.

175
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:33,531
It's now down to you and Jerko.

176
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,408
We'll soon find out
who's the most powerful young wizard.

177
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,288
Oh, sorry. My cell phone.

178
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,615
Hello, Mummy?

179
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:49,860
Okay, I've got to get to Volcanoland.

180
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,780
I guess it's just you, me and destiny.

181
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:07,223
No, Destiny Johnson lost
in the third round.

182
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,827
No, destiny, as in it's my destiny
to be a winner

183
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:13,870
and your destiny
to always live in my shadow.

184
00:11:14,397 --> 00:11:16,434
Well, I'll see you in the finals, Jerk.

185
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,834
How am I gonna get to Volcanoland?

186
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:25,797
I'd mail myself, but all the mail
goes through Dr. Evilini, and she's evil.

187
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:28,997
I work in the mailroom.
I could get around Evilini.

188
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:33,082
Are you saying you could mail me from
the mailroom without Evilini knowing?

189
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:36,360
I'm not saying that at all.

190
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,085
What is it with you people
and your head nodding?

191
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,328
Hey.

192
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:51,687
Excuse me. I need some information
about the volcano.

193
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:53,371
Fire away.

194
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:57,573
We're encouraged to use
volcano terminology whenever we can.

195
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:00,817
Is it true the volcano can drain wizards
of their powers?

196
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:04,022
The majority of wizards
enjoy the natural wonder of the park

197
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:07,502
and take a lot of pictures that they'll bore
their friends with when they get home.

198
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,741
What about the others?

199
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:13,541
They use the volcano
to drain wizards of their powers.

200
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,540
That's a separate entrance fee.

201
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:20,547
I have to prove this to my brother
before it's too late.

202
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:24,025
Hey, could you come back
to school with me?

203
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:27,353
What for? You got something bubbling?

204
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:29,707
See what I did there?

205
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:32,672
You're a volcano official.

206
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,677
My brother always believes
people in uniform.

207
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,440
It's one of the many things about him
that annoy me.

208
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:40,236
- Does it make you wanna erupt?
- Okay, now you're pushing it.

209
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:41,843
- Does it block your flow?
- Stop it.

210
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,762
- Does it make you wanna go molten?
- Don't.

211
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:46,878
- Make you hot under the collar?
- Okay, officially ignoring you.

212
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:55,488
- Alex, what are you doing? Who's she?
- Hello.

213
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:59,528
I'm the Information Desk Lady
from Volcanoland.

214
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:03,334
Go ahead, Justin. Ask her a question.

215
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:04,805
Could I get one of those?

216
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:07,850
- I like the fringe things on the shoulders.
- No.

217
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:10,693
A question about Volcanoland.
Just tell him.

218
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:14,131
At Volcanoland, more wizards
have been drained of their powers

219
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:18,137
than at all of the 77 Wonders
of the Wizard World combined.

220
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:20,135
Wizards come from near and far

221
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:24,619
to witness its awesome
wizard-power-draining properties.

222
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:27,182
Okay, so you weren't messing with me
about Volcanoland.

223
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,982
But that doesn't mean Evilini's
taking me there to drain my powers.

224
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,338
Dr. Evilini?

225
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,509
Oh, she has a season pass
to the draining section.

226
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:37,751
And she paid extra
so there's no blackout dates.

227
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,236
I gotta quit the tournament.

228
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:48,353
While I'm here, would you like to buy
an I Lava Volcanoland T-shirt?

229
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,590
No, I don't wanna buy
an I Lava Volcanoland T-shirt

230
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:53,361
because I don't lava Volcanoland.

231
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:58,199
He didn't have to blow his top.

232
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,838
Okay, I've had enough.

233
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,285
You want me to go dormant?

234
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:03,398
- Stop it.
- Okay.

235
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,161
Try a salad right around the corner.

236
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,606
Hey, lettucehead. Keep moving.

237
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:12,927
I warned you
about coming back here, shorty.

238
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:22,175
I don't wanna do this,
but you've given me no choice.

239
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:25,615
It's time for the salad
to get a little meat in it.

240
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:32,057
Hey, Salad Bowl Girl.

241
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:34,980
Remember me?

242
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:37,022
Well, let me help you out.

243
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:41,464
I'm the guy in the hot-dog suit.

244
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:44,945
You thought you ran me out of the biz
with that furniture arrow.

245
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,501
But I'm not going anywhere.

246
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:58,395
Oh, look.
The rest of the combo meal is here.

247
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,912
I can't believe it.

248
00:15:00,037 --> 00:15:02,109
I have always wanted to say this.

249
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,071
I just never imagined it being this great.

250
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,757
Food fight.

251
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:10,802
Fight.

252
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:19,364
Let me up. You can't do this.

253
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:22,567
- Had enough?
- Yes, I've had enough.

254
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:28,203
My lettuce was on the ground.

255
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,804
I'm a walking health-code violation.

256
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:38,530
- Thanks, guys.
- We got her. We got Salad Bowl Girl.

257
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,134
Dr. Evilini.
Alex told me about your evil plan.

258
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:48,938
- I'm not playing in the 12-ball final.
- Justin, Justin, Justin.

259
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,222
I don't have an evil plan.

260
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,503
Of course Alex doesn't want you to have
the 12-ball championship belt.

261
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:57,586
That would make you a shoo-in
to be the one in your family

262
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,427
to keep your wizard powers.

263
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:01,668
There's a championship belt?

264
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,310
Nice try, Evilini. I'm onto you.

265
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,708
The Volcanoland Information Desk Lady
told me.

266
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:13,596
She gave me a discount on my
Volcanoland park pass. I still hate her.

267
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:15,716
The point is, I wanna keep my powers.

268
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:17,238
So I'm done. I quit.

269
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,912
- I'm out of here.
- You can't quit.

270
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,509
I need to know
who's the most powerful young wizard.

271
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:24,475
<i>Scrittipolitti Noquitti</i>

272
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,038
Okay.

273
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:29,163
I don't know what you just did to me,
but I still qui...

274
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:31,561
I still qui...

275
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,245
You can't quit now.

276
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,361
- I put a no-quit spell on you.
- I qui...

277
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,242
I qui...

278
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,639
I wanna play. Oh, no.

279
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:41,409
What am I saying? What am I doing?

280
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:42,921
Give me my bidaddles.

281
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:46,046
I don't want them. I'm gonna win.
No, you're not.

282
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:53,576
WELCOME TO THE 852 ANNUAL
WIZ TECH 12 BALL TOURNAMENT

283
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:01,536
Guys, I have great news.
Justin's gonna quit the tournament.

284
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:03,574
Why would he quit?
That's not good news.

285
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:04,819
I can explain, see...

286
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:07,824
Wizards, student wizards,

287
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:12,180
visiting parents,
goblins and ghouls, Larry,

288
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:15,859
welcome to the Wiz Tech
12-Ball Finals.

289
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,623
Our first competitor.

290
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,622
Well, what can I say?
His name says it all.

291
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:25,464
Jerko Phoenix.

292
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:42,283
And a newcomer to the sport
and serious threat,

293
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:44,760
even though he doesn't look like it.

294
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:48,357
Justin Russo.

295
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,760
Hi, Mom.

296
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:57,761
Oh, look. He's waving at us.

297
00:17:57,892 --> 00:17:59,690
I don't wanna be here.

298
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,249
I love you too.

299
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:05,848
What is he doing here?
I told him not to play.

300
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,814
You need to be more supportive
of your brother.

301
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:11,375
I'm trying to save his powers
from getting sucked down a volcano.

302
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,338
We really should get her
into a creative-writing class.

303
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:17,933
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Evilini put a spell on me.

304
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,020
I can't qui...

305
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:22,857
First serve, Russo.

306
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:35,031
He's gotta lose. Lose, Justin, lose.

307
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:36,825
Alex.

308
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,874
I didn't mean to do that.

309
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,595
Way to go, son.

310
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,361
Keep your eye on the balls.

311
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,757
Miss it.

312
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,961
Can someone please stop me?

313
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,117
Oh, my gosh, they're up to 11 balls.

314
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:07,160
No one's ever gotten to 12 before.

315
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,081
The 12th ball. Get it, Justin.

316
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:34,899
We have a winner.

317
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:38,339
I can't believe it.
My brother's a champion.

318
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:41,256
Congratulations, Justin Russo.

319
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:45,463
You are the best 12-ball player
in the entire school.

320
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,023
What are you going to do now?

321
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,950
I'm going to Volcanoland.

322
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:54,233
You certainly are.

323
00:19:56,235 --> 00:19:57,305
That's it. It's over.

324
00:19:57,436 --> 00:20:00,270
I've tried everything.
I just can't beat Evilini.

325
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:02,594
Justin's gonna lose his powers.

326
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,995
Who are you talking to, honey?

327
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,153
Not now.

328
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,275
Here's an idea.

329
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:12,077
I am talking to myself.

330
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:14,924
<i>Some are evil, some are kind
But now all must speak their mind</i>

331
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:19,002
So it's Justin.

332
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:24,401
I'll take him to the volcano
and drain his powers for myself.

333
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,805
Why am I saying this?

334
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,524
Oh, no. A truth spell.

335
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:30,773
They'll all hear my plan to become
the most powerful wizard.

336
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:32,168
Stop talking.

337
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:33,450
Security.

338
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,656
I knew you could do it.

339
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:43,135
You went to great lengths
to help your brother,

340
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,411
and you brought Evilini down.

341
00:20:46,142 --> 00:20:49,295
When you apply yourself,
you can achieve a lot more than you think.

342
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:51,178
- I guess I can.
- Hey.

343
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:52,939
When you were at Volcanoland,

344
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:56,264
did you happen to buy a T-shirt
in my size?

345
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,101
Yeah, they're gonna mail it to you.

346
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:00,898
<i>Some are evil, some are ki...</i>

347
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,261
Okay, maybe I didn't.
But next time, okay?

348
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:04,586
Okay.

349
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:08,223
- Oh, Justin, honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

350
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:09,787
Thanks to Alex.

351
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:13,272
I can't believe my baby almost had
his powers drained in a volcano.

352
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:14,716
We were very concerned.

353
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:18,995
You still get to keep
the championship belt, though, right?

354
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,590
Alex, I'm kind of glad you came
to summer school with me after all.

355
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:26,072
Thanks for stopping Evilini
from stealing my powers.

356
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,081
So from now on, you'll believe me?

357
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,241
You know what? I will.

358
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:32,163
I think we've grown up a lot
this summer.

359
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:35,200
Yeah, me too.
Oh, you got something on your shirt.

360
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,521
I'm not falling for it this time.

361
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:46,132
Yeah. I saw that coming.

362
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,823
Isn't this the strangest thing
you have ever seen?

363
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:11,222
No, it's a dream come true.

364
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:14,068
Giant things eating what they are.

365
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:16,658
Come on, who hasn't had that dream?

366
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:21,983
If a giant claw comes out of the sky
and grabs one of them,

367
00:22:22,153 --> 00:22:24,429
then I've had that dream.

368
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:29,634
That's weird.
