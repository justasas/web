1
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:07,469
Hey!

2
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:09,188
Welcome to the
Freedom Tunnel.

3
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:10,498
Are you guys painters?

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,214
Well, no. But as you can see,
I am an artiste.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,939
My medium is fabric, seasonal
fruits, and cuddly creatures.

6
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:23,888
That's cool. Your art sounds
delicious and fuzzy.

7
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:26,165
What is this place anyway?

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,374
It used to be
an abandoned train tunnel,

9
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:30,620
but now it's been set aside
by the city for artists

10
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:32,291
to paint whatever they want.

11
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:35,570
Or hiding when they have a
fight with their girlfriends.

12
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,581
We're looking for Alex Russo.

13
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:40,021
Follow me.

14
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:41,895
Thank you.

15
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,439
Oh! What's this supposed to be?

16
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:48,282
It's a question mark.

17
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:51,592
No, I know what it is,
but what's it mean?

18
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:56,340
It means whatever you
want it to mean, man.

19
00:00:58,614 --> 00:01:00,854
I think it means he hasn't
decided what to paint yet.

20
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:05,336
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey, Line.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,582
I get it. It's a car
symbol in a tunnel,

22
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:11,255
on a cracked wall,

23
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:14,164
representing
the death of industry.

24
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:18,509
No, it's my initial in a
circle, representing...

25
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:20,750
...my initial in a circle.

26
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:22,187
Hey, Larry.

27
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:25,696
I was wrong.
Way off. Yeah.

28
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,307
It is her initial
inside a circle.

29
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,945
Congratulations, Alex.

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,448
I'm the president
of the committee.

31
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:34,153
I'm supposed to
congratulate her first.

32
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:36,988
Well, I'm vice president.
What do I get to do?

33
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:39,090
After I congratulate her,
you get to wish her well.

34
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:41,225
Oh, for the love.
Would somebody congratulate me

35
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,157
and then tell me what for?

36
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:46,156
The Tribeca Prep
Mural Paint Committee

37
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,893
had a meeting and I nominated
you to be mural painter.

38
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:52,132
Oh, my gosh. You nominated me
to paint a mural for the school?

39
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,201
No.

40
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,507
Alex, I need your help.

41
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,277
The rest of the submissions
were terrible.

42
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,448
So I told them about how
you do murals down here

43
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:01,917
and they all
agreed to it.

44
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,790
I questioned why I even brought
it up, but it was too late.

45
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,594
- Don't let me down.
- Yeah, don't let him down.

46
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:11,101
I'd say don't let me down,
but you could never let me down.

47
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:13,538
Anymore.

48
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:17,847
Paint a mural for the whole
school? I don't know.

49
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,485
You'll get out
of class to do it.

50
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,558
Well, then, you should have
said that first. What an honor.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000

52
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:20,949
Ham and cheese on white,
wheat or sourdough.

53
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:24,353
Your choice of side salad,
cole slaw, or French fries.

54
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:26,690
- Max? What are you doing?
- Yeah?

55
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,326
I'm making a video menu.

56
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:30,829
We have so many options that
I can't remember them all,

57
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:33,466
so I'm just going to play
this for the customers.

58
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:37,038
We are gonna start
hiring people to work here

59
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,075
who aren't related to me.

60
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,578
You'd have to pay them, Dad.

61
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,748
Oh. That's why I don't do it.

62
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:55,096
Oh, he did
the wrong thing.

63
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:01,702
I got the whole thing on video.

64
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,670
This is so going
on the Internet.

65
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:06,939
What do you say?
Can I put it on the Internet?

66
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:08,574
Oh, sure.
Sure you can.

67
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,609
I want everyone to know
how rude my customers are.

68
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,976
Don't smile.
I saw you laughing.

69
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:27,157
I stayed up all night
working on these.

70
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:29,125
Either one would
make a great mural.

71
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:33,761
Especially the one that
I'm sliding closer to you.

72
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,598
Which one do you think
I should go with?

73
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:40,766
Oh, honey.
It doesn't even matter.

74
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:46,338
What matters is that you're finally doing
something for someone other than yourself.

75
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:53,577
We just need to savor
this moment.

76
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,980
Excuse me.

77
00:04:57,014 --> 00:05:00,516
I know, honey. I know.
It's a miracle.

78
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,384
- We're good parents.
- Yes!

79
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,353
Wow. Look at all those sketches.

80
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,288
You're really going
all out for this mural.

81
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:09,389
No, I'm not.

82
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:11,590
I just want to make it good,

83
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:13,891
because I have to look at
the stupid thing everyday.

84
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:16,259
Except this one's not stupid.
It's really awesome.

85
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:17,560
But I'm not excited about it.

86
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:19,795
Say whatever you want.

87
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:21,429
We all know how much
you care about this.

88
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:23,830
It does seem like you care.

89
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,966
I'm just sayin'.

90
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:32,102
The Alien Language League has
moved up a bracket in the debates.

91
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:35,907
It's exciting. So, I'm not going to be
here to oversee the progress on the mural.

92
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,844
Your vice president is on it.

93
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:40,647
Great. Text me progress reports
every five minutes.

94
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,261
Who's gonna destroy Peakskill High at
tomorrow's Alien Language League debates?

95
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:53,231
Tribeca Prep. We're gonna
gee n'or their bla-nee-kan.

96
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:57,068
I heard there's gonna be
an actual scout from NASA

97
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:59,736
in the audience.
Do you know what this means?

98
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:03,940
We're gonna have an audience!

99
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:13,314
So, it's called
New York: Above and Below.

100
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:15,783
Above will be the pretty,
happy New York

101
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,351
which makes me want to barf.

102
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:21,388
And below will be the gritty,
grimy New York filled with barf.

103
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,459
That's it.

104
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:30,395
Excellent.

105
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:32,830
My committee corral approves.

106
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:37,833
If I can I'd just like
to make one little suggestion.

107
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:40,035
Just a little cactus hair.

108
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,706
I'd like to see more cowboys
in the above ground city.

109
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:47,277
Cowboys? In my mural?

110
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:50,345
Our mural.

111
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,415
I think they would really represent
our country's great Manifest Destiny

112
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,617
and "westward, ho" mentality.

113
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,754
I think you're the only one who
knows what you're talking about.

114
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,323
So, I think I'm just gonna
go on my own for this.

115
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,724
Absolutely.
Go your own way.

116
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,325
It's your vision. And you know
what your vision should have?

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,128
Caricatures. I love it when
people's heads are too big

118
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:13,363
for their bodies.

119
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:16,266
And they always hold teeny
tiny tennis rackets.

120
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:23,306
OK. So, giant heads, teeny
tiny tennis rackets...

121
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,875
And how about a bunch of panda
bears riding on the subway?

122
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:32,213
And the Statue of Liberty
shredding an electric guitar.

123
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,483
And panda bears.

124
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:40,019
If anyone else has another idea

125
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:43,055
why not just write it down
and pass it in to Miss Russo.

126
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,957
No, stop writing.

127
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,892
Why do you all have scrap paper
immediately available?

128
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:51,962
You'll do a bang-up job,
Miss Russo.

129
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,630
Oh, nice.

130
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,232
Harper...

131
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,801
Times Square filled with pizzas?

132
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:03,071
And look, this one just says,
"A picture of my grandma."

133
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:05,672
Whose grandma? How I'm supposed
to know what she looks like?

134
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:07,807
Oh, you've met
my Nana Franny.

135
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:11,144
She does needle point,
fought in World War II.

136
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,512
I'll get you a picture.

137
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,916
All right, Max.
What's the big emergency?

138
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:24,219
All right. Well, I put that video of
you on the Internet and got tons of hits.

139
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,553
People loved it.

140
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,755
So, if you jump on the other
end of this board for me

141
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,691
I'll be launched up and land
safely on our terrace.

142
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:32,627
And I'll put that
on the Internet.

143
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:35,596
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it right there.

144
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,331
I got tons of hits?

145
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,233
Oh, yeah, you did.
So come on.

146
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,234
Jump on the other end,
and I'll become famous.

147
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:43,969
The only thing
that's gonna happen

148
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:45,737
is you'll be launched
two feet in the air,

149
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,139
and you might break your arm.

150
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:48,974
Dad, come on. Just jump.

151
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:53,844
Fine. Just to show you how this
is not gonna work, I'll do it.

152
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,112
Yes.

153
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,315
Ready?

154
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:01,251
- Yep.
- One, two, three.

155
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:07,088
<i>I did it.</i>

156
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,190
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

157
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:12,960
<i>Knock it off!</i>

158
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,667
You've sure packed
a lot in here...

159
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:22,035
Pandas on the subway.

160
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:25,404
The Statue of Liberty
playing electric guitar.

161
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,205
And what's this?

162
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,106
Is that a cowboy
with a giant head

163
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,109
with a teeny tiny
tennis racket?

164
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:36,212
I know it's a mess, but it's
just what everybody else wanted.

165
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:41,617
Let me tell you something
very wise, all right, Alex?

166
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:46,987
When it comes to art, beauty
is in the eye of the beholder.

167
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:50,824
All right? It's impossible
to please everyone.

168
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:55,227
You're probably right.

169
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,629
Or maybe you're not.

170
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,899
No, I'm definitely right.

171
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,633
You can't please everyone.

172
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,001
OK. I was trying to
make a dramatic exit.

173
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:07,102
Oh! Oh, all right.

174
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:08,203
Well, do your thing.

175
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,939
OK. Thank you.

176
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:12,974
You're probably right.

177
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,543
Or maybe you're not.

178
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:19,780
Pretty good.

179
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:23,216
<i>So it's called
The Eye of the Beholder spell.</i>

180
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:25,351
It makes everybody see
what they want to see.

181
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:27,453
- I'll cast it on the wall...
- Hey, hey, hey.

182
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:29,288
As vice president
of the mural committee,

183
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:31,124
I can absolutely not
condone the use of...

184
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:33,793
Magic...

185
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:35,729
...as a means
to artistic expression.

186
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:40,300
- Are you done?
- Are you still gonna use magic?

187
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,237
- Yes.
- I'm done.

188
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
The weight of this mural
is too much to shoulder.

189
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:49,844
<i>Watch me use
The Eye of the Beholder.</i>

190
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:51,879
I'm gonna have
to inform Justin.

191
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:57,981
Oh, my gosh!

192
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:00,248
It's Nana Franny.

193
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,119
Oh, that's the most beautiful
mural I've ever seen.

194
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:12,053
Oh, thank you, Alex.
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,627
What is all this commotion?

196
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:26,498
Oh, Miss Russo.

197
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:30,468
You've lassoed my soul.

198
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:36,406
The perfect melding
of past and present.

199
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:39,309
Time is relative.
History is cyclical.

200
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:43,746
The cowboy shall once again
rule the western plains.

201
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,483
Those cowboys look like
panda bears to me.

202
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:51,018
Well, buckaroo, with great art
the interpretations are endless.

203
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:53,187
Thank you, Mr. Laritate.

204
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:55,656
Miss Russo,
there was a time

205
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,558
when I thought you wouldn't
amount to much...

206
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,294
That time was yesterday.

207
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:03,130
But now look at you.

208
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:06,166
You must be very proud to be
an artist who pleases everyone.

209
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,268
You're a real people pleaser.

210
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:11,637
People pleaser? Me?

211
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:15,141
No, no, no.
I'm Alex Russo. I don't...

212
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:17,642
I know.

213
00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:19,877
But look at how happy
everyone is.

214
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:25,082
So if everybody else is happy,

215
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:28,785
then that means I should be
happy too, right?

216
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:33,055
That's how happiness works.

217
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:39,961
Oh, I get it!

218
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,586
<i>Knock it off!</i>

219
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:54,956
That's um...

220
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,824
That's some pretty
crazy stuff, huh?

221
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,728
Yeah. Everybody's watching this.
It's going viral.

222
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:02,062
What are you gonna do next?

223
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,431
Next?

224
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,766
I just launched myself onto
a two story terrace.

225
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:11,168
That's cool.

226
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:14,438
But you need to plus it, dude.
That's already been done.

227
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:16,606
- By who?
- You.

228
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,074
That's right.

229
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:21,911
I do need to plus it.

230
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:24,146
<i>Knock it off!</i>

231
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,584
Hey, Harper, guess what?

232
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:33,420
Peakskill High
didn't stand a chance.

233
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,988
What can I say?
They didn't have a certain...

234
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:38,022
...Justin Russo.
Thank you very much.

235
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:41,059
Yeah, and next up...
Sachem High.

236
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:43,662
And they better bring it or they're
going home, crying to their mommies

237
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:45,596
on their little bikes
made up like starships.

238
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,398
- Ooh!
- I wish we'd thought of that.

239
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,967
Oh, my gosh.

240
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,468
The mural.

241
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,139
There's beakers,
test tubes and the...

242
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,706
...the Action News weather lady

243
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:03,709
giving an incredibly
accurate forecast.

244
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:07,179
Wow! Robot president.

245
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,616
This is awesome!

246
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:14,852
Wait a second.

247
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:18,989
I see test tubes. Zeke sees
robot president. And you see...

248
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,323
Nana Franny.

249
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,125
- Oops.
- Harper?

250
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:26,762
<i>What's going on? Did Alex use
The Eye of the Beholder spell?</i>

251
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,863
I don't know the name
of the spell she used.

252
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:32,500
But if I was gonna name it,
I would probably name it that.

253
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:36,969
You knew about her using magic?
Why didn't you text me?

254
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:40,105
I just love seeing
Nana Franny so much.

255
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,506
If you want my resignation
just say it.

256
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:44,542
I want your resignation.

257
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,010
La, la, la!
I can't hear you!

258
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:47,845
Give me your...
Harper! Harper!

259
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,581
Alex, I trusted you
to paint that mural

260
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,615
and you just used magic
and blew it off?

261
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:57,852
No, I had a great concept
and I was so excited about it.

262
00:14:57,886 --> 00:15:00,120
But everybody kept yelling
their ideas at me

263
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:02,856
like I was some sort
of paint monkey.

264
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,524
Alex, it's a committee.
It's what committees do.

265
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,660
And now that you mention it
everything down here

266
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:09,962
looks like it was painted
by monkeys.

267
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,599
Using magic on the school wall
was completely reckless, Alex.

268
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,868
Yeah, well, I'm the
one who's suffering.

269
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:19,536
Mr. Laritate said I was
an artist who pleases everyone.

270
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,772
And that's when I realized
I please everyone but myself.

271
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:26,608
And you know what that is?
That's a sell out.

272
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:29,945
- I'm a sell out.
- A sell out?

273
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,614
- Who's a sell out?
- Me.

274
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:36,383
I'm worse than that rapper who
did that washing machine ad.

275
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:40,620
Wiki-wiki-wiki-wash...
Ridiculous.

276
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:44,291
This is the mural I wanted to
paint for my school, but I didn't.

277
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:46,026
So, why do you feel so bad?

278
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,729
At least you painted what you
wanted. It's just down here.

279
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:52,264
Look, let me tell you
about an artist I know

280
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:54,666
who makes a living drawing
cheesy greeting cards.

281
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,801
Let's say his name is um...

282
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:58,035
...me.

283
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,970
Am I a sell out?

284
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:01,805
Of course.

285
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:06,076
You draw greeting cards?

286
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,977
Yeah, but the artistic
ones, right?

287
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:10,312
Yeah, sure, if you think
a thermometer that says,

288
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:12,514
"Get well soon," is artistic.

289
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:13,748
That's you?

290
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,785
The thermometer
clearly has a fever.

291
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:19,787
I mean, a thermometer with
a thermometer in his mouth.

292
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:22,327
That's... That's genius.

293
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,696
- That's good.
- Yeah.

294
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:29,866
When I draw that stuff, it
tortures me deep inside my soul.

295
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,334
And it hurts.

296
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:34,036
But I use that pain
to create all this.

297
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:37,339
Down here.

298
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:38,741
It's perfect.

299
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:42,545
You're right, Line.
Thank you.

300
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:45,948
I am now officially
a tunnel person.

301
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:47,249
Yeah!

302
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,585
Tunnel people!

303
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:52,219
So, you're just gonna
do your art down here?

304
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:53,753
Yes.

305
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,488
And if you would just leave,
I would get a chance to do it.

306
00:16:56,523 --> 00:17:00,058
So you don't want your art to be
seen by anyone? I don't get that.

307
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:02,393
That's because you're
not an artist.

308
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:03,828
You're right.

309
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:07,632
I could never paint a
question mark on a wall.

310
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,467
Hey, Line.
He called you a monkey.

311
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,071
That was before I knew about
that thermometer thing.

312
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,113
All right.

313
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:28,283
From down below,
this art should show.

314
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,857
Oh, my gosh.
It's my mural.

315
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,393
Alex, what did you do?

316
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:45,564
Well, defacing school property is something
I would do and have done many, many times.

317
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,900
But I can't take
credit for this one.

318
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,304
This has nothing
to do with panda bears.

319
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,440
I hate it and I'm
telling Mr. Laritate.

320
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:03,046
Justin, I don't know how this
got here. I didn't move it.

321
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,914
That must make you mad.

322
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:07,749
No. Actually,
it kind of feels good

323
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:10,185
to have everyone see
my original idea.

324
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:13,454
Even though
they all hate it?

325
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:16,423
That's OK.
At least they saw it.

326
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:19,326
And even though they hate it,
it made them feel something.

327
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,496
Well, then it looks like
I did it again. Boo yah.

328
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,233
Justin, now is not the time for
your Alien Language League junk.

329
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:31,136
No, no, no. I'm the one
who moved your mural.

330
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,405
And did you see how I was
playing it like it wasn't me?

331
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:36,507
I was like, "You must be mad,"
and "What if they take it down?"

332
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:39,910
And you were like: "Now I know why I'm
an artist, because they all hate it."

333
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:42,478
When really it was me
the whole time.

334
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:44,547
I was acting.

335
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:49,051
I can't believe you did
all that for me.

336
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:51,086
Well, you're the artist
and you're my sister,

337
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,987
and I think your work
deserves to be seen.

338
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:55,323
Thank you.

339
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,725
Don't get the wrong idea.
I hate the mural.

340
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:01,528
The message is heavy handed.
The theme's been done before.

341
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:05,398
And your trees look like
big, green lollipops.

342
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:08,834
Yeah, I gotta
work on my foliage.

343
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:14,838
Miss Russo, this is not
what we discussed.

344
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:17,375
What happened to that
handsome cowboy?

345
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:21,411
You asked me to paint
the mural, and I did.

346
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,380
And I'm not going
to change it one bit.

347
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:26,549
President of the mural committee,
how could you let this happen?

348
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:29,618
I left my vice president
in charge when I was gone.

349
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,422
That's right.

350
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:35,957
He did.

351
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:39,360
And I will go find her.

352
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:44,831
No, no, no.
It's not their fault.

353
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:47,033
Mr. Laritate, I'm sorry,
but from now on,

354
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,068
I'm gonna paint
what I want to paint.

355
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,271
Artists are so temperamental.

356
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:06,077
All right,
so what I'm gonna do

357
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:09,780
is jump this unicycle,
right here...

358
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:12,281
...over all of these
garbage cans, wearing...

359
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:14,183
...this bubble wrap.

360
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:18,586
Do you think you could run up and
jump those trash cans on your own?

361
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,853
No way, dude.

362
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,556
That's why I got
the unicycle.

363
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,190
A unicycle can't go any
faster than you can run.

364
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,158
- I beg to differ.
- Based on what?

365
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,960
It has a wheel.

366
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,195
Do you even know how
to ride a unicycle?

367
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:33,297
No, but I can ride a bicycle.

368
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:37,233
And this is one wheel less than
that, so it's gotta be easier.

369
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,570
I feel I've asked enough questions to not
be responsible for what is about to happen.

370
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:43,938
- Where's the record button?
- Right there.

371
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,473
On the back.

372
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:54,081
There's no turning back now.

373
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:56,516
OK. It's go time.

374
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,558
He did the wrong thing.

375
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,828
That really hurt.

376
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:14,331
Max, what are you doing?

377
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:15,932
Giving the people
what they want.

378
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,835
I'm an Internet sensation.

379
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,503
Well, knock it off!

380
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:22,205
It's her.

381
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,873
It's the "knock it off" lady.

382
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,109
Why they calling me the
"knock it off lady?" What?

383
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,146
We love how you
always say:

384
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,681
"Knock it off.
Knock it off."

385
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:33,815
And we love it when
you pretend to be mean.

386
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,919
Oh, well, I'm not pretending,
but thank you.

387
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:42,389
We're from the "knock it off"
lady fan club.

388
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:44,358
Knock it off!

389
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:49,662
Wait a minute. I'm the one
who started this whole thing.

390
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:50,730
Watch!

391
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:00,836
No, no, no.

392
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:03,105
I'm the one who started
this whole thing.

393
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,039
I do all the stuff she
says "knock it off" to.

394
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,507
Knock it off!

395
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,575
Knock it off! Knock it off!

396
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
