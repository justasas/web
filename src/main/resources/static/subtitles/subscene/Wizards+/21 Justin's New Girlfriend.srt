1
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:11,145
Oh my gosh, that was so much fun.
I love silent movies.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,153
Although it wasn't very silent
with Alex talking the whole time.

3
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:16,458
Uh, silent movies are the worst.

4
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,025
It's not that hard to go back

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,886
and put some voices in the movie.

6
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,051
I mean, people do it all
the time on the Internet.

7
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:26,218
The other day, I saw Big
Bird doing a Kanye West song.

8
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:32,054
Justin, don't listen to her.

9
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:35,158
She could never appreciate the
subtle nuances of Laurel and Hardy.

10
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:38,095
Oh, how about when they were
pushing that piano up the stairs?

11
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,732
You knew it was coming down,
but you just didn't know when.

12
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,132
Genius.

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,399
No, it was two idiots
moving something

14
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:48,198
they should have paid someone
else to move for them.

15
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:51,897
It's like that time you and Dad tried to
push the dishwasher up the fire escape.

16
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:54,232
We had to buy a new fire
escape and a new dishwasher.

17
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:56,435
She's just jealous.

18
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,639
She doesn't think it's a movie unless
there's a car crash every five minutes.

19
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:02,376
Hey,  Car Crash Every Five
Minutes  was a great movie.

20
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,712
Yeah, you knew the car was going to crash,
and you knew exactly when.

21
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,613
Genius.

22
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:09,548
That's a good one.

23
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:13,418
Oh, Harper, the silent movie festival runs
all week. We should go catch another film.

24
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,419
That's a great idea.

25
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:18,519
Wait, you guys are going
to the movies without me?

26
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,786
You obviously don't like silent
movies and we're really into them.

27
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:25,323
We should go see one of the
Charlie Chaplin comedies tomorrow.

28
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:26,724
Oh, that sounds great.

29
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:31,627
How can you call them comedies
if you can't hear the joke?

30
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:34,563
You don't need dialogue
for a comedy to be funny.

31
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:37,699
Oh, really? Well then
let's see about that.

32
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,207
I rest my case.

33
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:54,878
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,780
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

35
00:01:57,415 --> 00:01:58,982
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

36
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,617
* Yes, please *

37
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,452
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

38
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:04,252
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

39
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,587
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

40
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,421
* That's what I said *

41
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:11,756
* Everything is not what it seems *

42
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,392
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

43
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,962
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

44
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:23,833
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

45
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,970
* Everything is not what it seems *

46
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:30,772
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

47
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:34,611
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

48
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:38,481
* Because everything is not *

49
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:41,049
* What it seems *

50
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:48,050

51
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:50,990
You made this sandwich
with mayo on it.

52
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:54,426
Come on, Jerry, you're making me look
bad out there. I wrote down,  no mayo.

53
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,795
Well this says,  plus mayo.

54
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,164
That's an  X . X  means no mayo.

55
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:02,832
Why don't you just write  no mayo?

56
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:07,870
Can't bring in a Navy code cracker
every time you turn in an order.

57
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,041
Just fix the sandwich.

58
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,209
This is New York.
People want stuff fast.

59
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:16,578
If you were a superhero
your name would be

60
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,114
Super Slow Sandwich Making Guy."

61
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:22,049
And you'd be my sidekick.

62
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:24,584
Wonder How She Ever
Became A Waitress Woman.

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,220
You don't quite understand
what I do back here.

64
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:30,722
There's a lot more to it
than just making sandwiches.

65
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,791
I have to get the supplies,
do all the prep work,

66
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:36,460
make the orders and deal
with a wisecracking waitress.

67
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:40,930
Oh, I would love to see you do my job
dealing with customers for a day.

68
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:42,865
There's a reason
you're back here Jerry.

69
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:44,632
People don't like sweaty waiters.

70
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,866
There, I said it!

71
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:50,703
Hey, why don't you
guys just switch jobs?

72
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:53,906
That way you can see how hard it
is to do the other person's work.

73
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:57,843
Oh. Well, I don't know.
Your mom's job seems pretty tough.

74
00:03:57,877 --> 00:03:59,911
I mean, you have to write
down what people want.

75
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:02,347
And then later,
you have to bring it to them.

76
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:05,449
I can totally do your job!
And I can smile.

77
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:07,484
They won't be used to that.

78
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:10,353
Oh, bring it on.

79
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:14,556
I'll sit back here where no one can see me
and stuff a bunch of meat into slices of
bread.

80
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,157
But I'll get it right.

81
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:17,759
Stuffing?

82
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:19,761
This is an art.

83
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:23,998
They don't just give these Sandwich
University diplomas away to just anybody.

84
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:27,835
I made you that for Father's Day.

85
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,304
I still earned it.

86
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,445
Hey Alex, the movie was so good.

87
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,446
Awesome.

88
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,282
Matching t-shirts?

89
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,483
Oh, are they having a field
trip at school today?

90
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,853
Don't worry. You won't get lost.

91
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,325
They're prizes.

92
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,862
We knew the most Chaplin
trivia. Jealous?

93
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,931
Yes. I'm jealous of other people, because
they're not a part of this conversation.

94
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,467
- She's jealous.
- Uh-huh.

95
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:07,336
Harper, don't forget about the
Lon Chaney silent movie tomorrow.

96
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,171
We can't miss that. I'll make us shirts
that say we like our festivals...

97
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:12,239
...silent.

98
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:19,143
Oh...

99
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:21,579
I'm gonna go.

100
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,048
No, Harper.

101
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,250
Forget about the stupid
movie with Justin.

102
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,751
Let's go to the bowling alley

103
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,452
and rent shoes just to eat pizza.

104
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:32,455
And then when the guy behind the
counter threatens to call the cops,

105
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:36,891
we'll say "Do it, cause we'd like to get
a ticket for wearing bowling shoes."

106
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:40,727
I can't. Tonight's the night my mom
and dad and I pick out a kitten.

107
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:44,664
Now that things are great at home,
Doctor Paul says it's safe for animals.

108
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:49,801
Sorry.

109
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,771
I don't want you dating Harper.

110
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:57,373
It could upset the delicate balance of
who I can pit against whom in my life.

111
00:05:57,408 --> 00:05:59,240
I'm not dating Harper.

112
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,874
Oh, come on.

113
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:03,277
You make plans.
You go to the movies.

114
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:05,579
She walks you home. That's a date.

115
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:07,547
Wait a second.
I know what you're doing.

116
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:10,383
It's a scare tactic to get me
to stop hanging out with Harper.

117
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,285
Oh, really?

118
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,022
Because one time when you were napping on
the couch, she stared at you for an hour.

119
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:20,258
What? You let her stare...

120
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,726
You know, it's not working.

121
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,660
Harper and I just
like the same movies.

122
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:27,996
And she's kinda fun now that she's not
acting like some freak who has a crazy
crush on me.

123
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:31,299
OK, but that freak is living right
under the surface so stop dating her.

124
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:33,666
We're not dating!

125
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:35,234
But, you know what?

126
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,671
It looks like it bugs you, so hey,
why don't we call it a date.

127
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:40,739
With a capital "D."

128
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:44,442
Oh!

129
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,885
Yeah, I just found
out in Career Class

130
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,155
that you only need to go to
school 40 hours to become a pilot.

131
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,091
I totally have that kinda time.

132
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,960
Dude, you've never even been in a plane.
They're not gonna let you fly one.

133
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:09,596
You were 40 hours away from me
asking you to be my co-pilot.

134
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,969
Oh, Harper, there's a lecture tonight by
the guy who helped Buster Keaton do his own
stunts.

135
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:21,238
Wow, so a billion year old guy
is going to talk about falling?

136
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:23,339
Why don't you just go
hang out with Grandpa?

137
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:28,277
Oh, Justin, don't listen to her.
Count me in.

138
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,612
OK. Can't wait.

139
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:37,018
So where's Justin taking you
to dinner before the movie?

140
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,520
He didn't say
anything about dinner.

141
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:42,657
Well, yeah. No, I know.
But I mean, you've been out a few times.

142
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:47,662
Dinner and a movie, it's kinda what
people do when they're on a... date.

143
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:51,198
Date?

144
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:53,800
Oh my gosh. You're right.

145
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,535
I am dating Justin.

146
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,870
I never thought it
would happen like this.

147
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:01,673
By accident.

148
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:07,944
Oh, hey Justin. How ya doing?

149
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,179
Have you ever noticed,

150
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,148
that you and silent film star Rudolph
Valentino have a lot in common?

151
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,717
You're both half-Italian,
you both worked in a restaurant.

152
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:18,119
Although you're not a dancer.
But if you were a dancer,

153
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:21,021
I'd come to one of your shows.
Are you having a show? Cause I would go.

154
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,891
Would I make you nervous
if I sat up front?

155
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,558
I hope it's Grease.
Cause I love Rizzo

156
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,293
and I hate Sandy.

157
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:43,437
Nice going, Alex.

158
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:47,307
I know you did something to Harper to
make her act all "Creepy Harper" again.

159
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:50,376
Hey, everything's back
to the way it should be.

160
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,910
I'm her best friend.
She weirds you out. You're mad at me.

161
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:55,044
And she watches you sleep.
Everybody's happy.

162
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:59,515
No. I liked hanging out with
a girl that's just a friend.

163
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,184
Relax, you still have Mom.

164
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:04,687
The point is you
sabotaged our friendship

165
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:07,189
just because you didn't want
me hanging out with her.

166
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:09,224
It was a nice break
from my other friends

167
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,492
where most of our
conversations are about

168
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:13,294
"Actroid the Japanese Fembot."

169
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:25,706
Here's your Number
Four with no tomatoes.

170
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:32,379
Whoa. What did you do?
Stuff the whole cow in here?

171
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:35,248
Excuse me for putting a
little meat in the sandwiches

172
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,949
instead of just rubbing
it on the bread.

173
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,859
Now, where do these go?

174
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,426
Dad, didn't you write down the
table number on the order?

175
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,394
That would help.

176
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,229
Look, Max, can you figure
out who ordered these?

177
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,633
Dad, I don't want to get in the
middle of your competition with Mom.

178
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,171
I understand, son.

179
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,640
But for five dollars
you will, right?

180
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,042
I do need money for flight school.

181
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:16,646
Uh, OK.

182
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:18,381
Mom. I need a Brooklyn Bridge.

183
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,316
OK. What's in that?

184
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,684
Two pastrami sandwiches
connected by a hot dog.

185
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,419
Who orders that?

186
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:27,522
The guy that started
out with dessert.

187
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,225
Max, listen, you've got to help me.

188
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,560
I don't know how your dad
keeps track of all of this.

189
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:36,129
Listen, Mom, I like you,
I really do.

190
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:39,398
But this is between you and Dad.
I don't want to get involved.

191
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:42,367
All right, I understand, Max.

192
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:47,337
But, I could get involved
for the right price.

193
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,338
Oh, really?

194
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:52,206
OK, here.

195
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa Mom.
Don't make it so obvious.

196
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:02,582
Oh. Look, someone must have dropped
a five dollar bill on the floor.

197
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:06,286
OK, now help me!

198
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:10,090
I messed up on all
of these sandwiches.

199
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:12,158
All right, when you
mess up on a sandwich

200
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,961
here's the sponge Dad uses to clean
the condiments off the bread.

201
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:19,197
He calls it "The Eraser."

202
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:20,699
Thank you.

203
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,001
Oh.

204
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:26,370
I think you know a
better way to thank me.

205
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,905
Just fix those sandwiches.

206
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,139
OK.

207
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:43,083
Harper, what are you doing out here?
Why don't you just go in?

208
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,854
I am never going in there ever again.
Justin cancelled on the Buster Keaton
lecture,

209
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:48,755
and then when I tried
to make other plans,

210
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,590
he said he w busy for
the rest of the year.

211
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:52,558
Harper, you'll get over it.

212
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,860
Let's go inside and I'll
make you some hot chocolate.

213
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:56,662
Hey, wait a second.

214
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:59,297
You're being awfully
nonchalant about all this.

215
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:03,266
What are you talking about?
I'm being totally "chalant."

216
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:06,202
Did you say something to Justin?

217
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:09,605
Did you tell him about tt one
time I watched him sleep?

218
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,975
You did, didn't you?

219
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:16,377
That could be
misconstrued as creepy.

220
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,881
C'mon, Harper. We're back to normal.
Back to normal's good.

221
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:23,650
Alex, you're a pretty controlling
person and I put up with it

222
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:25,185
because you're my best friend.

223
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:27,053
But you knew how I
felt about Justin

224
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:30,824
and you couldn't just be okay with it.
What kind of best friend does this stuff?

225
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:34,995
Okay, maybe I didn't think it all the way
through, but you know what I was going for.

226
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,296
You know what?
I don't need an answer.

227
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,331
This is the kind of
question you hear now,

228
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:41,866
and think about later when I
leave in a huff. Which is now.

229
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,670
So you are going to
think about it, right?

230
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:47,838
I...

231
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,048
Mom, I need to talk to you.

232
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,717
Oh, can it wait, Alex? I'm finally
getting caught up on these orders.

233
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:10,020
Aren't you the one who always says,

234
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:13,390
"I always have time for you and
whatever problems you're having?"

235
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:16,625
That is you, right? Mother.

236
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,362
What is it, sweetie?

237
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:23,632
Two people very close to me are having
a problem, and I tried to fix it,

238
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,701
but I might have made it worse
for everybody, especially me.

239
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:28,769
Well, if you truly care about them

240
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:31,171
you'll need to put their
feelings above yours.

241
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:33,039
Do you know where Dad is?

242
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,008
Let me finish.

243
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:39,945
Get them in a room together and don't
let them leave until they work it out.

244
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,348
All right, that's
actually not a bad idea.

245
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,583
They'll be friends again,
they won't be mad at me,

246
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,119
and I don't have to apologize
to anyone. Thanks, Mom.

247
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:50,888
Oh, nice job pretending like
you wanted to talk to me.

248
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,189
OK, sweetie.

249
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,332
I'm here. What do you want?

250
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:12,370
I wanted to talk to you about this
whole mess. Here, grab a soda.

251
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:15,839
I'm gonna take out the garbage.

252
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,148
What do you want, Alex?

253
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:29,649
I don't have time for anything.

254
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:32,219
Ah! Justin! You're not
supposed to be here!

255
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:36,123
It's my house. You're
not supposed to be here.

256
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:42,994
Make your troubles no more,
go in through the out door.

257
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,729
Why are you here?! Oh,
I have to go.

258
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:47,899
Harper.

259
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,333
Um!

260
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:55,138
Whoa!

261
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,572
What's going on?

262
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:59,441
I don't watch you
when you sleep. Bye!

263
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:06,480
Stop following me.

264
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,581
Hang on, Harper.

265
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,486
Alex must have cast the "In
Through the Out Door" spell.

266
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:18,954
We can't leave without
coming right back in.

267
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:21,089
I should've known.

268
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:23,725
She said she was going
to take the garbage out.

269
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,160
She never takes the garbage out.

270
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:27,795
Why would she do this?

271
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,098
Because she's evil and probably
wanted us to be friends again.

272
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:34,568
Well, she's not gonna
get away with it.

273
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,770
Yeah. We gotta get
back at her for this.

274
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,072
- We should use magic.
- Yes!

275
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,774
We can make her really tiny and
chase her around with a vacuum.

276
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,508
My new kitty hates that.
Or we could...

277
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,544
Whoa! That's...

278
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,012
You've obviously been learning
about magic from Alex.

279
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,081
All magic isn't devious
and manipulative.

280
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,382
Really?

281
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,350
Then what's so great
about being a wizard?

282
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:57,521
Alex did the "In Through
The Out Door" spell, right?

283
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:00,790
But she probably wasn't smart
enough to put a "spell lock" on it.

284
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,159
Alex always wrecks it.

285
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:05,928
Make this door an exit.

286
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,635
We're free.

287
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:18,038
We gotta get back at her with something
that we know she hates. Something...

288
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:19,406
Something bad.

289
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,341
Silent movies!

290
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,110
Or books! Yeah! She hates books.

291
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:26,545
We can just get a bunch of
books and throw them at her.

292
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,247
Ooh, hardcover.

293
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:41,057
Payback time.

294
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,957
Yes, it is.

295
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:46,058
Alex, you're about to star
in your own silent film.

296
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,493
Take away color and sound,

297
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,294
this is where revenge is found.

298
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:38,923
That was awful.

299
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:41,491
I'm gonna go lie down.

300
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:44,327
I'm exhausted from all that
running and overacting.

301
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,503
Listen, Harper.

302
00:19:54,537 --> 00:19:57,238
I had a good time at the
silent movie festival with you.

303
00:19:57,273 --> 00:20:00,809
And just because the festival is over,
it doesn't mean you and I can't...

304
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:03,010
You know, go catch a
flick once in awhile.

305
00:20:03,044 --> 00:20:05,779
Oh, Justin. That'd be great.

306
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:08,014
There's a festival
coming up in Florida.

307
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:10,416
I can ask my mom if we can borrow her car.
And even if she says no,

308
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:13,519
I'm willing to go on the run with you
despite the trouble it will bring me.

309
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:16,355
Whoa... Harper.

310
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:18,556
Right. I'll try and control myself.

311
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,591
I'm probably more fun that way.

312
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:23,026
Little bit.

313
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,746
Dad, I can't help
you this afternoon.

314
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,614
Because I quit.

315
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:48,882
What? Why?

316
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,317
Are you in a play?

317
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:55,086
No, look. I just wanted to raise enough
money so I can go to flight school,

318
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,622
but they told me when I got down there,
that it was gonna be 5,000 dollars.

319
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:02,425
So I bought this suit instead.

320
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:09,465
But you can't quit. I need you. Your mom is
on the ropes. She is gonna crack.

321
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:14,836
No, she's not. I've been doing
her job for her. She paid me.

322
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,070
I should've known.

323
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:23,108
So, you've been paying Max to
do your work for you? Ha ha!

324
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:25,377
I win.

325
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:27,778
But Dad, you've
also been paying me.

326
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,348
So you've been taking advantage
of our son for your own benefit?

327
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:35,418
What kind of irresponsible
parent does that?

328
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:37,719
Or lets him dress
up like a doorman.

329
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:40,154
I'm a pilot.

330
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:45,724
You know, you guys need to realize
that both of your jobs are hard. OK?

331
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,826
You should really
appreciate each other more.

332
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:52,163
Now, if you'll excuse me.

333
00:21:52,198 --> 00:21:55,036
I need to go practice
my pilot talk.

334
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:01,512
Flight attendants, please
prepare the cabin for take off.

335
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:03,915
Bing-bong.

336
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:22,568
What can I get for you?
