1
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:13,989
That last multiple-choice question
was really hard.

2
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,433
- I got A.
- I got D.

3
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:16,783
And I'm pretty sure I'm right.

4
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:19,191
D wasn't even close.
Why are you so sure you're right?

5
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:21,831
No, I got a D on the test.
I'm sure I'm right about that.

6
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,113
Oh, look.

7
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:27,356
Gigi's handing out invitations
to her annual tea.

8
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,472
I'm so glad we're not invited,
because then we'd have to talk like this:

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,319
Hello, Mumsy. Hello, Popsy.

10
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:35,559
Isn't this a lovely tea?
Do you think my pinkie's high enough?

11
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:39,238
No, higher, like this,
because if you're going to a fancy tea,

12
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:42,482
you need to act
like you've smelt something terrible.

13
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:45,523
Good afternoon, Alex, Harper.

14
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,559
How is this lovely day
treating you so far?

15
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:51,361
What happened to your faces?
Apply your makeup with a hammer?

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,245
That is really funny, Alex, but incorrect.

17
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:00,762
What you see is the result of a method
where they inject stuff into your forehead.

18
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:04,044
Then, in a few days,
it falls down into your cheekbones.

19
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,684
Wait a minute, timeout.
Why aren't you fighting back?

20
00:01:06,814 --> 00:01:09,648
We just bagged on your faces,
which should be in a bag.

21
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:14,487
See? I did it again.
Why aren't you insulting me?

22
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,051
Remember? We don't like each other.

23
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:18,454
Oh, but that was back
when we were young and foolish.

24
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,457
- That was yesterday.
- My point exactly.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,491
That's why I'm inviting you
to my tea this weekend.

26
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,533
Your tea? I've always wanted to go.

27
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:28,176
Thanks, Gigi, this is great.

28
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:29,816
What?

29
00:01:29,943 --> 00:01:31,297
Well, I hope you guys can make it.

30
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,814
Come, girls. Let's go make fun
of Eddie till he cries.

31
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:37,656
Alex, I've always wanted
to go to a high tea.

32
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:40,825
- I love the idea of eating tiny sandwiches.
- You're serious?

33
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:44,021
I don't mean to sound unsupportive,
but are you out of your mind, woman?

34
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:46,459
Gigi has terrorised us
since we were in kindergarten.

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,785
Well, I think Gigi's taking the high road.

36
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:52,142
And I wanna reach out to her.

37
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,468
And if you wanna be a negative Nellie,
then go ahead.

38
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:58,189
The only Nellie I know is Nellie Rodriguez,
and she's a very positive, upbeat person.

39
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:00,387
Hi, Nellie. You going to Gigi's tea?

40
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:03,633
Yeah. I can't wait.
It's gonna be so much fun.

41
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,827
So, what are you gonna wear?

42
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:09,275
There's nothing worse
than a positive Nellie.

43
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:09,698
I can't believe you won't let me go
into the lair. You're bunk.

44
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,779
I'm not the one
who said you can't go in the lair.

45
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:13,622
Dad said no one can
while he's out of town.

46
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:14,813
Call me bunk.

47
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,344
Then how am I supposed to study

48
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:19,856
these new pocket spell books that Dad's
gonna quiz us on when he gets home?

49
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:22,296
You'll study like you do
for regular school.

50
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,584
You'll sit here and do your work,
and I'll do mine.

51
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:28,300
With your dad gone for the weekend,
I promised I'd do the bank deposit.

52
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,506
I can't believe Dad's making us
memorise 20 spells.

53
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,583
It's like he's gone, but he's not gone.

54
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:37,552
Can you at least stop shaking your leg?
I'm trying to concentrate.

55
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:40,588
Shaking my leg is how I concentrate.

56
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:46,507
- Cut it out.
- That's how I concentrate.

57
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:48,946
Guys, please.
I'm trying to do this deposit.

58
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:51,512
I know. Isn't Max so annoying?

59
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:53,277
You're the one who flicked my ear.

60
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,311
Oh, you mean like this?

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,199
Okay, that's it. That's it.

62
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,596
Come on. You guys
are gonna study your magic in the lair.

63
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,121
Come on.

64
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,881
See? We can't even get in if we want.

65
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:08,916
Dad put a lock on it.
There's probably some kind

66
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:12,277
of complicated magical spell on the lock
that we'll never be able to break.

67
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:15,126
Or a giant key
hanging on a hook right here.

68
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:19,928
I thought that was a decoration.

69
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,847
Come on. Get in the lair.

70
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,327
And don't tell your dad I let you in there.

71
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,132
You know what today is a great day for?

72
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:38,367
Today is a great day
for throwing myself into work.

73
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,613
Take orders
and not talk about my problems.

74
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:42,535
Slice salami
and not talk about my problems.

75
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,133
Be nice to rude customers
and not tell them about my problems.

76
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:48,019
You know me, service with a smile.

77
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:51,654
Oh, honey, you sound like you
wanna talk about your problems.

78
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:54,502
Mom, why are you always
in my business?

79
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:56,583
Okay, fine.

80
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:58,615
All right, I'll tell you.

81
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:00,975
Gigi invited Harper and I to her tea.

82
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:04,064
But Harper's gonna go.
She thinks Gigi's nice all of a sudden.

83
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,655
Well, people change.
Maybe Gigi is nicer.

84
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:10,338
Mom, if I'm gonna tell you about my
problems, you have to agree with them.

85
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:13,902
Okay, okay. Gigi, horrible, mean.

86
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,259
I know. Isn't she?

87
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,949
But Harper doesn't think so.

88
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:19,587
So I guess Harper and I
aren't friends anymore.

89
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:21,351
Oh, don't say that.

90
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:24,352
You and Harper have been friends forever.
And you'll always be friends.

91
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,113
You'll just have your ups
and your downs.

92
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:27,385
Right, like when we were nine

93
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:30,190
and we had the lemonade stand
and Harper kept all the money.

94
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,349
Well, she did do all the work.

95
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:34,036
- Mom.
- Sorry.

96
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:35,353
Sorry.

97
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,832
Where's the spell to get you
to stop shaking your leg?

98
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,199
Wizard mail?

99
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:52,000
You know, we always get wizard mail,
but we've never sent any out.

100
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,682
You're right.

101
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,004
Let's send out some prank mail.

102
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:04,199
Stranded on a deserted island

103
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,767
in the lava sea.

104
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,361
There's a lava sea?

105
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:12,286
I don't know. It's prank mail.

106
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,770
Got it, got it.

107
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,768
Wait. All we have to eat is hot rocks.

108
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:19,765
I like your thinking.

109
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,449
And now

110
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,814
we send out our first piece
of wizard mail.

111
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,536
Cool. Now what?

112
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,779
Now we wait.

113
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:45,142
Oh, now we're having fun, huh?

114
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:48,100
This is awesome.

115
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,462
- Hey.
- Harper.

116
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,388
Hi.

117
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:02,301
Hey, Harper, what's up?

118
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:04,071
Oh, Gigi invited me to a sleepover.

119
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:07,664
She wants me to make snickerdoodles.
The ones with the red-hot candies.

120
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,104
Obviously, she really wants
to be my friend.

121
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,715
It's unbelievable.

122
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:14,397
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
As in, I don't believe it.

123
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,633
I mean, come on.

124
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:18,319
Have you seen anyone finish one
of your spicy snickerdoodles?

125
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,191
It's Gigi. She doesn't like us.

126
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,635
If she invites you to her party,
it's to put whipped cream

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,195
in your hand while you're sleeping
and then tickle your nose.

128
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,922
I thought you were gonna be supportive.

129
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:32,117
I am. I ate your snickerdoodles
the first time you made them.

130
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,120
What's that?

131
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,919
It's the crown we're gonna present
to the best newcomer at the tea.

132
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,719
- Oh, can I see it?
- Oh, no, no, silly.

133
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,360
It's a surprise.

134
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:42,763
- I can't wait.
- Neither can we.

135
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,405
Something's up.

136
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:53,606
<i>Some people are a gem
Some people are a rat</i>

137
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:57,204
<i>To learn who's who
Give me the ear of a bat</i>

138
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,487
Oh, my gosh. Harper came so close
to seeing the crown.

139
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,731
I wanna see it.

140
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:05,729
Okay.

141
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:11,255
Do you see the L? It stands for loser.

142
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:14,611
And it's gonna look so good on Harper
when she's crowned the biggest loser.

143
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:17,939
Yeah, at our
who-can-bring-the-biggest-loser party.

144
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,542
What does this one smell like?

145
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:33,502
The stuff that grows between your toes,
mixed with a little earwax.

146
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,824
Amazing. You're right.

147
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:37,817
The bottle's back.

148
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,382
What's it say?

149
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:44,384
"We've received your plea for help.

150
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:48,108
Do not move or leave the island.
The hot lava sea will burn you up."

151
00:08:48,714 --> 00:08:50,227
Good to know.

152
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:52,949
"Emergency wizards will arrive
to rescue you soon."

153
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,270
They bought it.

154
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:58,356
"Please use the emergency supplies
to stay alive until we arrive."

155
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:01,232
What? There aren't
any emergency supplies.

156
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,832
They're pranking us back.

157
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,874
"Emergency wizard supplies."

158
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,676
Oh, a life raft.

159
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:13,761
I wonder if it's a magical life raft.

160
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,202
Wow, emergency wizards are coming.
They think we're really in trouble.

161
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:24,358
Max, emergency wizards are coming.
We really are in trouble.

162
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:27,640
Well, maybe there's a chance
they won't find us.

163
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:41,173
What are those gloves for?

164
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:44,731
I'm getting used to them for Gigi's tea.
I need to practise handling things.

165
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:45,925
Why?

166
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,930
That's why.

167
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,209
Aren't you gonna help me?

168
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,377
Why? They're already bruised.

169
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,497
Harper.

170
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:06,502
Maybe you shouldn't go to Gigi's tea.

171
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:09,822
It's really a
who-can-bring-the-biggest-loser contest.

172
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:11,335
Biggest-loser contest?

173
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:14,186
Alex, I can't believe you're making stuff up.
It's just sad.

174
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,424
I'm not making it up. I heard Gigi say it.

175
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,665
Oh, Alex, I know you wanted
to hear that,

176
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:22,385
but we all wanna hear a lot of things
we're never going to hear.

177
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,063
You're never gonna believe me,
are you?

178
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:28,462
Alex, Alex, Alex.

179
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:30,629
Real friends accept each other
branching out.

180
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:33,827
They don't get competitive and jealous
and make up ridiculous stories.

181
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:36,345
So you're going to that tea
no matter what I say?

182
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:37,909
Yes, I am.

183
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:41,067
I can't believe I'm doing this, but

184
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:43,752
- I'm going too.
- Oh, my gosh.

185
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:46,872
Yep, you're my friend, so I have
to be with you through thick and thin.

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,116
And I have a feeling
that this tea is gonna be thick.

187
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,357
Or thin, whichever one is bad.

188
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:54,118
Thank you, Alex.
This is gonna be awesome.

189
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:55,471
We can support each other.

190
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,913
I'll come over four hours before the tea
for a pre-tea tea.

191
00:10:58,044 --> 00:11:00,081
We can get dressed together,
practise our manners...

192
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,598
How about I meet you there?

193
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,047
Hey, Mom. We were just wondering
if maybe we could go to Grandma's.

194
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:17,444
- Why?
- Why?

195
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:20,883
Because we pulled a prank,
and now emergency wizards are after us.

196
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,643
Look, it's not that bad.

197
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:27,653
We just sent a prank message
in a bottle through the wizard mail

198
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:30,290
saying we needed help,
and emergency wizards responded

199
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,567
saying they're coming.

200
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:35,333
Okay, it's bad.

201
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,539
You guys are in an enormous amount
of trouble.

202
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,892
We know, we know. I wish we never
would've asked to go into the lair.

203
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:44,172
And you never would've let us in.

204
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:47,181
Yup. It's really your fault.

205
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,700
Well, maybe we can go stay
at Grandma's.

206
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:01,981
Ladies.

207
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:08,787
Welcome to tea at the Hotel Fleur
du Blahglublahfluflagettyflah.

208
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,187
The Hotel what? How do you spell that?

209
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:13,545
In French.

210
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:16,825
We are proud to present this tea,

211
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:21,393
served to you on the finest china
imported from Japan.

212
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:27,588
Hosted by
young Miss Gigi Hollingsworth.

213
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:32,756
I know you'll act
in the most ladylike fashion.

214
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:38,913
Enjoy your tea here at the Hotel Fleur
du Blahglublahfluflagettyflah.

215
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,598
Remind me to stop at the gift shop

216
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,841
and get a T-shirt
with the hotel's name on it.

217
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,755
Harper, Alex, I'm so glad
you guys could make it.

218
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:49,605
I mean, your attendance
is gonna make this

219
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,161
the most special tea I've ever had.

220
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,598
Well, thanks, Gigi.
I'm so glad you invited me.

221
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,721
Oh, not as glad as I am.

222
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,926
Attention, everyone.

223
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:16,937
Okay, then. Well, now that we've all had
a chance to mingle,

224
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:19,368
I have a huge announcement
I'd like to make.

225
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,898
Let's go look at the ladies' room.

226
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:23,534
I hear it's so fancy,
the toilet's filled with bottled water.

227
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:26,132
Plus the soaps look like little seashells.

228
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,897
Oh, I love those. But I really should stay.

229
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,820
I think Gigi's gonna say
something important.

230
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,013
She usually does.

231
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:36,020
And now it's time
to announce the best newcomer

232
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:37,818
and present her with the special crown.

233
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:40,416
I really think we should go.

234
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:43,585
If we don't go soon, the soaps
will get used and just be soapy lumps.

235
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,781
Look, I don't care
about your soapy lumps.

236
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,225
I can't let this happen.

237
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,583
Truth spell, truth spell.

238
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:59,469
<i>Some are evil, some are kind
But now all must speak their mind</i>

239
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:01,904
If my parents could afford
the same dermatologist as Gigi,

240
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,389
I'd be way prettier than her.

241
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,554
Oh, my gosh. Did I just say that?

242
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,955
After I clean my ears, I look.

243
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,513
What's wrong with me?

244
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,232
Please pick me for best newcomer.

245
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,353
Please, please, oh, pretty please
with a cherry on top.

246
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,359
I hope this isn't one of those loser teas.

247
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:22,481
It'll be the fifth one I've been to this year.

248
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:26,755
Jennifer looks way prettier than me.

249
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,678
I'm gonna talk her into a bad haircut.

250
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:31,116
Hey, Jen,
I'm gonna talk you into a bad haircut.

251
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,358
Why did I just say that?

252
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:39,802
Oh, this is going better than I thought.
Hey, everybody, I'm a wizard.

253
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:51,524
You guys got everything?

254
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:54,724
I called Grandma,
and she's blowing up our mattresses.

255
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:57,566
When your dad gets back,

256
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:00,377
we have to make sure
we have our story straight.

257
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,179
Or we could get our story straight now.

258
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,811
Officer Lamp.

259
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:13,855
This is my partner. He's a goblin.

260
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:16,542
- I have a name.
- Yeah.

261
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:19,463
But nobody can pronounce that.

262
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:21,825
We're emergency wizards.

263
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:24,063
I have a report here
of someone using the wizard mail

264
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:25,667
to request emergency services

265
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:29,623
when, in fact,
no services were required.

266
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,709
Yeah, they pranked us.

267
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,942
- That's what I just said.
- But you took too long, you know?

268
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:41,992
- We're just an ordinary family enjoying...
- You guys are in the wrong place, right?

269
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,708
This is the Russo family
of Waverly Place, New York, New York?

270
00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:51,593
Home to wizards-in-training Justin,
Alex and Max?

271
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,110
These are not the droids
you're looking for.

272
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,589
What are you doing?

273
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,998
Nothing. I figured I'd give it a shot.

274
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:03,921
Okay, I see.

275
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:06,160
Was that short enough for you?

276
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,799
Oh, now we're doing short jokes?

277
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:12,445
Guys, so I guess we're cool, then?

278
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,797
Yeah, we're cool.

279
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:17,482
Just after we ask you a few questions.

280
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,884
Individually.

281
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:29,284
Did you just say you're a wizard?

282
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:34,009
I wanna say no,
but yes, I did say I was a wizard.

283
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:35,614
You think you're a wizard?

284
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:38,052
Yeah, but everybody's saying
crazy stuff right now.

285
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:40,168
I want Gigi to say some stuff to you now.

286
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:44,617
The truth is, I hate wearing this dress.

287
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:46,772
You wanna know what I wanna do?

288
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,211
- I wanna break this.
- Do it.

289
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,299
That felt good.

290
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:57,371
You know what I've always
really wanted to do?

291
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,820
This.

292
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,216
Great idea, Gigi. That looks like fun.

293
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:13,222
Stop. Stop.

294
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,030
All I wanted is a tea
with sandwiches and gloves

295
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:19,110
and small talk that no one would
remember when they got home.

296
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,466
That isn't what this tea's about.

297
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:23,949
I know you won't believe me,
but you're gonna believe Gigi.

298
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:27,067
- Gigi.
- Ladies, ladies.

299
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:29,664
Finally, someone to restore order.

300
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:30,945
No.

301
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:34,309
Here's something
I've always wanted to do.

302
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:46,960
How you doing today, Max?

303
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,675
I'm fine, thanks.

304
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,362
Is it okay if I call you Maxy?

305
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:54,000
I got a note here that says
they sometimes call you Maxy.

306
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:56,599
Yeah, Maxy's cool.

307
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:59,322
I'm trying out Maximillions, though.
See if it catches on.

308
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:02,486
- That's great, Maxy.
- I guess it's not catching on.

309
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:05,247
Are those shoes new?

310
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,845
No. You sure you don't want
to try out Maximillions?

311
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,239
I'm done with him, Goblin.

312
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:11,642
Get him out of here.

313
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:15,171
So, Justin,

314
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,365
word on the street is that
you're the best student,

315
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:20,294
regular and wizard school.

316
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,934
I do okay.

317
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:28,814
I guess that means
you're smart enough to realise

318
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:32,171
that Maxy, cute kid,
told us the whole story.

319
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,212
And if your story
doesn't exactly match his,

320
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,374
well, we're gonna have a problem.

321
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:44,218
I don't know what you're talking about.

322
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:46,782
We didn't do anything.

323
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,305
Get out of here.

324
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,782
I'll go when I'm ready.

325
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,429
Theresa Russo. Mortal.

326
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,747
Married to former wizard Jerry Russo.

327
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:04,909
Yeah, you have a couple of nice kids.

328
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,468
We did it. I mean, they did it, but...

329
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:10,473
I let them into the lair,
so I guess we did it.

330
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,867
We? I? Who was it, lady?

331
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:16,558
It was me, but they drove me to it.

332
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:20,069
There was leg-shaking and ear-flicking,
and I had to do the bank deposit.

333
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:23,431
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to run a business from your home?

334
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:26,679
Tell you what we're gonna do.

335
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:28,400
You're gonna let me off with a warning,

336
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:31,276
because I'm not a wizard,
and I didn't know any better.

337
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:33,639
What, are you living in a fantasy world?

338
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:37,876
I feel so free.

339
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:42,678
I hate the Hotel Fleur
du Blahglublahfluflagettyflah.

340
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,403
Stop it. You have no manners.

341
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,967
I know this isn't going the way you
want it to, but this is what had to happen.

342
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:55,405
Gigi, why don't you tell everybody the real
reason why you had this stupid tea?

343
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:56,682
Okay, that's easy.

344
00:19:56,813 --> 00:20:00,490
The truth is that this tea is really a contest
to see who can bring the biggest loser.

345
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:03,887
And I brought Harper.
She was just about to be crowned winner.

346
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:05,655
You think I'm the biggest loser?

347
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:09,816
So all the sleepovers
and the snickerdoodles, that was a lie?

348
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:13,410
Yeah. We were trying to string you along
and get you to come to this loser tea.

349
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:19,094
And you didn't come for the tea.
You came to protect me.

350
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:21,374
I'll always protect you. It's what we do.

351
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:23,782
You know, it's funny.

352
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:26,703
You brought Nellie
when Nellie really should've brought you.

353
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:31,219
See that? Gigi thinks you're a bigger loser,
and you're supposedly her friend.

354
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:33,702
Oh, you think I'm a loser?

355
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:35,460
Well, this is what I think of you.

356
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:41,264
Now, what do you wanna do
with that cake?

357
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,270
I wanna eat it.

358
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:48,191
Okay. What's the second thing
you wanna do with that cake?

359
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:51,384
Throw it at Gigi.

360
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:02,474
I don't like Gigi either.

361
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,112
Here.

362
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,638
I think that it's time that Gigi gets a taste

363
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:10,071
of what she's been dishing out
to all of us for years.

364
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,715
No, no.

365
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,355
Oh, stop, everybody.

366
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,362
Stop. I honestly think
I may have gone too far.

367
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:22,924
You think?

368
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:26,397
But I know someone who hasn't.

369
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:28,121
Harper.

370
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,408
You want me to wear the loser crown?

371
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,600
- Well, okay.
- No.

372
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:37,326
Oh, okay.

373
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:45,010
Well, it's not exactly the tea I imagined,
but I'll never forget it.

374
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:46,569
- Let's go home.
- Not yet.

375
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,848
There's something I saw
that I kind of wanna do before we leave.

376
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:55,576
You guys know you have to clean
all this up, right?

377
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:56,769
We kind of figured.

378
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,697
And pay for everything you broke.

379
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:01,700
That's fair.
Can we do two more swings?

380
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:03,536
Sure.

381
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:14,296
How is washing their laundry
community service?

382
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:17,980
We're part of the community,
aren't we?

383
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:21,505
Oh, that's bunk.

384
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:24,019
Hey, careful with that. That's my wife's.

385
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,709
Oh, it's lovely.

386
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:29,302
She must be very handy.
