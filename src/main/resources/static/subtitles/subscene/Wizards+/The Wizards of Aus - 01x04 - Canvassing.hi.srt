1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:05,086
(mystical music)

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,158
- Excuse me, Deciding Hat.

3
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:21,936
- Hat of Deciding, actually.

4
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:24,624
- Cool. So, you're a sort
of hat who decides things.

5
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,633
How's it going?

6
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:26,965
- Better than this wine.

7
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:28,664
It's a terrible vintage.

8
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:31,312
And I don't know why I had
them heat it up for me.

9
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:33,272
It's piping hot.

10
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:34,921
What is this serving glass?

11
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:36,244
A goblet of fire.

12
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,499
(laughs)

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,838
- Cool.

14
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,280
So, I'm here today to kind of talk

15
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,193
about a few complaints, I guess,

16
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:45,710
from the student body.

17
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:48,255
They're a little worried
that their entire futures

18
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,789
hinge on the whims of a hat.

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,495
No disrespect.

20
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:54,188
- Who would they prefer decide their fate?

21
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,667
A Christmas stocking?

22
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:58,279
- No, because that's dumb.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,936
- Make is quick, boy.

24
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:02,060
I'm beginning to decide that I'm bored.

25
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,675
And this hot wine isn't helping at all.

26
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:06,950
- I just feel as though we're maybe

27
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:10,641
fostering a lack of diversity
amongst the school houses.

28
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:12,672
Possibly based on a personal prejudice.

29
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,553
- Prejudice?

30
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:14,844
I'm not prejudice.

31
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:17,840
I'm a hat of deciding, no less.

32
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:20,041
And I've decided that
I've had quite enough

33
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:21,495
of your nonsense, boy.

34
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:22,856
Now run along and heat me up

35
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:24,745
some more of this terrible wine.

36
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:26,231
- No, we are far from done.

37
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:28,935
Okay. You see, all the
kids with heroic qualities

38
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,548
you've put them all into Hero House,

39
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,846
which is great for them.

40
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:33,580
No complaints from Hero House.

41
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,627
You're kind of screwing
over everyone else, right?

42
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,107
I mean, you take all the nerds
put them into Nerdling House.

43
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:39,780
You pull all the morons
into Dumb Dumb House,

44
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:40,881
which helps nobody.

45
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:41,915
You take all the ugly kids,

46
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,470
put them into Ooglo Booglo House.

47
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,981
And don't think I haven't
noticed you put all the

48
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:47,381
big chested girls into
Fun Bag Tittie House.

49
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:48,995
- What can I say?

50
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:51,446
The hat wants what the hat wants.

51
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:54,075
- And that's not even getting
started on Evil House.

52
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:56,059
- Well, you don't want all the bad apples

53
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,346
poisoning the rest of the barrel, do you?

54
00:01:58,347 --> 00:01:59,397
- No, I agree.

55
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:01,068
But you don't want them
scheming off together

56
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,260
in a little dungeon.

57
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:03,766
Perhaps, if you took the bad kids,

58
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:05,003
put them with the good kids,

59
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,334
then some of those good qualities

60
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,156
would trickle over on the bad kids.

61
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:11,246
I mean, to that point, why
do we even have a house

62
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,493
commemorating who is
essentially our Hitler.

63
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:15,971
Maybe, just maybe, if we took those kids

64
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:17,132
and didn't tell them,

65
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,931
"Hey, day one, you're in Hitler House.

66
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,671
"Good luck, Matey Potatey,"

67
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:23,013
we'd have a few less dark
wizards on our hands.

68
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:25,375
- I'll be cockhead (inaudible).

69
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:26,826
- It's a self fulfilling prophecy.

70
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:29,556
- Have at thee!

71
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:32,907
Oh, look. I'm about to
decide where you should go.

72
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:37,239
Hm, interesting. I've decided
that you're a big gay.

73
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,654
So, it's off to Poofter House with you.

74
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:41,086
It's been decided.

75
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,242
Poofter House for the bloody poofter.

76
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:45,562
- Hey, not cool you fucking homophobe.

77
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:48,384
- Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't
hear you defending minorities

78
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,073
over all of these gay thoughts of yours.

79
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:52,268
How gay.

80
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:53,626
- (laughs) Gay.

81
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,627
(screams)

82
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,003
(bottle clanking)

83
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,765
- Good day, mate. What do you know.

84
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:49,306
♫ Senator Geoff Quinn, you're
as income as they come ♫

85
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:49,992
- Oh, yeah.

86
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:52,032
♫ Like bringing home the ashes

87
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,404
♫ and push tuckering your time ♫

88
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:54,264
- See that?

89
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:55,412
Heart on my sleeve.

90
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:57,930
♫ You're gonna win, Geoff Quinn ♫

91
00:03:57,931 --> 00:03:59,205
- I'm Senator Geoff Quinn.

92
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,102
Are you like me?

93
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:02,398
Are you fed up with
feeling scared, fearful,

94
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,353
in your own home?

95
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,918
I don't want to be scared
in my home anymore.

96
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,638
- Good on you.

97
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,741
- We are being influxed and used,

98
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,192
fluttered with a mass immigration

99
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:12,280
of people who come from a
deeply inappropriate culture.

100
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,353
Like the wizards sitting around their bums

101
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,886
changing the very fabric
of the universe on a whim.

102
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:19,672
And they don't say anything,
these polly waffle bastards.

103
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,333
They're not prepared to speak the truth.

104
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,121
That's my problem. If
anything I'm too open,

105
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:24,398
I'm too direct, I'm too honest.

106
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,499
Kangaroo. Wallaby.

107
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,032
We feel the same thing, don't we?

108
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,135
Bilby.

109
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:29,913
Of course we do.

110
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:31,794
Beaconsfield miners.

111
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:34,173
Now, look, I'm not saying that
all wizards are terrorists,

112
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,047
but every terrorist seems to be a wizard,

113
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,347
isn't that the case? Crikey!

114
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:39,026
♫ We'll make those mongrels flee,

115
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:41,592
♫ like we did at Gallipoli ♫

116
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:44,703
♫ You're gonna win, Geoff Quinn ♫

117
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:45,719
- I'm a parrot.

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,060
I love my kids,

119
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:48,766
and I'm looking forward
to having grand kids,

120
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,533
but I tell you what,

121
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:53,191
I do not want to have a baby bones.

122
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,595
Get rid of that.

123
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:55,951
It's disgusting.

124
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:57,073
Crikey!

125
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:58,157
I'm a fish and chips shop owner

126
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:00,136
and thank you for your patronage.

127
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:02,128
I still have nightmares of that.

128
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,426
Fishy Thursday.

129
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,665
Bloody Gandalf the Grey,

130
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,821
why not Gandalf the Green and Gold,

131
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,003
you terrorist mong.

132
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,981
Uluru!

133
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:13,811
♫ It's a bloody beauty ♫

134
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:14,993
- We're gonna do the right thing

135
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:16,968
by our people at the ballot box.

136
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:18,373
♫ Who dares wins ♫

137
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:19,602
- Come on, let's do it!

138
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:21,577
We can work together.

139
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:23,352
We can stop the cloaks.

140
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:26,390
♫ You're gonna win, Geoff Quinn ♫

141
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:32,719
- You're a bloody bones
of bloke, the tripe B.

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,904
- Love your work, mate.

143
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:35,665
- You're bloody welcome.

144
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,996
- Great song, mate.

145
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:39,094
- It's disgusting.

146
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,362
I can't believe he's
getting so much traction.

147
00:05:41,363 --> 00:05:42,186
- Worse that he's right.

148
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:44,463
It's a great song.

149
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:45,420
This day couldn't get worse.

150
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:47,289
First dad goes missing and now this.

151
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,700
He's right about us as well.

152
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:51,112
A couple of dark wizards really
take advantage of the chaos,

153
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:54,152
and they fuck it up for the rest of us.

154
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,615
I'm not going home, I can't.

155
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:57,099
- The stories about wizards fitting in

156
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,024
just fine don't sell newspapers, Jack.

157
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,961
But you do have options.

158
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:03,281
Have you thought about
starting a petition,

159
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:05,451
or you can canvas your local area.

160
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,904
- I'll never have the reach that he has.

161
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:09,177
He's already got the public in his pocket.

162
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:12,090
- Well, maybe it isn't the
public you should be talking to.

163
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,229
(knocks)

164
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,430
- Hello sir, madam, Greek Grell, or other,

165
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,325
my name is Jack.

166
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:28,414
I am from the wizard realm, just like you,

167
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,665
but much prefer living here in Melbourne.

168
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,480
To better integrate
into Australian society,

169
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:34,762
maybe there are some ways

170
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:37,968
that we can all tone it
down a bit, blend in better.

171
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,848
Do you think there's anything you could do

172
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,815
to be making yourself a
little less conspicuous?

173
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,510
- You know, I've never
really thought about it.

174
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,910
I guess I could stop
wearing this leather jacket.

175
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,195
It is a little threatening.

176
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:57,322
- Yeah, or, you know, you do
live next to a petrol refinery.

177
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:58,882
(sirens wail)

178
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:01,524
Don't you think your neighbors
might be a little anxious

179
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:05,240
living next door to somebody who,

180
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,278
you know?

181
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,426
- Frequently barbeques?

182
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:08,955
- Maybe.

183
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,455
- Because I'm not gonna stop barbequing.

184
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:13,102
I'll have you know my
neighbors love my lamb cutlets.

185
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:14,643
- Your skull is on fire!

186
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:15,656
It's the peak of summer.

187
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:17,327
It is an arid farm land,

188
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:18,813
and you're a fucking ghost rider.

189
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,521
- Ghost writer, actually.

190
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:22,339
- What?

191
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,521
- I earn my bread writing biographies

192
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:26,032
for the rich and famous.

193
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,469
Why, I've just finished a memoir for

194
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,865
a very influential local
chef, Curtis Stone.

195
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,217
Mayhap you've heard of him.

196
00:07:37,838 --> 00:07:39,654
Here I'll sign you a copy.

197
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,020
- Give me Harry Potters,
give me Harold Holt.

198
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,586
Give me Harold Holt back.

199
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:53,953
He'd be 98 now.

200
00:07:53,954 --> 00:07:54,954
(knocks)

201
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:58,653
- Hello sir, madam, or other,

202
00:07:58,654 --> 00:07:59,801
I am Jack.

203
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:00,802
- No.

204
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,735
- Oh, I haven't said anything yet.

205
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:07,906
- Bron know this land doesn't
deal with spellcasters.

206
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:10,015
- Well, good thing I'm
not here to play cards

207
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:12,325
because deal, poker.

208
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,599
Poker? Hardly knew her.

209
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,232
- You have the bearing of a man

210
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:20,659
with so much fire without flint or tinder.

211
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,525
- Well, that's a cool way to put it.

212
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:24,361
Yes, I am slash was,

213
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:26,801
but technically still am
a wizard, nonpracticing.

214
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:29,447
- You take a long time to
say nothing, Jack Stormcrow.

215
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:32,257
- You take a long time to
say nothing, Jack Stormcrow.

216
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:34,529
A barbarian does not take kindly to a man

217
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,758
who must cheat the elements for valor.

218
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,079
A true measure of a man is in the amount

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,411
of lives you can take before
his is taken from him.

220
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:46,057
I'm yet to meet the man, woman, or beast

221
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,440
worthy of sending me to the sleep eternal.

222
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:54,441
My body provided feast for crow and worm.

223
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:57,778
- Isn't that a little bleak?

224
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,486
- That is the way of things.

225
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:01,923
- Okay, well, in Melbourne

226
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:03,466
we have these things called laws.

227
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,764
- Bronlo abides only by the code.

228
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:09,573
Hard laws of steel and conquest.

229
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:11,826
- And what do those laws allow?

230
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:13,769
- Rape, pillage, murder.

231
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,465
- Well, all three of those are terrible,

232
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:19,383
and the opposite of laws.

233
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,612
What is against the laws of barbarians?

234
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:22,763
(yells)

235
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:26,962
- Okay, well. If that
was a gift, thank you.

236
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,376
If it was not, ow.

237
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:31,550
- I grow weary of your blathering talk.

238
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,432
By the iron of Crom!

239
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:43,776
- [Dying Person] Help me.

240
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:46,195
- I don't think this was his house.

241
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:48,498
- [Dying Person] Help.

242
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:50,607
- Ernie bloody dingo.

243
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:51,652
(knocks)

244
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,927
- Good day, mate.

245
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:59,853
- I spy with my giant eye.

246
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,017
- Cool.

247
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,611
- Holland Hanson.

248
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,516
Hanson.

249
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:23,364
Handsome.

250
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:24,984
She's a handsome woman.

251
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,453
- So, maybe stop turning
art critics into stone

252
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:30,964
and selling them as sculptures.

253
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:34,653
- [Medusa] You just
don't understand my work.

254
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:50,142
- Would you like to sample
some champagne, sir?

255
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:53,272
- [Jack's Dad] What beautiful flesh tones.

256
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:55,392
- Oh, no thanks. I only drink bugs?

257
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:58,896
- That's cool.

258
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,197
- And if you just turn your attention away

259
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:05,168
from this lovely lady,

260
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,955
you'll see another fine piece of work.

261
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:10,010
This is a piece I call,

262
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,738
"Disappointment of a Son."

263
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,956
- Hey, dad, you could've told me

264
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,708
that this is where you wandered off to.

265
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,518
Trying to lay low, so, maybe just go home.

266
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,478
Stop pretending like you know about art.

267
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,033
- I am art.

268
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:26,237
Fine art, if I do say so myself.

269
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:27,595
And I do.

270
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:28,953
I'm even in a gallery.

271
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,786
- Okay. Well, at least get
away from the nakedness.

272
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:33,876
It's embarrassing me in
front of Medusa, man.

273
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:35,185
And she's cool.

274
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,709
- Where do you want me to stand.

275
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,552
Next to that giant bowl of fruit?

276
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:42,329
Or the surrealist section?

277
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,535
I don't like that.

278
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,075
It's weird.

279
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,945
The staircase is confusing.

280
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,375
The clocks are all slippery,

281
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:51,769
and the women's face is
all in the wrong spot.

282
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,169
I shant be returning.

283
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,177
It's gross.

284
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:54,994
- I'll get the turps, dad.

285
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:56,303
Don't think that I won't.

286
00:11:56,304 --> 00:11:57,558
- You'll never catch me.

287
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,997
I'll hide in the Where's Wally.

288
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:02,967
- Where's Wally already has
a wizard, and he's the worst.

289
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,871
- Excuse me, sir, but
there's no longer any need

290
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,820
to yell at the art.

291
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:16,853
- What did I just say?

292
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,222
- [Medusa] Facist.

293
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:22,665
- Mel Gibson.

294
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,758
I didn't like his early stuff,
but I like his opinions.
