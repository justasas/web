1
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:04,986
Since mom is out of town,
wizard class is cancelled.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,054
Yes!

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:10,390
What does Mom being away have to
do with class being cancelled?

4
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:13,246
I said Mom's away.
We can have some fun.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,493
- Yes!
- Yeah!

6
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:19,539
Hey, what's really fun is
when you give me my allowance.

7
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:22,935
First we're gonna play something
I like to call Spell Roulette.

8
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:25,428
Here's the book of spells.

9
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:27,766
Each of you randomly points to one,

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,004
recites it and then
we see what happens.

11
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:34,503
- I'll go first.
- OK.

12
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:41,679
Defleppard, Animalus.

13
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,175
Now, this is Undo Dust.

14
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:53,743
It undoes a spell when a wizard
forgets how to reverse it.

15
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:56,914
What kind of wizard, Alex,
would be so ill-prepared, Alex,

16
00:00:56,948 --> 00:00:59,550
where they would forget
a reverse spell, Alex?

17
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:05,420
What kind of jerk, Justin...
I'm good with just saying that.

18
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:08,224
All right.

19
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,795
OK, Alex, you're up.

20
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:17,866
There you go.

21
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:24,605
No, you can't just change it.

22
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:27,773
- Yeah, no, it's not...
- She doesn't do the rules.

23
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,975
Ooh! I like this one.
Rain on, chain on.

24
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,381
Nice. And with that,
I'll be out spending my allowance.

25
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,750
Sorry, Alex. I don't
have any cash on me.

26
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:43,219
Guess you should've thought
your little plan through

27
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,786
a little more carefully.

28
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,954
Oh, I did.

29
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:50,458
What? I'm part of your plan?
No! That's...

30
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:53,827
Um, Dad, you owe Justin $25.

31
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:57,398
Huh? Wait. Alex,
come back here! Come on!

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,065
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

33
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,967
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

34
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,168
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

35
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:06,801
* Yes, please *

36
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,637
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

37
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:10,271
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

38
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,774
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

39
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:14,608
* That's what I said *

40
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:17,711
* Everything is not what it seems *

41
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:21,582
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

42
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:25,153
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

43
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:30,022
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

44
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:33,158
* Everything is not what it seems *

45
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:36,962
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

46
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:40,797
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

47
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:44,667
* Because everything is not *

48
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,236
* What it seems *

49
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:52,237

50
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,776
Wow. Alex, I really like
what you've done here.

51
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,846
It's a very dramatic blend
of color and circles.

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,415
Really? 'Cause I was
just painting this.

53
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:09,054
Nice. Hey, everybody,
take a look at Alex's piece.

54
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,591
Some of us are over-thinking
our projects a little too much

55
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:17,027
and we could all follow Alex's
lead and be more spontaneous.

56
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:19,796
I'll show you spontaneous.

57
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:24,967
Let's skip this class and do
something more interesting,

58
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,901
like watching the football
team learn how to read.

59
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:31,036
OK, good work, everybody.

60
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:35,907
And, T.J., how about for
your next assignment

61
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:39,911
you draw yourself a detention
slip and I'll sign it?

62
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:47,383
And that is why you are
my favorite teacher.

63
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:49,785
And do you know why you're
my favorite student?

64
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,888
Because you'll hang back
after class and clean up.

65
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,190
Oh, I see what you did there.

66
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:58,858
I don't like it, but I respect it.

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,135
Clean it up. Wash it,
scrub it down, oh, no.

68
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:20,391
What did you just do?

69
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:24,593
that was fast.
That was almost instantaneous.

70
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:32,097
That's because I clean
things competitively?

71
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:36,779
And I am a champion
competitive cleaner.

72
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:39,768
It was a really good class today.
You were great. OK, bye!

73
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:45,086
Justin, I need you to
sign something for me.

74
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:51,795
"Dear Coach Gunderson.
Please excuse Max from P.E."

75
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:54,455
"He has mono-orangosis."

76
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:57,010
I've never even heard
of mono-orangosis.

77
00:04:57,045 --> 00:05:00,629
Yeah, well, that's because it's
a very rare color blindness.

78
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:05,516
- Oh, really?
- I can't see anything orange.

79
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,105
I can't taste orange.
I can't even hear orange.

80
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,058
In fact, I didn't hear
half of what I just said.

81
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,580
Sure you don't wanna go with
something more realistic,

82
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,706
like I'm-a-dumbadosis?

83
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,832
- Oh.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:22,222
That's a really nice way to
talk to somebody with a disease!

85
00:05:24,316 --> 00:05:26,475
You have a disease?

86
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,931
Why, yes, I do.

87
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,914
- It's mono-orangosis.
- Oh, you poor baby.

88
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:36,870
- You know, I've heard of that.
- You have?

89
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:41,322
Well, that is kind of
impossible, but great.

90
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:50,751
You're not gonna believe what
I set up for the sleep-over.

91
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:53,807
We're gonna make our own purses!

92
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:57,893
We can sew on the buttons,
appliquÃ©s, ribbons.

93
00:05:57,927 --> 00:06:00,021
Oh, Harper, this is
gonna be so much fun.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,933
Oh, I just love our
slumber parties.

95
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,025
Oh, me, too.

96
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:14,403
Wouldn't that be awesome if that
was the pizza we forgot to order?

97
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:21,879
You're a wizard.

98
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:26,197
I've been thinking about how you
cleaned up in class so fast,

99
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,587
and there's only one explanation.

100
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,746
You are a wizard.

101
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:34,565
No, I'm not. Harper, am I a wizard?

102
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,825
Alex? A wizard?

103
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,542
Please. It's not like she's
got a magic flying carpet

104
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,868
or can duplicate herself
or knows a spell to make

105
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:48,020
a klutzy person not klutzy when
they work at their sandwich shop.

106
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,113
If she was a wizard,
she could do those things,

107
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:54,265
but she doesn't, so she isn't.

108
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:01,239
Alex, please. I know that T.J.
from class is a wizard, too.

109
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:04,496
- T.J.'s a wizard?
- Yes, T.J.'s a wizard.

110
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,518
What other secrets
haven't you told me?

111
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:10,207
Um, I'm not gonna make a purse.

112
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,989
Alex, I need your help.

113
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,975
OK, I'm not saying I'm a wizard,

114
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,902
but what kind of help
are we talking about?

115
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,961
T.J. and I dated over the summer.

116
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:25,188
Ewww!

117
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:27,449
It didn't end well

118
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:30,272
and he turned me
into the worst thing

119
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,331
that he could think of.

120
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:34,457
A 40-year-old woman.

121
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:36,384
No!

122
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,495
I was a 16-year-old girl.

123
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,821
Prove it.

124
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:45,814
I can text 50 words a
minute without looking.

125
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,873
I eat strawberry lip
gloss like it's candy.

126
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,434
If I could dress like I was
going to the beach all the time,

127
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:51,497
I would.

128
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:56,179
Sounds more like a 14-year-old girl,
if you ask me.

129
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:59,469
Alex, if you could
turn me back to 16,

130
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:01,329
I would be your best friend.

131
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:05,978
Uh-huh! Sorry, woman.
That position is filled.

132
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,398
- I'm just saying.
- OK. Shh.

133
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,458
Um, OK.

134
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:17,558
There's only one way to find out
if you were a 16-year-old girl.

135
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:21,624
I'm not saying I'm a wizard,
but I'll go get the Undo Dust,

136
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:25,627
which undoes spells,
if there were such thing as spells.

137
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:32,633
- And he's out of the chute.
- Oh, oh. Ah-ha-ha!

138
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:36,269
What'd I tell you? Looks like
we got another Cat Man Don't!

139
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,938
Ride him! You gotta
just get in there.

140
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,840
Hold onto him. Wow!

141
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:44,909
Ya-hoo! Come on.

142
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,811
All right, Miss Majorhealey.

143
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:51,014
When we sprinkle the dust,
we'll find out if you really are 16.

144
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:58,720
Dang! She's cute.

145
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:03,558
Check me out!

146
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,927
I'm back! I'm back!

147
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,396
Whoo-hoo!

148
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:15,467
Do you have any "shut
your piehole" dust?

149
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:17,869
Well, she's happy.

150
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:21,271
Hey, you have to promise not to
tell anybody I'm a wizard, OK?

151
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:25,742
Oh, yeah, sure. Whatever.
'Cause you did it!

152
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:27,377
Look at me! I'm back!

153
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:40,153
I think I know why T.
J. broke up with her.

154
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:44,257
So, T.J., heard a rumor about
you and Miss Majorhealey.

155
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,360
Well, I'm not a fan,
but it's no rumor.

156
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:49,563
I know you turned her
into a 40-year-old woman,

157
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:51,165
so I turned her back.

158
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,769
You what?! That is so not cool, Alex.
Not cool at all.

159
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,772
And what happened between me and
Jenny is none of your business.

160
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,541
Besides, have you heard her squeak?

161
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:04,911
OK, she's a bit of a squeaker,

162
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:07,080
but what you did to
her is still wrong.

163
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,816
It's wizards like you who are
almost gonna get us exposed.

164
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,852
Alex, you've got a mouth on you.

165
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:16,087
I was wondering if you
would help spread word

166
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:17,854
that art class is cancelled.

167
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,322
What? Why?

168
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:23,291
Miss Majorhealey texted
in her resignation.

169
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:28,864
Which is strange, 'cause I
didn't know my phone got texts.

170
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,503
That's it? You're just
gonna cancel art class

171
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:36,671
because you don't have
a teacher to teach it?

172
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:39,540
That's kind of how schools work.

173
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,540
But I love art.

174
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:44,941
Maybe it's time to start
loving some other classes,

175
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:48,376
like math or English or science.

176
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,244
Nobody likes a one-trick pony.

177
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,456
Hey, Alex! Hey, Harper!

178
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,025
Miss Major... Miss Majorhealey!
Where have you been?

179
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Did you know that they
cancelled art class?

180
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:06,429
I know. I quit so I could
make up for the time I lost

181
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,831
when I wasn't 15 and part of 16.

182
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:10,899
Ooh! And call me Jenny.

183
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:14,469
No, I don't wanna call you Jenny.

184
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:16,139
I wanna call you Miss Majorhealey

185
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:17,774
and I want you to
be my art teacher,

186
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,746
so I can keep the one class I
love and stay off the streets.

187
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,350
If there's one thing I
learned from being 40,

188
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:28,053
it's that you don't need
a class to be artistic.

189
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,121
And you need to stretch more.

190
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,092
What about T.J.? Don't you wanna
rub it in his face you're back?

191
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,794
Nothing ever feels finished to me

192
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,662
unless I rub it in someone's face.

193
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:41,097
And the other thing I
learned from when I was 40

194
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:44,000
is that rubbing it in someone's
face doesn't get you anywhere.

195
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:47,270
Really? Then I definitely
don't wanna get older. Uh-uh.

196
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:49,905
Oh, that reminds me.

197
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:52,006
I have to go sell a car.

198
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,342
Because I am no longer
a licensed driver.

199
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:03,682
Hello. Thank you for coming
to Waverly Sub Station.

200
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:05,383
My name is Justin.
Can I interest you

201
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,251
in a half-sandwich
pickle spear combo?

202
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,590
You're Misty May-Treanor.

203
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:15,558
Oh, my gosh! Oh,
my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

204
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:19,995
Holy moly!

205
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,597
Uh...

206
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:24,765
Hey. What's up, Misty?

207
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,667
Hi, trying-to-be-cool-guy.

208
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:32,270
I'm looking for Max Russo.

209
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:36,440
I'm sorry if he took your gold
medal but he likes shiny things.

210
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:41,111
My niece, Chelsa,
says he's fighting mono-orangosis.

211
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:44,646
I think I saw it on a telethon,
so I stopped by to cheer him up.

212
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:50,485
Max. There's someone here you
need to explain something to.

213
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:53,320
Hi, Max. I'm Misty May-Treanor.

214
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:56,088
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

215
00:12:57,724 --> 00:13:00,625
How many fingers am I holding up?

216
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,294
- Uh, two.
- Oh, my gosh.

217
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:05,062
You are Misty May-Treanor!

218
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:10,066
- Whoa!
- I heard about your disease.

219
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,801
I thought you would wanna take
your mind off it and hang out.

220
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,303
OK. Come on.

221
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:19,374
Oh, Justin, you can cover
my shift for me, right?

222
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:21,675
No.

223
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,344
Oh, I think you can.

224
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:25,413
You got it, Misty.

225
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:31,317
Mr. Laritate. Mr. Laritate,
you can't cancel art class.

226
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,587
Life isn't just about facts and figures,
it's about expression.

227
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:37,957
If kids don't express themselves
in a controlled environment,

228
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,827
they'll just end up on the streets.

229
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,797
Russo, I'm impressed.

230
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:46,265
Your passion for something

231
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,000
besides getting out of schoolwork

232
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:50,936
warms this old cowboy's heart.

233
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,572
- It does?
- Like a campfire.

234
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,507
I should be able to
pull a few strings

235
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,343
and get things up and running
again at the old art corral.

236
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:03,212
Thank you, Mr. Laritate.
It really means a lot to me.

237
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,481
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.

238
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:10,186
Could you give this basket
to your ailing brother, Max?

239
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,655
It has some of hisavorite
knick-knacks and do-dads.

240
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,194
Yes, sir, Mr. Laritate.
I'll give Max the basket.

241
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,871
He only said the basket.

242
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,843
Excuse me. Do you know where
I could find Max Russo?

243
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,845
Look, whatever he broke,

244
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,014
you should have gotten
the extended warranty.

245
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,082
No, no, no.

246
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:50,220
- I'm Dwayne Johnson.
- Oh, you're Dwayne Johnson.

247
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,055
Well, the water
founin's over there,

248
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,956
but I don't think
you should fix it.

249
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,124
It's funny when people
get squirted in the eye.

250
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,726
No, I'm sure it's funny, but...

251
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,762
I'm Dwayne Johnson, the actor.

252
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:03,997
Great. I'm Alex Russo,

253
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:06,732
and my hobby is I like to
poke things with a stick.

254
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:10,235
But I haven't figured out how
to make money with that yet,

255
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:11,903
so I'm in school.

256
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:16,408
Actors need a second job until
they make it. You're a plumber.

257
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:19,543
Actually, I'm not a plumber.
I've been in quite a few movies.

258
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:21,644
Acting is my first and only job.

259
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,480
All right. Hope that
works out for you, then.

260
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,718
Wow. Well, let me know if you
ever get into personal training.

261
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:32,787
You're in shape. What do you bench?

262
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:36,324
- 450, but who's counting?
- Right.

263
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,894
I could design a
cardio program for you.

264
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,830
- Oh, my gosh. That'd be great.
- You em like a nice girl.

265
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,932
I always dat first.

266
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:48,002
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

267
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:50,337
Let me go look at the fountain,
see if I can fix it.

268
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:58,330
It's terrible. I think I read
about that on the internets.

269
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,899
- I gotta go cheer him up.
- Right.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,302
- I'll get back to you.
- OK.

271
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:07,437
Hey, everybody,
look! It's the famous actor,

272
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:09,305
Dwayne Johnson,
fixing our fountain!

273
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:20,150
OK, here's your turkey on
wheat with a side of coleslaw

274
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:21,518
and red and blue chips...

275
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:23,153
Dad! Misty May-Treanor is here

276
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:25,122
because Max pretended
to have a fake disease

277
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:27,357
that doesn't let him taste,
hear or see orange.

278
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:30,227
And people are giving him gift baskets,
and it's all wrong.

279
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:34,661
- Did you say Misty May-Treanor?
- Yes.

280
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,500
Whoa!

281
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:42,936
That was a spike.

282
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,807
Oh! Misty May-Treanor!

283
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,009
Is it? Misty May-Treanor!

284
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,579
Wow! You're... you.

285
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,014
Yes, I am.

286
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,917
Mr. Russo, I can't even
imagine how rough it is

287
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,285
for you to deal with what
Max is going through.

288
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,824
Misty, there's something we all
need to tell you and I'm just...

289
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,662
Yes, yes. It's very, very trying

290
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:17,330
to have a son with this condition.

291
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:20,265
Especially with the
furniture in this house.

292
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:23,667
What? Lies!

293
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:27,471
What makes it worse is when the
whole family's not supportive.

294
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:33,041
We... We're working on him.
He's in denial, so...

295
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:37,077
Dad, we're making salad.
Do you want a bowl?

296
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:41,881
Salad. Of course I would, son.

297
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:44,583
Justin, you mind covering
my shift down at the shop?

298
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:46,985
I think we're gonna be awhile.

299
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,353
No! I'm already working a double,
and this is...

300
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:51,788
You wanna get the door, son?

301
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,858
Aunt Misty, I just
searched the internet

302
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:58,993
and there's no such
thing as mono-orangosis!

303
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:02,296
The truth!

304
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,132
You know, since the Olympics,
this has been happening a lot.

305
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,535
- You people are sick.
- No, Misty, wait!

306
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:11,169
- You have to sign my...
- Let it go.

307
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,437
- ..sign my son!
- No!

308
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:13,871
- Please! Misty!
- Not your son.

309
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,107
- Get out ay! Misty!
- Come on. No!

310
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,580
So, here we are, T.J.

311
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:27,749
I got Jenny back and now
I got the art class back.

312
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:31,984
So I guess you can say
I'm kind of on a roll.

313
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:37,288
It gives me great
pleasure to announce

314
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:40,325
that I am going to be
teaching art class.

315
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:43,527
Wait.

316
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:47,029
You're teaching the class?

317
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:50,799
Yes, thanks to your
inspiring speech.

318
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,902
Oh. Now I'm on the roll.

319
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:58,504
All right, let's kick things
off with a little painting.

320
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,907
Today we're gointo
be interpreting me.

321
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,243
Wearing my cowboy suit.

322
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,483
All right. Please grab your brushes

323
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,918
and pay attention to detail.

324
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,786
Take your time and don't rush,

325
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,190
as art is all about pre-planning

326
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:22,291
and being exact.

327
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,394
But that's not art.

328
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:29,730
It is if Mr. Laritate,
our art teacher, says it is.

329
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:33,166
Brushes up!

330
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,534
And... begin.

331
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,437
Mr. Laritate, no offense,

332
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,672
but I... I don't think
art is about being exact.

333
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:45,374
It's about everyone's
individual interpretation.

334
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:48,409
Not here. I'm the
sheriff of this class

335
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:50,851
and I wanna see
everyone's replication

336
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:54,310
of the billowy
wooliness of my chaps.

337
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:06,987
Mr. Laritate, as much as I
would love painting your chaps,

338
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:10,056
I think art class should
be a little more creative.

339
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:13,125
A class where we can
truly express ourselves

340
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,027
in a way words can't.

341
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,229
If you think you have a
better interpretation

342
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,631
of what art class should be,
why don't you share it with us?

343
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,934
Right. Everyone grab your brushes

344
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,502
and paint whatever you want.

345
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:30,005
Be creative, spontaneous,
passionate.

346
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,642
I'll show you passion.

347
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:36,312
Is that all you got?

348
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:52,193
Ha-ha!

349
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,233
Whoa, Nelly!

350
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,309
Alex, look what you did.

351
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:08,878
I'm so sorry, Mr. Laritate.

352
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:11,847
Miss Russo, I have never seen,

353
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:14,149
in all my years of teaching,
a student who...

354
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,619
I know, I know.
A student so disobedient,

355
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:18,754
who cares about no one
but herself, blah, blah.

356
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,090
I heard this last period.

357
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,157
No. I'm talking about a student

358
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,592
who showed so much passion
for what she believed in,

359
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:27,761
who probably surprised herself

360
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:29,964
but didn't surprise me at all.

361
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,032
Just look at what you inspired.

362
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,904
To reward you for your
dedication to this class,

363
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:40,540
I'm going to go out and
find you a real art teacher.

364
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:43,810
- You can be teacher's deputy.
- Great.

365
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:49,282
My first job as deputy is this.

366
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:51,250
T.J., why don't you
take out your sketch pad

367
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:54,554
and draw yourself a detention slip?

368
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:57,523
I'll show you a detention slip.

369
00:21:57,557 --> 00:21:59,925
Thank you. That's
exactly what I wanted.

370
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:02,093
That backfired.

371
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:10,128
OK, here's the melt you
ordered with no cheese.

372
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,096
So, technically,
it's just warm tuna.

373
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,831
Mom, Dwayne Johnson
is upstairs with Max

374
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:18,267
because he pretended to
have mono-orangosis again.

375
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:21,369
- Did you say Dwayne Johnson?
- Dwayne Johnson.

376
00:22:21,404 --> 00:22:23,071
Oh, my God!

377
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,543
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

378
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:34,981
All these muscles and I'm powerless

379
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,817
against your mono-orangosis.

380
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:40,519
Dwayne Johnson!

381
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:43,288
Oh, my gosh! You are you!

382
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:46,857
Yes, I am. Mrs. Russo,
I'm so sorry to hear about Max.

383
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:50,225
- It's gotta be so rough on you.
- Oh, it's so tough.

384
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:53,928
I could just faint.

385
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:55,563
- Catch me, Dwayne.
- Sure. Yeah.

386
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:05,505
Oh!

387
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,242
I heard you were here.
There's no such thing as mono-orangosis.

388
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:13,880
Ever since I became famous,
this is happening a lot.

389
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,949
You people are sick, even you, Mom.

390
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:18,752
Let's go, Chelsa.

391
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:21,389
- No.
- Give me this. Ungrateful.

392
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:22,991
Wait! Wait, wait!

393
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:28,992
