1
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:06,238
I'm sorry, dude.
I'm a little short today.

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,256
Can I make you a candle in trade?

3
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:12,063
Oh yeah, sure. As long as you make one
of those candles look like a twenty.

4
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:15,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the titude?

5
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:18,400
If she wanted somethg rotten,
she'd buy your bananas.

6
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,033
Hey, Maggie. I got it.

7
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:23,203
No, no, Alex. You do too
much for me already.

8
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:27,608
I need to thank you for getting
my landlord to lower my rent.

9
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:31,077
People really underestimate
my arm-wrestling skills.

10
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:33,846
It's all about wrist
position and a greasy table.

11
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:36,582
Here I am, sir,

12
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:38,851
paying for fruit from this table

13
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:41,949
where I found a bunch
of cockroaches.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,482
Shhhh.

15
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:48,084
Just pay me half and
get out of here, Russo.

16
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:53,656
Right on. Stick it to the Man.

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,824
You know I hate cheating people.

18
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:59,160
Maggie, wait till you
taste those mushy apples.

19
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:01,226
Believe me, we're not
the ones cheating.

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,127
Hey, you've got 15 minutes
to beat feet to school.

21
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:08,963
Actually, 14 because you have
to give me a hug before you go.

22
00:01:09,964 --> 00:01:11,130
Peace, Alex.

23
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:12,865
Thank you.

24
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:20,098
I know it sounds weird,

25
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:21,833
but one of my homework assignments

26
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:24,266
was to carry grocery bags
to someone's apartment,

27
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,433
and I forgot to do it.

28
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:27,566
- Alex, I'll be fine.
- It's okay.

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,399
All I have to do at school is
read the morning announcements.

30
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:32,867
- Don't you have classes?
- Oh, I have classes.

31
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,201
The question is, "Which one
of them I'll be going to?"

32
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:38,769
You know, I love how you
stuck it to the Man.

33
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:40,303
Sock it to 'em!

34
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:41,838
Oh, yeah! Come on.

35
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:44,173
Sock it to 'em! Oh, yeah!

36
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:47,136
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

37
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:49,104
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

38
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:51,305
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

39
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,940
* Yes, please *

40
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:54,774
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

41
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,575
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

42
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,910
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

43
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:00,745
* That's what I said *

44
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:04,082
* Everything is not what it seems *

45
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:07,719
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

46
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:11,291
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

47
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:16,161
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

48
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:19,296
* Everything is not what it seems *

49
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,098
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

50
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:26,933
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

51
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:30,800
* Because everything is not *

52
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,368
* What it seems *

53
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:39,169

54
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:42,642
When you highlight, Max,
you don't use a black marker.

55
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:45,077
- That... makes it disappear.
- Oh, my gosh!

56
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,379
Ssh! Dude, that's
Jeanette Brocoletti.

57
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:50,949
Someday I'm going to ask her out.

58
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,383
Why not now?

59
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,584
Well.. Because, I...

60
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,719
I don't know what to say, and...

61
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:58,920
I think I smell like teriyaki.

62
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:02,089
Oh! You do.
Did you spill on yourself?

63
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:07,426
Let's just say this is not
the front of my shirt.

64
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,727
OK, look. Let me
give you some advice.

65
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,696
If you want to talk to Jeanette,

66
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,964
all you gotta do is go up
to her and make her laugh.

67
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,400
Girls love guys who
can make 'em laugh.

68
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:19,602
All right. I'll give
that a shot. - Good.

69
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:20,937
Oh! Wait.

70
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:24,672
Are you setting me
up for something bad?

71
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:27,574
No. But should have.

72
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,541
It would've been a great joke.
I'm too nice.

73
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:39,315
Oh, hey, Jeanette.

74
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,650
Hey!

75
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,718
Bet you wanna know what
I'm laughing about?

76
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:47,187
Yeah. We all do. That's why
they sent me over here.

77
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:50,189
I will tell you.

78
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:51,557
See that girl over there?

79
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,159
Her hair looks like
spaghetti in a ponytail.

80
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:58,328
And where does she get her clothes,
Forever 1985?

81
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,464
Max, that's my best friend.

82
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,733
I'm just gonna go.

83
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:07,835
Max, it's OK.

84
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:09,769
Sarah makes fun of me sometimes.

85
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:12,204
Because your eyes
are too far apart?

86
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:13,738
What?

87
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:16,574
You think my eyes
are too far apart?

88
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,242
No! Not for me.

89
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,411
I wish they were further apart.

90
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:22,912
Change the subject.

91
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:26,548
I kinda wanted to ask
you out on a date.

92
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,315
Why don't you just ask me?

93
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,850
'Cause I blew it.

94
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:32,018
Go ahead.

95
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:34,754
Nah. I'm just gonna wreck it.

96
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:37,756
Max.

97
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,357
I'm giving you a second chance,

98
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,159
because I think
you're kind of funny.

99
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:43,729
Oh. OK, well... That's fine.

100
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,363
But I don't think it's gonna work.

101
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:50,500
Uh, Jeanette...

102
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:51,867
Do you want to go out with me?

103
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:53,602
Nah.

104
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:56,571
What?

105
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,906
Just kidding.

106
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,809
Give me a call.

107
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,811
Whoa. Jeanette, thank you!

108
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,813
It totally worked, bro.

109
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:08,514
You were funny and she liked you.

110
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,683
Really? I wasn't even
trying to be funny.

111
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:13,951
I barely knew what was going on.

112
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:18,156
Believe me, dude,
when it comes to girls

113
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,057
that's always the best way.

114
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:27,498
Hello. Alex, where are you?
Second period is starting.

115
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:30,468
Yeah, the hallway's clear. OK.

116
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:33,737
Help me travel on my own.
I need to get there through this phone.

117
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:37,340
Thanks, Harper.

118
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:39,943
I would've gotten here sooner
but I dialed the wrong number.

119
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:41,744
There's this really
confused guy in India

120
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,645
with my footprint on
the side of his face.

121
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:46,550
Alex, Mr. Laritate's
really mad at you

122
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,685
because you flaked out
on morning announcements.

123
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:51,386
He had the kid with the rubber
bands on his braces do them.

124
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:53,421
I'm not sure if he said
"Friday is Picture Day"

125
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:56,724
or "Fried eggs in pickled hay."

126
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,127
It doesn't matter.
I'm going to be ready for both.

127
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,995
I better get to Geometry.
No. English. No.

128
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,930
Government. Oh. Whatever the
class isefore Mr. Laritate...

129
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,397
Sees you?

130
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:11,099
Sit by the window in detention.

131
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:13,335
I'll throw you some CornNuts.

132
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,107
No more detention for you.

133
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:22,743
I came to that decision when
you brought a blow-up mattress

134
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:25,479
and clock radio that
made ocean noises.

135
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:26,981
To the hoosegow.

136
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:29,617
I don't know what hoosegow means,

137
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:32,420
but I'm pretty sure it
doesn't mean ice cream stand.

138
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:39,325
Blueberry or apple?

139
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,559
Apple.

140
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:44,263
T marshmallows.

141
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:48,766
Hey, nice new Navajo blanket.

142
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,368
Thanks, I picked it
up at a yard sale.

143
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:54,670
Oh. It really ties
the room together.

144
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:58,806
You're in here way too often.

145
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,308
Hey, dude, that's your call,
not mine.

146
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:04,945
Miss Russo,

147
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,383
I used to fancy myself a little
bit of an outlaw like you.

148
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,651
I used to belly up
to the soda fountain

149
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:14,953
and have a glass of all the
flavors mixed together.

150
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:18,055
They called it soda danger.

151
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,057
I called it breakfast.

152
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:23,593
That all changed when the
doctor called it a peptic ulcer.

153
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:25,295
Do you see where I'm
going with this?

154
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,732
No, but I rarely do when
we have these talks.

155
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:32,168
I'm talking about...

156
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,371
...howkipping morning announcements

157
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:39,707
is the latest in a long
line of your selfish acts.

158
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,710
If it's not putting an "out of
order" sign on the girls' bathroom

159
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:44,578
just so you can watch the panic...

160
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:47,080
That was a good one.

161
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:51,383
Then it's having the library
order up your fashion magazines.

162
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,085
Oh, that reminds me.

163
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:56,288
I need them to renew "
Hot Rods and Handbags."

164
00:07:56,322 --> 00:08:00,058
Here's what we're going to do
to break this selfish streak.

165
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,260
You're going to join
the Happy Helpers club.

166
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:05,696
Oh, two things I don't like:
clubs and helping.

167
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,198
I'm not a fan of happy either.
So throw that in, too.

168
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,001
If you don't join,
you'll be suspended.

169
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:14,603
And don't think you can skip it,
because I'm the advisor.

170
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:16,605
Fine.

171
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,108
I'm not going to lie,
I still might try.

172
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:22,843
ax] I got a date. I got a date.

173
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,445
Dad! I got a date.

174
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,080
Max, I told you.

175
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:28,349
If a girl comes in and
asks if you do take-out,

176
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,684
it doesn't mean she
wants to take you out.

177
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:35,153
No, a real date with
Jeanette Brocoletti.

178
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,388
Really? Atta boy.

179
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:38,990
"Atta boy" what?

180
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:41,691
Our son is about to
go onis first date.

181
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:44,461
No, he isn't. He's only 13.

182
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:47,796
- Mom.
- Come on, Theresa.

183
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,732
I'm a reasonable person.

184
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,402
Your father and I will
chaperone the date. OK?

185
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:54,970
And it has to happen in here.

186
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:58,740
I don't know, guys.
Let me ask Justin.

187
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,476
Justin!

188
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,844
Hey.

189
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:05,180
Mom and Dad want to
chaperone me on my date.

190
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,181
Oh!

191
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:09,617
Sounds more like a play date.

192
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:13,020
My expertise in romance got you this far.
Let me give you a hand.

193
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,121
Guys. I can chaperone him.

194
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:19,358
Oh, look at my big boy
looking after my little boy.

195
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,826
You're taking me out that night.

196
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,961
- Movie in Times Square?
- Yeah.

197
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,996
We can make fun of tourists who visit
New York and eat at chain restaurants?

198
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:29,232
- I love you.
- Me too.

199
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:35,004
OK, Justin, one last favor.

200
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,572
Can you pretend to be the waiter,

201
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,206
so she doesn't know
I'm being chaperoned?

202
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,142
Yeah, dude. No problem. I've got a
suit that I've been dying to wear

203
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:44,979
since Grandma made that
miraculous recovery.

204
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:05,330
Out.

205
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:08,132
Thanks for joining the Happy
Helpers Club with me, Harper.

206
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,534
No problem. I don't want
to see you get suspended.

207
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:14,504
I don't like hearing what teachers say
about you when you're not at school.

208
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:18,106
Well, this club
might not be so bad.

209
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,041
Yeah, it's not like they have
a club cheer or anything.

210
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:24,244
Did I just set it up?

211
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:26,446
I think you did.

212
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:28,114
Happy Helpers! Happy Helpers!

213
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,482
That's what we are!

214
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:30,750
Helping people! Helping people!

215
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:32,852
Helping near and far! Yay!

216
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:36,689
OK, Happy Helpers.

217
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,224
Before we start our jamboree,

218
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:44,060
I'd like to welcome Alex Russo
and Harper Finkle to our posse.

219
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:45,094
Club.

220
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:46,663
Right. Club.

221
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,598
Now, let's go over

222
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,736
who participated in this
week's community work.

223
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,539
Did anyone throw away a
candy wrapper they found?

224
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:57,707
Good.

225
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:01,711
Did anyone push an elevator
button for someone else?

226
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,580
Good!

227
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:06,481
Wait. These are the
good deeds they do?

228
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,282
That's just stuff they
should do every day.

229
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,785
I made change for a dollar.

230
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,191
OK. This week we need someone

231
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:20,826
to close the front door
when the bell rings.

232
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,694
Eeny, meeny, miny..

233
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,229
Alex.

234
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:28,532
That's great, Alex.
Whenever we do volunteer work,

235
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:32,502
we get awards and ribbons
to put in our Spirit Books.

236
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:35,538
They're what make us Happy Helpers.

237
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,975
A ribbon for closing the door?

238
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,610
Harper, you see what's going on?

239
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:43,512
They don't care about
helping people.

240
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,682
They only care about getting credit
for doing nothing. I'm out of here.

241
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:51,585
If anyone wants to close the door
behind me and get a ribbon, feel free.

242
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:54,387
No.

243
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,490
Alex, if you don't stay in this class,
you're going to get suspended.

244
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:02,760
Mr. Laritate, I just
gave Alex good advice.

245
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:04,895
How many ribbons is that worth?

246
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,300
I'll split them with you.

247
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:20,173
Hey Alex, what's
with the bummer face?

248
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,675
The Man come down on you?

249
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,144
Yeah.

250
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,945
The Man said I was being selfish

251
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,214
so he made me join a stupid
club to teach me a lesson.

252
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,917
You mean like a commune?

253
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,918
Don't knock it till
you've tried it.

254
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:37,987
No. It's the Happy Helpers Club.

255
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:41,356
Who are supposed to be all
about helping the community

256
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:43,959
but really they're just
all about themselves.

257
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:46,260
Oh, man. That's bogus.

258
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:48,829
You are one of the most...

259
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,064
Oh!

260
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:51,965
...unselfish...

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,668
...coolest chicks I know.

262
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:56,436
That's the truth, Ruth.

263
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,739
Mm! It's Maggie.

264
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:00,240
It's an expression.

265
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:01,374
Ah!

266
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:02,509
Respect.

267
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,679
This club does stuff like...

268
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:08,480
...telling someone
their shoe's untied

269
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:10,783
and then they call
that community service.

270
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:12,551
Man, I know where
you're coming from.

271
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:16,188
Back in '68 I was very
into the peace movement.

272
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:19,925
You know? Marching,
talking to people, organizing.

273
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,462
Then one day, I went to
a campus peace rally.

274
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:26,799
Well, these guys weren't into
working for peace at all.

275
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:31,070
They were just using the whole scene so
they could rebel against their parents.

276
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:32,371
Blew my mind.

277
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,474
So then you just bailed, right?

278
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:37,977
Hm? No way, LBJ.

279
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:39,144
What?

280
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:41,847
Well, it's an expression.

281
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:43,982
Respect.

282
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:49,154
Look, my friends may be
puppets of the establishment,

283
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:51,990
but my cause was righteous.

284
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:56,195
So I grabbed my bullhorn
and I spoke the truth.

285
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,830
- Spoke the truth.
- Yeah! Right on.

286
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:03,501
You know, you should
try it sometime.

287
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:07,573
I can dig it. Thanks.

288
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:13,279
Yeah. Stick it to the Man!

289
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,881
Sock it to 'em!
Sock it to 'em! Oh, yeah!

290
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:18,217
Sock it to 'em!
Sock it to 'em! Oh, yeah!

291
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:19,284
Sock it to 'em!

292
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,291
Excuse me.

293
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:30,795
We have a reservation.
Russo, party of two.

294
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,064
Yes, you do. Your
table's right over here.

295
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:36,099
Wow, Max. Pretty impressive,
having your own waiter.

296
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:43,039
That's rht,
I do have my own waiter.

297
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:44,274
Is this table all right?

298
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:46,643
It's the one that I set
up with the tablecloth.

299
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,977
I'm OK here.

300
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:50,612
No. Look, you don't
have to be nice to him.

301
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:52,380
He's my waiter.

302
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:56,218
We'd like to move over there.

303
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,354
She said she was fine here.

304
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:01,056
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

305
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,358
Lose the 'tude, waiter dude.

306
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:08,197
The lady would be more
comfortable over there.

307
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:26,581
Will you excuse me a moment,
Jeanette?

308
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:31,019
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

309
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:33,455
I'm being funny in front of
my date like you told me to.

310
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:36,524
You think ordering me around and
treating me like this is funny?

311
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,095
Yeah, you're pretty mad,
so I think it's hilarious.

312
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:44,231
Jeanette, I am so sorry.

313
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:46,466
I wonder if our waiter
comes with chips,

314
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:49,068
because he is a dip.

315
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:52,037
Hey, waiter.

316
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:57,341
Do you think you can handle
getting us some water?

317
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,483
Ah!

318
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,351
The fizzy type.

319
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:08,686
Yes.

320
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,789
The lady and I would
love the fizzy type.

321
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,034
Is that fizzy enough for you, sir?

322
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:25,838
He is so funny.

323
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:27,206
And cute.

324
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,910
Jeanette, what do you mean by cute?

325
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,146
Cute like he looks cute? Or...

326
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,349
...cute like when I put pretzel
sticks up my nose and my mom goes:

327
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:38,950
"Cute."

328
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,418
That sounds funny.

329
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:41,720
Oh, yeah it is.

330
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:44,256
Hey, waiter, where are
our pretzel sticks?

331
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,264
You had your chance.

332
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:55,167
Hey!

333
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,470
Before you mop that up,
let's hear the specials.

334
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:05,844
For the lady,

335
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,647
I'd recommend losing the boy with
the bloody nose in his future

336
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:12,083
and having dinner with someone
that can make you laugh, for real.

337
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:15,319
And for the boy, I'd recommend
the dinosaur chicken strips

338
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:18,789
with a side of wet wipes.

339
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:20,691
I'll go get you a bib
and some crayons.

340
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:22,860
If you stay inside the lines...

341
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:25,028
I'll put it on the wall.

342
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,864
Will you excuse me, please?

343
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:36,003
Pound for pound, you're a clown.

344
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:42,808
Back to our date.

345
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:45,944
Let's get this party started.

346
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,649
Is there something in my nose?

347
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,391
Oh!

348
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,960
Uh-oh. Justin!

349
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:16,269
You think this is hilarious,
don't you?

350
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,438
Yes. Yes, I do.

351
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:25,144
Yeah. It's pretty funny.

352
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:30,115
You got me.

353
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:33,217
Actually, you got yourself.

354
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,752
I did.

355
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:37,588
Hello? Are we having a date or not?

356
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,391
Relax, we'll get back
to the date in a second.

357
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:44,261
I guess I had it coming to me.

358
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,962
What were you thinking?

359
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,166
I'm thinking that when I'm mean
and insulting that it's funny.

360
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,502
But it might only be me.

361
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:56,004
Why don't you ask Jeanette?

362
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:02,943
Yeah, it's only me.

363
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,245
Man.

364
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,648
That was my first
date and I ruined it.

365
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:11,384
There will be plenty
of other dates,

366
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:15,053
and you'll find different
ways to ruin those too.

367
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,590
Hey, I started the
dino chicken strips.

368
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,825
- You did? I call the T-rexes.
- Of course.

369
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,463
I got another ribbon.

370
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,667
No more for her.

371
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:33,904
Alex, where were you?

372
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,307
You missed seeing me
get all these ribbons.

373
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,076
Ribbons for what?
This is only your second meeting.

374
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,345
This one is for coming
to a second meeting.

375
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,215
This next award goes to Alex
Russo for clapping erasers.

376
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,518
I wasn't clapping erasers.
I was trying to hit the clock

377
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:53,620
to see if I could get
it to move forward.

378
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:56,622
Repairing a stuck clock.
Even better.

379
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:58,090
Come on up and get your ribbon.

380
00:19:58,224 --> 00:20:00,125
No. Wait.

381
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,027
You want to give me a ribbon
for something I didn't even do?

382
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,029
You honestly see nothing
wrong with that?

383
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:06,864
I don't.

384
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:09,934
It's about time I got
some appreciation, Mom.

385
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:21,946
It's stick it to the Man time.

386
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,882
I'm sorry, Mr. Laritate. I can't take
that ribbon. I didn't do anything.

387
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,818
And even if I had,
I still wouldn't take it.

388
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,153
I'll take it.

389
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,455
Oh! Sorry.

390
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:36,260
I was told I had to join
this club or get suspended.

391
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:41,264
Most of you know me.
That's not a shocker.

392
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,601
You think you're helping the community,
but you're hardly doing anything.

393
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:47,470
And you do it for selfish reasons.

394
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:50,139
Now, I know I can be
a little selfish too,

395
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:52,241
because I don't help
a lot of people.

396
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:54,143
But I know when I do.

397
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:57,613
I do more than this and I don't
expect anything in return.

398
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,682
I don't even do it to
make myself feel better.

399
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,784
I do it to make the other
person feel better.

400
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,586
Wow.

401
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:07,590
That was a very moving speech...

402
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:08,924
...worthy of a ribbon.

403
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,292
No!

404
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:11,293
No.

405
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:13,095
I don't want a ribbon.

406
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,997
It's either the
ribbon or suspension.

407
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:16,765
That's a lovely ribbon.

408
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:24,325
There you go, Mr. Laritate.

409
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,460
You're going to look great
for 60's Day at school.

410
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,896
- Thank you, Alex.
- Yeah, she's the best.

411
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,432
You know, she really
understands flower power.

412
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:34,767
Flower power? I don't get it.

413
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:36,268
It means you're generous, Alex.

414
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,271
I don't know why you didn't
tell me you were a Happy Helper.

415
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:42,206
Nope, not a Happy Helper.
An unhappy troublemaker

416
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,775
who quietly does good
without anyone knowing.

417
00:21:46,144 --> 00:21:47,411
I can dig it.

418
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,180
So I'm not suspended?

419
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:51,882
Whoa!

420
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,517
You mean you're the Man?

421
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:57,721
And I was gonna give you a candle.

422
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:00,457
Alex, I'll make you a deal.

423
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,926
I'll suspend the suspension
if you'll show more

424
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:05,062
flower power around school.

425
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:06,998
And I'll try to get
the Happy Helpers

426
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,434
to start calling your club a posse.

427
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:11,836
Deal.

428
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,909
But I'm still gonna have
to make fun of your outfit.

429
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:20,479
I would expect nothing less.

430
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,681
Right on.

431
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:23,451
Oh, yeah! I can dig it.

432
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:28,452
