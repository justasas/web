1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,740
Did my messenger fish
just tell you my evil plan?

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,570
No.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,910
All right. This time, pay attention.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,810
Dear Mama, you'll be proud to know

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,880
that after the 12-ball tournament
reveals the best young wizard,

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,250
l will drain--

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,190
Okay, maybe he did tell me.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,220
She is not my mother, you stupid fish.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,990
Hey, at least l didn't tell her
about Volcanoland.

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,960
l never said anything
about Volcanoland.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,300
Well, you have to go to an undersea
volcano to drain a wizard's powers.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,240
And Volcanoland is the only--

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,210
We have a problem.
You just heard my plan.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,150
And l love your plan.

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,780
l think it'd be great for me
if Justin wins the tournament

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,690
and you drain his powers.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,420
How so?

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,050
Because without his powers,

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,360
there's no way he'll end up being
the family wizard.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,560
l will.

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,820
Well, of course there's Max,

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,990
but he thinks
microwave popcorn's magic, so...

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,570
Well, it looks like we're
on the same side.

24
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,230
Care to seal it with a diabolical laugh?

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,240
l'll try.

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,070
Needs more bass.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,250
l thought l heard voices.

28
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,080
Good evening, Headmaster Crumbs.
Just here with one of my prized students.

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,720
Really?

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,760
Alex Russo
is one of your prized students?

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,020
All the other teachers say
she's remarkably slack.

32
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,330
And you know how we feel
about slackers.

33
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,490
We don't like slackers.

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,470
Perhaps they don't know Ms. Russo
as well as l do.

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,010
Well, then.

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,940
Perhaps l should stick around
and get to know you too.

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,740
Now, what are we talking about?

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,110
Just girl talk.

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,190
Bras and stuff.

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,450
Oh, well, then, l've got to go.

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,340
Forget the Waverly Sub Station.
They use day-old bread.

42
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,480
Beautiful people eat at The Salad Bowl.

43
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,590
Lots of attractive women
eat salads these days.

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,400
Look at this.
No wonder we had such a slow day.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,860
Excuse me.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,230
What do you think you're doing?

47
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,240
lt's not Halloween, and you're a little
too old to be trick-or-treating anyway.

48
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,100
lf you don't mind, why don't you
stand in front of the clown supply.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,400
l think you'd fit in better over there.

50
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,280
l have to stand here
because l'm stealing your customers

51
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,250
with my crisp lettuce
and crunchy cucumbers.

52
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,440
You can't do that.

53
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,350
That's what the hot-dog guy
in Washington Square Park said.

54
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,930
Now he's holding the arrow toward
cheap furniture going out of business.

55
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,430
So back off, meat eaters.

56
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,350
Listen, you talking bowl of freak.

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,470
You are not gonna steal our customers.

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,300
Submarine sandwiches
have a long history in New York City.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,900
And l know New Yorkers,
and New Yorkers love sandwiches.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,940
They're not just gonna give them up
for tomatoes, carrots and--

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,140
What are those, snails?

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,180
They're porcini mushrooms.

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,110
Oh, l love porcini mushrooms.

64
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,610
Jerry.

65
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,980
- l--
- Get inside.

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,150
Okay, look, all we have to do is advertise
our shop like she advertises hers.

67
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,690
Where are we gonna find a goof
to wear a ridiculous costume for us?

68
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,310
lt's time for the serve-and-volley drill.

69
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,250
You serve, l volley.

70
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,320
You cry for mercy.

71
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,490
l wasn't ready.

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,460
Justin, can l talk to you?

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,960
l need to practice.
l'm playing in the semifinals tomorrow.

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,800
No, you're not. Dr. Evilini is gonna drain
the champion's powers at Volcanoland.

75
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,800
- l can't let you win this thing.
- l'm sorry, volcano what?

76
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,030
Her messenger fish told me.

77
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,080
She wants to become
the most powerful wizard.

78
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,910
So there's a volcano
and a messenger fish.

79
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,420
We need to focus on Evilini.

80
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,280
l don't know if you know, but she's evil.

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,010
No. Her name's Evilini.

82
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,590
And how much clearer could it be?

83
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,880
Okay, if she was really evil,

84
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,720
don't you think she would've changed
her name to Really-Friendly-ini

85
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,160
or Nice-ini or Totally-Not-Evil-ini?

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,120
All right, we're not getting anywhere.
You need to listen to me.

87
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,570
This is exactly why l didn't want you
to come to Wiz Tech.

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,070
Stop bothering me.
l need to focus and concentrate.

89
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,510
lf l could focus, l would've hit those.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,330
There she is, working the streets.

91
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,860
Go get her, Max.

92
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,360
Max.

93
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,960
Hey, how'd you get it
to smell like onions?

94
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,800
Oh, that's you.

95
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,350
Jerry, it needs more ventilation holes.

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,610
That's why we went with Swiss cheese.

97
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,950
Now, go get those customers.

98
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,420
Yeah--

99
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,750
Maxy, are you okay?

100
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,950
Sorry, buddy.

101
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,930
Just get me up
before the three-second rule kicks in.

102
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,360
Get your Bronx-Strami.

103
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,130
Central Pork Sandwich
right here at the Sub Station.

104
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,410
Hey, it's working.

105
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,840
That's my boy.

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,810
Salads make you perky.

107
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,940
Sandwiches make you sleepy.

108
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,640
You know why people eat salad
with a roll?

109
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,980
Because it makes a sandwich
in their stomachs.

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
You have to eat sandwiches
with your hands.

111
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,720
Like savages.

112
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,720
Salads are un-American.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,290
All right. You won this lunch rush.

114
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,220
But if you're here tomorrow,
you're gonna get it.

115
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,230
l am scared of lettuce.

116
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,070
lt's high in vitamins and fiber.

117
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,240
Headmaster Crumbs, l need your help.

118
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,870
What seems to be the problem?

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,150
Dr. Evilini's gonna drain the 12-ball
champion's powers at Volcanoland.

120
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,020
And l think my brother
may end up champion.

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,220
You have to do something.

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,520
l can't. My hands are tied.

123
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,370
You don't believe me either?

124
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,160
No, my hands are really tied.

125
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,870
l lost a bet with Evilini.

126
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,570
Professor Maloney and l
got into a beard contest,

127
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,800
of which l had no business
being part of.

128
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,180
Don't you see? That bet was a setup.

129
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,840
Evilini has tied your hands
so you can't do anything about it.

130
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,510
You may be onto something.

131
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,210
But l can't confront Evilini.
She'd only deny it.

132
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,190
lf you want to protect Justin,
it's up to you.

133
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,660
Get him to back out of the tournament.

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,130
l already tried, but once l mentioned
Volcanoland and the talking fish,

135
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,670
he thought l was messing with him.

136
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,240
Sounds like you need some hard evidence
to convince your brother.

137
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,900
l suggest you knuckle down
and go to the library.

138
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,940
Sure, l'll go to the library.

139
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,400
Oh, really?

140
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,840
- ls that the truth?
- Sure.

141
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,580
Some are evil, some are kind
But now all must speak their mind

142
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,520
l hate libraries. What am l saying?

143
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,220
There's no way l'm going to a library.
What am l saying?

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,160
l put a truth spell on you to see
if you're really on your way to help Justin

145
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,790
or if you're just going to slack off again.

146
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,690
l wanna help, but not at a boring library.

147
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,430
Well, then go someplace
where it isn't boring.

148
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,560
Like Volcanoland.

149
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,970
How do l get to Volcanoland?

150
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,600
l can't tell you that.

151
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,710
- Then why did you tell me to go there?
- l didn't. l would never say that.

152
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,600
l'm the headmaster.

153
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,720
l can't send a student off campus
to Volcanoland.

154
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,950
- What?
- You should never go to Volcanoland.

155
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,020
lt could be dangerous.

156
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,320
So just to be clear,
you want me to go to Volcanoland?

157
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,720
l didn't say that.

158
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,160
But you did say Volcanoland.

159
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,760
l will admit to that.

160
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,370
Nice.

161
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,570
What's happening?

162
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,900
Justin's fallen behind.

163
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,510
Oh, good.
Maybe l don't have to go to Volcanoland.

164
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,950
The only way he can win now
is if he hits the tattler.

165
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,510
- The tattler?
- Yeah, it's an obscure rule.

166
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,680
lf you hit the tattler,
it's an automatic win.

167
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,690
But the tattler isn't even in here,
so there's no chance.

168
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,020
- Yeah.
- There she is.

169
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,220
What's she doing?

170
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,060
She's tattling. She's the tattler.

171
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,860
lt's obvious.

172
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,070
He did it. He hit the tattler.

173
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,980
l won. l'm going to the finals.

174
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,380
Well played, Russo.

175
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,650
lt's now down to you and Jerko.

176
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,520
We'll soon find out
who's the most powerful young wizard.

177
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,430
Oh, sorry. My cell phone.

178
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,730
Hello, Mummy?

179
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,970
Okay, l've got to get to Volcanoland.

180
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,920
l guess it's just you, me and destiny.

181
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,290
No, Destiny Johnson lost
in the third round.

182
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,880
No, destiny, as in it's my destiny
to be a winner

183
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,930
and your destiny
to always live in my shadow.

184
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,490
Well, l'll see you in the finals, Jerk.

185
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,890
How am l gonna get to Volcanoland?

186
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,870
l'd mail myself, but all the mail
goes through Dr. Evilini, and she's evil.

187
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,070
l work in the mailroom.
l could get around Evilini.

188
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,140
Are you saying you could mail me from
the mailroom without Evilini knowing?

189
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,450
l'm not saying that at all.

190
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,150
What is it with you people
and your head nodding?

191
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,420
Hey.

192
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,790
Excuse me. l need some information
about the volcano.

193
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,460
Fire away.

194
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,670
We're encouraged to use
volcano terminology whenever we can.

195
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,910
ls it true the volcano can drain wizards
of their powers?

196
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,110
The majority of wizards
enjoy the natural wonder of the park

197
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,550
and take a lot of pictures that they'll bore
their friends with when they get home.

198
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,780
What about the others?

199
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,590
They use the volcano
to drain wizards of their powers.

200
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,590
That's a separate entrance fee.

201
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,600
l have to prove this to my brother
before it's too late.

202
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,060
Hey, could you come back
to school with me?

203
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,400
What for? You got something bubbling?

204
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,770
See what l did there?

205
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,710
You're a volcano official.

206
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,710
My brother always believes
people in uniform.

207
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,470
lt's one of the many things about him
that annoy me.

208
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,280
- Does it make you wanna erupt?
- Okay, now you're pushing it.

209
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,880
- Does it block your flow?
- Stop it.

210
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,820
- Does it make you wanna go molten?
- Don't.

211
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,920
- Make you hot under the collar?
- Okay, officially ignoring you.

212
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,520
- Alex, what are you doing? Who's she?
- Hello.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,560
l'm the lnformation Desk Lady
from Volcanoland.

214
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,400
Go ahead, Justin. Ask her a question.

215
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,870
Could l get one of those?

216
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,840
- l like the fringe things on the shoulders.
- No.

217
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,670
A question about Volcanoland.
Just tell him.

218
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,150
At Volcanoland, more wizards
have been drained of their powers

219
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,150
than at all of the 77 Wonders
of the Wizard World combined.

220
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,150
Wizards come from near and far

221
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,630
to witness its awesome
wizard-power-draining properties.

222
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,200
Okay, so you weren't messing with me
about Volcanoland.

223
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,990
But that doesn't mean Evilini's
taking me there to drain my powers.

224
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,330
Dr. Evilini?

225
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,490
Oh, she has a season pass
to the draining section.

226
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,770
And she paid extra
so there's no blackout dates.

227
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,240
l gotta quit the tournament.

228
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,370
While l'm here, would you like to buy
an l Lava Volcanoland T-shirt?

229
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,610
No, l don't wanna buy
an l Lava Volcanoland T-shirt

230
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,350
because l don't lava Volcanoland.

231
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,220
He didn't have to blow his top.

232
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,850
Okay, l've had enough.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,290
You want me to go dormant?

234
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,420
- Stop it.
- Okay.

235
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,140
Try a salad right around the corner.

236
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,570
Hey, lettucehead. Keep moving.

237
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,870
l warned you
about coming back here, shorty.

238
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,150
l don't wanna do this,
but you've given me no choice.

239
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,590
lt's time for the salad
to get a little meat in it.

240
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,020
Hey, Salad Bowl Girl.

241
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,960
Remember me?

242
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, let me help you out.

243
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,430
l'm the guy in the hot-dog suit.

244
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,910
You thought you ran me out of the biz
with that furniture arrow.

245
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,470
But l'm not going anywhere.

246
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,350
Oh, look.
The rest of the combo meal is here.

247
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,880
l can't believe it.

248
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,080
l have always wanted to say this.

249
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,060
l just never imagined it being this great.

250
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,660
Food fight.

251
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,730
Fight.

252
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,270
Let me up. You can't do this.

253
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,470
- Had enough?
- Yes, l've had enough.

254
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,110
My lettuce was on the ground.

255
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,740
l'm a walking health-code violation.

256
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,460
- Thanks, guys.
- We got her. We got Salad Bowl Girl.

257
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,060
Dr. Evilini.
Alex told me about your evil plan.

258
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,870
- l'm not playing in the 12-ball final.
- Justin, Justin, Justin.

259
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,170
l don't have an evil plan.

260
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,440
Of course Alex doesn't want you to have
the 12-ball championship belt.

261
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,510
That would make you a shoo-in
to be the one in your family

262
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,340
to keep your wizard powers.

263
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,610
There's a championship belt?

264
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,250
Nice try, Evilini. l'm onto you.

265
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,580
The Volcanoland lnformation Desk Lady
told me.

266
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,460
She gave me a discount on my
Volcanoland park pass. l still hate her.

267
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,590
The point is, l wanna keep my powers.

268
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,130
So l'm done. l quit.

269
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,790
- l'm out of here.
- You can't quit.

270
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,400
l need to know
who's the most powerful young wizard.

271
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,370
Scrittipolitti Noquitti

272
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,930
Okay.

273
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,050
l don't know what you just did to me,
but l still qui--

274
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,440
l still qui--

275
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,110
You can't quit now.

276
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,240
- l put a no-quit spell on you.
- l qui--

277
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,150
l qui--

278
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,520
l wanna play. Oh, no.

279
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,280
What am l saying? What am l doing?

280
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,820
Give me my bidaddles.

281
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,950
l don't want them. l'm gonna win.
No, you're not.

282
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,430
Guys, l have great news.
Justin's gonna quit the tournament.

283
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,480
Why would he quit?
That's not good news.

284
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,710
l can explain, see--

285
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,650
Wizards, student wizards,

286
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,020
visiting parents,
goblins and ghouls, Larry,

287
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,720
welcome to the Wiz Tech
12-Ball Finals.

288
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,450
Our first competitor.

289
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,460
Well, what can l say?
His name says it all.

290
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,330
Jerko Phoenix.

291
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:34,110
And a newcomer to the sport
and serious threat,

292
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,620
even though he doesn't look like it.

293
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,210
Justin Russo.

294
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,620
Hi, Mom.

295
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,630
Oh, look. He's waving at us.

296
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,570
l don't wanna be here.

297
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,100
l love you too.

298
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,740
What is he doing here?
l told him not to play.

299
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,610
You need to be more supportive
of your brother.

300
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,180
l'm trying to save his powers
from getting sucked down a volcano.

301
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,150
We really should get her
into a creative-writing class.

302
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,750
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Evilini put a spell on me.

303
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,820
l can't qui--

304
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,680
First serve, Russo.

305
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,830
He's gotta lose. Lose, Justin, lose.

306
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,630
Alex.

307
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,710
l didn't mean to do that.

308
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,400
Way to go, son.

309
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,190
Keep your eye on the balls.

310
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,590
Miss it.

311
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,790
Can someone please stop me?

312
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,930
Oh, my gosh, they're up to 1 1 balls.

313
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,930
No one's ever gotten to 12 before.

314
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,840
The 12th ball. Get it, Justin.

315
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,690
We have a winner.

316
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,130
l can't believe it.
My brother's a champion.

317
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,040
Congratulations, Justin Russo.

318
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,230
You are the best 12-ball player
in the entire school.

319
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,810
What are you going to do now?

320
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,740
l'm going to Volcanoland.

321
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,010
You certainly are.

322
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,080
That's it. lt's over.

323
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,050
l've tried everything.
l just can't beat Evilini.

324
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,390
Justin's gonna lose his powers.

325
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,790
Who are you talking to, honey?

326
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,960
Not now.

327
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,050
Here's an idea.

328
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,860
l am talking to myself.

329
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,700
Some are evil, some are kind
But now all must speak their mind

330
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,800
So it's Justin.

331
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,210
l'll take him to the volcano
and drain his powers for myself.

332
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,610
Why am l saying this?

333
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,310
Oh, no. A truth spell.

334
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,550
They'll all hear my plan to become
the most powerful wizard.

335
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,980
Stop talking.

336
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,250
Security.

337
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,460
l knew you could do it.

338
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,930
You went to great lengths
to help your brother,

339
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,230
and you brought Evilini down.

340
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,100
When you apply yourself,
you can achieve a lot more than you think.

341
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,010
- l guess l can.
- Hey.

342
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,740
When you were at Volcanoland,

343
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,070
did you happen to buy a T-shirt
in my size?

344
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,910
Yeah, they're gonna mail it to you.

345
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,710
Some are evil, some are ki--

346
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,080
Okay, maybe l didn't.
But next time, okay?

347
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,410
Okay.

348
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,990
- Oh, Justin, honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

349
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,520
Thanks to Alex.

350
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,030
l can't believe my baby almost had
his powers drained in a volcano.

351
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,460
We were very concerned.

352
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,760
You still get to keep
the championship belt, though, right?

353
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,370
Alex, l'm kind of glad you came
to summer school with me after all.

354
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,840
Thanks for stopping Evilini
from stealing my powers.

355
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,840
So from now on, you'll believe me?

356
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,000
You know what? l will.

357
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,910
l think we've grown up a lot
this summer.

358
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,950
Yeah, me too.
Oh, you got something on your shirt.

359
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,280
l'm not falling for it this time.

360
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,890
Yeah. l saw that coming.

361
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,540
lsn't this the strangest thing
you have ever seen?

362
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,920
No, it's a dream come true.

363
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,780
Giant things eating what they are.

364
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,390
Come on, who hasn't had that dream?

365
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,730
lf a giant claw comes out of the sky
and grabs one of them,

366
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,130
then l've had that dream.

367
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,370
That's weird.
