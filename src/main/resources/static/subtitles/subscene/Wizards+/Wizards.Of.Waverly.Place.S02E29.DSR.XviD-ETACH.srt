1
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:08,487
- Juliet!
- Oh, hi! How's it going?

2
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,056
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to ask you something.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,396
Um... Will you, uh...

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,163
Will you go to prom with me?

5
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:17,934
Oh... Justin, that... that's sweet.

6
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:19,537
But I'm... I'm a vampire,

7
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:21,073
and I've been alive
for a long time,

8
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:22,943
so I've been to way too many proms.

9
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:25,446
How many?

10
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:27,516
Well... Five hundred twenty-three.

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,887
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:34,893
That's, um... a sizable number.

13
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:38,131
You see, the thing about prom
is people always expect too much

14
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:39,366
and they're always let down.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,968
Not this time.

16
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:44,139
Guess what our theme is?
Best Night Ever.

17
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:47,476
There you go.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,979
It's like one prom I went to,
the theme was Starry Night.

19
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:52,482
- I was there with this guy, Galileo.
- The astronomer?

20
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:55,352
- Is there another one?
- I think there might be a rapper.

21
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:58,590
- Oh, no. That's Lil' Galileo.
- Oh, yeah.

22
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,526
Juliet, if you go
to the prom with me,

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,562
I will find a way
to make it special.

24
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,932
I prom-ise.

25
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,602
OK. I'll go.

26
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,871
You won me over with
your goofy play on words.

27
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,773
People underestimate
the power of goofy.

28
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,508
Yes.

29
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,616
Harper, it's prom season!

30
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,620
And this year's theme is
Best Night Ever. Awesome.

31
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:25,523
Oh, my gosh. I'm excited, too!

32
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:27,760
Sometimes I stifle my
excitement in front of you,

33
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:31,765
'cause you're rarely ever
excited like this! Wait.

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,034
Why are you excited about prom?

35
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:36,838
I'm not. Look...

36
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:40,243
I'm excited about you and
me planning the anti-prom.

37
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:43,747
I knew it. I was excited
about the wrong thing.

38
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:47,683
Harper, look, for anti-prom we're
gonna go with a zombie theme.

39
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:50,187
Zombies move really slow,
but they're also scary.

40
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:53,423
Slow but scary is the perfect
combination in a monster...

41
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:55,124
...and a prom.

42
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:01,028
Do you think Zeke would go with me?

43
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:06,233
You like Zeke?

44
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,503
Yeah.

45
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,239
I think he likes me, too.

46
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,041
I slipped and fell in the cafeteria

47
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:15,711
and he stepped around
me like a gentleman.

48
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:20,649
Why don't you go ask him?

49
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,418
Hey, Zeke...

50
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:25,154
We're planning zombie prom on
the same night as regular prom.

51
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:26,990
Oh! I love zombies.

52
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:30,159
It's weird, though. Their slowness
actually makes them scarier.

53
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:34,597
I was wondering if maybe
you would like to...

54
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,802
...be on the committee
to plan zombie prom?

55
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,972
And maybe after we plan it,
we could...

56
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,606
...be on the clean-up committee.

57
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,243
And in between the
planning and cleaning,

58
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:47,978
we might as well...

59
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:50,614
...stop by and make sure
everyone's having a good time.

60
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:55,886
Are you asking me...

61
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:58,422
...to be on three committees?

62
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:04,462
Change my name to
Extracurricular Man! Oh!

63
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:12,936
I totally chickened out.

64
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:16,373
Yeah, but the good news is,
you're dressed like a chicken.

65
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,876
These are penguins.

66
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:22,646
Oh... that's funny.

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,347
'Cause you said...

68
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:25,682
You said chicken,

69
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:29,119
but you're wearing penguins and...

70
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:32,822
Birds.

71
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,329
<i>* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

72
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,431
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

73
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,532
<i>* You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease *</i>

74
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,034
<i>* Yes, please *</i>

75
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:46,936
<i>* But you might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

76
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,805
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

77
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:51,406
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

78
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,940
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

79
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:56,042
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

80
00:03:56,077 --> 00:04:00,045
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

81
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,682
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

82
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:08,252
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

83
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:11,555
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

84
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,726
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

85
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:19,029
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

86
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:22,264
<i>* Because everything is not *</i>

87
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,401
<i>* What it seems *</i>

88
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:34,402

<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

89
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:39,946
And that is why wands are not
supposed to be kept in back pockets.

90
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,213
Yes. Thank you, Dad.

91
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,649
This baby's going in my
front pocket this time.

92
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:54,157
Oh! Wizard mail's here.

93
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:58,194
There's a, uh, package for Max.

94
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,029
And it's not from himself.

95
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:02,231
You finally learned where
to put the return address.

96
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,107
Hey, I've been chosen
to help trial test

97
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:15,943
a new wizard gadget
called the No Fear Ring.

98
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:21,547
Yeah, they, uh, want to see if
this thing makes me fearless,

99
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,348
and then give them feedback.

100
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:25,850
Dude, you don't even know
what the word feedback means.

101
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:31,387
Feedback. They want me to throw up.

102
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:36,091
Yeah. I know how
to sound out words.

103
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:41,528
Besides, I don't care.
They're gonna pay me for it.

104
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,899
I'll just, uh,
sign this permission slip

105
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:49,135
and have them send the check to me.

106
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:52,504
You know, to pay for the
new wand I'm about to buy.

107
00:05:56,644 --> 00:05:58,311
And that, too.

108
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:02,915
Hey, Dad. Guys, I need to get
the word out about zombie prom.

109
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:04,683
Zombie prom?

110
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:08,053
Juliet and I will be at Best Night
Ever with all the normal people.

111
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:13,455
Yes. The wizard-slash-vampire couple should
definitely go to the normal people prom.

112
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:19,527
- Have fun with that.
- We will.

113
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,495
What are you going
to call zombie prom,

114
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,498
A Night to Dis-member?

115
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,770
That's actually not bad idea.
Thank you, Justin.

116
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:35,372
No, no, no. You can't use that.
That was a burn.

117
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:38,508
It's in the burn rule book...

118
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,844
...that's in that bookshelf.

119
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:46,514
So, Max, will you hand
these out at school for me?

120
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,349
I don't know about that, Alex.

121
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,551
I mean I'm getting paid for
this No Fear Ring thing.

122
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:53,720
So... you should
probably pay me for this.

123
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:56,956
You mean, you'll have money so you
should pay me for letting you do it?

124
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,924
- Is that what I meant?
- That's what you said.

125
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:03,361
OK, then. Oh, but can I pay
you after I hand them out?

126
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,864
I should charge you extra
for that. But I won't.

127
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:09,033
Thank you. Just got
to finish up, uh,

128
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:12,236
filling out this permission slip.

129
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:27,449
That permission slip
seemed surprisingly heavy.

130
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:33,688
Mail's here.

131
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,396
Zombie prom?

132
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,165
I'm not going.

133
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,833
Last prom I lost an arm.

134
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,935
I love to dance.

135
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,372
Come on, we never do
anything fun anymore.

136
00:07:57,406 --> 00:08:00,474
Fine, I'll go.

137
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:03,142
But I'm not dancing.

138
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,516
All right, think, Zeke.

139
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,084
I gotta make this prom
special for Juliet.

140
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,654
- She's been to tons of them.
- Juliet's been to lots of proms?

141
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:21,357
Yeah.

142
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:24,526
Because she already... graduated.

143
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,161
Ah, an older lady?

144
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,930
Way to go, buddy.

145
00:08:28,964 --> 00:08:31,332
Hey, you know what they
say about older ladies?

146
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,433
What?

147
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:37,570
They like to eat dinner at 4:
00 and they get amazing discounts.

148
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:40,539
OK. OK, I got it. Maybe...

149
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,641
...I'll get up on stage
with the DJ, right?

150
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:45,377
And I'll serenade Juliet
in front of everyone.

151
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,845
Then, wait, wait, wait...

152
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,715
When the tears are
welling up in her eyes,

153
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:51,716
I'll ask her to go steady.

154
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:53,485
Yeah, serenade?

155
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,953
"Danger. Danger. Will Robinson."

156
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,955
Here's what you do.

157
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:00,323
Pick her up in a
horse-drawn caiage.

158
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:03,659
Girls love alternative
means of transportation.

159
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,394
- Huh?
- Dude!

160
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,929
- Juliet, hey.
- Hi.

161
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:10,031
Hey, OK. I know what I'm gonna do.

162
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,133
I'm gonna take you to prom...

163
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,134
...in a horse-drawn carriage.

164
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:18,037
Every time I've gone to prom
in a horse-drawn carriage,

165
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:19,872
we've ended up having to walk home.

166
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,673
Why, 'cause the horses run away?

167
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,475
Oh, they try.

168
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:26,444
But I'm too fast for them.
Then it's lights out, horsy.

169
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,014
But, you really don't need to
do anything special for prom.

170
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,282
- It's OK.
- OK, fine.

171
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,784
No horse-drawn carriage.

172
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,985
But I'm still gonna serenade you.

173
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,954
Oh, that's pretty good.

174
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:41,256
No one's ever done that before,
Justin. - I knew it.

175
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:45,760
I know nothing about women.

176
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,431
Oh, but hey, so I can't wait to
dig up my parents and tell them.

177
00:09:57,203 --> 00:10:00,406
Zeke, there's only one thing that
will make zombie prom fun for me.

178
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,841
Would you...

179
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,876
...design a decorative
coffin table for snacks?

180
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:09,247
Snack committee? Yeah!

181
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:12,250
Open the lid, get the dip.
I'm on it.

182
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:19,490
Alex, I did it again.
I panicked and completely bailed.

183
00:10:19,524 --> 00:10:21,792
Yeah, ya did.

184
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:23,893
I think I can help you
with your fear. Hang on.

185
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:26,729
Hey, Max.

186
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,900
Good job bussing that table.
High five.

187
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,002
It feels good to be appreciated.

188
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:35,170
Yeah, don't get used to it.

189
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:40,073
Here, put this on.
I borrowed it from Max.

190
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,741
It's a magic No Fear Ring.

191
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:45,144
No Fear Ring? I'm a little scared.

192
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,146
Yeah. Until you put it on.

193
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,747
It goes with what you're wearing.

194
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,482
It does, doesn't it?

195
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,150
But, don't show anybody.

196
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,252
Max doesn't even know I
took it off his finger.

197
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,387
You'd make an amazing pick-pocket.

198
00:10:58,421 --> 00:11:01,489
Hey. It's not a skill I'm proud of.

199
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:04,658
Yes, it is.
It totally comes in handy.

200
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:07,093
Ah! Which reminds me...
Here is your coin purse back.

201
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,596
Sorry.

202
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,168
Zeke. Zombie prom.

203
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:20,137
Me, you, on a date.
Let's do this thing!

204
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,874
- Totally!
- Walk with me.

205
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,942
And keep telling me
things you love about me.

206
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,644
Well, ladybugs are awesome on you.

207
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:30,545
And you walk fast, that's cool.

208
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:32,280
Wow.

209
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,389
<i>* Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi *</i>

210
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,057
<i>* I... * </i>

211
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:46,025
<i>* I, I, I... * Aw, man. </i>

212
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,693
Me, me, me, me? I, I, I, I?

213
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,995
Wow. Self-centered much?

214
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:53,030
I'm doing vocal exercises,

215
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:54,731
so I can serenade Juliet tonight.

216
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:57,099
Singing? In front
of all those people?

217
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,134
Who do you think you are,
Lil' Galileo?

218
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:02,503
No. I can actually sing.
Lil' Galileo? Fast talker.

219
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,172
That's it. That's all he's got.

220
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,307
No, I know you can sing.

221
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:08,842
I'm just saying,

222
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,612
do you really want to do it
in front of all those people,

223
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,814
staring right up at you?

224
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:18,150
Waving their cell phone cameras.
Taking your picture.

225
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:19,852
Putting it on the Internet

226
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:23,322
for people to see over
and over and over again?

227
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:28,660
so people can watch it for
years and years and years.

228
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,831
No, it's gonna,
it's gonna be great,

229
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,366
because after that,

230
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,468
I'm going to ask her
to go steady with me.

231
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:39,872
Go steady? Whose prom are
you going to? Grandpa's?

232
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,274
Going steady is romantic.

233
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:45,076
If you find hysterical laughter
romantic, then you're good.

234
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:48,246
- I'm not nervous, Alex.
- Oh, I didn't ask, but thank you.

235
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:56,085
Max, where's the ring,
dude? I need to borrow it tonight.

236
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,154
Fine, but this thing
doesn't even work.

237
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:00,089
I don't feel the
least bit different.

238
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,860
What?! Where's the ring?

239
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:09,062
Oh. Maybe that's why I
don't feel different.

240
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:11,997
- Hmm...
- Max, where's the ring?

241
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:15,033
I won't have the nerve to serenade
Juliet tonight without that ring.

242
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:17,201
And how in the world am I
going to ask her to go steady?

243
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:21,537
Go steady? Who are you, Grandpa?

244
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:24,238
I promised her I'd sing to her,

245
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:26,940
and without that ring
I'm scared to death.

246
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,542
Hmm. Check my ear.
I have my finger in there a lot.

247
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:33,745
We're done talking.

248
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:43,299
How great is this?

249
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:47,235
We all look gross, no one's smiling,
and we get to drink brains.

250
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:51,272
Do I have any brains in my teeth?

251
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:54,976
- Yes.
- Cool, cool.

252
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,616
Hey, no cutsies.

253
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:07,820
The costume is weak,
but the smell is right on.

254
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:12,057
Wow. Nice skin,
veiny-looking things, man.

255
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:13,491
Way... way to commit, man.

256
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:19,696
Why don't you shuffle yourself
to the back of the line.

257
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,332
Uh, Harper, maybe we should
just let him cut in front.

258
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:25,667
He seems a little dehydrated,
not in the mood to talk.

259
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:29,404
Zeke, how can you be so cute and
so spineless at the same time?

260
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:30,972
I'm going to stand up to this punk.

261
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,483
Real zombie?

262
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,085
OK.

263
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,292
Let's hear it for
the Best Night Ever.

264
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,196
Anyway, um...

265
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,434
I would, uh, I would like to call
up to the stage Juliet Van Heusen.

266
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,674
And before I announce the winner

267
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,111
of the table centerpiece
raffle... over there,

268
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:17,046
I would like to sing to her.

269
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,249
Oh, my gosh,
he's gonna sing to her.

270
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,651
Don't you ever do that to me.

271
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:28,356
Good.

272
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,625
One moment,
just gotta get the beat.

273
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,762
How's that for perfect timing?

274
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:43,698
Hey. This right here,
is the highlight of your whole life.

275
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,468
How do you feel about it now?
That's right.

276
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:55,640
<i>* I'm too nervous to be clever *</i>

277
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:59,978
<i>* But I'd do anything for
you whatever *</i>

278
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:05,015
<i>* To be without you
I'd say never *</i>

279
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:09,919
<i>* It's because you and
I are together *</i>

280
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:11,420
<i>* That makes this *</i>

281
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:14,024
<i>* The best night *</i>

282
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,092
<i>* Ever *</i>

283
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:22,666
- Could this get any worse?
- Hold for it.

284
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,203
I'd like to say one more thing,
people, before you clap.

285
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:27,939
Juliet...

286
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:30,909
...would you like to
go steady with me?

287
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:37,715
Justin, the real zombies
have crashed zombie...

288
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:41,319
I can't hear you. - Real zombies
have crashed the zombie prom.

289
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,555
Uh...

290
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,858
Um... a lot of... a lot of...

291
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:53,630
A lot of you might think
you heard me say zombies.

292
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:57,300
But that's because
it's a zombie prom,

293
00:16:57,335 --> 00:17:02,104
so I say zombies a lot.

294
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:06,275
Just like I did right now.

295
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,415
That is all.

296
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:18,886
What she meant was is the band,
the Real Zombies,

297
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,655
uh, is actually playing
at the zombie prom.

298
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,660
What are you looking at?

299
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,428
I want to have you for dinner.

300
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:32,163
I have a date, jerk. Zeke?

301
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:35,967
- Zeke?
- Psst! Under here.

302
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,335
And now you've made
my date uncomfortable.

303
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:40,737
You're gonna apologize or else
you're gonna meet the king

304
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:42,672
and queen of this prom.

305
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,477
Where's Zeke?

306
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:51,815
- Zeke!
- Justin!

307
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,515
You are a sight for sore eyes.

308
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,017
Harper's standing
up to those creeps.

309
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,251
- She's fearless.
- Got any room under there?

310
00:17:58,486 --> 00:17:59,954
For Juliet.

311
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,989
Or... or, we could stay out
here and I could help you fight.

312
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:07,926
OK. Yeah. Let's do that.

313
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:11,563
Max, save yourself.

314
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:13,197
This place is
infested with zombies.

315
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:16,166
Yeah, I know. I got an
RSVP from some zombies.

316
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:19,036
That's where the flyers went.

317
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,004
Yes. Zombies are coming, man.

318
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,873
But don't worry,
I already locked the doors.

319
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:28,210
Nobody can get in and
we can't get out.

320
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,346
Did you at least find
the No Fear Ring?

321
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:34,315
- I could use it right now.
- Harper has it.

322
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,216
That's why she's standing
up to the zombies.

323
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:39,752
Whoa. Harper has my ring?
I'm going in.

324
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,124
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.

325
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,560
Harper, you gotta
give me my ring back.

326
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,228
I'm a product tester and I
need to file a report on it

327
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,896
in order to get paid.

328
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:58,033
All right, not now.
You know, you don't scare me.

329
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,568
Guys, we've got to help Harper.

330
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:03,337
We've come to help
you get out of here.

331
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:05,472
What? I'm not afraid
of these losers.

332
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:07,507
Uh, if I didn't know any better,

333
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,242
I'd say these zombie
prom-goers were actual zombies.

334
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:12,878
Uh, they're from another
school's drama department.

335
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:16,982
They have an unbelievable costume
designer who also teaches chorus.

336
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:20,352
Costume designer
and chorus teacher?

337
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:23,088
Mr. Santos from Jefferson High.

338
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:26,290
Oh, they must be here
to dance battle us.

339
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:28,224
Dance battle?

340
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:31,559
We do love to dance.

341
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:34,260
It's on!

342
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:37,731
One music video and we're expected

343
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,265
to have dance battles everywhere.

344
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,135
- Come on!
- ]

345
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,282
Yes!

346
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:28,384
Yeah! Yeah! We won, we won!

347
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:31,754
Just once I'd like
to win one of these!

348
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:35,990
That's right,
keep walking, zombies.

349
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:38,758
What kind of zombies can't
even dance a zombie dance?

350
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:40,760
Max, shh! Be quiet.
They're zombies.

351
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:42,327
They could come back
and eat your brain.

352
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:44,095
Yeah?

353
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,831
Good luck trying to eat
these brains, zombies.

354
00:21:46,865 --> 00:21:48,866
My dad says I got a thick skull.

355
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,435
He's not wearing the No Fear Ring,

356
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,805
but he's still not
afraid of anything.

357
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,206
Maybe the ring doesn't work.

358
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,407
But when Harper had it on,
she had no fear.

359
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:01,977
Oh, my gosh.
It doesn't work on him,

360
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:03,812
because he already has no fear.

361
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:05,814
Everybody has fear.

362
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:08,917
Guys, who wants to dare me to
cannonball into that punch bowl?

363
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:11,986
Ahh, you don't have to dare me.
I dare myself.

364
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,521
OK. He has no fear.

365
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:18,758
Alex, anti-prom was more
popular than real prom.

366
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:23,129
Wait. That means next year more
people will want to go to anti-prom.

367
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:26,131
So... then we'll go to real prom.

368
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:28,766
We're always one
step ahead of them.

369
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:40,420
You really know how
to zombie dance.

370
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:44,388
How many, uh, how many zombie
proms have you been to?

371
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,870
- Yes?
- Yes, I'll go steady with you.

372
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,574
You will. That's...

373
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:59,143
That's great,

374
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:02,491
because people sort of
indicated that it was lame,

375
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:05,871
but, like, I don't really
care what people think and...

376
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,012
I'm nuts about you

377
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:10,799
and I just want to make you happy.

378
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:19,053
This is the best night ever.

379
00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:29,054
