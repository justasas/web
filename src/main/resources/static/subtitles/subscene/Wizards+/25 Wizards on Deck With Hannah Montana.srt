1
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,506
Hey!
What are you doing?

2
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,141
Oh, there's nothing
good on TV,

3
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:14,876
so I'm going to watch
Alex do homework.

4
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:17,912
That's a reality show
I've never seen an episode of.

5
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:23,318
Daddy, see?
Too many distractions.

6
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:26,754
It's really Justin's fault that
I've fallen behind in science.

7
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,656
Really? I thought
it had something to do

8
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:30,758
with the 14 missing assignments.

9
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,829
Fourteen?
I thought it was ten.

10
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:38,499
I told you that
four weeks ago.

11
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:41,703
This is why you aren't doing
anything over school break,

12
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:43,671
except take that
science class.

13
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:46,674
It's ironic that the person
who likes school the least

14
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,376
has to do it the most.

15
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,981
Life is funny like that.

16
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:58,386
Here, Justin.
This one's for you.

17
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,389
This is from that
essay contest I entered.

18
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:06,628
"Winner..." Winner, winner!
I won! I won the contest!

19
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:10,031
I won a trip to the S.S. Tipton
Teen Cruise to Hawaii.

20
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:12,834
We're going on a cruise!

21
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,140
Teen cruise.
Family members 18 and under.

22
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:23,011
We're going on a cruise!

23
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:24,912
Ah! Hold on there,
little girl.

24
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:27,215
You're not going anywhere
but that science class.

25
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,851
That's what you get
for missing ten assignments.

26
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:32,487
- It's up to 14 now.
- What?

27
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:35,156
Clearly, we need
to check every week.

28
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,192
Alex, you're gonna come
to the ship with us

29
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:39,827
and drop off your brothers.

30
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:42,530
And maybe seeing all the fun
they're about to have

31
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:44,632
will make you feel
really bad about yourself.

32
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:48,970
- Is that good parenting?
- I think it is.

33
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,305
All right.

34
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,674
Oh, my gosh.
Look...

35
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:56,177
It says here I get a
photo op with London Tipton.

36
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,746
She's beautiful and rich.

37
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:02,450
And famous for doing
absolutely nothing.

38
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:05,486
Aren't you kinda known
for doing nothing?

39
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,854
You think I'm doing nothing,

40
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:09,457
but really I'm planning
something against you.

41
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:12,093
- That's my popcorn. Come on!
- No.

43
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:31,553
Hey, Mr. Moseby.

44
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,822
"Teen Cruise to Hawaii?"
Awesome, huh?

45
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:36,591
If I paint over the word "teen,"
will they go away?

46
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:41,263
Come on, Mr. Moseby.
It can't be that bad.

47
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:43,265
I signed up for the class
you're teaching.

48
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:46,568
Oh, good. I look forward
to matching minds with you.

49
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,804
- Shouldn't be half bad.
- Oh, really?

50
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:54,109
- You plus you equals all bad.
- OK, zzzt!

51
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,588
We're just saying
goodbye to the boys.

52
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,257
- You don't have to wear a life vest.
- Yes, I do.

53
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:12,093
We're on water. And if people
were meant to be on water,

54
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:16,331
we'd be born with these things.

55
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,967
But you have all those swimming
medals from high school.

56
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:21,069
Honey, why do you think
I was so fast?

57
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:23,371
I couldn't wait
to get out of the water.

58
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:29,744
Thank you.

59
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:33,615
Dude, check it out! There's a
marine paleontology exhibit on board.

60
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,251
They must have known
I was coming.

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,854
Was I supposed
to keep an eye on Alex,

62
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,256
- and make sure she didn't sneak away?
- Yes.

63
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,159
When exactly
does that job start?

64
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:49,097
- Russos? The Russo party.
- Right here. Yes.

65
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:50,632
Ah, the contest winners.

66
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,668
Welcome to the S.S. Tipton
Teen Cruise to Hawaii.

67
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:57,372
You know, the
ship's name is "Tipton,"

68
00:04:57,406 --> 00:05:02,310
which has the word "tip" in it.
Which makes me really nervous.

69
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,981
It also has the word
"ton" in it.

70
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:09,451
As in this ship weighs
87,000 tons.

71
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,621
Oh, my gosh.
How does this thing float?

72
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,790
Magic.

73
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:19,694
I'm kidding.

74
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,665
There's no such thing
as magic!

75
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,171
The letter said I would get
a photo op with London Tipton.

76
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:33,108
Justin, don't be disappointed
if she won't talk to you.

77
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:38,580
Maybe there will be a cardboard
cut-out of her you can meet.

78
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:41,983
Now, let me tell you about the
wonderful amenities we have on board:

79
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:45,987
We have an arcade and a hot tub,
a buffet, a basketball court.

80
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:48,623
Oooh! And a state-of-the-art
marine biology lab,

81
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:51,326
- where I'll be teaching class.
- There's a school on board?

82
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,862
- Yes.
- Don't tell Alex.

83
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,465
She'll wear us down until
we let her take her class here.

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,068
Theresa, we must be strong.

85
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:03,805
87,000 tons.

86
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:08,443
Now, I'll take the teens
to their contest-winning cabin.

87
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:11,279
Is it close to, uh,
London Tipton's room?

88
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:15,650
No, but it's close to where we store
the cardboard cut-outs of her.

89
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:20,422
Bye!

90
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:22,724
OK. Let's find Alex
and get out of here.

91
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,360
Right. Before she figures
out there's a school on board.

92
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:28,730
Did you guys know
there's a school on board?

93
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:33,268
- And, there's a 24-hour pizza
bar. - There's a pizza bar?

94
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:37,005
Don't get distracted by the
pizza. That's part of her plan.

95
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,140
But pizza's the second
most distracting food,

96
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:41,343
after ice cream.

97
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:43,545
I wonder if they
have ice cream on board.

98
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,348
OK, I've lost you.

99
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:50,218
Alex, even if we said yes,
you're not even packed.

100
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:53,722
So if I'm packed, I'm good?

101
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:55,323
"Bags from home meet me here,

102
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:57,792
take them there
and bring them near."

103
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:01,262
You packed your bags?

104
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,031
How did you know
you'd be going?

105
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:06,167
I find that if you keep acting like
something you want is gonna happen,

106
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:07,936
a lot of times it does.

107
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:11,706
Listen, if I let you do this, you
have to promise to stay in that class.

108
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:15,276
And find out if there's
any ice cream in there.

109
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,279
Dad, I promise to stay in class.
What else am I going to do?

110
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:21,816
Well... Ah! I'm not gonna
give you any ideas.

111
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,520
Oh, my gosh.
We're sinking.

112
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:28,523
Let's go!
Let's go!

113
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,105
This is the S.S. Tipton
Teen Cruise's best cabin.

114
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:48,676
This is the ship's infirmary.

115
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:51,179
Oh, uh, I don't know
what "infirmary" means,

116
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:54,449
but I'm pretty sure this is
where they treat the sick people.

117
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:57,886
True, we were over-booked,

118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,822
but it is one of our
most sanitary cabins.

119
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,258
At least it was.

120
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,727
Enjoy.

121
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,399
Justin, look.
Check it out.

122
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:13,034
It's one of those arm clocks.

123
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,736
I'm going to go
put it on people

124
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:16,671
and tell them what time
it is inside their bodies.

125
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,208
Bon jour, brothers!
Surprised to see me?

126
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:23,244
No. Surprised that you
know two words of French.

127
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,948
Mom and Dad said as long as I take
my science class on board, I can stay.

128
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:30,118
Mom and Dad also think I got no
shot at meeting London Tipton.

129
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,553
And they're probably right.

130
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:33,321
What would London Tipton
want to do

131
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:36,524
with someone who could only get on
this ship by entering an ess contest?

132
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,461
The photo op will probably be,
"Hello, I wrote an essay."

133
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:41,930
"Oh. Hello, I'm
beautiful and rich."

134
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:46,101
Click! "Wait, my eyes were
closed! Can we... you, busy."

135
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,807
If you want to talk to London
Tipton, just do what I do.

136
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:55,009
Keep acting like something
you want's gonna happen.

137
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:59,180
And a lot of times it just does.
I'm on the cruise, right?

138
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,283
Yeah, you may
be on to something.

139
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,285
Well, get out of here.
I'm about to do something

140
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,587
you don't
wanna know about.

141
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,222
- Does it involve me?
- No.

142
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,023
All right.

143
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:24,806
Hey, I was thinking
while I was in there,

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,808
these tights could be a hat.

145
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:30,145
Why not? See how much fun
this cruise is?

146
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,848
Speaking of fun, I signed you up for
a really cool marine biology course.

147
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:36,651
Marine biology?
That doesn't sound like fun.

148
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:40,622
What? You love marine biology.
Remember that whale-watching trip?

149
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:45,960
- The one when I got seasick? - That
wasn't seasick. That was excited-sick.

150
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:49,130
I do throw up
when I get excited.

151
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:53,968
Well, get ready to vomit, because
you're going to marine biology class.

152
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:56,604
- Thanks, Alex.
- Oh, one more thing though.

153
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,806
You're going to be
Alex Russo when you go.

154
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,808
Well, who are you
gonna be?

155
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:04,812
I'm gonna be the girl having as much
fun as she can, as fast as she can

156
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:07,115
until she gets caught.

157
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,918
Someone get this thing off me!

158
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:12,187
It keeps getting tighter!

159
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,929
Ah, thanks.

160
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:23,865
So, I hear you're randomly
taking people's blood pressure.

161
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,570
I'm Zack. I'm kind of the one on the
ship who does weird and hilarious stuff.

162
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:32,540
Well, good for you. I'm the one who
does incredibly cool, serious stuff

163
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,177
that people laugh at
for no reason.

164
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:39,647
That sounds
like a challenge.

165
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,382
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

166
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,052
It sounds to me like the whole
time you've been talking,

167
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:47,889
I've been trying to figure out
what you meant by "blood pressure."

168
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,994
Oh, it's on. You and me.
Tonight. Easy Squeezy.

169
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,296
We're drinking super-sized
"everything slushies."

170
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:58,499
They give you a slush rush.
See if you can handle it.

171
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,801
You're on.

172
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:24,826
Oh! Excuse me, do you
work in this jewelry store?

173
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,028
Can I see that
in a princess setting?

174
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,163
Jewelry store?

175
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,533
Uh... I don't work here.

176
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:36,404
I was just wondering...

177
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:39,907
Where would you like to
go on our second date?

178
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:42,644
Well, second dates for me
are taking my private jet

179
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:44,646
to one of my four castles
for fried chicken,

180
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:48,016
or taking one of my helicopters to
one of my yachts for fried chicken.

181
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,351
I love fried chicken.

182
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:55,290
Wait a minute. We didn't go out
on a first date. Who are you?

183
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:57,992
Uh, no, I...

184
00:11:58,027 --> 00:12:02,930
I'm... the paleontologist
in charge of this exhibit.

185
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:07,535
Yep. Dr... Fossil.

186
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:12,006
- I'm a doctor.
- Oh, I like doctors.

187
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:15,276
So, Dr. Fossil, if we were
going on a second date,

188
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:18,313
and I'm not saying we are,
because I think the number "second"

189
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:19,847
comes after the number "first,"

190
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,517
but then, I was never really
good with lower case numbers,

191
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:23,851
where would you take me?

192
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,288
I'd take you to the best
restaurant on this ship.

193
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:30,191
The Balcony of the Neptune Room?

194
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:35,330
- That. - Tonight. Eight.
I'll meet you there, Dr. Fossil.

195
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,668
The doctor is in.

196
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,679
- Hi. I'm Alex Russo.
- I'm Cody Martin.

197
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:54,148
I see you like to get to class
before the teacher, too.

198
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,152
I do. And I'm OK with sitting up front,
now that my self-confidence is up.

199
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:02,290
People used to make fun of me behind
my back, but now I'm OK with it.

200
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:06,561
They also find it threatening if you
turn around and say, "I heard that."

201
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,731
Nice to meet you, Alex Russo.
I'm going to remember you.

202
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:11,232
Ah, you don't have to.

203
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:20,341
Ah! I need one more for
the tug of war. Hm? Anyone?

204
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,311
Chance to humiliate
some boys?

205
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,445
Sure, why not!

206
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,117
And the winner gets two tickets
to the Hannah Montana concert.

207
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,686
Oh my gosh,
I love Hannah Montana.

208
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,989
Well, good for you,
girl I don't know.

209
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,226
I'm Bailey.
What's your name?

210
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,896
I'm... girl you don't know.

211
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,565
And, go!

212
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:49,670
- We're slipping. We're slipping!
- Spit on the floor!

213
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,173
Rub your shoes in it.

214
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:56,310
Oh, it's working!
Oh, I get it.

215
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:59,247
- It gets the dust off your shoes to
give traction... - Less talk, more pull!

216
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:00,381
Sorry!

217
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:10,425
Powned!

218
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,194
- What! Eat it.
- Yeah!

219
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:17,799
- And the winner is Bailey and...
- Girl you don't know.

220
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,203
We won! We're going
to Hannah Montana!

221
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:25,306
Massive splash,
and I got nothing.

222
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,278
Now, I will need your name so I
can put it on the winners board

223
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:33,481
- with your picture for everyone to see.
- No, no, no. No names.

224
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:37,251
No board. We didn't win. We
cheated by spitting on the floor.

225
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:42,089
- She told me to, Mr. Moseby.
- After all we've been through?

226
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,693
- Can I still go to Hannah Montana?
- Oh!

227
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,795
Not unless you win
the scavenger hunt.

228
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:51,165
I'm gonna go look for an egg-beater.
There's always an egg-beater.

229
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,303
I will need your name
for the cheaters roster.

230
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:57,939
My name...

231
00:14:57,973 --> 00:14:59,907
...is...

232
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:04,479
Ashley... Olsen.

233
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:11,085
Ashley Olsen, you are the most
honest cheater I've ever met.

234
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:18,793
Ashley Olsen. I can probably
remember that. Ashley... Oh, no.

235
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:20,428
Ah, well.

236
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:29,804
And so I had to go ahead
and operate on him,

237
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:33,774
even though I only had a Swiss
army knife and a bowling ball.

238
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,244
Oh, my gosh!

239
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:37,545
That is so amazing.

240
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,581
You did all that and
you're a teenage doctor?

241
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:45,453
Nope. I did all that because
I'm a teenage doctor.

242
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,358
You know, there are a lot of people
who make up all kinds of stories

243
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:54,195
- just to get close to me.
- Really?

244
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:57,698
Yeah, people lie to me
all the time.

245
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:02,637
- But, you would never lie to me,
would you, Dr. Fossil? - Oh, uh, no!

246
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,809
- London, there's something
I have to tell you. - Me, too.

247
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:12,914
Look, I'm just so glad I finally met
someone who can be real around me.

248
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:16,417
- Now, what were you going to say?
- Nothing.

249
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:19,954
Just that I was gonna remind you that I'm
a teenage doctor and I really like you.

250
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:24,525
Well, I really like you, too.

251
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,394
Oh. Text!

252
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,531
- Oh, what a pain. I have to go.
- What?

253
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:33,267
I really wanna finish
this date, but I can't.

254
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:35,670
I have to go to the main deck
to greet some poor family

255
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:39,140
who had to win a contest to
get on the boat, the Russos.

256
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,143
Oh, that's how you
know you're full.

257
00:16:47,988 --> 00:16:49,555
Max! Dude, I'm in trouble.

258
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,757
London Tipton thinks
I'm the rich Dr. Fossil,

259
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,393
and she's on her way here to take
a picture with the poor Russos.

260
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:55,995
Oh, no. We're poor?

261
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:59,332
Well then, I guess
I can't afford these.

262
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,040
You're gonna be no help.

263
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,711
Where am I gonna
get a disguise?

264
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:14,413
- Harper!
- Hi, Justin!

265
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:16,682
You're good with costumes,
right? I need you to...

266
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:19,852
Well, I'm not sure I have
that material. Harper?!

267
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:21,854
What are you doing here?

268
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,457
I'm part of Alex's scheme.

269
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:28,828
- I need you to be Alex Russo.
- That's also part of Alex's scheme.

270
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:31,230
- Great.
- There's London Tipton!

271
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:34,967
You guys must be the Russos.
Max, Justin and Alex.

272
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:37,870
- London, I know what you're thinking...
- Yeah.

273
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,239
I'm thinking I need to
get this photo op over with,

274
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:42,742
so I can get back
to Dr. Fossil.

275
00:17:42,776 --> 00:17:46,913
Oh, my gosh! You
look just like him!

276
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:48,814
And...

277
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:51,984
...you just met London Tipton.
Have a nice cruise.

278
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:56,622
That girl is really dumb.

279
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,858
And that's coming from me.

280
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:06,432
Time! I finished first.

281
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:09,502
No, I finished first.
This is exactly why I said

282
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:11,270
we shouldn't drink
from the same cup.

283
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:12,939
You can't tell
who finished first.

284
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:16,242
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

285
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:18,177
I have an idea how
we can settle this.

286
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:21,514
- Settle what?
- Don't try to confuse me.

287
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:26,085
Look, I'm gonna beat you at
luggage cart races tomorrow.

288
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,920
Oh, you're on.

289
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,488
Exactly.

290
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,761
Hey, are we even doing
this right, Ashley?

291
00:18:35,796 --> 00:18:38,464
- Ashley...
- Olsen?

292
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:39,765
That's it.

293
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,101
Well, if the object
of the game

294
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:44,670
is to see how many of these
things we can knock overboard,

295
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:48,541
I think we're winning.

296
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:56,048
To see the cells
of this lobster,

297
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,818
you'll stain them with tiny
amounts of methylene blue.

298
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:04,223
- Stains are also how you can tell
me from my brother. Nice one!

299
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:05,791
Thanks.

300
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,661
Anyway. After that,
you'll prepare the lobster

301
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:12,465
with a little bit of butter
and tarragon.

302
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:19,171
How long does it take to
get from the Atlantic Ocean

303
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,840
to the middle of
the Pacific Ocean?

304
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:25,611
- That's an excellent question,
Alex Russo. - Well, that's me!

305
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:30,883
It takes a month of constant
sailing at top speed

306
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,518
if you go
through the Panama Canal.

307
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:34,487
Or you could take the path
Magellan did in 1522

308
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,856
and go around
Cape Horn, but...

309
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,192
- But he died before he got all the
way home. - Knowledge is cool.

310
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:44,697
- So are dead explorers.
- You're an amazing student, Alex Russo.

311
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,966
Well, that's
Alex Russo for you.

312
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,169
That's me. Alex Russo.

313
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:53,873
- Isn't making pizza great, Ashley?
- Yes.

314
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:57,610
I love making my own food.
That's what Ashley...

315
00:19:57,644 --> 00:20:01,047
...Olsen does. Yes!
I gotta write that down.

316
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:03,349
Alex, I need your help.

317
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:05,618
OK, well, that's
gonna be hard.

318
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:09,088
There's no one named Alex here.
Just Bailey and Ashley Olsen.

319
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:10,523
She taught me to spit.

320
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:12,158
Well, I already
knew how to spit,

321
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,460
but she made me OK
with doing it in public.

322
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:16,962
Got it.
Part of the scheme.

323
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:20,566
Ashley, I've got a problem.
Over here.

324
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,905
OK, Alex,
I got exactly what I wanted...

325
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:28,007
- ...a date with London Tipton.
- Great!

326
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,077
- Not great. I lied to get her.
- Still great.

327
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:34,747
No... I got exactly what
I wanted and now it's terrible,

328
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:37,717
- because she's not so smart.
- What do you mean?

329
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:43,422
- Max thinks she's dumb.
- Whoa. You gotta dump her.

330
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:46,258
- I know.
- How are you gonna do it?

331
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:50,129
- I'm just gonna tell her.
- Can I watch?

332
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:53,566
- I'm not gonna cry.
- Ah.

333
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,868
- Where's the finish line?
- The hot tub!

334
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,943
Watch out!

335
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,415
Oh my gosh. Bailey?

336
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:10,850
She's choking!

337
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:12,251
Dr. Fossil, help her.

338
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:14,587
- You're a doctor.
- I don't know how to save her.

339
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,956
What kind of a doctor doesn't
know how to save a person?

340
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:18,991
- Look, I was going to tell you...
- Tell me what?

341
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,060
That you're not
a very smart doctor?

342
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:25,998
Bailey!

343
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:35,541
- Bailey, are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

344
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:37,777
You just saved her life.
What's your name again?

345
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:38,944
Ashley Simpson.

346
00:21:40,614 --> 00:21:41,847
You said Olsen.

347
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,587
Yes, Ashley Simpson Olsen.

348
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:51,190
No, it's not.
It's Alex.

349
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:54,193
- Alex?
- Yeah, my sister, Alex Russo.

350
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:56,529
- She's not Alex Russo.
- Harper!

351
00:21:56,563 --> 00:21:59,632
- Ha! That's Alex Russo.
- Harper!

352
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,467
Harper! I got an "A"
on the first quiz.

353
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,569
Wait a minute.
She just called you Harper.

354
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:06,438
She called you Ashley.
And you called her Alex?

355
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:08,507
OK, what is your name?!

356
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:11,277
I'm gonna clear
this up right now.

357
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:15,948
Her name is Alex Russo.
She's my sister. We... ah!

358
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:20,586
London, I need to explain
something to you.

359
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,689
OK. That girl, whatever
her real name is, saved Bailey.

360
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:26,926
And you, Dr. Fossil, did not.
That is all I need to know.

361
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,994
You're a dumb doctor.

362
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:30,696
And I can't date
someone who's dumb.

363
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:32,631
No matter how handsome
and smart you are.

364
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,935
You're breaking up with me?
For being dumb?

365
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:37,903
- Me?
- That's right.

366
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:40,973
All right.

367
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:44,376
I am dumb.

368
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:46,278
Because I thought
that was gonna be hard,

369
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,714
- and you made it real easy.
- Yeah.

370
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:51,450
You're so dumb, I don't even
know what you're talking about.

371
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:03,162
I've just gotta
know something.

372
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:05,798
Would you ever go
out with someone

373
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:09,101
that worked in a sandwich shop
and wrote stories and essays?

374
00:23:09,135 --> 00:23:13,339
Including one that was good
enough to win him this cruise?

375
00:23:13,373 --> 00:23:15,274
That sounds like Justin Russo.

376
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:17,343
I should've gone out
with him instead of you.

377
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:19,278
I wonder where he is?

What's going on?

381
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,430
Guess what huge star is getting on board our boat?

382
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Ferran AdriÃ , the head chef of El Bulli?

383
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,990
No. Guess again.

384
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,170
Takeru Kobayashi, five-time world champion hot dog eater?

385
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,030
Wow, you guys are lousy guessers. It's Hannah Montana.

386
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,440
She's taking our boat on the teen cruise to Hawaii.

387
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,370
I wanted to see her perform in Honolulu, but it's sold out.

388
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,420
Well, it just so happens I know Hannah Montana.

389
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,210
She once stayed at the Tipton.

390
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,320
She even ate cake off my brother's shirt.

391
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,720
Does he still have the shirt?

392
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,160
Does he still have the cake?

393
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,570
Cody, if you get me tickets, I'll love you forever.

394
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,170
Forever?

395
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,680
That's a long time.

396
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,220
Consider it done.

397
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,990
Back! International superstar coming through.

398
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,530
Who is it? Who is it?

399
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,490
Right.

400
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,330
Miss. Montana, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the...

401
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,590
I said get back.

402
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,410
Don't touch me.

403
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,100
Kirby!

404
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,870
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Moseby, you're so little

405
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,800
I mistook you for one of those chicks.

406
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,100
I was just protecting Hannah.

407
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,120
Protect me!

408
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,110
-Where's Cody?  -Down here.

409
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,020
Did you see Hannah?

410
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,010
No, I'd like to see a chiropractor.

411
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,260
So, what do you recommend?

412
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,080
Me... with whipped cream.

413
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,950
Thanks, but I'm already nauseous

414
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,450
from the whole boat rockin' thing.

415
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,900
Zack, you think messing with

416
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,150
a man's botanical rinse is funny?

417
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,470
I think any man who uses a botanical rinse is funny.

418
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,600
Sorry.

419
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,230
Great. Now, I have to go wash, rinse and repeat

420
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,430
and repeat and repeat.

421
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,600
I haven't seen you around. I'm Zack.

422
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,570
And I'm being hauled away.

423
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,920
Did you do that to his hair?

424
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,130
No, I'm being good, remember?

425
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,870
Did you finish all your science homework?

426
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,420
I said I was being good, not boring. That's your job.

427
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,510
And you know what your job's gonna be...

428
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:31,990
"Thank you, enjoy the movie... thank you, enjoy the movie."

429
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,820
Wow... your brother thinks you're gonna end up

430
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,480
in a dead-end, going-nowhere, minimal wage job?

431
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,680
We have so much in common! Don't we?

432
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,220
Wow! That suitcase sure is roomy.

433
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,710
Yeah, it is. Check this out.

434
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,130
Hello...

435
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,810
That's the same echo I get from my closet back home.

436
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,400
It's so big, it has its own Congressmen.

437
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,640
Really? Do you want it?

438
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,520
All it's gonna cost you is a lunch with a charming,

439
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,630
handsome young man.

440
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,090
Is he in there, too?

441
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,920
No, I was talking about me.

442
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,760
Thank you,

443
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,340
but I've already tried one nut from your family tree.

444
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,230
No, no, no, no, believe me. I'm nothing like my brother.

445
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,850
He thinks he's so cool because he wears clean clothes,

446
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,400
and showers everyday.

447
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,110
And that's why the cat won't lick you...

448
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,610
even when you're covered in chicken liver.

449
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,000
No! You can't meet Hannah Montana.

450
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,600
She's busy... er... writing a song.

451
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,450
Check that. She's eating a salad.

452
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,400
Dang it. Anything she does causes a riot.

453
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,550
You know, when I agreed to come on this teen cruise,

454
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,920
I thought it would be fun,

455
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,390
thought it'd be relaxing.

456
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,110
I just forgot about all the dang...

457
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,210
I got it, I got a picture of Hannah Montana.

458
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,260
...teens.

459
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,250
Yeah, what's the matter with kids today?

460
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,080
Get back.

461
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,850
Hi, Kirby. I'm here to see Hannah Montana.

462
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,740
You and everybody else on this boat, but no can-do.

463
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,550
It's my job to keep that southern bell from getting dinged.

464
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,330
I'm a close personal friend of hers.

465
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,380
That's what they all say. Prove it.

466
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,670
Tell me something about her no one else knows.

467
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,680
She loves knock knock jokes. You wannna see?

468
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,560
-Watch. Knock, knock...  -Who's there?

469
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,020
Okey-dokey.

470
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,120
Miss. Montana, your friend Cody is here to see you.

471
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't know a Cody. Here's a picture.

472
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,280
But I don't want a picture.

473
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,440
I say we take off our wigs and go out there

474
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,600
and hit the wave pool.

475
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,540
Oh yeah, I'll just come as Hannah

476
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,550
and leave as Miley.

477
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,380
That won't give away anything.

478
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,670
Well, I'm going out there because nobody cares about Lola...

479
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,940
They cared about Lola.

480
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,460
Morning, ladies. Hah, perfect,

481
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,290
just what I need after the stress of

482
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,260
saving those dolphins from the tuna nets.

483
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,660
Just get in... get in... get in... get in...

484
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,890
What are we getting in?

485
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,900
Trouble if you don't zip it.

486
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,130
I'm sick of Justin's attitude so...

487
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,770
I put a little surprise in the hot tub for him.

488
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,520
Alex, that's classic, but you're not supposed to use...

489
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,990
Science? I learned this in class.

490
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,470
Who knew school would ever come in handy?

491
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,180
Oh man, Justin's gonna be so mad. Look,

492
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,020
his face's turning red, his body's blue.

493
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,350
Just stick a few stars and we can

494
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,650
fly him off the back of the boat.

495
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,210
I'm not scared of Justin.

496
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,490
Oh my heavens.

497
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,210
When I find out who did this, I will feed them to the sharks,

498
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,520
except for the heads, so they can watch the whole thing.

499
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,690
Hey I'm scared of.

500
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,700
I know exactly who's gonna be shark-bit.

501
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,880
As do I.

502
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,460
-Alex. Zack? What?  -Zack. Alex? What?

503
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,970
This was Alex, I know my sister.

504
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,030
This was Zack, I know my hooligan.

505
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,260
-But...  -Look, look, look... this is getting us nowhere.

506
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,960
We can either go out and find who did this

507
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,440
or we can stand here and argue until we are blue in the face.

508
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,640
Might as well. I'm already blue in everywhere else.

509
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,080
Alex!

510
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,760
Zack!

511
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,420
Hi!

512
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,700
Zack, is this your cabin? Let's check it out.

513
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,810
Thank you.

514
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,620
-Wow.  -You like my place, huh?

515
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,270
Like it? I can't see it.

516
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,290
Oh that stench's making my eyes tear up.

517
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,170
Blink fast, it helps.

518
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,910
Zack!

519
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,690
I'll go get rid of him.

520
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,680
Okay, you do that. I'm gonna hide or tidy things up, yeah.

521
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,750
Oh, that's disgusting.

522
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,460
-You...  -I didn't do it.

523
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,990
-Oh yes you did.  -I swear I didn't.

524
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,790
By the way, what is it that I didn't do?

525
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,560
You put blue dye in the hot tub.

526
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:21,360
Dye... dye? No, I've done soap bubbles, pudding,

527
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,250
teabags, rubber foot, electric eels, but no dye.

528
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,850
How could I have missed dye?

529
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,390
You didn't. I found this right outside your door.

530
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,820
I knew it was you.

531
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,580
-But that's not...  -Your butt is confined to this cabin.

532
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,810
You're left to entertain yourself

533
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,210
with whatever is in this room.

534
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,180
I think I can make that work.

535
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,300
London, I need you to call Hannah Montana for me.

536
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,500
Don't you ever mention that name.

537
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,330
She refused for the theme song to

538
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,980
Yay Me, Starring London Tipton on her next album.

539
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,070
Why would you expect Hannah to...

540
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,430
Don't test me, boy.

541
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,720
Look, I told you never to say Hannah Montana.

542
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,690
I can't believe I said it.

543
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,670
This is impossible.

544
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,980
Either I need a softer coconut or a harder straw.

545
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,170
Cody?

546
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,250
Sorry. I couldn't get Bailey tickets.

547
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,600
I guess I'm just gonna have to tell her the truth.

548
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,680
Or you could tell her aliens came down and threatened

549
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,820
to disintegrate the earth if you didn't give them

550
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,680
your tickets to see Hannah in Hawaii.

551
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,040
Something tells me that coconut hit you on the head.

552
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,430
Ok, I've been trying to decide

553
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,150
how to wear my hair to the Hannah concert.

554
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,680
I could go with the funky updo, right, right?

555
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,740
Or half up half down, that's kind of cool, right?

556
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,710
Or... or.. the whole funky rocker mosh pit thing, okay?

557
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,200
Like this, yeah?

558
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,160
Bailey, I know I kind of promised you

559
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,650
I could get you those tickets to Hannah.

560
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,300
I know. Can you believe it?

561
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,820
My guy is getting me tickets to a sold-out concert.

562
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,380
My guy?

563
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,600
Yeah. Unfortunately,

564
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,270
there's been an inter-galactic incident, so...

565
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,730
Enough about your stupid commics.

566
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,590
Bailey's trying to dicide how she should wear her hair

567
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,420
to the concert, which her guy is taking her to.

568
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,050
I know, I'll wear it down.

569
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,470
Now we're gonna find a great outfit to go with my hair.

570
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,040
I'll go check London's trash.

571
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,990
You're so home free with the alien thing.

572
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,660
Now what am I supposed to do?

573
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,480
Look to the Heavens and plead?

574
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,180
I want Hannah Montana tickets to Hawaii.

575
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,850
Want Hannah Montana tickets to Hawaii?

576
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:43,530
Two tickets to Hannah Montana's concert in Hawaii

577
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,570
for the winner of our Teen Cruise scavenger hunt.

578
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,830
-Did you hear that?  -Darn right I did.

579
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,770
I want a robot that makes pancakes.

580
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,590
Ok, well, I'm gonna clear out, okay.

581
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,290
Wait, you can't leave me.

582
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,040
I'll be in solitary confinement.

583
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,700
I'll be forced to dig an escape tunnel,

584
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,200
which will wind up sinking the boat.

585
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,510
You should just confess, you'll feel so much better afterwards.

586
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,050
Maybe get out of your room sooner.

587
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,610
Like me, right now, Ok?

588
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,220
But I didn't do it.

589
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,990
I'd never pull such a lame prank.

590
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,590
What do you mean, lame?

591
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,430
It had amateur written all over it.

592
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,370
Are you calling whoever did this an amateur?

593
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,030
That's it. Lame, amateur,

594
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,710
it was Cody.

595
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,530
I bet he's getting back at me for my brilliant hair prank.

596
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,070
Oh yeah, glue in a brush, real brilliant.

597
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,120
But I need proof, a witness.

598
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,040
Look, I'm gonna go back to the sky deck

599
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,870
and see if anybody saw who did this, all right?

600
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,040
Maybe I'll go with you, I'm a really good interrogator.

601
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,770
Oh, would you...

602
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,570
Hello, London, I brought... I brought you a present.

603
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,010
Dirt...

604
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,380
With seeds and the baby flowers will grow just like our love.

605
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,720
You're odd, but you're dormy. And I like that. Have a seat.

606
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,210
Ok, silver bell, toy train, egg timer...

607
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:35,790
What idiot puts a sword fish on a scavenger hunt list?

608
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,220
Ok, this scavenger hunt is out of control,

609
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,350
some kids just tried to take

610
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,750
this yellow barrette out of my hair.

611
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,210
(Get it away.)

612
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,650
Thank goodness we already have our tickets,

613
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,150
so we don't have to do anything stupid like this scavenger hunt.

614
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,550
Yeah... but you should probably give us that barrette...

615
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,180
to keep it safe.

616
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,950
Good idea. Thanks.

617
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,410
Yeah, and if you have a rutabaga, you should give us that too.

618
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,230
I might have one in my locker.

619
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,110
Then what are we standing here for?

620
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,140
We have a waxy vegetable to protect.

621
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,930
Okay, you snoop around the hot tub,

622
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,960
and I'll go ask your brother if he saw anything.

623
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,370
No, I'll go ask him because he's my brother and I love him.

624
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,420
You say anything about my P-R-A-N-K

625
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,710
and I will pound you so hard

626
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,640
that you'll be sneezing out of your belly button.

627
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,920
That's gonna be very awkward during allergy season.

628
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,610
Does this have anything to do with whatever she was spelling?

629
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,290
London, I'm not allowed to tell you, but

630
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,920
Y-E-S.

631
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,480
Fine, don't tell me.

632
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,060
I found this test tube outside of Zack's door.

633
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,110
Now this clearly proves that he is to blame

634
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,890
and now he has escaped from his cabin.

635
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,880
Oh, please. Alex probably planted that evidence.

636
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,020
She is an evil genius.

637
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,540
She is an evil genius? No, Zack is an evil...

638
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,700
well... he's not a genius, more of an evil nincompoop.

639
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,970
I'm sorry, ma'am. I swear I didn't see anything.

640
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,080
Look, I didn't even want to see anything.

641
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,010
Ok, we have the rutabaga.

642
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,720
Now all I need to win those tickets

643
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,830
and Bailey's heart is a silver chalice.

644
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,560
Good luck finding that.

645
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,310
Oh yeah, you better run.

646
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,570
-How could you?  -How could you?

647
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,090
-My own brother. What?  -My own brother. What?

648
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,960
Do they always talk at the same time like that?

649
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,610
Tricky, isn't it?

650
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,700
How could you frame me?

651
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

652
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,300
But I need to find a silver chalice before the com...

653
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,990
Attention, Hannah fannas,

654
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:17,890
the scavenger hunt is now over and we have our winner.

655
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,650
No!

656
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,630
-You!  -You!

657
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,130
This is the miscreant who turned you blue.

658
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,800
Hah, no, it's not. It was her.

659
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,140
Justin, Mr. Moseby is our host on this lovely cruise

660
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,110
and you insult him by arguing with him. Come brother.

661
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,360
Wait a minute, I recognise those warn-twisting

662
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,090
manipulations followed by a hasty exit. It was you.

663
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,110
Sure, blame me.

664
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,820
Because it was you.

665
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,790
Looks like I caught ya blue handed.

666
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,170
Told you.

667
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,710
You played me like a violin.

668
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,050
You're sneaky, deceitful, underhanded...

669
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,780
Where have you been all my life?

670
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,850
I'll tell you where she's gonna be...

671
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,660
grounded while we're in Hawaii.

672
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:25,490
Who's got the blues now? Blue...

673
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,260
Oh, let's just look at the time.

674
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,810
Mr. Moseby.

675
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,900
Isn't there something that you'd like to say to me?

676
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,740
Maybe sonething that rhymes with "I'm Flory"?

677
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,400
First off, let me say that you're incredibly flannoying,

678
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,990
but I am sorry that I accused you of

679
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,150
putting dye in the hot tub.

680
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,840
However, in the process, you confessed to 6 unsolved pranks.

681
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,910
You're so in trouble.

682
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,410
Apology accepted.

683
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,370
OK.

684
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,450
Cody, isn't Hawaii the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?

685
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,480
Second most beautiful.

686
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,830
Bailey, I need to talk to you.

687
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,330
First, I want you to help me pick

688
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,540
which greeting tunes when I meet Hannah Montana.

689
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,070
I could go country... Howdy Hannah...

690
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,990
or sophisticated... How do you do, Miss. Montana...

691
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,540
or Japanese... Konijiwa Hannah sang...

692
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,480
They're all great

693
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,840
except for the fact that we don't have tickets.

694
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,150
I'm sorry, what?

695
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,730
It sounded like you said we don't have tickets.

696
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,050
Look, I'm really sorry, Bailey.

697
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,160
I tried everything to get those tickets for you.

698
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,140
I thought you knew Hannah.

699
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,070
Well, she didn't remember me and Kirby wouldn't let me in

700
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,050
and London couldn't help me,

701
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,350
so I tried to win the scavenger hunt.

702
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,580
Here's your barrette back, by the way.

703
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,380
Then Zack accused me of framing him and...

704
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,210
What was that for?

705
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,050
To get you stop babbling.

706
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,080
I need to babble more often.

707
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,860
And because no one's ever gone through

708
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,880
so much trouble for me.

709
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,510
Thank you.

710
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,070
You're welcome.

711
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,400
Hey guys, want a bite of the birthday cake?

712
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,460
Whose birthday is it?

713
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,430
I don't know, some guy.

714
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,360
Whenever I hear singing, I just go in the room.

715
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Oh, dude. Isn't that Hannah Montana

716
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,350
sunbathing on the port side deck?

717
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,160
Hurry. I hear she's like totally signing autographs.

718
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,610
I am so over this teen cruise.

719
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,630
My cake...

720
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,140
Maybe there's still some after the party.

721
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,150
Thank you, Mr. Moseby. Thanks for clearing out the lobby.

722
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,550
Oh, absolutely. Enjoy the starboard deck.

723
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,900
Is that where they have the wave pool?

724
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,070
-Oh and the rock climbing wall?  -And the parasailing?

725
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,670
Oh yeah. It's a month of fun.

726
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,690
Unfortunately, you have about 5 minutes until

727
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,700
they realize you're not sunbathing on the port deck

728
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,170
and start hunting you down like

729
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,570
angry fire ants... Hannah...

730
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,450
Enjoy.

731
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,070
You're... you're... Konijiwa

732
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:19,910
Bless you.

733
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,680
Hey, now I remember you.

734
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,330
I "cake off" you.

735
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,610
No, that was actually my twin brother.

736
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,620
I was the cute one standing next to him.

737
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,940
Oh and you kept the shirt, my fans are awesome.

738
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,710
Yeah, you're telling me. Remember that one

739
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,990
who sent you like a corn cop carving of yourself?

740
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,530
You got it?

741
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,890
Yeah... and I loved it.

742
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,850
So... um... you guys coming to my show tonight?

743
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,410
We'd love to, but it was all sold out.

744
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,990
You wouldn't happen to know anyone

745
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,610
who could get us tickets, would you?

746
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,450
Oh, I think I can pull some strings.

747
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:00,010
Here's the tickets... and back stage passes.

748
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,000
Oh, wait, sorry. That's my coupon.

749
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,700
One more stamp and I get a free cupcake.

750
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,240
Thank you, thank you. Arigato.

751
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,770
Yeah, I gotta go, too.

752
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,750
Cody, this is gonna be the best date ever.

753
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,000
-Date?  -Oh yeah.

754
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,140
Excuse me a second.

755
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:29,610
Yes, my six-month plan worked.

756
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:41,980
-London?  -Um?

757
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,820
I've had so much fun with you these last few days

758
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,080
-and there's just one more thing that I need to ask you.  -OK.

759
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,540
You're not gonna ask me to marry you, are you?

760
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:56,610
No, no. I was gonna ask if you wanted a shoe shine.

761
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,330
Oh, then yes.

762
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,270
You know, Max, no man has ever treated me as well as you do.

763
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,330
He's not a man, he's a child.

764
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,710
Well, for now.

765
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,500
So you'll wait for me then?

766
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,450
I can't promise that,

767
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,920
but 5 years from now, when we're in the same grade,

768
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,610
you can sit next to me.

769
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,240
Yes.

770
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,730
I am never gonna wash this cheek again.

771
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,960
But um... sorry, you have to wash those hands.

821
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:48,247

00:47:48,955 --> 00:47:50,820

823
00:47:50,857 --> 00:47:53,553

to the sound guy,

824
00:47:53,593 --> 00:47:55,322

825
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:56,828
You know, l¡ke, uh...

826
00:47:56,863 --> 00:47:58,387

827
00:47:58,431 --> 00:48:00,058
''Boo!''

828
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:06,035
Well, unless Boo's last name
¡s You St¡nk, don't th¡nk so.

829
00:48:06,072 --> 00:48:08,165
L¡lly, come on, let's face ¡t.

830
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:10,334
Everyth¡ng went wrong
because l don't have Mom's anklet.

831
00:48:10,376 --> 00:48:12,207
F¡rst, we know
the anklet's ¡n th¡s room,

832
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:13,337
so we're go¡ng to f¡nd ¡t.

833
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:14,971
Maybe ¡t's ¡n the bathroom.

834
00:48:15,014 --> 00:48:18,177
And second, the rehearsal
probably went bad because

835
00:48:18,217 --> 00:48:21,152
you knew you d¡dn't have the anklet
and so you were nervous.

836
00:48:21,187 --> 00:48:22,848
lt's not l¡ke ¡t has mag¡cal powers

837
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:25,221

Ever s¡nce l lost ¡t,
noth¡ng's gone r¡ght.

1174
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:10,027
l had the worst rehearsal ever.

1175
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:12,723
l m¡ssed steps, l sang flat...

1176
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:14,356
...forgot words.

1177
01:05:15,834 --> 01:05:18,325
Honey, now that stuff
happens to every rock star.

1178
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,632
Oh, really?

1179
01:05:19,671 --> 01:05:22,196
Does every rock star end up
w¡th a torn up hotel room,

1180
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,973
a broken m¡rror, green ha¡r
and a rat on the¡r head?

1181
01:05:27,012 --> 01:05:32,075
That'd be cons¡dered a slow n¡ght
on an Ozzy Osbourne tour.

1182
01:05:32,117 --> 01:05:35,052
Dad, you don't get ¡t.

1183
01:05:35,086 --> 01:05:36,110
Just...

1184
01:05:37,155 --> 01:05:40,420
...w¡thout Mom up there
on stage w¡th me...

1185
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:41,857
...l'm gonna blow ¡t.

1186
01:05:41,893 --> 01:05:45,954
l know what you mean.
l used to worry about the same th¡ng.

1187
01:05:45,997 --> 01:05:47,487
Ra¡s¡ng you k¡ds w¡thout her.

1188
01:05:49,034 --> 01:05:50,661
But l d¡d ¡t.

1189
01:05:50,702 --> 01:05:52,567
You know how?

1190
01:05:52,604 --> 01:05:55,801
'Cause she was w¡th me
every step of the way.

1191
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,330
R¡ght ¡n here.

1192
01:05:58,743 --> 01:06:00,506
And anklet or no anklet,

1193
01:06:00,545 --> 01:06:02,513
¡t's the same th¡ng for you.

1194
01:06:02,547 --> 01:06:05,482
She's w¡th you, r¡ght there.

1195
01:06:06,384 --> 01:06:09,080
- You really th¡nk so?
- l know so.

1196
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,055
Who do you th¡nk always rem¡nded me
to br¡ng the back-up w¡g?

1197
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,559
[d¡stant horn blows]

1198
01:06:16,595 --> 01:06:18,790
Huh. Look at that.

1199
01:06:19,698 --> 01:06:23,464
Turn¡ng out to be a beaut¡ful day
for a concert ¡n Hawa¡¡.

1200
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:35,973
Hey! What are you guys

1201
01:06:36,014 --> 01:06:39,006
Don't you have t¡ckets to my concert?
And the after-party?

1202
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,210
Let's go.

1203
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,050

Oh, my gosh, Cody, d¡d you do th¡s?

1205
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:45,513
Ba¡ley, look...

1206
01:06:45,557 --> 01:06:47,889
...¡f th¡s relat¡onsh¡p
doesn't have honesty,

1207
01:06:47,926 --> 01:06:49,860
¡t doesn't have anyth¡ng.

1208
01:06:49,894 --> 01:06:52,192
Yes. Yes, l d¡d.

1209
01:06:56,868 --> 01:06:58,961
Let's rock, Hawa¡¡!

1210
01:06:59,004 --> 01:07:01,029
<i>Why would you rather be</i>

1211
01:07:01,072 --> 01:07:03,404
<i>Anywhere else w¡th me</i>

1212
01:07:03,441 --> 01:07:05,807

<i>Check out the scenery</i>

1215
01:07:10,115 --> 01:07:12,049
<i>We won the lottery</i>

1216
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:14,108
<i>/ tell you, man
/t's all r¡ght here</i>

Th¡rd camera, mark.

1218
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:20,790
That w¡g has got to come off

1219
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:22,349
And that day ¡s today!

1220
01:07:22,394 --> 01:07:25,363

1221
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:26,421
Let's rock th¡s...

Sorry.

1230

But the last th¡ng
l need ¡s to be robbed...

1231
01:07:53,525 --> 01:07:56,255
Not ''robbed'' and not ''last th¡ng''.

1232
01:07:56,795 --> 01:07:58,285
