1
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:04,268
The best superhero
crime fighter on the planet

2
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:06,768
is Mr. Spandex Avenger.

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:10,868
Ooh, cute tights. Oh, my gosh.
I totally have the same pair.

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,504
Mr. Spandex Avenger isn't
as tough as my robot.

5
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:20,838
Your robot has
an ice cream tub head.

6
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:23,105
Aren't those the lights
from Dad's bike?

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,605
Yeah, yeah. You watch.

8
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:27,874
My robot's gonna win the gold
medal at the Robot Olympics.

9
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,216
Sorry, I'm late.

10
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:40,379
The group project presentation
is due today:

11
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:42,246
Wall walking.
Let's see it.

12
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,645
- You didn't work on your group project?
- I wanted to.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,913
But Alex wouldn't
take time from Dean.

14
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,348
I like that Dean.
Very nice boy.

15
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:57,483
Thank you, Dad.
Besides, I made time.

16
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:00,352
- You were building a friend.
- I have friends.

17
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:02,454
And they're all
building robots, too.

18
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:04,723
Hey, we just doubled
our clique. Sweet.

19
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:08,625
- Max?
- Dad, can't talk now.

20
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,225
Look, working together as a team
is extremely important.

21
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:16,691
We'll practice wall walking now.
Alex, Justin, grab your wands,

22
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:19,924
and stand on
either side of Max.

23
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,194
All right. Now,
say "havity no gravity."

24
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:26,996
Havity no gravity.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,629
OK, Max.
Walk up the wall.

26
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,170
Oh! Hey!

27
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:45,204
There's my emergency hamburger
on the top shelf.

28
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:49,306
- Alex, Justin, concentrate.
- Dean texted me back!

29
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:55,510
Your phone's interfering
with my robot.

30
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:59,179
- Come on, don't...
- Whoa!

31
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:03,483
...lose your concentration.
Max, are you OK?

32
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:06,652
Nope! This is an emergency!

33
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:10,386
And I can fix it
with my emergency burger.

35
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,927
Yo, Russo.
How about a root beer?

36
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,695
No thanks, I'm working.

37
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:16,564
No, I mean how about
some more root beer?

38
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,833
I'm not thirsty.

39
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,472
I was trying to
get you to come over there

40
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,340
so I could ask you if you'd like
to go roller skating Friday night.

41
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,309
You mean like on a date?
Our first date?

42
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:34,377
You want it
to be our first date?

43
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:37,478
No, first dates are sappy.

44
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:40,847
But we have to go
on a first date sometime.

45
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:44,449
Not if we call this fun little
exchange our first date.

46
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:46,751
It was fun.
I had a great time.

47
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,786
Thanks for walking me home.

48
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:59,828
So I hear you and Dean are going
out on a date Friday night.

49
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:04,633
How did you possibly hear that?
He just asked me a minute ago.

50
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:07,803
My robot's got hyper-hearing.
I'm tapped into his signal.

51
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:09,571
Harper and I have
been testing it out.

52
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:18,479
Well, your robot heard right.
Dean and I are going skating.

53
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:21,949
Well, you'd better be careful with
that one because Dean has a reputation.

54
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:26,386
He is dangerous! He has a key
chain with a bottle opener on it!

55
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:29,221
He even uses it
on twist-offs!

56
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:36,026
No, a reputation with girls. There's a corner
of the roller rink known as Dean's Corner.

57
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:37,728
Where he takes
girls to kiss them.

58
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:41,331
That's true, Alex!
He's a kisser!

59
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,339
Change channel!
Change channel!

60
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:56,980
I don't know, Alex! With Dean's
reputation, I'd be nervous!

61
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:59,214
Oh, would you!

62
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,417
My goodness, Harper!

63
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:06,487
People make that stuff up.
The point is I like him a lot

64
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:09,424
- and I'm gonna go skating with him.
- Hey, Alex, good news.

65
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,726
Two couples are gonna
come roller skating with us:

66
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:14,495
Joey and Kate and that
Zeke guy really wants to come.

67
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,065
So I'm thinking
we should find him a date.

68
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,402
- Maybe you could talk to your
friend Harper. - I'm right here.

69
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:25,304
- I'm her friend Harper.
- Oh! Nice to meet you.

70
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,640
You're not as weird
as everyone says.

71
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:31,377
Thank you. You are as scary
as everyone says.

72
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,546
Thank you!

73
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,614
Great, so we're all going
to the roller rink.

74
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:42,820
A group date? I thought this
was gonna be an alone thing.

75
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:47,157
- What am I, 15?
- Yeah, Alex. You are 15.

76
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:51,494
Would you just
let me be mad?

77
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:54,130
Alex, I just got off the phone
with your math teacher.

78
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:57,432
- You haven't turned in the last three assignments?
- Really?

79
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,101
That's the first
I've heard of this.

80
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:00,969
First you've heard
of the assignments?

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,070
No, the first I've heard
I'm in math.

82
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,307
Do your homework.

83
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,343
Fine. I need your help
with something.

84
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,345
I'm not doing
your math homework.

85
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,548
No, no. It's about
my first alone date with Dean.

86
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,451
It's gone from awosome to a
six-some. It's totally wrecked.

87
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:21,320
Oh, yeah! That happened
to me when I was your age.

88
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:24,623
- But I eliminated the other couples.
- Really? How? What did you do?

89
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:28,725
Well, I challenged the girls
to a breakdance competition.

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,794
You should be good, beat them
and humiliate them into not going.

91
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,762
Always start with
the popping and the locking...

92
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,731
...before you go
into the ground work.

93
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:42,367
- Like this.
- OK. Wow!

94
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,538
That's good, Mom.
I'll definitely do that.

95
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,341
Oh! I think something popped
and something locked.

96
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,551
Yeah, Kate. I know you had your
heart set on going skating,

97
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,320
but I hear Tears of Blood
arplayinan impromptu concert

98
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,721
in the park
this Friday night.

99
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:06,922
T.O.B. playing?
Their drummer recovered?

100
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:09,624
No! I'm trying to
get rid of people

101
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,326
so I can go on my
alone date with Dean.

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,094
Yep, they're
totally playing.

103
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,797
I know they're your favorite
band. That's why I'm telling you.

104
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:19,033
- They're my favorite band, too. Ask if I can go.
- Stop it!

105
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:22,169
Um, so, um, we'll miss you
at the roller rink.

106
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:25,705
OK, bye!

107
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:28,307
OK. One couple down,
one to go.

108
00:07:28,342 --> 00:07:30,609
- And try to keep up.
- I'm keeping up.

109
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:33,078
I'm gonna go call
the ticket broker right now.

110
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:36,782
There is no... He why
don't you give me the money.

111
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:38,617
I'll get you some tickets.

112
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,922
I can't believe it!

113
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:48,090
Somebody's been robbing delis
in alphabetical order.

114
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,792
They're calling him

115
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:53,461
"The Alphabetical Order
Deli Robber."

116
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:56,630
- What?
- Yeah.

117
00:07:56,665 --> 00:08:00,467
He started with the Aardvark
CafÃ©, then he hit the Banana Hut,

118
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:03,068
and he's worked his way up
to the Umbrella Stand.

119
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:07,771
- Umbrella Stand Deli?
- It's food you can eat in the rain.

120
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:11,841
- Oh.
- According to this article,

121
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,543
the robber's been stealing
money out of tip jars.

122
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:17,445
So what? You don't
give us the tips anyway, Dad.

123
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,080
And you know half that money's
'cause of these dimples right here.

124
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:25,648
Oh, well, he's also
taking all the cupcakes.

125
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:29,517
Cupcakes?
What a messed up world!

126
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:33,820
- What are the cops doing about it?
- Nothing.

127
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:38,423
I ess they're too busy with criminals
who steal big things like cars and jewels.

128
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,325
Are you kidding me?

129
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,128
I haven't used a car
or a jewel in years,

130
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:46,162
but I eat a cupcake
every morning.

131
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:50,531
Yeah, that's why your dentist sends
me a Christmas gift every year.

132
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,332
Wait a minute.

133
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,134
If the Deli Robber just robbed
the Umbrella Stand Deli,

134
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,702
then that would mean...

135
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,438
<i>âª A B C D E F G
H I J K L M N O P âª</i>

136
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:04,107
<i>âª Q R S T U... âª V!</i>

137
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,908
The Viking Deli
is probably next.

138
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:08,310
- That's just down the block!
- Yes, it is, Maxy.

139
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:10,745
And after the Viking Deli,
then...

140
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,347
<i>âª A B C D E F G
H I J K L M N O P âª</i>

141
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:18,318
<i>âª Q R S T U V... âª</i>

142
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:21,287
W! Waverly Sub Station!
That's us!

143
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:25,424
Oh, boy, if only The Spandex Avenger
were real, he could stop the Deli Robber.

144
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:31,728
Introducing...

145
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:34,698
...Maximan!

146
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:45,073
Uh... Max,
what's with the costume?

147
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:49,810
I'm not Max. I'm...
Maximan!

148
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:53,680
Defender of the
New York delis.

149
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:57,116
Dad told me the Deli Robber
just robbed the Viking Deli.

150
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,120
And if I'm not mistaken,
W's next.

151
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,989
I'm not mistaken, am I?

152
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,591
About the alphabet? No.

153
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:09,093
About everything else going on?
Absolutely.

154
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,035
Hey, Max, I heard you're working
on the alphabet. Good for you.

155
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:25,206
Dad, never mind about the alphabet.
What I need to learn is a spell.

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,243
Something that would
tie someone up. Like shoes.

157
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:32,447
Like a person-sized shoe
that robs delis.

158
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:35,850
I got just the thing.

159
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:38,252
Here. Toss that rope
in my direction,

160
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:41,021
and say "soap on a rope,
soap fell off a rope,

161
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:44,187
rope shot out of my hand,
rope tie up that man."

162
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:46,255
Great. Simple.

163
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,993
Soap on a rope,
soap fell off the rope,

164
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,562
rope shot out of my hand,
rope tie up that man.

165
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:03,504
- It didn't work.
- That's because you need two other wizards to help you.

166
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,174
- Do you know what you need to do now, Max?
- Yeah.

167
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,943
I need to learn a spell
that makes two other wizards.

168
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:21,852
Alex, I know I'm your best friend and all,
but there's no way I'm going to Skate Barn.

169
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:24,588
I hate that big skating
chicken they have.

170
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:26,856
It's OK, Harper.
I'm not making you go.

171
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,859
Oh, my gosh, thank you, Alex.
You're such a good friend.

172
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,595
Yeah, you're totally not getting
why I'm not making you go.

173
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,131
Oh, I know why.
You want to be alone with Dean.

174
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:36,866
But I don't think
that's a good idea.

175
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,201
Don't forget about the corner
where he makes his move.

176
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:42,003
And I'm not talking
about the spinning fly-bys.

177
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:46,075
Harper, that's just a rumor.
It's not true.

178
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:47,943
Hey, Russo.
Hey, what's-her-face.

179
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:50,311
I've got a nickname.

180
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:57,951
I'm thinking tonight I'll meet you at the
roller rink in that corner by the lockers.

181
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:01,554
Oh, the corner.

182
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,158
All right.

183
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,829
Alex, hold this.
That's "Dean's Corner."

184
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:16,266
Harper, there's no
such thing as Dean's Corner.

185
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,703
It's purely coincidence that he
asked me to meet him in a corner.

186
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,672
He asked me to meet him
in the corner.

187
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:29,801
Mum, I took your advice and I managed
to get rid off of all the other couples,

188
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:31,302
so now it's
just me and Dean.

189
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:33,805
Ooh! Which pop
and lock moves did you use?

190
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,509
The thing is now Dean wants to
meet me in his kissing corner.

191
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:44,011
Oh, Alex,
I'm very disappointed in you.

192
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:47,747
But I don't want to kiss him.
I mean, I really like him.

193
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:51,718
It's just I don't want to be like all
those other girls. What should I do?

194
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:54,921
Well, honey, this is
what you need to remember:

195
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:58,457
If a boy really likes you,
he'll like you for who you are.

196
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:02,093
And I think who you are
is a very beautiful girl

197
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:07,363
who, you know, can sometimes
be a little scary, you know.

198
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:11,133
And a little devious
and sometimes very sneaky.

199
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,635
And would it kill you to clean
a dish from time to time?

200
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,906
Mom! Mom, please
stay on the subject!

201
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,809
This is about me going
on a date, but not kissing.

202
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:24,244
Kissing? What's this
I hear about kissing?

203
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:27,981
- Who are you kissing?
- Dad, I'm not kissing anyone.

204
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:32,985
- I'm gonna go on my date with Dean.
- I never cared for that boy.

205
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,323
What? Just yesterday you said,
"I like that Dean. Nice boy."

206
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:42,962
Well, of course he was nice. He was just
using me to get to you and I fell for it.

207
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:47,266
Darn Dean's winning smile
and twinkling eyes.

208
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,812
Hi, Dean. Here you are.

209
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:05,248
Second date. Alone.

210
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:08,150
In the corner.
Just like you said you'd be.

211
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:12,288
You're kind of just saying everything
you're seeing. Is everything OK?

212
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:16,158
Yeah. I was just thinking
that we go skating right away.

213
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:19,460
Because we're here.
At the Skate Barn.

214
00:14:19,494 --> 00:14:22,729
Second date.
In the corner.

215
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:24,697
Alone when we
should be skating.

216
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,833
You're still doing it.

217
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,968
Yeah, you're right.
Can we just skate?

218
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,970
- Absolutely. That's what I came for.
- Great. Thank you.

219
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,173
Hey, everybody,
reverse skate.

220
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,511
- You really just want to skate?
- Yeah. I love this song.

221
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:45,047
Me, too. Way more than
standing in that corner.

222
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:48,484
Sorry about the pile-up.
Let's everybody reverse back!

223
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:50,619
Really? Are you kidding me?

224
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:56,557
Um, 'cause I kinda thought
you'd want to do something else.

225
00:14:56,592 --> 00:14:59,092
- Oh, I know what you mean.
- You do?

226
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:02,495
- Bet I can lap you.
- You don't.

227
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,868
What are you
looking at, chicken?

228
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:15,574
OK, we've trained
long and hard for this.

229
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:18,976
I've reprogrammed you with the
latest in digital technology.

230
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,378
We're ready for the big
synchronized robot event.

231
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:46,668
So you'll dance with a robot, but you
won't help your own brother fight crime?

232
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,605
Yeah. Pretty much.

233
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,974
I got to get to the Robot
Olympics. You're on your own.

234
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:55,343
No, Justin, I can't be.

235
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:58,045
Dad taught me a spell to tie
someone up, but I need partners.

236
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,514
- You're going after the Deli Robber!
- I'm gonna stop him, too.

237
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:04,716
- Spells or no spells.
- No, Max, you can't go out there alone.

238
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,585
- You'll get hurt.
- No. I'm gonna use

239
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:10,688
- my limited knowledge of tae kwon do.
- You don't know tae kwon do.

240
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,657
That's what "limited" means.

241
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:18,996
Oh, look.
We're near the locker corner.

242
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,864
Maybe we should
stop there for awhile.

243
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:22,833
I mean, I know I said
I didn't want to before.

244
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:25,802
But now that you don't want to,
I kind of wondered why not.

245
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:29,037
- I don't need to stop.
- Um, why not?

246
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,539
Why don't you want
to stop in the corner?

247
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,741
You usually stop
in the corner, right?

248
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,744
You stop there so often, I
believe they call it Dean's Corner.

249
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,780
Oh, I get it.

250
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:43,283
You're tired since I lapped
you. All right. Go rest up.

251
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,385
What? No! I...

252
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,493
The spinning fly-by?
Chicken costume? Harper!

253
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,395
What are you doing here?

254
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,302
Feather.

255
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:09,839
I couldn't go on the skating
date because I work here

256
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,708
and I was embarrassed
to tell you.

257
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:15,979
You're embarrassed to tell me about a
job where you wear a ridiculous costume?

258
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:19,048
You went to school yesterday
dressed as a pilgrim.

259
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:21,416
And what are you doing
in Dean's Corner?

260
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:25,287
Now that he doesn't want me in
the corner, I want to be in it.

261
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:28,957
But suddenly I'm not good
enough to kiss? Here he comes.

262
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:32,928
- Go! Go!
- Stay out of that corner!

263
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:36,531
Um, Dean, can I talk to you?

264
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:39,902
There's a lot of rumors going
around about you in this corner.

265
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:44,238
Oh, man. I was afraid
this was gonna happen.

266
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,474
- I know I got this reputation.
- And if it's true,

267
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:51,076
it kind of makes me feel like
you don't want to kiss me.

268
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,945
Look, kissing is all some
girls seem to care about.

269
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,915
- I was just hoping you weren't one of those girls.
- I'm not.

270
00:17:57,949 --> 00:18:00,850
That's not all I care about.
I mean, that's all I cared about

271
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:03,318
the past hour,
but what is up with you?

272
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,354
It's like you're...

273
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,689
OK.

274
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:11,291
Look, what happened
with those girls

275
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:14,193
is after I'd kiss 'em, they'd
run off and tell their friends.

276
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:16,062
They wouldn't even
finish the date.

277
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,931
You think I'd kiss you
and then take off?

278
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:23,502
- I don't know.
- Well, I wouldn't.

279
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:26,372
I'd also play that claw machine
where you win stuffed animals.

280
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:30,008
That's my favorite game.
I won a caterpillar last week.

281
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:37,248
So, do you want to kiss me, or...
Where did we land with all this?

282
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,050
- You're not gonna take off, right?
- Absolutely not.

283
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:44,520
Skateboard chicken
dance time, everyone!

284
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:48,690
And I do mean everyone! Even
you two, over in this corner!

285
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,359
You made me come over here!

286
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:09,541
- That was nice.
- Alex!

287
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:12,710
Quick! We have to get Max. He's
gonna try and stop the Deli Robber!

288
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:15,312
- That's insane!
- I know, but he won't listen to reason.

289
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:18,549
He could get hurt.
We have to help him.

290
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,452
- What am I gonna do?
- Come on, Alex. Is this the skateboard chicken dance?

291
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,622
Will you come on? Go!

292
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,194
- Max, wait!
- Max!

293
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:36,463
- You can't stop the Deli Robber!
- I got this figured out.

294
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:39,732
I'm gonna go over to Murrieta
Clown Supply to buy 40,000 marbles

295
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:42,701
for 50 cents each.
That's...

296
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:44,736
A million dollars?

297
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,640
Max, think about
what Maximan would do.

298
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:51,843
He'd walk up that wall and lasso
the culprit when he least expects it.

299
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,278
Here comes somebody!

300
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:57,813
OK, we'll do the wall walking
spell to get you up there.

301
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,281
Havity no gravity.

302
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,560
Waverly Sub Station.

303
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:22,597
I'm going in.

304
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:24,865
Soap on a rope,
soap fell off the rope,

305
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:28,101
rope shot out of my hand,
rope tie up that man!

306
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,239
- Nice work, Max!
- You got him!

307
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,708
The jig's up, evil-doer.

308
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:39,444
You've stolen your last
tip jar and cupcake.

309
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:41,979
Wait a minute.

310
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:45,915
How many people
do we know go...

311
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,421
Dad!

312
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:55,524
- Dad.
- I knew it.

313
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,726
Crime runs through these veins.

314
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,963
That explains my struggle
to stay good.

315
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,832
Actually, Max, I think Dad
made the whole thing up.

316
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:07,235
- There is no Deli Robber.
- Curses! I took the bait.

317
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:11,303
I wanted you guys
to work as a team.

318
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,969
Wait a minute. So I went
through all this for nothing?

319
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:18,272
Not for nothing. You worked
hard! You did a good job!

320
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:22,075
And I spent a whole month on that robot
and then gave up the Robot Olympics?

321
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,078
Yes! For the team!
Excellent!

322
00:21:25,112 --> 00:21:27,913
And I left Dean after
I promised I wouldn't.

323
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:33,684
What an admirable sacrifice.
I'm proud of all three of you.

324
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:36,920
As long as you didn't
kiss the boy, Alex.
