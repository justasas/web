1
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:11,328
This is the best video game ever.

2
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:14,462
- Jab, jab, jab... roundhouse!
- Backflip!

3
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:18,266
[both] Jab! - Hey!
How many times have I told you guys

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,669
- to keep video games video?
- I told them and I told them, Dad.

5
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:24,604
Sword!

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,610
Oh! That is not what they mean by "
slashing prices."

7
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:34,680
Cool swords. Let me try.

8
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:37,617
Wow, you look nice, Dad.

9
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:39,151
I didn't even know you had a suit.

10
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,987
I don't. Kick, kick, nose pull.

11
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,089
Well, that suit does fit
you a little tight...

12
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,425
Hey, that's my suit!

13
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:48,927
That reminds me. Justin,
I need to borrow your suit.

14
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,462
I'm taking your mother out to
dinner for our anniversary.

15
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:54,031
Oh. Did you get her a card?
Because while Mom's reading it,

16
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:55,732
you can slip the
waiter your coupon.

17
00:00:58,603 --> 00:01:02,172
My lamp! What is going on in here?

18
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:05,174
Yeah. What is going on in here?

19
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:09,478
I thought we had a
rule about wizardry.

20
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:12,781
The random magic in this house
is getting on my nerves.

21
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:16,150
How many times does this lamp have to
break for you guys to get the message?

22
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:20,819
If the message is, "Ugly lamps are
easy to break," I think we got it.

23
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:23,221
Your mother's right.

24
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:25,123
We have to be more
considerate of someone

25
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:28,292
who doesn't understand
the temptations of magic.

26
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:31,428
Doesn't understand? Wait,
are you trying to make this my problem?

27
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:33,497
[all] Oh!

28
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:38,134
No. I was just saying that...
there... What was I saying?

29
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:42,538
Uh, what Dad is saying is that we
should accept each other for who we are.

30
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:44,573
Kind of like Dad did
when he married you.

31
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:48,243
Yeah. I was a wizard at the time,
and it was a big decision for me.

32
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:53,180
Oh. I'm sorry, Jerry. I had no idea it was
such a big decision for you to marry me.

33
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,549
[all] Oh!

34
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,052
No! It wasn't a big decision.
It was more of an impulse.

35
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:02,621
No. Impulse is not helping.

36
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,856
Let me know how your
anniversary dinner turns out.

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,624
[all] Oh!

38
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:09,660
<i>* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

39
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:11,962
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

40
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,265
<i>* You can fix any problem with the
slightest of ease Yes, please *</i>

41
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,267
<i>* You might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

42
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,035
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

43
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:21,804
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

44
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,372
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

45
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:26,375
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

46
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,279
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

47
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:33,983
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

48
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:38,554
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

49
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:41,823
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

50
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:45,860
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

51
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:49,463
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

52
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:53,600
<i>* Because everything is not *</i>

53
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:54,635
<i>* What it seems *</i>

55
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:01,073
Listen up, because of
your magic run amok,

56
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,775
I have to go out and get some
"I'm sorry" gifts for your mother.

57
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,078
[scoffs] Dad, come on!

58
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:08,780
Mom's really easy.

59
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,983
Why don't you just rub her feet?
That's what I do.

60
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:15,186
Oh! That's just weird.

61
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,055
Really? 'Cause I
don't have a bedtime.

62
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,757
I'm not gonna rub her feet.

63
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:24,693
That crooked toe
just freaks me out.

64
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:27,762
Your mom will be fine once I buy
her some of her favorite things.

65
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:30,163
Ooh! I know what you
should get her. - You do?

66
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:32,999
Peach lip gloss and skull
and bones press-on-nails.

67
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:35,735
That's what you want.
You're no help.

68
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:42,073
Dad can relax. I went on the
World Wide WizWeb this morning

69
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:44,745
and ordered Cupid to come
shoot Mom with a love arrow.

70
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:48,416
You ordered Cupid?! Oh,
that makes perfect sense.

71
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,218
Mom's mad that we're
using magic in the house.

72
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:54,354
So, naturally, you bring
more magic into the house.

73
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,623
Oh, brilliant.

74
00:03:56,658 --> 00:04:00,793
OK, OK. Everybody stop yelling.
I'll cancel the Cupid order.

75
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:03,662
When people are right,
it doesn't mean they're yelling.

76
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:06,164
You can't cancel Cupid
once he's been ordered.

77
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:09,667
You'd know if you took it upon yourself
to read ahead, like a good student does.

78
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,603
Oh, did you read about the
recipe for wizard punch? - No.

79
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:15,740
- Good, I just made it.
- Ow!

80
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,808
Oh, wizard punch.
I'll bet that's delicious.

81
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:24,846
Well, you've got a problem.
When Cupid gets here,

82
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,114
he isn't gonna leave until
he fulfills his order.

83
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:30,050
[Cupid] Yep. Your brother's right.

84
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:34,953
So who's the lucky guy or gal...
or thing? I don't judge.

85
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:38,924
Oh, look. It's a baby with wings.
And a carrying handle.

86
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,293
Back off. It's a sash, genius.

87
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:47,263
Oh, this kid is gonna need me
when he grows up. I can just tell.

88
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:50,967
Look, Mr. Cupid,
I ordered you by mistake.

89
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,035
And, um, we really don't
need your services,

90
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:55,404
- so if you could go back...
- Save it, sweetheart.

91
00:04:55,572 --> 00:05:00,108
I can't go anywhere until your
mom gets an arrow in the keister.

92
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:04,011
OK, fine. Just shoot Mom in the
keister and get out of here.

93
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,480
Hey, look, it's bendy!

94
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:09,949
No, it's not.

95
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:13,386
You broke my arrow!

96
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,287
You have more arrows, right?

97
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:18,924
I'm a baby! I'm barely
allowed to have this one!

98
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:24,029
[Cupid] Hey, hey, hey!

99
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:28,332
Don't leave me in here!
I'm afraid to be alone!

100
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,969
OK, we've got to keep Cupid hidden
from Mom until we fix the arrow.

101
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:34,204
- We? I don't think so.
- Hey!

102
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,973
If she sees him, she'll blame me.

103
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:39,208
Then I'll figure out a way to blame you.
We're all in this together.

104
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,678
Come on, I'm always
saying dumb stuff.

105
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:48,682
Our marriage is based on us ignoring each
other's flaws. I ignore all of yours.

106
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,117
[all] Oh!

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,587
What are you guys up to?

108
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,457
Uh, not magic, that's for sure.

109
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:01,761
Yeah, Mom, 'cause you know me. I always
tell you when these guys mess around with
magic.

110
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,996
Always.

111
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,900
- Is he gonna tell her?
- Sh!

112
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,970
- Tell me what?
- [Cupid crying]

113
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,539
Uh... about Max's
terrible stomach ache.

114
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:19,442
His really, really bad
stomach ache. - [crying]

115
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,878
In fact, there's a new
virus going around.

116
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:25,880
<i>- The Influ cupidosa.
- Subtle.</i>

117
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:30,049
<i>- I panicked!
- Oh, mijito!</i>

118
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:34,185
Come on, let's go upstairs. I'll make you
some of Grandma's tree bark and fish oil
tea.

119
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,820
[sobbing] You...

120
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:41,158
What are we gonna do now?
We still have Cupid.

121
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,192
You said, "we." You're
officially in. Awesome!

122
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,628
Every time.

123
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,969
OK. Mom's still upstairs.

124
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:04,676
I made extra tree bark and
fish oil tea. Who wants some?

125
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,878
Maybe later.

126
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,614
Oh, goodness!

127
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,048
Uh...

128
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,084
What are you doing,
playing in the dirty dishes?

129
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,020
Bad baby!

130
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:29,397
Hi. Do you watching my little
brother for one second?

131
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:35,269
Oh! Cute baby!

132
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:39,272
[scoffs] Sure, the baby's cute.
But look at me, Mom. I'm way cuter.

133
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:45,411
Hi, Alex. Look what I
knitted for Justin.

134
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,214
Oh! That's interesting.

135
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:51,316
And it smells like shampoo.

136
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,751
It's a sweater entirely
made of my hair. - Oh!

137
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,453
- Feel how soft it is.
- Uh...

138
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,155
I take your word for it.

139
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:02,158
He's upstairs with Max,
trying to fix Cupid's arrow.

140
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:05,426
OK. Thanks. Notice how I didn't
react when you said Cupid?

141
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:08,195
It's my way of acting cool with
having a wizard as a best friend,

142
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,163
even though I'm
freaking out inside.

143
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:13,832
Kind of like how I didn't freak
out when you said, "hair sweater."

144
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:19,538
Thank you for watching him.

145
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,473
There. Good as new.

146
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:25,777
Now, Cupid can shoot Mom,
she'll love Dad and then go home.

147
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:29,446
Know what? We are
really good at this!

148
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,548
We should open up Cupid's
Arrow Repair Shop.

149
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:38,919
There's only one Cupid.
He has only one arrow.

150
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:41,219
Oh, yeah. Good point.

151
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:46,890
We should also sell burgers.
Babies love burgers.

152
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,028
Hi, guys. Justin,
what do you think of this?

153
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:56,197
Um, it's kind of nice. Ooh!

154
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:57,966
It's really soft, too.

155
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,269
Great, because I knitted it for you
from my own hair. It's 100 percent me!

156
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:08,340
Oh...

157
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:12,143
I know. You don't
have to say anything.

158
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:17,281
[laughs] Look, Harper,
I know you've had a crush, obsession,

159
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:19,316
on me for a really long time,

160
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,186
but I think it's about that time I
was completely honest with you...

161
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:27,523
Harper, I am never,
ever, ever going to...

162
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:31,192
[gasps] Ah!

163
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:33,594
...love you more
than I do right now.

164
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,699
Uh-oh.

165
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,970
Oh, Justin. This is the
best day of my life!

166
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:46,407
I should've made you a
hair sweater years ago.

167
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:50,076
I would've been happier
and warmer if you had.

168
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,747
Max! What did you do?

169
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:58,783
Maybe Dad's right.
I shouldn't have a BB gun.

170
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:03,853
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

171
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:06,555
I love thee to the depth
and breadth... Oh!

172
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,925
This'll be more romantic with
the sweater on. - Uh, Harper.

173
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,528
Look, I hate to burst
your bubble here,

174
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:17,665
but Justin's only acting like that because
Max just shot him with Cupid's love arrow.

175
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,735
Gosh, I guess you're right.

176
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,905
It's not real love if it comes
from his butt and not his heart.

177
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:29,843
<i>Mi amor, let's go for a carriage
ride around Central Park.</i>

178
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:32,011
But I don't care!

179
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:38,384
- Where's your mother?
- Ah, Father. Thank you.

180
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:41,921
For my lady love.

181
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,191
Oh, yes!

182
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:48,660
Why is he acting like
he's in love with Harper?

183
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:52,162
What are you doing with an arrow?
And why are you holding a baby?

184
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:57,133
Love... Arrow... Baby...
That's Cupid!

185
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:05,039
To solve a problem that started
because you used magic?

186
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,707
Yeah. That's kind of what I do.

187
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:15,246
- What's that?
- Um... a baby.

188
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:19,783
Hold still, or the baby gets it.

189
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:23,620
Who's the baby? Oh! I'm the baby!

190
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:27,890
OK, Alex. Why do you have a baby?

191
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:34,295
Uh... It's a baby... doll...

192
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,132
...from my Marriage
and Family class. Yes.

193
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:42,037
- [Cupid burps]
- Excuse me.

194
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:47,607
You know what, Alex? I think it's good
you're taking Marriage and Family.

195
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,475
You're never too young to learn
how to get along with someone

196
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,744
who makes it very difficult
to get along with.

197
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,383
You are so right, Mom.
I'm gonna take this doll up to my room

198
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:59,719
and think of ways for Dad
to appreciate you more.

199
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:03,289
Wait a minute. Isn't your open
house at school this Friday?

200
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,691
I want to meet your
Marriage and Family teacher.

201
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,261
[both] Why?

202
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,362
I have some personal
stories to share

203
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,631
about what marriage and
family life are like

204
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:16,768
once you get past the pretty
pictures in bridal magazines.

205
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:22,072
I fixed it! - Oh! Maxy, I told you,
don't play with arrows.

206
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:24,040
They're dangerous, honey.

207
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:28,878
Someone could get stuck with
this and then where would we be?

208
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:31,713
Closer to the end of our problem.

209
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:35,417
Phew! That was close.

210
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:40,021
Uh... you don't really have
Marriage and Family class, do you?

211
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:42,690
I love how you know me.

212
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:55,135
I want to get a drink
of water, Justy.

213
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,404
I only thirst for you, Harpy.

214
00:12:57,438 --> 00:12:59,438
Does that meanou
don't want any water?

215
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:03,776
No. I want water, too.
We should share everything.

216
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,651
Ah, the waters of love.

217
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:18,020
Hey, Justin. Missed you
at Alien Language League.

218
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:22,458
[speaks alien language] You
know what I'm sayin'? [laughs]

219
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:27,795
I'm sorry, Zeke. I'm done
with your childish things.

220
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:32,297
- I've found love.
- [laughs] With who?

221
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:39,001
With me! Hello? Arm?
He's wearing my hair.

222
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:40,969
Yeah, dude, what's
up with that sweater?

223
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:44,607
You look like the floor
of a barber shop.

224
00:13:46,644 --> 00:13:49,445
Zeke, you've insulted
my woman's honor.

225
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,481
We will settle this like gentlemen:

226
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,782
Water balloon fight at 30 paces.

227
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:55,617
I can't throw 30 paces.

228
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:59,187
That's 'cause you throw like a...
[alien language]

229
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:02,224
I do not throw like
a [alien language]

230
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,329
Hey, everybody! There's gonna
be a fight outside! Over me!

231
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:11,000
OK, my little Marriage
and Family folk.

232
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:14,002
I hope you can rope your
noggins around today's lesson:

233
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:17,106
Smart Shopping with Coupons.

234
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,809
There's no better way to get more
bang for your buck than with...

235
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:23,645
[Cupid crying] I'm bored!

236
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,110
Shh!

237
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:30,578
Who's that back in the south 40? Alex Russo,
you are not in this class.

238
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:34,348
No, Mr. Laritate, I'm not.

239
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:37,617
But it's always been my
dream to be in this class.

240
00:14:37,652 --> 00:14:42,455
And I think a dedicated teacher like you
would want to help me realize my dreams.

241
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:46,859
[sniffs]

242
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:51,263
I smell someone trying to
sell me some cow patty.

243
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:54,532
Come on. I really
want be in this class.

244
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,767
I even brought my own pretend baby.

245
00:14:56,868 --> 00:15:00,704
Which is huge, because anybody who
knows me knows I never come prepared.

246
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:04,907
Look, Miss Russo,
I'm always partial to enthusiasm,

247
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:08,578
but the train's already pulled
out of the station on this one.

248
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,413
We did that assignment last month.

249
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:14,449
But Mr. Laritate, how can you
say no to this little guy?

250
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:16,350
[buzzing]

251
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:21,957
What? Bad baby! No!

252
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:27,630
I gave it a shot.

253
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:33,802
A shaving baby doll?

254
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:36,371
They've officially run out of toys.

255
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:47,347
<i>Ma chÃ©rie.</i>

256
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,598
[French accent] A quiet tÃªte a
tÃªte over a romantic dinner.

257
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,700
Thanks, but it's only 3:
30 in the afternoon.

258
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:14,003
[chuckles] It's never
too early for romance.

259
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:26,546
Bubbly a la orange?

260
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:33,085
Justin, the French thing
is nice but a little corny.

261
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:39,790
You're right! I must go learn the
new language of love for you,

262
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:43,692
which is... Cantonese.

263
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:47,229
Come on, Albert. Let's go learn it.

264
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:52,433
Thank goodness you're here.
I thought my dream had come true,

265
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:55,568
but Justin won't let me out of his sight.
He's got his arm around me so much

266
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:58,737
that my shoulder is starting to
smell like his armpit. Here, smell.

267
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:02,341
Ah! No need. I'm not
gonna fight you on that.

268
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,709
I don't think I can
live like this forever.

269
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:06,711
[Cupid] Forever? No.

270
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:09,246
Love from my arrow
is only temporary.

271
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,015
Wait! This is temporary?
Why didn't you tell me that?

272
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:15,516
I'm a baby. I forget things.

273
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,984
Hey, look! I got a
belly button. [laughs]

274
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:25,056
Dad, bad news. I couldn't get
into Marriage and Family class.

275
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,858
It's OK. I think your mom forgot

276
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:28,893
about talking to your
teacher at open house.

277
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:31,362
Oh, that's right.
Tonight is your open house.

278
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:34,298
Thanks for reminding me, Jerry.

279
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:37,034
Yeah, thanks for
reminding her, Dad.

280
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:40,504
I fixed it!

281
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:44,307
Max, what did I tell you
about playing with arrows?

282
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:46,876
Oh, sorry.

283
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,455
Harper!

284
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,991
What are you doing down there?

285
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,462
Bring it in.

286
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:14,732
You're never gonna believe this,

287
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,067
but I signed up for scrapbooking.

288
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,469
And I made one about us.
Check it out!

289
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:25,644
Justin, you're taking all the fun out of
my unrequited, twisted obsession for you.

290
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,216
Leave me alone! I'm the one who makes
the scrapbooks in this relationship!

291
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,317
Harper!

292
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,357
Hey, Justin. [speaks
alien language] Harper!

293
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:40,360
[all laugh]

294
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:43,496
What? I don't [alien
language] Harper!

295
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:49,266
Ah! No, no,
no! Zeke! Guys! Wait up!

296
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,136
[alien language]

297
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,838
Thers my Justin.

298
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:57,874
And you used to "da-ca" me.

299
00:18:57,908 --> 00:19:01,143
Dad, where's Mom? You were
supposed to keep an eye on her

300
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:02,978
so she wouldn't go to my class.

301
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:06,848
- I lost her by the cupcakes.
- Dad, cupcakes?

302
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:09,951
All right. I got
lost in the cupcakes.

303
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:12,354
- Where's Max?
- I...

304
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,191
I sent him to wood shop so
he could fix Cupid's arrow.

305
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:19,059
Let's go.

306
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:23,663
...which is why I tell
your ducklings that...

307
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,930
Oh, no. Mom beat us here.

308
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,466
...from the rooster's
crow to the coyote's howl.

309
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,701
- [laughter]
- You got that right, partner.

310
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:35,104
Even raising the inconsiderate
rooster is a job.

311
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:36,840
Mrs. Russo? Why are you here?

312
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,642
I had thoughts on
marriage and family

313
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,876
which you might find interesting.

314
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:43,143
Yeah, but your daughter isn't in...

315
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:46,411
Theresa, why don't we come back en Mr.
Laritate has more time to talk.

316
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:49,480
Here's an article about
how difficult it can be

317
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:53,983
when two very different people get married
and now they're afraid their mother was
right.

318
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,653
I fixed it!

319
00:19:57,687 --> 00:20:00,021
What took you so long?

320
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:01,589
Oh, would you just...

321
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:04,291
OK, this is it.

322
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:07,193
Cupid, it's time to save the
day with a perfect shot at Mom.

323
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:09,863
Take the shot! Go!

324
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:15,202
Oh, just shoot!

325
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,407
Oh, no. What did you do?

326
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:24,142
[Cupid] Hey, kid,
did you balance the arrow

327
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:26,010
- after you fixed it?
- Yeah.

328
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:29,546
It felt heavy on one side,
so I took the decorations off.

329
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,617
You have the most beautiful eyes.
What color are they?

330
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,487
Um... thank you.
eye brown, I think.

331
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:41,323
Yeah, they're definitely brown.

332
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,660
Great. Thanks a lot, Cupid.

333
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:47,262
Now, I'm gonna have to start
calling that old lady Mom.

334
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:50,530
I am not rubbing her feet.

335
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:52,499
[Cupid] Relax. Look over there.

336
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,540
Only to take you back to
the rest home, black eyes!

337
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:07,011
My eyes aren't black. - Keep flirting
with my husband and you'll get there.

338
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,582
[Cupid] You know,
sometimes jealousy

339
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,918
works better than a love arrow.

340
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:17,691
Well, Mom and Dad didn't get back together
the way I thought, but this will work.

341
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:21,662
Come on, Mom. Let's go hear my PE teacher
tell you how I hate to run. It'll be fun.

342
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:27,333
You're mine. Don't you forget that.

343
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:43,400
So, you want to tell me, he's not going to
leave until I get shot in the butt with an
arrow?

344
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,902
[all] Yeah, that's right.

345
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,771
I really hate magic. Give me that.

346
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:53,342
Ow!

347
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:59,479
Oh! I love you guys.

348
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,949
[Cupid] Works for me.

349
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:13,950
