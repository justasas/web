1
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,006
<i>The world blew up
in a thousand atomic fireballs.</i>

2
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:35,510
<i>The first blast was set off
by five terrorists.</i>

3
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,512
<i>It took two million years...</i>

4
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,017
<i>for some of the radioactive clouds
to allow some sun in.</i>

5
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:46,111
<i>By then, only a handful
of humans survived.</i>

6
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,749
<i>The rest of humanity had
changed into hideous mutants.</i>

7
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:53,488
<i>These mutant species
floundered in the bad areas...</i>

8
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:57,862
<i>radioactive lands that never allowed
them to become human again...</i>

9
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:01,369
<i>and made each birth a new disaster.</i>

10
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:03,803
<i>Then, in the good lands...</i>

11
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:08,310
<i>they came back,
arising from their long sleep...</i>

12
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,608
<i>fairies, elves, dwarves...</i>

13
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,205
<i>the true ancestors of man.</i>

14
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:16,808
<i>They lived happily in the good areas.</i>

15
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:21,146
<i>It was a big day in Montagar.
Delia, queen of the fairies...</i>

16
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:24,158
<i>was presiding over the feast of plenty...</i>

17
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:26,854
<i>celebrating 3,000 years of peace.</i>

18
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,659
<i>In the midst of the celebration...</i>

19
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,326
<i>Delia felt a pull from the skies.</i>

20
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,767
<i>She looked up
and saw dark clouds...</i>

21
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:38,603
<i>forming on the horizon in every direction.</i>

22
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:42,872
<i>She fell into a trance
and left the party...</i>

23
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:45,812
<i>heading for her home on a high hill.</i>

24
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,213
<i>At first, the fairies were puzzled.</i>

25
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:52,653
<i>But then they too felt
a force drawing them to follow.</i>

26
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,985
<i>Delia was alone inside.</i>

27
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:58,515
<i>The storm grew until
it was a raging cyclone...</i>

28
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,721
<i>hovering over the dwelling.</i>

29
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:04,994
<i>One of the older fairies
ventured inside the house.</i>

30
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:08,195
<i>There lay Delia on her bed...</i>

31
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,933
<i>holding a pair of twins in her arms.</i>

32
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:13,998
<i>The older fairy instantly knew that...</i>

33
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:18,638
<i>these were not ordinary twins,
but magical wizards.</i>

34
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:21,649
<i>The baby wizards were
polarized like magnets...</i>

35
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,686
<i>one attracting with a magnetic draw...</i>

36
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:28,484
<i>the other repelling
and impossible to get near.</i>

37
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:31,651
<i>Avatar, the kind and good wizard...</i>

38
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,161
<i>spent much of his boyhood...</i>

39
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,222
<i>entertaining his mother
with beautiful visions.</i>

40
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,665
<i>Blackwolf, the mutant wizard...</i>

41
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,670
<i>would never visit his mother...</i>

42
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:47,232
<i>and spent his time
torturing small animals.</i>

43
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:50,676
<i>More years passed,
and Delia continued to slip.</i>

44
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:53,681
<i>Finally, all life drained out of her...</i>

45
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:58,186
<i>and Avatar held her hand trying
desperately to use his magic to restore her.</i>

46
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:01,553
<i>He cradled her in his arms and wept.</i>

47
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:06,584
<i>When Blackwolf found that
his mother had died, he was excited...</i>

48
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:12,396
<i>for now he felt he would take over
her leadership and rule the land.</i>

49
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:15,403
<i>When Avatar confronted
Blackwolf, he was enraged.</i>

50
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,635
<i>They began a furious battle.</i>

51
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,471
<i>Each using his magic, they continued...</i>

52
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:24,569
<i>until they had nearly destroyed each other.</i>

53
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:31,152
<i>But Avatar's magic was stronger...</i>

54
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,556
<i>because he had the emotional loss
of his mother that drove him on.</i>

55
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,321
<i>Blackwolf was defeated.</i>

56
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,920
<i>"The day will come, my brother,
when I will return...</i>

57
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:45,592
<i>and make this a planet
where mutants rule. "</i>

58
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:50,002
<i>Blackwolfheaded off,
leaving Avatar very disturbed.</i>

59
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,685
The time has come.

60
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,695
Kill!

61
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,645
Well, hello, handsome.

62
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:01,270
Hello, honey.

63
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:09,081
<i>He is called Necron 99.</i>

64
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,177
<i>He is one of Blackwolf's assassins.</i>

65
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:16,190
<i>He travels the land destroying
the believers of magic.</i>

66
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:49,248
<i> "My children,
the only true technology is nature.</i>

67
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,656
<i>"All the other forms
of manmade technology...</i>

68
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:54,161
"are perversions.

69
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,164
"The ancient dictators used technology...

70
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:59,826
to enslave the masses."

71
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:43,296
- Weehawk, can't we stay here for tonight?
- No.

72
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:46,306
Just for a few hours' rest.

73
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:49,810
- I sense something.
- But the road is clear.

74
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:52,812
We haven't seen an assassin for days.

75
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,314
A clever assassin stays hidden.

76
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,647
Avatar must be warned.

77
00:08:57,718 --> 00:09:01,654
Our mission is nearly over, Westwind...

78
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,917
but now it's time for one final run.

79
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:51,584
Damn it!

80
00:11:56,197 --> 00:12:00,600
- Well?
- They're not back yet, my president.

81
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,367
- They're really late now,
aren't they, old wizard?

82
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,374
Bad magic, isn't it?

83
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,376
And if they don't show...

84
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:13,709
you'll know no more than you did before.

85
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:18,013
- How true, fairy goddess
of the New World...

86
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,315
but if they don't show...

87
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:23,824
I think that will tell us something too.

88
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:28,189
Damn it, Avatar! If there's any danger...

89
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:31,789
maybe we should...
maybe we should arm our states.

90
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:36,303
- Science and technology?
- There's no time for that.

91
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,703
Even if we could impress
our people with the danger...

92
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,208
science and technology were outlawed...

93
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:44,574
millions of years ago...

94
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,704
and, we must admit...

95
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:49,648
it's been a peaceful world since then.

96
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,685
Enough, Wizard!

97
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,722
<i>I demand to know what you know...</i>

98
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,849
<i>- or I'll banish you!</i>

99
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:01,224
Banish him?

100
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,729
But, Father, who will teach me...

101
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:06,733
all the magic I've left to learn?

102
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,735
Only Avatar can make me...

103
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,737
a full-fledged fairy.

104
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,000
As you can see, I'm only half there.

105
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:15,736
<i>All right. All right.</i>

106
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,712
I'll tell you...

107
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,681
if you think you can handle it.

108
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,184
<i>What do you know
about war, about bombs...</i>

109
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:28,881
<i>that could turn
a planet molten and liquid?</i>

110
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,686
To think it could start again...

111
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,559
ten million years after the final one.

112
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:41,696
Sometimes I get tired of being so old.

113
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,896
Sometimes...

114
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:47,702
being a wizard is lonely at the top.

115
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,642
We're waiting, old, old wizard.

116
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,702
You know about my brother.

117
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,012
Well, as the years passed...

118
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:59,211
I searched for my brother in vain.

119
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:03,245
He had settled
in the dark land of Scortch...

120
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:06,350
<i>where people still died of radiation.</i>

121
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:10,363
<i> For 5,000 years,
Blackwolf studied black arts...</i>

122
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,834
<i>increasing his wisdom 10,000-fold.</i>

123
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:18,030
<i>He built a small following
of frog-like creatures...</i>

124
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:22,007
<i>but needed more troops
for his evil plans.</i>

125
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:25,011
<i>He then formed an army
whose generals were called up...</i>

126
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,139
<i>from the black shadows of hell.</i>

127
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:34,380
<i>Souls who waited for untold eternities
for a new leader...</i>

128
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:36,719
<i>Blackwolf's tremendous power...</i>

129
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,589
<i>enslaved them all to carry out his will.</i>

130
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:44,091
<i>Then stories of Blackwolf's armies...</i>

131
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,690
<i>attacking neighboring countries came back.</i>

132
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:50,203
<i>Demons of hell armed with black magic...</i>

133
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:53,399
<i>but they would get bored...</i>

134
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:55,408
<i>or sidetracked in the middle of battle...</i>

135
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,774
<i>and give up, running home.</i>

136
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:13,791
Fritz! Fritz, get up,
for God's sake! Get up!

137
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,226
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!

138
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:18,730
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!

139
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:22,234
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!

140
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:24,736
Those despicable, animal warmongers!

141
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,738
They've killed Fritz!

142
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,774
Take that! Take this!

143
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,036
Take that, you green slime!

144
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,738
- You black-hearted, short bow-legged...
- Max!

145
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:37,249
Max, I'm okay! I'm okay, Max.
Just a scratch.

146
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:41,344
- Look, I'm all right.
- Oh. Oh, damn.

147
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:43,355
There you go again
stepping on my lines...

148
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,789
raining on my parade, costing me medals.

149
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,759
Oh, damn!

150
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,262
Ohh. Oh, Fritz?

151
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:54,357
Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!

152
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,767
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!

153
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:00,271
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!

154
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,774
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!

155
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:06,175
Take this! Take that! They killed Fritz!

156
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,978
<i>They could easily have won,
but they lacked...</i>

157
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,347
<i>the motivation and inspiration.</i>

158
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,819
<i>Blackwolfknew he needed more.</i>

159
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,882
<i>He sent his huge armies out
to excavate ancient ruins...</i>

160
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,019
<i>for links to the past.</i>

161
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:27,328
<i>Tales reached Avatar that bits and pieces
of pre-holocaust technology...</i>

162
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,734
<i>were being dug up and marched
back to Scortch I.</i>

163
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,965
<i>With these ancient pieces...</i>

164
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,736
<i>he built a new war machine.</i>

165
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,744
<i>Still, his generals
needed more to fight with.</i>

166
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:42,440
<i>This drove Blackwolf mad with frustration.</i>

167
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:47,214
<i>Then one day, that frustration vanished.</i>

168
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:51,746
I sent my elf spies to find out
what was happening.

169
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,258
I'm sure he has
found some great power...

170
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:57,091
that will control his armies.

171
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:01,156
You mean you sent out that elf envoy...

172
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:05,000
to investigate
based on a vague feeling of your...

173
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,224
I've failed you, my wizard.

174
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,317
I've failed you, my president.

175
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,813
What news do you bring?

176
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,553
The lights went out! The lights went out!

177
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,562
Necron 99 has destroyed himself.

178
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:41,594
It's done!

179
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,501
With the assassination
of the presidents of the free states...

180
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,505
comes their fall...

181
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:51,509
and that of my brother.

182
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,636
It's done.

183
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,943
We have four more lights left, sir...

184
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,006
four more.

185
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:00,018
It's not important!

186
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:06,184
The main exterminations are complete.

187
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,524
<i>The remaining countries are now ruled...</i>

188
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,029
<i>by second-rate incompetents...</i>

189
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:14,965
<i>so confused...</i>

190
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:17,332
<i>that even now they blame the killings...</i>

191
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:22,033
<i>on those within their own ranks.</i>

192
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,480
It's time to strike!

193
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,076
<i>Sieg heil.</i>

194
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,566
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, lard bottom.

195
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:52,001
- Get up. Blackwolf's callin'.
- I don't want to go.

196
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:54,562
Hey, when Blackwolf calls, we go.

197
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,074
- I don't want to fight anymore.
- Ya gotta.

198
00:19:57,143 --> 00:20:01,170
- I don't want to hurt things anymore.
- Hey, you're so stupid.

199
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:04,080
Listen, I ain't stupid. Just listen.

200
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,017
You know what I mean,
trees, birds, butterflies...

201
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,145
Everything's got a right
to live. You know what I mean?

202
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:11,746
- Hey...
- Everything! Everything's got a right to live.

203
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:14,088
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Butterflies...

204
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,958
Blackwolf's got a secret weapon
that makes us invincible.

205
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,589
We can't lose.

206
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:24,261
Right, left. Right, left.
Right, left. Right, left...

207
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:37,280
It will never work.
People don't want war.

208
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,114
It destroyed this planet, its people...

209
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,952
and all records of past civilizations.

210
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:48,619
Not all records, as you'll soon find out.

211
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:53,859
Attention!

212
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:57,835
Leaders of tomorrow's master race!

213
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:44,138
The time has come, as I promised...

214
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:48,509
<i>a time when I reveal to you...</i>

215
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,380
my loyal followers...

216
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:56,114
<i>the ancient secret of war...</i>

217
00:22:56,221 --> 00:23:00,885
the key to creating hysteria...

218
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:03,052
fear...

219
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:06,689
gods.

220
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:21,879
Behold!

221
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:41,023
<i>Sieg heil! Sieg heil!</i>

222
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,687
Sieg heil!

223
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:47,791
<i>Blackmark's army's come again!</i>

224
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:51,734
Our cousin elves
are already in the trenches.

225
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:54,101
It's our loved land too.

226
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:58,438
For Elfin and Fairyland, united we fly.

227
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:32,576
Hey, Elfie, do you hear those drums?

228
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:34,578
Sure do, Peewhittle.

229
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,911
I don't believe those blokes
are gonna try it again.

230
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:42,147
I'm scared.

231
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,951
Now don't be, governor.
You're too young to remember...

232
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:48,993
but Blackwolf must have
lost one million men here...

233
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:52,622
last time he tried to invade.

234
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:55,962
<i>And if Blackwolf's
stupid enough to try it again...</i>

235
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,968
<i>he'll lose twice more.</i>

236
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:00,834
Them goblins and demons...

237
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:03,306
just look mean, but they're yellow.

238
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,343
<i>They got no cause to fight.</i>

239
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,004
<i>They always give up and run
with our arrows chasing them...</i>

240
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,015
<i>all the way home.</i>

241
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,917
It's always been that way
and will always be the same.

242
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:17,511
Ain't that the truth, boys?

243
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:55,405
<i>Weehawk, what's that
old wizard been doing for four hours?</i>

244
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,880
If he's looking for answers
from that assassin...

245
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:00,645
my father's sword can get it
quicker than brain reading.

246
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:03,313
Cool down.
Cool down.

247
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:06,824
I got it,
and it ain't good.

248
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:09,826
The key is a dream machine...

249
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:12,829
that inspires armies
with ancient war images.

250
00:29:12,897 --> 00:29:15,331
It must be destroyed.

251
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,769
It is in Blackwolf's castle
in the land of Scortch.

252
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,931
When do we leave?

253
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:23,941
Leave?
What do you mean, leave?

254
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:25,943
You got to be kidding.

255
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:28,445
I'm too old for this sort of thing.

256
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:31,616
Just wake me up
when the planet's destroyed.

257
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:35,685
<i>- Well, I'm not too old. I'll go myself.
- Very noble.</i>

258
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:40,019
We're going.
I must avenge my father's death.

259
00:29:40,091 --> 00:29:43,356
It ain't no fairyland out there, kid.

260
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:45,361
But all right, all right.

261
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:47,863
I was just testing you.

262
00:29:47,932 --> 00:29:50,230
<i>Well?</i>

263
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:54,869
<i>- Well, what?
- Well, what now?</i>

264
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:58,841
Uh, I don't know.

265
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:02,367
Oh, why don't you sit there for
a couple hours while I figure it out?

266
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:04,380
Okay.

267
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:10,610
<i>- Uh, Avatar.
- All right. All right.</i>

268
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,122
How do we find this machine?

269
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,126
This creature, uh,
I shall call him Peace.

270
00:30:17,194 --> 00:30:20,129
Peace?

271
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:23,291
In the hopes that he will bring it.

272
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,801
He's somehow wired to the machine.

273
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,306
And the only freedom he'll
ever have from its painful grip...

274
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:31,307
is in its destruction.

275
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:35,311
Go now, both of you,
and prepare for the journey.

276
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:39,475
- I'll reason with him when he awakens.
- Avatar, you're not that old.

277
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,882
She's gotta be kiddin'.

278
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:46,480
Looks like my brother and I
now begin our final battle.

279
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,463
<i>Weehawk spent a night
saying good-bye to his tribe...</i>

280
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:56,523
<i>asking them to protect his family...</i>

281
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,967
<i>and to name a new chief
ifhe did not return.</i>

282
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:04,030
<i>Elinore said good-bye to her father
and then the other fairies of her kind.</i>

283
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:08,044
<i>She told them she will return
as queen of Montagar...</i>

284
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:10,376
<i>her father's death revenged...</i>

285
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:13,679
<i>and herself a full-fledged fairy.</i>

286
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:18,080
Well, they're here, nut.

287
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:22,023
I'll be right down, heroes.

288
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:25,392
<i>All right, creep.
Now, before I untie you...</i>

289
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:28,125
I wanna tell you a couple things.

290
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:31,930
And I want you to listen
and listen carefully.

291
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:35,438
This has been the biggest bummer
of a trip I've ever been on.

292
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:39,272
If you let me down
or you hurt my friends...

293
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:41,436
<i>especially the broad...</i>

294
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:43,946
<i>I got stuff planned for you...</i>

295
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:47,108
<i>- that'll take 20 years to kill you.
- No pain.</i>

296
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:51,644
<i>And you'll be screaming for mercy
in the first five seconds.</i>

297
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:53,781
Peace wants love...

298
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:56,952
wants free, will help.

299
00:31:57,027 --> 00:32:00,622
Look, just get us there,
you got it?

300
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,301
Don't be sad,
Elinore.

301
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:08,304
I'll kill that monster as soon
as he shows us that projector.

302
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:10,966
Are you kids ready?

303
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,807
<i>You know, this Peace here,
he knows every step towards Scortch.</i>

304
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,848
I promised him life
without pain...

305
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,849
uh, life without fear...

306
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,784
- I still don't trust him.
- H-Hey.

307
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:27,347
You're both forgetting you have
the protection of a powerful wizard here.

308
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,657
Damn it.

309
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:38,327
He's getting older but not much bolder.

310
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:41,337
I wonder if I packed my scotch.

311
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,343
Sing us a song, Elinore.

312
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:51,347
I don't want to.

313
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:55,351
But that's why we brought you. Come on.

314
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,807
<i>Where's daddy? What is he doing?</i>

315
00:33:24,882 --> 00:33:27,180
<i>He's guarding our home, son.</i>

316
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:30,311
There's been a war,
and this land has lost.

317
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:33,379
Why can't we fight and win, Mommy?

318
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:35,516
<i>Because they have
weapons and technology.</i>

319
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,584
<i>We just have love.</i>

320
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:50,305
Hey, Louie, What are we
gonna do with the prisoners?

321
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:53,138
How do I know?
They're findin' out right now.

322
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,144
Duuuhhh.

323
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:57,612
What is this place?

324
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:01,139
- Dumbo, it's religion, man. Ain't you heard?
- Religion?

325
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:03,812
Yeah. Blackwolf says
the responsibilities of the prisoners...

326
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,856
is up to
the priests inside.

327
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:08,357
Now, what we got to do,
dumbo...

328
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:11,360
is reconnoiter the priests
and find out.

329
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:13,362
What is all this?

330
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,796
Bits and pieces
of religion, man.

331
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:17,800
<i>What's the matter
with you?</i>

332
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:21,304
<i>Holy objects they saved
for millions of years, man.</i>

333
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:24,307
- What are we looking for?
- Hey, so dumb.

334
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,640
We're looking
for the priests, man, the priests.

335
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:29,645
Why?

336
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:31,681
I don't know.

337
00:34:31,749 --> 00:34:36,015
I guess because you need
God on your side, stupid.

338
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,020
Who's that?
Who's that?

339
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:40,022
- That's them. Them. Them.
- Who's that?

340
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,024
Uh, listen, you guys.

341
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:44,026
We hates to interrupt you, you know.

342
00:34:44,094 --> 00:34:46,528
- We're sorry.
- Yeah. But, uh, you see, Blackwolf...

343
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:48,531
- you know, our fhrer...
- It wasn't our fault.

344
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,533
Uh, shut up, will you?

345
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:53,035
<i>Blackwolf, the fhrer,
started this war, see.</i>

346
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:56,334
<i>We got all these prisoners
we don't want to feed...</i>

347
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:59,535
<i>We ain't got time for that.
We just got time for war.</i>

348
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,044
So, we were, uh...
I want to ask you guys...

349
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:04,046
He's asking you, not me.

350
00:35:04,114 --> 00:35:07,379
<i>Yeah, I'm asking if you want
to take care of'em, it's okay with us.</i>

351
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:09,715
<i>- Me too. Me too.
- Yeah, see?</i>

352
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:11,721
<i>- Yeah. Okay, dumbo.
- Okay.</i>

353
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:14,383
<i>- My sons, you say you are the victors.
- Uh-huh.</i>

354
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,392
<i>- But there is only one victor.
- Mmm.</i>

355
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,223
That's Him.

356
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:24,157
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

357
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:26,566
Patience.

358
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:30,630
- We must first observe sundown and pray.
- He's got a point.

359
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,768
Hear us, O Lord. Hear our petition.

360
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:38,474
O Lord, we cry out to you.
Lord, hear our prayer.

361
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:41,916
Hear the prayers
of thy humble servants.

362
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:44,352
O Lord, God, Lord, God...

363
00:35:44,421 --> 00:35:47,117
do not fail us in our hour of need.

364
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:50,592
We need you, O Lord.
We cry to you, O Lord.

365
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:53,824
Lord, help us.
Help us, O Lord.

366
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:57,424
<i>We need you. We cry to you.</i>

367
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:08,778
<i>We cry out to you!</i>

368
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:26,957
Hey, enough already.

369
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:30,398
O Lord, God, Lord, God.

370
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:34,038
All right, it's been five hours.
Time's up.

371
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:37,265
Okay, Charlie. It's no good.

372
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:40,742
- Put plan "A" to work.
- It's about time.

373
00:36:44,815 --> 00:36:47,409
Okay, babe. They ain't gonna talk.

374
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:51,420
- Gimme plan "B".
- Hey, what's plan "B"?

375
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:53,922
Hey, hey, hey. Watch.

376
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:07,596
Will the birth be soon?

377
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:09,605
Very soon, my Lord.

378
00:37:09,673 --> 00:37:13,609
<i>You're young to be queen.
But deliver me a son...</i>

379
00:37:13,677 --> 00:37:17,374
<i>and you shall help me rule this planet.</i>

380
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:20,884
I don't want to rule this planet, my Lord.

381
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:25,217
- Just our kingdom is enough.
- Enough?

382
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,224
Enough for mutants to stay
in their place, huh?

383
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:31,728
Live with radiation
so our bodies crawl with hell?

384
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:34,093
We will live in the good lands.

385
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,223
My son will grow
where there isn't death...

386
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,929
in the very waters we drink
and the air we breathe.

387
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:42,631
Wise men...

388
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:46,608
will my son be human or mutant?

389
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:50,272
Mutant, the charts say, my Lord.

390
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:53,942
The next one won't be.

391
00:37:54,017 --> 00:37:57,282
Do not have it killed, Oh, Lord!

392
00:37:57,354 --> 00:38:01,017
It is not his fault!

393
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,190
Wait a minute, Avatar.

394
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:37,853
Peace is taking us towards
the mountain fairies' domain.

395
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:40,089
We should go around.

396
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:42,598
Avatar, why is Peace stopping?

397
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,759
Fairy bad.

398
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:47,770
Not good. Go around.

399
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:50,432
Coming from Mr. Nice guy here...

400
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:53,442
those fairies must be something else.

401
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,535
Go on, nut. We'd lose time.

402
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:58,103
<i>Bad fairies.</i>

403
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:01,117
Elves and fairies are bad-blood cousins.

404
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:04,052
I'm not in the mood for their pranks.

405
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:06,112
They may have useful information.

406
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,785
Don't worry. Time has passed.

407
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,956
Much of the rivalry
between fairy and elf has subsided.

408
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:31,010
Barbarians.

409
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:39,649
Gee, they're adorable.

410
00:39:39,723 --> 00:39:42,658
Oh. Hey!

411
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,832
# Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha #

412
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,344
Holy chrome!

413
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:11,887
Oh. Hey.

414
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:25,197
By my sword, that is no way
to treat a lady.

415
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:43,011
Hey! Oh!

416
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:49,023
Stop this childish display.

417
00:40:49,092 --> 00:40:52,493
Why, even at elves' houses,
I've seen more sophisticated magic.

418
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:56,089
All right. All right. You've had it.

419
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,566
This is Avatar the Great
you're fooling with.

420
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:03,004
Avatar, consul and wizard
of your great-grandfathers' consuls...

421
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:05,667
<i>who was turned into Avatar the Old.</i>

422
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:08,905
Yeah, that's me...
Avatar the Old now...

423
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:11,004
but I still got my powers.

424
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:13,015
And you've cost me my patience.

425
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:16,075
I call upon all forces of darkness.

426
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:20,681
Oh, winds of abysses
howling through the stars...

427
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:24,022
<i>and eons of centuries.</i>

428
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:27,359
<i>O Lords of the Whirlwind,
black, gray and white...</i>

429
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:29,695
<i>I call upon you.</i>

430
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:54,587
<i>Oh, ever-increasing darkness...</i>

431
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:57,092
<i>shapeless and mindless beings...</i>

432
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,028
<i>corroded and rotten
in your hearts, body and mind...</i>

433
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:05,364
I summon you
from your ancient, timeless travels...

434
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:07,528
to ride the winds of blackness.

435
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:09,799
<i>And cabash!</i>

436
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:29,558
Please accept our apologies for the behavior
of some our more carefree brothers.

437
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:32,959
I'm Sean, leader
of the Knights of Stardust...

438
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:36,055
protectors of Dolan,
king of the mountain fairies.

439
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:40,229
We have prepared a feast to welcome
you to our humble domain.

440
00:42:40,303 --> 00:42:43,568
Listen here, you little winged squirt.

441
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,734
- Do you realize...
- Oh, Avatar, stop being so grumpy.

442
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,906
Oh... I... Hey, Oh...

443
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:52,949
<i>Ohh.</i>

444
00:42:55,652 --> 00:42:58,212
All right. Okay. Okay.

445
00:42:58,288 --> 00:43:00,256
I'm Avatar the Great, as you've heard.

446
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:03,258
Now, this here is Elinore,
queen of Montagar.

447
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:05,260
What brings you here?

448
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:08,491
<i>Oh, we're on a quest
to the land of Scortch.</i>

449
00:43:08,565 --> 00:43:11,500
<i> You're heading for Scortch?
I'm afraid you're in for trouble.</i>

450
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:14,093
<i>Will you tell us what you know?</i>

451
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:16,105
Steady, Westwind.

452
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:19,199
We'll eat alone, lest we sit with fools.

453
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,369
Meecher, where's Peace?

454
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:24,039
- Arise, you fools!
- Hey, what's that?

455
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:28,546
Assassin! Technology...

456
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,320
By the soul of Dulac and Rackham!

457
00:43:37,394 --> 00:43:40,886
- Elinore is gone!
- It was Peace!

458
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:43,558
I knew we should have
killed him when we had the chance!

459
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:45,463
Never mind. We must find Elinore.

460
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:48,070
The fairies have taken
her into the mountain.

461
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:50,902
Hey, there's no time to waste.

462
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,344
No one's ever been
to the fairy sanctuary before.

463
00:44:02,419 --> 00:44:05,786
- It's forbidden to all.
- Drums.

464
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:09,019
It begins.
Quickly now, or all is lost.

465
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:28,978
<i>You must save Elinore. Hurry, old fool.</i>

466
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:31,810
<i>Morro crinkle frizetta.</i>

467
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:33,975
<i>Enough magic, old man. Run!</i>

468
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:30,626
Very bad. Not good. Not good.

469
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:04,291
Destroy her! She's party to death!

470
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:07,734
Sean is dead! Killed by lies
and human technology.

471
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:11,740
Will it be brother
against brother here too?

472
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:14,402
Only humans kill their own kind.

473
00:47:14,477 --> 00:47:16,570
She allowed technology and death...

474
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:18,671
into the Golden Circle.

475
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:20,682
She is a traitor.

476
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,015
Traitor?
You fools, release me.

477
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:26,988
Stay back!
As the king's guards...

478
00:47:27,056 --> 00:47:29,490
we can't allow you near
until the king has ruled.

479
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,519
No one rules
over Elinore of Montagar.

480
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:36,531
We rule.

481
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,864
We rule over death,
lies, and deceit.

482
00:47:39,936 --> 00:47:42,029
<i>We rule.</i>

483
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:51,542
She's emoting. I feel her pain.

484
00:47:51,614 --> 00:47:53,548
It hurts! It hurts!

485
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:58,887
Wow!

486
00:47:58,955 --> 00:48:02,391
Avatar never told me
I had full fairy powers.

487
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:04,892
He said I wasn't ready yet.

488
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:07,395
I told you, she's dangerous.

489
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:10,398
Destroy her while there's still time.

490
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:14,129
<i>I say destroy her, king's rule or not.</i>

491
00:48:14,203 --> 00:48:16,194
Now why'd you want
to go and do that for, love?

492
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:18,672
It's hard enough
controlling them as it is.

493
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:23,576
Release me, or I, Elinore,
shall show all you ants something.

494
00:48:39,428 --> 00:48:43,228
- Stop him, miss. Stop him!
- Oh, did I do that?

495
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:47,235
Stop! I command you to cease.

496
00:48:47,303 --> 00:48:51,296
Okay. Leave everyone alone.

497
00:48:51,374 --> 00:48:54,400
I say, miss, you better stop him.

498
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:57,207
I think it would be better
if you released me and we all ran away.

499
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,545
Kill! Kill! Kill!

500
00:49:09,892 --> 00:49:11,826
Holy chrome.

501
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:15,159
Elinore's really gone and done it.

502
00:49:15,231 --> 00:49:17,426
It's all a disaster.

503
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,834
Well, old man, what are
you going to do about it?

504
00:49:21,904 --> 00:49:24,498
You better hurry, miss.

505
00:49:24,574 --> 00:49:27,941
Avatar the Great...

506
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,604
- coming.
- Avatar!

507
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:37,282
Yeah.
You can kill me now, I'm sure.

508
00:49:37,353 --> 00:49:39,947
<i>I've given myself to you.</i>

509
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:43,014
- I make no attempt to save myself.
- Save yourself?

510
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:45,686
Save yourself? Save me!

511
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:48,127
I can't, Elinore.

512
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:50,961
The only one who could
might be the king here.

513
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:55,868
My mission, O Lord, is to save
the world from another holocaust.

514
00:49:55,938 --> 00:50:00,966
<i>Sean was killed not by us,
but by my brother's assassins...</i>

515
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:04,877
<i>who have been sent to kill
Weehawk, Elinore...</i>

516
00:50:04,947 --> 00:50:08,644
<i>Peace, and myself
before we reach Scortch.</i>

517
00:50:08,718 --> 00:50:12,313
For all I know and fear,
Weehawk is dead.

518
00:50:12,388 --> 00:50:14,322
So might be Peace.

519
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,325
I ask for permission
to take the girl and myself...

520
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:19,384
to try to complete our mission alone...

521
00:50:19,462 --> 00:50:22,693
<i>though it does seem doomed now.</i>

522
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:26,393
I will not allow you to hurt Elinore...

523
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:28,562
without a fight by myself.

524
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:31,072
My brother lies, my good King!

525
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:36,703
Avatar! Avatar!

526
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:40,308
What will it be, King?

527
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:42,317
<i>Time's getting short.</i>

528
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:46,082
Avatar, could you hurry up a little bit?

529
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:49,124
We have been sent death...

530
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:51,352
images and humans...

531
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:53,418
each with a different story.

532
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:59,264
Something happening here.
Not you, please. Oh, no.

533
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:01,667
I have always been very good...

534
00:51:01,737 --> 00:51:04,900
and could even be
better sometimes.

535
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,908
<i>It starts again.</i>

536
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:11,003
The only act
that has been real so far...

537
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,072
is the fact that Avatar
did not break his word.

538
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,951
When the arrow struck him,
he did not fight back.

539
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:22,957
<i>And from what we all heard
about Avatar's power...</i>

540
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:26,517
<i>- that is surely the sign of truth.</i>

541
00:51:26,595 --> 00:51:31,965
We will neither join
nor hinder nor help these two.

542
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:34,969
We will wait and see.

543
00:51:35,037 --> 00:51:37,938
That is our decision.

544
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:55,646
Well, we're out of there.

545
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:57,659
Ouch!

546
00:51:57,727 --> 00:51:59,718
Thanks.
I forgot about that.

547
00:51:59,795 --> 00:52:04,732
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no, no. Let me help you.

548
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,825
How's that?

549
00:52:06,902 --> 00:52:09,462
It's very pretty, Avatar.

550
00:52:09,538 --> 00:52:13,565
Yeah, well, it could be warmer.

551
00:52:13,642 --> 00:52:15,735
We might as well begin.

552
00:52:15,811 --> 00:52:18,678
This is the way, I think.

553
00:52:18,748 --> 00:52:21,683
Scortch lies somewhere
over these mountains.

554
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,714
<i>Well, good morning.</i>

555
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:54,716
<i>Cozy morning, huh?</i>

556
00:52:54,784 --> 00:52:56,718
<i>Avatar, we're trapped.</i>

557
00:52:56,786 --> 00:53:00,722
<i>It's nothing a little
hard work won't cure.</i>

558
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:03,725
Here. Follow me, Snow Queen.

559
00:53:16,806 --> 00:53:20,003
I'm so cold, so cold.

560
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:22,509
Is it much farther?

561
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:37,024
Elinore, we've rested long enough.

562
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,356
We'd better move on.

563
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:43,023
Just a little while longer, Avatar.
I'm so tired.

564
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:45,032
Well, okay.

565
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:51,039
I'll go over and see
if I can see a pass or a path or a...

566
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:54,371
or a house or... something.

567
00:53:58,781 --> 00:54:01,045
Oh, my God.

568
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,550
They're our own tracks.

569
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:07,055
We've been moving in circles.

570
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:10,057
I better not tell Elinore.

571
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:13,390
It'll do her no good.

572
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:15,396
Avatar, riders!

573
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:18,831
Run! Assassins come to finish the job!

574
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:21,836
We'll cut their throats.
Let them come.

575
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:23,929
Right. I'll zap them back to Scortch.

576
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:26,839
They split up.

577
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:31,005
Going to come at us from each end.

578
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,176
- Avatar, we really tried, didn't we?
- Yes, Elinore.

579
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:38,049
That's all anyone
really could have done.

580
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,385
Steady.
Here they come.

581
00:54:41,457 --> 00:54:44,290
<i>Braxis plaxis traxis!</i>

582
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,055
Montagar forever.

583
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,722
Death, assassins!

584
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:54,565
Peace! Peace, we found them!
We found them!

585
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:57,572
What took you so long?

586
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,574
Quickly, Peace. Quickly.

587
00:54:59,642 --> 00:55:02,076
Let's get them off this glacier.

588
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:04,078
The quest is saved.

589
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:12,215
<i> The night
was spent in the protection of a cave.</i>

590
00:55:12,288 --> 00:55:16,224
<i>Elinore and Weehawk slept as
Avatar counseled with Peace...</i>

591
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:18,817
<i>on the quickest route to Scortch.</i>

592
00:55:18,894 --> 00:55:21,658
<i>The journey took them past the ruins...</i>

593
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,721
<i>of ancient civilizations.</i>

594
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:25,733
<i>Strange beasts lurked about...</i>

595
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:29,965
<i>but the dangerous mutants
that lived there were gone...</i>

596
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:31,973
<i>gone to Blackwolf's army.</i>

597
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:36,944
<i>All they left were their wives,
hurling insults and rocks...</i>

598
00:55:37,012 --> 00:55:40,106
<i>as the party passed through.</i>

599
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,014
<i>Then finally, the desert.</i>

600
00:55:46,755 --> 00:55:51,021
Yeah, I feel it too.

601
00:55:51,093 --> 00:55:54,256
Please do not attempt
to draw your gun.

602
00:56:02,137 --> 00:56:05,971
Avatar, you old fool! You've come!

603
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,044
Oh!

604
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:14,048
Our father's returned.

605
00:56:16,785 --> 00:56:19,447
Avatar... fighter!

606
00:56:19,521 --> 00:56:22,786
Avatar... father, mother, freedom!

607
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:24,792
Love, life!

608
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:46,480
We've been camping in the desert...

609
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:49,278
away from prying eyes.

610
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:53,287
- Where did you get the guns, Abdul?
- Guns!

611
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:57,348
Well, we got them
from old Blackwolf himself.

612
00:56:57,426 --> 00:57:00,418
You mean you joined with...

613
00:57:00,496 --> 00:57:02,430
No, no.

614
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:04,489
We ambushed a wolf patrol...

615
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:07,000
took everything except their women...

616
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:10,937
and two days from now,
we attack Scortch I.

617
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:13,804
What do you mean, attack?

618
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:16,936
The remaining elves of the free world...

619
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:18,946
have joined under my banner.

620
00:57:19,014 --> 00:57:22,609
That banner will be
carried to Scortch I.

621
00:57:22,684 --> 00:57:24,618
Join us, old wizard.

622
00:57:24,686 --> 00:57:26,745
We desperately need you.

623
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:36,130
Is this how you're repayin' me?

624
00:57:36,198 --> 00:57:41,261
Stand back.
Avatar will not be touched.

625
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:45,466
When our world was young,
so was mighty Avatar.

626
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,475
Misty moons ago...

627
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:50,535
<i>he strode this planet like a messiah...</i>

628
00:57:50,612 --> 00:57:54,548
<i>curing radiation sickness
from man and bird...</i>

629
00:57:54,616 --> 00:57:57,710
<i>cleaning the planet of its filth.</i>

630
00:57:57,786 --> 00:58:00,380
It was Avatar who fought
alongside my father...

631
00:58:00,456 --> 00:58:02,924
against the first mutant attack.

632
00:58:02,991 --> 00:58:07,985
So now we have
our messiah back again.

633
00:58:08,063 --> 00:58:11,999
<i>He's going to destroy
his brother for us.</i>

634
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,501
<i>With what?</i>

635
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:19,507
A woman-child, one elf...

636
00:58:21,076 --> 00:58:23,510
and a moron robot.

637
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:34,522
Oh, Avatar.

638
00:58:57,312 --> 00:59:00,042
- What is it?
- It's Blackwolf.

639
00:59:00,115 --> 00:59:03,448
He's trying to gain control.

640
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:06,920
Back! Back!

641
00:59:06,989 --> 00:59:08,980
Back to hell!

642
00:59:09,057 --> 00:59:10,991
You can't have him!

643
00:59:20,669 --> 00:59:23,604
You did it.
You beat the demon.

644
00:59:23,672 --> 00:59:26,004
What's happened?

645
00:59:26,074 --> 00:59:29,771
Well, I suddenly
felt very sorry for Peace...

646
00:59:29,845 --> 00:59:33,508
so I went over to him, and I took
his hand and I tried to comfort him.

647
00:59:33,582 --> 00:59:37,518
Peace is in constant
mental battle with Blackwolf.

648
00:59:37,586 --> 00:59:40,749
Your kind words took his mind
off the battle.

649
00:59:40,822 --> 00:59:42,756
It allowed Blackwolf his chance.

650
00:59:42,824 --> 00:59:45,691
Avatar. What's that?

651
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:51,391
Trapped.

652
01:00:08,116 --> 01:00:11,313
- Jump, Peace!
- Jump, Peace!

653
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:23,555
<i>Elinore!</i>

654
01:00:37,312 --> 01:00:40,440
Elinore!

655
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:00,467
<i>Ah, I don't know.</i>

656
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:02,469
<i>I just don't know.</i>

657
01:01:02,537 --> 01:01:06,166
I don't know what
happened to Elinore.

658
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:09,404
Betrayal of Elinore
to the quest has broken his heart.

659
01:01:09,478 --> 01:01:11,912
There is nothing wrong
with him.

660
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,041
Tomorrow morning, the attack begins.

661
01:01:17,486 --> 01:01:20,421
- Avatar, we have to go now.
- Oh, whatever.

662
01:01:20,489 --> 01:01:23,424
The cliffs of Scortch can be seen.

663
01:01:23,492 --> 01:01:27,428
<i>- We have to go now to complete our mission.
- Huh?</i>

664
01:01:27,496 --> 01:01:30,431
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

665
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:34,435
- How?
- We have to swim in.

666
01:01:34,503 --> 01:01:37,131
Oh. Okay.

667
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:17,536
What's happened to the world?

668
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,546
I don't know.

669
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:22,208
I can remember back...

670
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:26,355
All the fairies were so good...

671
01:02:26,488 --> 01:02:30,083
We're here. Scortch.
Chrome!

672
01:02:30,158 --> 01:02:33,093
Come. We'll walk right up the road...

673
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:35,095
and no one will expect it.

674
01:02:35,163 --> 01:02:37,893
- We'll act like slaves.
- Yeah.

675
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:41,697
The castle. I see it.
It's quite a distance.

676
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:46,173
I had one where the whole country
would disappear for a day.

677
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:49,938
Ohh.
That was, uh...

678
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:54,004
That was really, uh...
I just don't know.

679
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:56,949
Over there.
That must be the entrance...

680
01:02:57,018 --> 01:02:58,952
to the lower cities.

681
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,456
Now, guards might be about. Come on.

682
01:03:02,524 --> 01:03:06,392
Hmm. How ugly.

683
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:10,227
How ugly. Kapow!

684
01:03:10,298 --> 01:03:12,892
Boom. Boom.

685
01:03:24,479 --> 01:03:27,607
<i>I just don't know.</i>

686
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:30,412
Maybe... Maybe I should
make a deal with them.

687
01:03:41,496 --> 01:03:45,830
Chrome.
Which way? I don't know.

688
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:48,199
You know, I should have
stayed with them.

689
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,501
- They love magic.
- Shh.

690
01:03:51,573 --> 01:03:54,440
- Avatar, just stay quiet.
- Yeah. Oh.

691
01:03:54,509 --> 01:03:56,443
Psst. Hey, General.

692
01:03:56,511 --> 01:04:00,607
Want to buy an elf hat? Elf beard?

693
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:02,912
<i>Souvenirs for sale.
Precious souvenirs for sale.</i>

694
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:07,944
<i>- Get them while they're still hot.
- No more wars, you fools... love.</i>

695
01:04:08,023 --> 01:04:10,457
Scortch can be beautiful too.

696
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:12,959
Look, look. Real, beautiful presents.

697
01:04:14,463 --> 01:04:17,125
<i>Now, that-that...</i>

698
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:19,690
that is a wonderful trick.

699
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:22,862
- Wonderful.
- It's Avatar. Oh, General.

700
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:26,965
It's him. It's bad.
It's come to hurt the fhrer.

701
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:29,909
Kill it.
Oh, master, kill it.

702
01:04:29,978 --> 01:04:33,414
That's impossible.

703
01:04:33,482 --> 01:04:36,417
That dirty old man
is Avatar the Great?

704
01:04:36,485 --> 01:04:39,921
If that is so...

705
01:04:39,988 --> 01:04:43,981
then I am a warthog's uncle!

706
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:45,993
Funny you should say that.

707
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:54,159
Kiyah!

708
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:57,897
Ki-Kiyah!

709
01:05:01,243 --> 01:05:04,371
Oooowah!

710
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,454
The enemy is dead.

711
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:16,047
Oh, master, the enemy is dead.

712
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:20,060
My God! What have I done?

713
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:23,894
Master loves Larry.
Master feeds Larry.

714
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,897
What are elves good for?

715
01:05:30,972 --> 01:05:33,167
Avatar, good luck!

716
01:05:36,177 --> 01:05:38,202
The beast has shown us
the way to the castle.

717
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:43,016
I'm sorry, Weehawk.

718
01:05:43,084 --> 01:05:45,348
I'm just an old fool.

719
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,354
You know...

720
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:50,516
the world owes you much, kid...

721
01:05:50,592 --> 01:05:54,028
even if we don't take another step.

722
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:05,688
God! Avatar, get down.

723
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,820
I've seen him.
You can't beat him. He's too strong.

724
01:13:08,897 --> 01:13:11,593
Avatar, don't do it.

725
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:13,964
You may be right...

726
01:13:14,035 --> 01:13:15,969
but I gotta battle my brother.

727
01:13:16,037 --> 01:13:18,972
You find an entrance into the castle.

728
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,840
Smash the projector,
and tell Elinore...

729
01:13:22,911 --> 01:13:26,244
that Avatar will die with her tonight...

730
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:29,249
even if we win.

731
01:13:31,152 --> 01:13:34,087
Hello.

732
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:36,589
You have aged, old fool.

733
01:13:36,658 --> 01:13:39,252
The world is mine.

734
01:13:48,403 --> 01:13:52,430
- Weehawk!
- Slut!

735
01:13:52,507 --> 01:13:55,943
Weehawk, don't!
Weehawk, don't! Don't! Don't!

736
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:59,246
Stop, elf!

737
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:03,410
Blood on blood flowing,
fathers and sons dying...

738
01:14:03,484 --> 01:14:07,716
brothers and lovers spilling false hate
and rivers of life flowing away.

739
01:14:07,789 --> 01:14:12,419
Fool elf! Think your sword
is always quick, but what else?

740
01:14:12,493 --> 01:14:14,427
<i>Think!</i>

741
01:14:16,831 --> 01:14:19,766
Weehawk, I could not help it.

742
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:22,769
When I touched Peace in the desert...

743
01:14:22,837 --> 01:14:25,101
Blackwolf trapped my mind.

744
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:28,438
I'm not as strong as Peace. It hurts.

745
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:34,445
Avatar must know.

746
01:14:34,515 --> 01:14:36,813
The trouble with you, my brother...

747
01:14:36,884 --> 01:14:38,818
is that you've always been too good.

748
01:14:38,886 --> 01:14:42,151
Well, that may be.

749
01:14:42,223 --> 01:14:45,659
But I still think I look
more like Ma than you do.

750
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:47,991
You know, uh, lots of character.

751
01:14:48,062 --> 01:14:49,996
I'm agin' better.

752
01:14:50,064 --> 01:14:55,161
Brother, there is no need
for me to destroy you.

753
01:14:55,236 --> 01:14:58,034
Surrender.
Surrender your world.

754
01:15:00,108 --> 01:15:03,475
You always did need
an audience, you sap.

755
01:15:03,544 --> 01:15:05,842
Let me tell ya...

756
01:15:05,913 --> 01:15:08,677
I ain't practiced
much magic for a long time.

757
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:13,346
I wanna show you a trick Mother
showed me when you weren't around...

758
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:16,686
to use on special occasions like this.

759
01:15:16,758 --> 01:15:20,216
Ah. Oh, yeah, one more thing...

760
01:15:20,294 --> 01:15:24,025
I'm glad you changed
your last name, you son of a bitch.

761
01:15:43,284 --> 01:15:45,718
Avatar!
Elinore's no traitor!

762
01:15:45,787 --> 01:15:48,654
She was possessed by Blackwolf.

763
01:16:03,237 --> 01:16:06,866
<i>It is done! It is done!</i>

764
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:09,466
<i>The world is free!</i>

765
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:17,208
<i>The projector destroyed,
the battle was over.</i>

766
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:19,412
<i>Shadow creatures
froze in their tracks.</i>

767
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:21,512
<i>Some faded...</i>

768
01:16:24,192 --> 01:16:26,126
<i>some crawled back to hell.</i>

769
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:30,726
<i>Mutants... leaderless... ran.</i>

770
01:16:30,798 --> 01:16:36,634
<i>Elves swept the beaches clear of the few
remaining mutants that still fought...</i>

771
01:16:39,173 --> 01:16:43,303
<i>- As hundreds of circling black birds...</i>

772
01:16:43,377 --> 01:16:46,642
<i>screamed at the carnage below.</i>

773
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:52,142
<i>There was some rejoicing.</i>

774
01:16:55,656 --> 01:16:59,092
<i>But mostly, everyone wished
to return home quickly...</i>

775
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:03,096
<i>to tell their loved ones
that the war was won...</i>

776
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:05,724
<i>Hitler was dead again...</i>

777
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,997
<i>and that they could live
once more in peace...</i>

778
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:12,403
<i>in the land they loved so much...</i>

779
01:17:12,473 --> 01:17:14,687
<i>God-given. Amen.</i>

780
01:17:14,722 --> 01:17:16,902
<i>God-given. Amen.</i>

781
01:17:18,411 --> 01:17:21,141
Avatar! Look what I caught!

782
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:24,883
Don't hurt Larry. Larry served.

783
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:27,215
Beast of a thousand scales...

784
01:17:27,287 --> 01:17:30,051
Hey, hey, hey. Set it free.

785
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:32,216
It's harmless without Blackwolf.

786
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:35,489
Pity it. It's not its fault.

787
01:17:35,562 --> 01:17:37,655
Mmm. So be it.

788
01:17:39,232 --> 01:17:41,496
Thank you. Thank you.

789
01:17:41,568 --> 01:17:44,264
Thank you, master.

790
01:17:45,338 --> 01:17:47,602
We ride back to Montagar.

791
01:17:47,674 --> 01:17:50,939
Weehawk, you ride back
to Montagar alone.

792
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:54,538
Avatar and I will start
a new kingdom somewhere.

793
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:57,276
You will rule Montagar as their new king.

794
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:01,612
Are you and Avatar married, my Queen?

795
01:18:01,688 --> 01:18:05,351
Hey, kid, take it easy, huh?

796
01:18:05,425 --> 01:18:09,293
You did a good job,
but don't get carried away.

797
01:18:09,362 --> 01:18:12,729
You think Avatar's
too old to get married?

798
01:18:12,799 --> 01:18:17,293
Weehawk, how many years
do wizards live, 10,000 or more?

799
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:20,635
And I got at least a thousand left,
you know what I mean?

800
01:18:20,707 --> 01:18:24,643
Forgive me, Avatar.
Forgive me, both of you.

801
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:27,145
For Montagar, forever.

802
01:18:38,058 --> 01:18:40,822
Well, come on. Let's make it.

803
01:18:40,894 --> 01:18:44,159
Avatar,

804
01:18:44,231 --> 01:18:47,997
You're getting older and much bolder.

805
01:18:48,068 --> 01:18:51,504
Come on! I meant
let's make it out of here.

806
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:55,007
Sure you did.
