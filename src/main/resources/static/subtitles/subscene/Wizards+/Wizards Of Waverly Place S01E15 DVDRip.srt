1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,620
Dude, close your mouth.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,060
Your tongue is gonna dry out.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,960
You're right.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,930
Listen, man.
Why don't you just ask her out?

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,370
Kari Langsdorf?

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,940
l can't ask out Kari Langsdorf.
She's got no idea who l am.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,440
She's never even talked to me.
l'm totally invisible to her.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,480
- Sorry, man. l didn't see you there.
- Why would you?

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,850
Totally invisible to everybody.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,550
Hey, Kari, you wanna check out
a movie this weekend?

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,850
Do you play baseball?

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,320
No, but l'm quarterback
of the football team,

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,330
president of student council
and l'm a swimsuit model.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,060
l only date baseball players.

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,200
Oh, sorry.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,140
Didn't see you there.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,480
- So, Justin, do you play baseball?
- Yes.

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,910
- You gonna try out for the team this year?
- l might.

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,380
You think you got a shot?

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,340
Absolutely not.

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,640
Hey, Alex, can l get a turkey sandwich?

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,040
l'm off the clock.
You know where everything is.

23
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,950
Well, if you're off the clock,
then what are we doing here?

24
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,540
l've got a jean jacket at home
that's not going to sequin itself.

25
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,950
Relax, Harper, we're just waiting
for my dad to come back

26
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,790
with the team he's coaching
so we can see the cute guys.

27
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,990
All right, guys.
Root beer floats are on the house.

28
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,590
Hey, Justin tried out for the first time,
and even made the team.

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,900
Who knew?

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,340
Well, l know how much you love baseball,
so l figured l'd give it a shot.

31
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,910
Awesome. Then it's settled.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,980
l'm the Aztecs' number one fan.

33
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,270
Let the trash talking begin.

34
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,300
Dad, he's doing it again.

35
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,880
Maxy, we really appreciate
the enthusiasm,

36
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,540
but let's not revisit
what happened on the soccer field.

37
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,980
What soccer field?

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,920
The one the park police
said you can't go to anymore.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,260
Excuse me for cheering for my brother.
ls that a crime?

40
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,390
According to the park police, yes.

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,830
The kid in the diaper started it.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,490
Hey, Alex,
do you have an extra-long spoon?

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
Sure. Okay.

44
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,610
Here you go, Riley.

45
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,040
Thanks.

46
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,950
What was that?
l thought you were off the clock.

47
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,550
l'm always on the clock for Riley.
lsn't he so cute?

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,020
You mean Justin.

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,350
No, Riley.

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,660
Justin's cute.

51
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,600
l can't believe Justin's on Riley's team.

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,930
Finally, after years of Justin
being a bore,

53
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,230
l can use him
for my own personal gain.

54
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,040
- How are you going to do that?
- l have no idea.

55
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,650
But it's a nice feeling,

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,540
the kind that makes you stop
and give thanks you have a brother.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,310
Here he comes. How do l look?

58
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,210
- Fine.
- Just fine?

59
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,250
Fine isn't good enough.

60
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,450
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

61
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,950
Hey.

62
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,620
Hey, Justin.
Congrats on making the team Riley's on.

63
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,790
Baseball, right?

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,690
Yep, l made the team, all right.

65
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,820
You don't sound all right.
What's the matter?

66
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,460
l've done a bad, bad thing, Alex.

67
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,660
What?

68
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,550
l charmed the baseball
so Dad would think l was good.

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,170
l didn't know you were into baseball.

70
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,310
l'm not. l'm into Kari Langsdorf.

71
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,780
Okay, so, what's the bad,
bad thing you did?

72
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,950
l cheated.
l used magic to make the baseball team.

73
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,820
lf Dad knew, he would flip out.

74
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,420
Yeah, but the important thing is,

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,660
is now you're on the baseball team
with Riley.

76
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,830
What?

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,730
Well, Riley's the catcher,
so he can teach you some stuff.

78
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,470
But until then, you should probably
use magic to stay on the team.

79
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,840
Alex, l'm not like you.
l don't break the rules.

80
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,240
l'm ridden with guilt.
lt's eating up my insides.

81
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,980
Pretty soon, l'll be just a shell.

82
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,650
You'll get over it.
And, Justin, magic is your talent.

83
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,450
l mean, do they make a tall
basketball player play on his knees?

84
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,650
No.

85
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,850
Do they make a fast swimmer
only do the dog paddle?

86
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,260
No.

87
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,590
Then why should a wizard
not use magic?

88
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,090
Hey.

89
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,960
Congratulations on making the team.
l'm Kari.

90
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,770
Hi, Kari. l'm Just-- Just--

91
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,170
- l'm Just--
- Just so happy to meet you.

92
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,570
Yes, he is. And his name is Justin.

93
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,700
Well, it's nice to meet you, Justin.

94
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,610
l love going to the baseball games,

95
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,510
so l'm sure we'll be seeing a lot
of each other at the baseball games,

96
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,450
because you play
in the baseball games.

97
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,180
l love baseball.

98
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,830
She can see me.

99
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,160
She can totally see me.
l'm not invisible anymore.

100
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,960
No way.
You know the invisibility spell?

101
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,860
l'll trade you for the popularity spell.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,870
You know what?
l am totally gonna use magic.

103
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,440
Thanks, Alex.

104
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,910
You always know
the right wrong thing to do.

105
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,810
Now go sit by Riley
and tell him how cool l am.

106
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,610
Here we go. Come on now.

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,090
Ball four. Take your base.

108
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,530
Time, ump.

109
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,290
Time.

110
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,660
Yeah, Justin!

111
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,400
He and l are gonna be going out soon.

112
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,510
Nice job today. Nice job.

113
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,010
All right, Justin.
Let's see if you can finish this thing.

114
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,380
Justin looks great in his uniform.

115
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,420
He slept in it last night.

116
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,490
l find that totally attractive.

117
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,360
Alex, here comes Riley.
Do you wanna talk to him alone?

118
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,770
- That would be nice.
- Got it.

119
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,970
lf you need me, l'll be over here.
Hi, Justin.

120
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,240
Hey, Riley. Cute uniform.

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,040
Thanks. lt was my idea
to go with the sleeveless jerseys.

122
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,150
- l'm gonna be your good luck charm.
- What?

123
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,720
Whenever l'm here, you'll win.

124
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,290
lf this guy strikes out and we win,
l'll believe you.

125
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,790
You'll see.

126
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,330
- Good eye, baby. Good eye.
- Get the strikes.

127
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,100
Get this guy out and we win.
lf you don't, we lose.

128
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,330
No pressure.

129
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,710
Come on, Justin. Good luck, Justin.

130
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,580
Throw a knuckleball.

131
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,840
Come on, Justin.

132
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,080
Mow this guy down. He ain't no hitter.

133
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,250
He couldn't hit it
if you threw a basketball.

134
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,450
Hey, kid, do you mind? That's my son.

135
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,990
Oh, l'm sorry. For you.

136
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,010
Lead-off hitter. Lead-off hitter.

137
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,040
- That's all right.
- All right, baby.

138
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,570
Strike one.

139
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,150
That's my brother. l'm his brother.

140
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
Together, we'll send you losers home.

141
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,290
Nice work, son. Bring in the heat.

142
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,820
Strike two.

143
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,550
Amazing, huh?

144
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,560
You feel that heat, losers?

145
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,430
Strike three. You're out.

146
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,540
- Game over.
- Nice.

147
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,960
Way to go, loser.

148
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,790
You should change
your first name to Lou

149
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,400
and your last name to Sir.

150
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,160
Get it? ''Loser.''

151
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,570
Oh, boy.
You ever seen a kid pitch like that, huh?

152
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,260
Come to think of it,
l've never seen a kid pitch like that either.

153
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,510
Something's not right.

154
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,280
You were awesome
out there today, Justin.

155
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,690
Those batters had no clue
what you were throwing at them.

156
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,350
- Like they had never seen pitches before.
- That's what l do.

157
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,550
Throw them the dark stuff,
turn up the heat,

158
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,600
give them a little pop-goes-the-weasel.

159
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,200
Pop-goes-the-weasel?

160
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,060
ls that like a baseball term?

161
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,530
Yeah, in Taiwan,

162
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,140
where l learned the pitch.

163
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,110
Oh, l'm glad we finally met.

164
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,110
See you around.

165
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,310
Just, l need to talk to you.

166
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,740
As my dad or as my coach?

167
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,380
As your magic teacher.

168
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,180
You broke the rules.
You never break the rules.

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,810
Do they make a tall basketball player
do the dog paddle?

170
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,580
Do they make a fast swimmer
swim on his knees?

171
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,890
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,290
Alex told me to use magic.

173
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,230
Here's some advice.
Stop listening to your sister.

174
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,760
Got it. E-mail to self:

175
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,770
''Stop listening to evil sister.''

176
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,530
Justin, l'm very disappointed in you.

177
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,770
You've always been a stickler
for the rules.

178
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,710
- All right, fine. l'll quit the team.
- No, you're not quitting the team.

179
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,440
You're gonna learn your lesson
by pitching without magic.

180
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,310
l'll get creamed.

181
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,890
Exactly.
That's the learning your lesson part.

182
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,660
l'm ready for Justin's second game.

183
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,100
Max, don't you think
that foam finger's a little big?

184
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,360
No, but this one might be.

185
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,770
Hey, if it rains,
you can mop up the infield for us.

186
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,510
That's a good one, Dad. Yeah.

187
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,370
Hey, Alex.
You ready to go to the game?

188
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,180
- Come on.
- Nope.

189
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,580
l'm not going today.

190
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,420
But you're Riley's good luck charm.

191
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,220
My dad's making Justin pitch
even though he can't use a spell.

192
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,120
Spell?

193
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah. Justin had a spelling test
and couldn't practice pitching.

194
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,220
Yeah, that works. Nice.

195
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,200
So he's gonna get clobbered
and the team's gonna lose.

196
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,670
But don't you wanna see Riley?

197
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,500
Yes, but not if they're gonna lose.

198
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,300
That's just gonna show Riley
that l'm not his good luck charm.

199
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,970
But he might wish you were there.

200
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,910
l know. That's the good part.

201
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,180
l won't be there,
which will reinforce the idea

202
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,310
that l am his good luck charm.

203
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,910
Okay...

204
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,220
But l think it would be fun to see Riley.

205
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,090
Let me explain this to you slowly.

206
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,310
- lt's a run.
- Good job, crew.

207
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
Let me ask you something.

208
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,380
l know, l know.
l'm getting creamed out here.

209
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,460
Right, right.

210
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,890
Hey, does your sister
ever ask about me?

211
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,070
l know it was tough going today, Justin.

212
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,540
Tough going?

213
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,260
l gave up 26 runs.

214
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,540
Their guys kept running around
and around and around

215
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,170
- and around and around and around--
- Justin.

216
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,340
Justin, listen.

217
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,440
Only one of my kids
is gonna be able to keep his powers.

218
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,250
l don't want you relying on magic,
because you might not have it one day.

219
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,420
All right, all right. l get it.

220
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,150
l never liked baseball anyway.

221
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,090
Then why did you try out for the team?

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,900
To impress Kari Langsdorf.

223
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,360
l get it.

224
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,440
You know, when l was your age,
l tried using magic to impress a girl.

225
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,560
Turned into a total disaster.

226
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,270
- What happened?
- l married her.

227
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,210
Just kidding.

228
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,470
Seriously, l'm just kidding.

229
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,740
Don't even say l said that,
even as a joke.

230
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,610
The point is, using magic is cheating.

231
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,990
And cheating to impress people
ultimately fails.

232
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,920
So l suggest you practice hard,

233
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,030
because l've decided
to pitch you again next game.

234
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,530
Dad, without magic,
l'll get creamed again.

235
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,230
Not necessarily.
You have some of my natural ability.

236
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,460
We just have to find it.

237
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,590
- Do l have a choice?
- No.

238
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,670
Look, son, you made a commitment
and you have to stick to it.

239
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,240
You think l can do better
than l did today?

240
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,040
lt'd be hard to do worse.

241
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,340
All right.

242
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,780
- All right, fine. l'll give it a shot.
- No magic, right?

243
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,080
- No magic. Got it.
- Okay.

244
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,560
You see? They lost.

245
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,950
So if l'd gone to the game,

246
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,120
l couldn't possibly be
Riley's good luck charm.

247
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,890
And then he wouldn't be
interested in me.

248
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,830
Do you understand that?

249
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,700
Oh, l get it. Good plan.

250
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,770
Now let's talk about something
that's really important.

251
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,000
Your brother's baseball uniform.

252
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,110
How cute is he in that?

253
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,510
Alex, where were you today?
We got smeared.

254
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,010
l've been studying.

255
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,720
She wasn't there and you lost.

256
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,620
Sounds like she's
your good luck charm.

257
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,820
You're welcome.

258
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,720
l'm sorry, Riley.

259
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,060
l didn't know you wanted me
to come to every game.

260
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,330
Yeah. You're our good luck charm.

261
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,700
And we need good luck every game.

262
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,300
Every game? l don't know.

263
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,740
l'll tell you what.

264
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,070
lf you come to our next game
and we win,

265
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,700
l'll take you to the fall dance.

266
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,410
And what makes you think
l'd wanna go to the fall dance with you?

267
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,920
Every girl does, don't they?

268
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,360
Yeah, you're right. Okay, you got a deal.

269
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,220
Great. Because l'm very superstitious.

270
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,420
But with you,

271
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,430
l got a feeling we'll go all the way
to the state championship.

272
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,090
And all the way to the fall dance.

273
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,830
See you.

274
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,270
Oh, wait.

275
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,630
What are you gonna do
if Justin pitches badly next game,

276
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,710
they lose, and Riley realizes
you're not his good luck charm?

277
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,280
As long as l have
something to do with it,

278
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,210
l'm pretty sure Justin's team
will win the next game.

279
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,850
Oh, come on, Justin.

280
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,190
l didn't paint my face
for a tied-up game.

281
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,760
This stuff is starting to burn.
ls that bad?

282
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,870
l sure hope Justin gets out of this jam,
otherwise you're not good luck.

283
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,870
And l was up half the night with my mom
trying to figure this out.

284
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,770
So when you're there, he wins,
and when you're not, he doesn't.

285
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,480
Don't worry.
l know Justin will get out of this.

286
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,960
Batter's out of there.

287
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,590
Good job. Good job.

288
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,600
- Thanks, coach.
- Nice.

289
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,830
Justin, is there something
you wanna tell me?

290
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,970
No. ls there something
you wanna tell me?

291
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,940
- No.
- All right.

292
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,110
Good talk. Good talk.

293
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,650
Let's play some ball.

294
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,460
Time, ump.

295
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,900
Time.

296
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,700
Justin.

297
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,970
You're calling timeout
to talk to a guy sitting on the bench?

298
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,870
There's no rule against it.

299
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,650
- l told you l didn't do it.
- l know, l know.

300
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,680
l was watching you.

301
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,750
There's something going on, though,

302
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,450
so l want you to use your powers
to counteract it.

303
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,750
Keep the game fair.

304
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,020
Okay...

305
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,490
Un-time.

306
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,690
Play ball.

307
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,820
Come on, let's go.
Everybody on the bench.

308
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,630
Safe.

309
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,280
Timeout, ump. Timeout.

310
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,220
Time.

311
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,540
Alex, get over here.

312
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,320
You're calling timeout to talk to a fan?

313
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,550
Show me the rule, ump.
Show me the rule.

314
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,990
l know what you're doing, young lady,
and l want it to stop.

315
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,760
l was just trying to help.

316
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,760
- Here, Justin, recite this spell.
- What is it?

317
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,370
lt will erase everyone's memory

318
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,810
so they won't remember
what happened the past few minutes.

319
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,570
- Even ours?
- l don't know.

320
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,740
l don't remember. l've never used it.

321
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,310
All right.

322
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,140
Cerebellum erasis

323
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,650
What just happened?

324
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,160
We won. We won.

325
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,730
ln your face, losers.
Go home and cry, you little babies.

326
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,240
l smell smoke,
because you were burned.

327
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,770
There he is. Get him. Get him.

328
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,340
Dad, l don't remember
how the game ended.

329
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,210
Neither do l.

330
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,220
l think Alex had something to do with it.

331
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,950
What's that piece of paper?

332
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,690
Hey, this could
come in handy someday.

333
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,340
So Alex, looks like l've got a date
for the fall dance.

334
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,410
Yes, you do. And Friday night too.

335
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,700
We're going out Friday night?

336
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,280
Yeah, you asked me
right after you scored the winning run.

337
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,540
Don't you remember?

338
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,510
Yeah, sure. Great.

339
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,120
Looking forward to Friday night.

340
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,780
Yes, you are.

341
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,720
l know what you did, Alex.

342
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,090
You broke the rules and used magic

343
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,390
because you wanted Riley
to ask you out.

344
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,590
l did no such thing.
And it totally worked.

345
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,230
l don't think it did.

346
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,380
- What are you talking about?
- Your punishment.

347
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,310
- You're not going to the fall dance.
- What?

348
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,640
Justin used magic.
Where's his punishment?

349
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,750
Justin was already punished
on the baseball field

350
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,620
when the other team ran around
and around and around.

351
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,350
- Hi, Kari.
- Oh, hey, Justin.

352
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,020
- Mind if l join you?
- Please do.

353
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,130
So l was wondering, since you like
baseball players and everything

354
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,230
if maybe you'd not want to not go
to a movie or something?

355
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,600
Did you just ask me out?

356
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,140
l think so. l was trying to.

357
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,430
Okay, sure.

358
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,570
- l'd love to go to a movie with you.
- Excellent.

359
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,510
So we're on this weekend.
What movie do you wanna see?

360
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,980
Oh, l only date baseball players,
and l only see movies about--

361
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,180
- Baseball.
- No, cats.

362
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,450
Okay.

363
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,420
Are there any movies out right now
about cats?

364
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,030
No.

365
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,560
Would you see a movie about dogs?

366
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,290
Not unless they're cats
disguised as dogs.

367
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,330
Farm animals?

368
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,240
Are the cats, like,
disguised as farm animals,

369
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,140
like, cows and stuff?

370
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,300
Yeah.

371
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,480
l'll tell you what.

372
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,780
Why don't we wait
till a cat movie comes out?

373
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,510
l'll keep an eye on the paper, real close.

374
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,280
Good talking to you, Kari.
