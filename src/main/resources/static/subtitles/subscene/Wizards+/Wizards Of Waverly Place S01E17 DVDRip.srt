1
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:06,884
Okay. Last question.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,494
''Bat wings, dragon scales and fruit punch
make what kind of potion?

3
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:17,001
A, invisibility. B, skin of steel.
C, a refreshing fruit smoothie.''

4
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:18,531
Got it.

5
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:20,639
Does he have to say ''got it''
after every question?

6
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:22,638
lt's throwing me off on my exam.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,141
We're taking an exam?

8
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:31,413
Time. Pencils down.
Last exam section.

9
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:33,075
Grab your wands and line up.

10
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,346
You have to use
the transfiguration spell

11
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:38,821
to change one of these guinea pigs
into a white dove.

12
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,722
Okay, Justin, you're up.

13
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:47,461
This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill its slot

14
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,991
Very good, Justin.

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,439
- Alex, you're up.
- Oh, okay.

16
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:58,868
This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill its slot

17
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:06,377
lt's a pretty dove.

18
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:10,480
No. lt's a pretty brick.

19
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:14,993
You weren't concentrating.
Max, you're up.

20
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:22,127
This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill with snot

21
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:27,537
l said ''snot,'' didn't l?

22
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,506
Okay, everybody record
your transfiguration results

23
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:34,613
in your midterm-exam text booklets.

24
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,577
l don't know why you guys
even bother taking the tests.

25
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:41,312
We all know l'm the one that's gonna win
the family wizard contest

26
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:42,944
and keep my powers.

27
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:44,852
That's not for a long while, Justin.

28
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,017
And what if they change the rules
so only girls keep their powers?

29
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:50,789
Oh, wait, you still might win.

30
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:54,562
Oh, Alex, you're so transparent. You know
that l'm better than you at magic,

31
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:56,464
so you have to lash out
and make fun of me.

32
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,593
And you don't take
any of this magic seriously.

33
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,901
l can't take you seriously.
You use big words like ''transparent.''

34
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,633
What are you, British?

35
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:08,146
No, but l am.

36
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:12,179
Professor Crumbs,
always nice to see you.

37
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,309
The beard is coming in nicely.

38
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:16,753
Jerry.

39
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:19,050
l knew your father when this

40
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:22,923
was just a soul patch
for the lovely witches.

41
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,869
l am here to collect your exams
and take them back to Wiz Tech.

42
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,101
Why doesn't Dad
just grade our papers?

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,935
So that no one will get better grades

44
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:39,169
just by batting their eyes
and trying to look cute.

45
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,443
Are you talking about me?

46
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:45,846
Alex, you're doing it right now.

47
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:43,202
Wizard report cards are here.

48
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:47,474
Oh, you sound excited.
You must feel confident you did well.

49
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:51,773
Wizard report cards are here.

50
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,777
You first.

51
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:02,286
Max Russo, your exam results

52
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:05,463
plus your coursework
equals a solid C-plus.

53
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,999
You are totally average. Cool.

54
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:15,240
Sweet, l got a C. Yes.

55
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,946
Alex Russo, your exam results
plus the homework you handed in

56
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,448
on greasy napkins
that smelled like shrimp

57
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,452
all equals...F.

58
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:31,621
And the...is a low F.

59
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:33,725
Excuse me.

60
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,885
l turned a guinea pig
into a very solid brick,

61
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:39,896
which l think is a much more effective
symbol for peace.

62
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:41,790
Please have your parents sign me,

63
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:44,960
so l can return to Wizard Tech
and receive my payment.

64
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:46,571
l have to make a living.

65
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:51,541
- Yeah, right, like that's gonna happen.
- No, no, no.

66
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:53,736
l got children to laminate.

67
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:56,608
What are you gonna do?
Mom and Dad need to sign that.

68
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,383
Well, they can't sign something
that never got here.

69
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:01,017
- But it got here.
- No, it didn't.

70
00:05:01,153 --> 00:05:02,677
- Yes, it did. No, it didn't.
- lt did.

71
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:04,187
- What?
- l don't know.

72
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:05,722
Perfect.

73
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:09,959
Oh, the report cards are here.

74
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,757
l gotta make a copy for my new frame.

75
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:21,971
Justin Russo,
your exam results plus your coursework

76
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:26,374
equals all As
and one B-plus in rhyming charms.

77
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:28,412
You're the smart one.

78
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:31,816
B-plus? l can't put this in the frame.

79
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,377
What a shame.

80
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,012
See, l got game. This grade is lame.

81
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:40,455
Oh, l got a good rhyme. Corn.

82
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:41,992
And?

83
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:44,696
l panicked.

84
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:57,235
Oh, l love it in there.
lt smells like popcorn.

85
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,205
Why don't you hush?
l thought l threw you away.

86
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:04,441
You can't throw me away.
l need a parent to sign me.

87
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:08,543
And preferably with a nice soft-tip pen.

88
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,716
See you later, honey.
l'll be back in an hour.

89
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:16,855
Going for a jog.

90
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:19,496
Are you doing the dishes?

91
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:23,602
Yeah, sure.

92
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:28,406
l know what you're doing.
You're afraid of what's gonna happen

93
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,203
when your report card gets here,
so you're trying to be extra good.

94
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,875
Yep. You always know
what l'm up to, Dad.

95
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:41,610
l'm back.

96
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,053
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's see if you keep talking

97
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:48,217
when you're full of hot sauce.

98
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:49,953
That is hot.

99
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,500
You know what? l feel bad for you.

100
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:59,730
l'm going to tell you
how to get rid of a bad report card.

101
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,271
Really? How?

102
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:03,602
Get good grades.

103
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:08,136
Now you pay twice. Four times.

104
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,840
Sixteen. Thirty-two.

105
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:12,951
Sixty-four.

106
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,886
Alex, what are you doing?

107
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:19,151
Mom.
That was just confetti for the parade.

108
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:22,491
There's no parade.

109
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:25,353
Not yet, but there will be.

110
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:27,432
And how proud are we gonna be

111
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:29,466
when we're the first ones
to throw the confetti?

112
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:32,093
My guess, pretty proud.

113
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,699
You know what?
l've got a magazine and an iced tea.

114
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:37,502
l'm good with whatever you're up to.

115
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:47,652
ls that the new issue
of Urban Terrace Gardening?

116
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:49,846
- l've been waiting for that.
- Alex.

117
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:56,051
l got to the corner,
and l realized l forgot to stretch.

118
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:57,594
And it's hot.

119
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:01,626
l think l'll start jogging in the fall.

120
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:05,562
Alex Russo,
your exam results plus the homework--

121
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08,367
- What'd you say, Alex?
- Nothing.

122
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,770
Alex, it's not very ladylike
to talk with your mouth full.

123
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,513
Hey, what's that?

124
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,488
- These parents are now not
- What are you doing?

125
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,182
Two guinea pigs should fill their slot

126
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:33,092
What did l just do? l panicked.
l had to buy myself more time.

127
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:35,666
- To do what?
- To panic.

128
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:41,932
l still don't know
why you'd spend your entire savings

129
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:43,905
on a giant blow-up exercise ball.

130
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,844
lt's for exercise?

131
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:52,310
Man, l was gonna blow this up,
then walk across the ocean in it.

132
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:54,720
That is exercise, Maxy.

133
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,020
Man.

134
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,084
Cool. Guinea pigs. Can l race them?

135
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:05,693
No. l'm still working
on Dad's transfiguration spell,

136
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:08,356
and these guinea pigs
have to stay in their cage no matter what.

137
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,625
Fine. l'll just go ask Mom and Dad.

138
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,964
Mom and Dad aren't here,

139
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:15,335
because they went to an emergency
sandwich-shop convention.

140
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:19,877
Emergency sandwich-shop convention?

141
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:23,311
Yeah. You know how you were all tweaked
because sandwich wraps are tortillas,

142
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:24,780
and they don't get enough credit?

143
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,442
Well,
people are finally getting behind that.

144
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,486
Yes. My e-mail campaign worked.

145
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:33,721
Now, wait. Now get out of here, you guys.
l'm having my AP biology friends over

146
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:37,226
to watch the new episode
of Volcano Discovery in high-def.

147
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:39,228
And l don't want you guys
to embarrass me.

148
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,598
We are not the embarrassing part
of what you just said.

149
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,568
That was the best volcano special ever.

150
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,180
The high-def made it seem like
the volcano was right in your living room.

151
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:59,978
Oh, which, geologically speaking,
would be a statistical improbability

152
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:03,850
along the lines of there being
a snowstorm in the Sahara Desert.

153
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:07,890
You got me. Good nerd burn.

154
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:15,763
Well, l'm off to the park
to bury something.

155
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,528
Oh, a time capsule?

156
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:19,302
Yeah, sure, that.

157
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:21,799
l love doing that.
You should put a cell phone in it,

158
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:25,707
call it and leave a voicemail, so that way
someone in the future can pick it up.

159
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:28,942
No, actually, people take my calls now.

160
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,850
Harper, what are you doing here?

161
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:37,986
l heard about Justin's big party,

162
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:40,318
and l've been working up the nerve
to crash it.

163
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:43,694
Well, l've been working up the nerve
to leave. Oh, look, l did it.

164
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:53,465
Hey, everyone. So volcanoes, huh?
That's a hot topic. Am l right?

165
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:58,540
Volcanoes, they're hot.

166
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:00,878
We're off volcanoes.

167
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:03,871
Now we're debating who's smarter,

168
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:05,950
a 12-year-old boy
or a common guinea pig.

169
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:09,748
l'm on Justin's side.
Which side are you on, Justin?

170
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:13,853
As always, l'm on the side of science.

171
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:17,956
This calls for an experiment.

172
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,604
This was so totally worth my allowance.
l'm gonna use it forever.

173
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,473
Okay, when Harper says go,

174
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,204
you'll both try and make your way
to the stack of cheese slices

175
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,814
located outside the subway car.

176
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:40,046
Three.

177
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:42,380
Two. One.

178
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,378
Go.

179
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:56,696
l hate this thing.

180
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,542
Alex's guinea pigs are getting away.
Catch them.

181
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:11,606
Oh, man. We lost Alex's guinea pigs.

182
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,976
l knew if l had party
without parental supervision,

183
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,019
this would get out of hand.

184
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:18,949
Oh, Alex is gonna freak out.

185
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,757
Unless we buy two more guinea pigs
at the pet store.

186
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:25,622
Good thinking, good thinking. Let's
hide this in the lair so Alex doesn't find it.

187
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:28,164
Then we'll go to the pet store.
They always give me a treat.

188
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,363
Those are dog biscuits.

189
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:33,966
l know. What do you think keeps my teeth
so white and my hair so shiny?

190
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:46,543
Look, you change into a C now,
and l promise l'll get an A next semester.

191
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:48,084
And it'll all even out.

192
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,188
Sorry.

193
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:52,351
Then you leave me no choice.

194
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:01,257
Alex Russo.

195
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,291
You haven't returned
your wizard report card.

196
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:08,236
Wow, talk about a paper cut.

197
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:15,578
l need to speak to your parents
straightaway.

198
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:18,714
l hope that's British
for much, much later.

199
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:22,946
No? Okay, could you just
give me one minute? Yeah.

200
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:35,764
Actually, my parents took my report card
with them to a sandwich-shop convention.

201
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:39,769
l'm sure you're familiar with the tortilla
versus sandwich-wrap controversy.

202
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:42,967
No? Okay,

203
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:51,844
l agree.

204
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,282
Tortillas were cheated.

205
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,049
l can see why your parents dove
into this most pressing crisis.

206
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:03,252
l'm sorry l questioned you.
Will you accept my apology?

207
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,957
Definitely. Thanks for stopping by.
Don't be a stranger.

208
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:08,123
Say hi to the little warlocks for me.

209
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,833
Let's wizard handshake on it.

210
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:14,171
The two-handed wizard handshake?

211
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:16,103
That's the one.

212
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:26,282
The only thing she gets an A in
is hiding and lying.

213
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,118
Be still.

214
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:31,516
You lied to me.

215
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:33,216
l can explain.

216
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,383
l'm not interested
in what you have to say anymore.

217
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:37,523
l'm coming back tonight
to see your parents,

218
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:40,928
and we'll decide how long
to suspend your powers.

219
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,263
My powers? No, you can't.
l'm gonna need those.

220
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:48,066
l'm also gonna need to know
a sound that someone could make

221
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,300
to attract a guinea pig, for instance.

222
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:56,378
l would try a sort of rabbit-y thing,
but with more saliva.

223
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,279
Desist.

224
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:03,850
You haven't acted
with any responsibility.

225
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:06,457
Say goodbye to your magical ability.

226
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:09,453
No.

227
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:21,871
Okay, these guinea pigs
look just like the ones we lost.

228
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:23,167
You think this'll trick Alex?

229
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:25,503
What are you doing
with my guinea pigs?

230
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:27,077
Yes, l do.

231
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:30,812
Mom and Dad
aren't really away for the weekend.

232
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:34,578
l had to turn them into these guinea pigs
to keep them from seeing my grades.

233
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:40,482
So the guinea pigs in the cage
were actually Mom and Dad.

234
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:43,553
Yeah, these guinea pigs
are Mom and Dad.

235
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:48,393
No, were, because they scurried off,
so we bought these at the pet store.

236
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:49,831
- Oh, man.
- Oh, man.

237
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:52,528
Oh, man. We've lost four guinea pigs.

238
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,064
How could you do something
so stupid?

239
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,301
Only a stupid person
would think that my stupid thing

240
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:00,968
was stupider than your stupid thing.

241
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:03,047
You don't even deserve
to have wizard powers.

242
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:05,742
This isn't about me right now.
This is about finding Mom and Dad.

243
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:10,014
- Who you turned into guinea pigs.
- Okay, it's a little about me.

244
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,647
Here's what we should do.

245
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,691
We'll ask these guinea pigs
where guinea pigs would run away to.

246
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:16,953
How are we gonna
ask these guinea pigs anything?

247
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:19,256
Use the transfiguration spell
to turn them into people,

248
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:20,695
and they'll be able to tell us.

249
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:22,993
- You use it. lt's your problem.
- l can't.

250
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:26,468
Crumbs suspended my powers
until Mom and Dad sign my report card.

251
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:29,802
What? ls there anything else
you wanna tell me?

252
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,069
Yeah. There's no
emergency sandwich-shop convention.

253
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,645
Nobody cares
about your stupid tortilla movement.

254
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:37,705
No, Justin, look.

255
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:39,942
Will you just hurry
and say the spell, please?

256
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,712
Fine.

257
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:47,658
These guinea pigs are small,
dumb and hairy

258
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:50,990
Make them human
to find Theresa and Jerry

259
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:54,090
You've gotta be kidding me.
We're human.

260
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:59,129
l'm gonna use my opposable thumb
to pick stuff up.

261
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:02,735
Check it out.
l have things in both hands.

262
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:05,741
- Ask me if l'm okay.
- Are you okay?

263
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:07,868
Yes, l am.

264
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:09,940
Okay, settle down.

265
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:13,279
We need your help finding
a couple of guinea pigs, guinea people.

266
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,322
- l smell peanut butter and jelly crusts.
- And dirty socks. And orange soda.

267
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:21,888
Under Max's bed.

268
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:30,226
Oh, Max, the door opens.
You cleaned up in here. Go.

269
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,406
ls this marshmallows
smeared on asparagus?

270
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,911
Yes. Yes, it is, Justin.
That experiment's almost complete.

271
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,549
Max, what are you doing
with Mom's black dress?

272
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:49,051
lt's a Darth Vader cape.
You people have no imagination.

273
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,316
This is where my lucky mug went.

274
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,189
There they are.

275
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,230
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

276
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:04,893
Oh, they look mad.
Maybe changing them back is a bad idea.

277
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:08,700
Yeah, it's a bad idea.
Let's just be raised by two guinea pigs.

278
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,678
Okay.

279
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:20,508
These guinea pigs are now not
Mom and Dad should fill their slot

280
00:18:25,324 --> 00:18:27,349
Alex Russo, you are in so much trouble.

281
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:30,325
l can explain, but you need to know
that Professor Crumbs is coming

282
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,362
to discuss
my horrible report card with you.

283
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:37,759
Were you eavesdropping?

284
00:18:37,903 --> 00:18:40,963
Mr. and Mrs. Russo, l am here--

285
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,006
What am l standing on?

286
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:48,368
lt's marshmallow surprise.

287
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:51,414
The surprise is asparagus.

288
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:57,744
Alex, do you wanna tell
Professor Crumbs where we were?

289
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:02,619
l turned them into guinea pigs
to keep them from seeing my report card.

290
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:05,519
And how did that work out for you?

291
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:08,829
Not well.

292
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:15,197
Oh, l see you have Alex's powers.
Don't let them fall into the wrong hands.

293
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,865
Oh, wait, they already were
in the wrong hands.

294
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:23,379
Yes, they were.
l am taking away her powers forever.

295
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:29,215
l have never seen such a blatant disregard
for the student wizard code of conduct.

296
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:31,845
No, please don't do this.
l've come this far. lt's not fair.

297
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,858
l'm afraid it is. l shall take your powers
and be on my way.

298
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:43,094
Professor Crumbs
turned into a guinea pig.

299
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:45,533
Sweet.

300
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:49,230
Don't look at me.
l don't have my powers.

301
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,569
Justin?

302
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:54,703
l panicked.

303
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:59,307
This is my problem, not yours.
Don't let me drag you down.

304
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:02,011
But you don't drag me down.
l don't want you to lose your powers.

305
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:04,645
Every time you mess up,
l have to think of a way to fix it.

306
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:07,189
You make me a better wizard.

307
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:10,055
Look, l don't know.
Professor Crumbs as a guinea pig?

308
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:12,390
Somebody's gonna lose their powers.

309
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:15,329
Well, l'm not a wizard, so...

310
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,492
What do you guys want for dinner?

311
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:26,043
Justin, you have to change him back.

312
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:28,305
Everybody just has to take
their medicine.

313
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:36,213
This guinea pig is a bad dresser
Turn him now into my professor

314
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:42,853
Justin Russo. How dare you?
You are supposed to be a model student.

315
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:44,052
l'm appalled.

316
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:45,824
l know.

317
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:50,468
l deserve whatever punishment
you're about to give me.

318
00:20:52,037 --> 00:20:53,595
Professor, this is all my fault.

319
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:57,699
Justin, l heard what you said
about your sister

320
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:00,277
through my guinea-pig ears.

321
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:07,111
And if you could do something like that,
l can't ignore it.

322
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,410
You two bring out the best
in each other.

323
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,153
Alex.

324
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,522
l know l'm going to regret this,

325
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:18,863
but l am returning your powers

326
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:22,296
so that you can train
alongside your brother.

327
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,970
And to your punishment,

328
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:38,845
you both will spend the next two weeks
grooming my beard.

329
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:43,185
l'll see you in my office
Monday morning at 8:00.

330
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:45,118
Bring a comb.

331
00:21:50,262 --> 00:21:53,254
Alex, is there something
you wanna say to your brother?

332
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:57,194
Yeah. Thanks for sticking up for me.

333
00:21:57,335 --> 00:22:00,361
Yeah. Professor Crumbs
really bought that story l laid onto him

334
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:02,939
about you making me a better wizard.

335
00:22:03,074 --> 00:22:06,805
- Yeah. l really hate you.
- Yeah. l hate you too.

336
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:15,880
And l guess, if it means so much to you,
l'll sign your tortilla petition.

337
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:18,584
Thank you.

338
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,857
Well, l really hate both of you.
Now we don't have any guinea pigs.
