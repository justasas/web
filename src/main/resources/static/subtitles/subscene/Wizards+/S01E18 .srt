1
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:07,564
Okay, everybody, gather round.

2
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:11,727
Time for the semiannual
new-sandwich-idea meeting.

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,283
Okay. Max, go.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,764
The Crust Lover's Special.

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,044
It's a sandwich
made out of only bread crusts.

6
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:20,893
What do you do with the middles?

7
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:25,730
It would be nice if you pitched ideas
rather than problems once in a while.

8
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,173
Okay.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,136
- Alex, go.
- Okay. Meat Me in Little Italy.

10
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:37,660
Double the meat on a small Italian roll.

11
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:42,058
And you could also say
Meat Me in Turkey.

12
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:45,624
And I think you know
where I'm going with this.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,431
I have created sandwich-naming dice.

14
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,464
One has the name
of New York City locations,

15
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:56,063
the other, various sandwich meats.

16
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:57,384
Watch.

17
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,794
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

18
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:04,517
That's the beauty
of the sandwich-naming dice.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,149
If you don't like it, you just roll again.

20
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:10,513
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

21
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:13,644
Here, I'll...

22
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,521
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

23
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,525
Hey, somebody fixed these dice.

24
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,327
Why are you looking at me?

25
00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:27,723
Yeah, you should look at me.

26
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:31,812
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

27
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:35,726
What if we take double the meat
and put it in a small Italian roll...

28
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,573
And we can call it
Meat Me in Little Italy.

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,057
What?

30
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:44,380
Don't you get it, honey? It's a pun.

31
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:46,899
It's not a pun. It's stolen.

32
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,378
You heard me, right, Justin?

33
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:50,737
I didn't hear a thing.

34
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:54,709
Well, Alex, if you say you said it,
you probably did.

35
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:57,789
The most important thing is,
if one of us has a great idea,

36
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,261
we all have a great idea.

37
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:02,430
Oh, honey,
I just came up with another one.

38
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:04,625
Meat Me in Turkey.

39
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:06,388
Alex, you can take credit for that one.

40
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,826
See? Now everybody's happy.

41
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,218
Question.

42
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,230
If you're faced with a situation
and time is running out, what do you do?

43
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:09,830
Let one rip
and blame whoever else is in the room.

44
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:13,868
Okay.

45
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:15,471
We're talking about magic.

46
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,836
More specifically,
the freeze-frame spell.

47
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,880
You can freeze people around you
without freezing yourself.

48
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,833
It was developed by Dr. J. Geils.

49
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:27,115
Justin, why don't you give it a try?

50
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:30,203
All you have to do is say:

51
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,679
And time will be frozen.

52
00:03:31,806 --> 00:03:34,845
- For how long?
- For as long as you can hop on one leg.

53
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:36,163
Wait, wait. Why one leg?

54
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,963
Because Dr. J. Geils
only had one leg.

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,220
Charley horse. Charley horse.

56
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,980
Going down.

57
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:09,104
Hey, I like this spell.

58
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:20,632
All right.
One Meat Me in Little Italy combo,

59
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:22,075
or, as I prefer to call it,

60
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,835
My Mom and Dad
Never Give Me Enough Credit

61
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,273
For All the Hard Work I Do sandwich.

62
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,674
Oh, a sandwich with a side of attitude.

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,359
Tasty.

64
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,919
- What are those?
- Oh, my gosh, you're relentless.

65
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:39,641
If you must know,
I work for a fashion magazine.

66
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:43,402
Well, not a good one.

67
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,250
All these outfits are trying
way too hard to be different.

68
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,767
Well, you're unusually opinionated.

69
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:52,454
No, it's pretty usual for me.

70
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:54,812
I'll tell you what I like.

71
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:04,735
This with this and that with that.

72
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:09,260
I like your panache, kid.

73
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:10,692
Oh, we don't have panache.

74
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:14,182
But we do have quiche.
It's kind of like a pie.

75
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:18,944
Would you be interested
in an internship this summer

76
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,904
<i>with Fashion Fatale Magazine?</i>

77
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,465
<i>Fashion Fatale?</i>

78
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:26,984
I read those for free at the newsstand
until the guy chases me away.

79
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,432
Just give me one second.
Let me ask my parents.

80
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,388
<i>Mom, Dad,
some dude from Fashion Fatale Magazine</i>

81
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:37,080
just offered me an internship,
and I'm gonna take it. Okay.

82
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,076
They said yes.

83
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:52,243
Before we get started,

84
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:55,681
I'd like to introduce you to our new intern,
Alex Russo.

85
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,564
Air kisses.

86
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:03,413
Okay. That was really weird.

87
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:05,209
Kiss back.

88
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:07,408
- Really?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,497
Hi, I'm Alex. What's your name?

90
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:19,978
Paul.

91
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:22,017
Oh, that's a cool name.
How do you spell it?

92
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:25,663
P-A-U-L.

93
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,510
Isn't that just Paul?

94
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,429
It's Paul.

95
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:34,433
Okay, people.

96
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:37,228
I'd like those ideas
for the fall-fling issue.

97
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:38,795
I want different.

98
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,430
What different ideas do you have?

99
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:44,069
Eve, you're up.
You panicked. We're done with you.

100
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,071
Jack, you're up.

101
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,990
Wearable yogurt.

102
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:52,040
You have got to stop pitching that.

103
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:57,080
I have an idea.

104
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:00,997
No, you don't.
Interns don't pitch ideas, they get coffee.

105
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,691
Sure, Alex, what you got?

106
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:08,610
Well, something different would be

107
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:12,046
finding a way
to make summer colours work in the fall.

108
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:13,686
Love it.

109
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:16,776
Pushing the envelope
without bursting the envelope.

110
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,936
Okay, I need research on it,

111
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,092
I need editorial on it,
I need photography on it.

112
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:23,019
And, Paul, I need some coffee.

113
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,020
Eight sugars. Dash of cream.

114
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:29,855
And I'll have a chocolate biscotti, Paul.

115
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:41,946
Okay. Our new hire, Millie,
will be here any minute,

116
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:45,073
and I expect the two of you to show her
how things are done around here.

117
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:47,107
Millie? Isn't that a grandma's name?

118
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:49,627
What, is it short
for "millions of years old"?

119
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,718
I bet you she smells like ham.

120
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,755
Hey, maybe then people will smell her,
and we'll sell more ham.

121
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:00,719
There she is.
Hi, Millie, welcome to the shop.

122
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:10,241
Well, now we know
what her first job is gonna be.

123
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,601
Hey, Millie. How you doing?

124
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:16,612
- These are our sons, Justin and Max.
- Hi, guys.

125
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:23,648
Did I forget to wear pants or something?
Because I have that dream sometimes.

126
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:26,498
No, no, no.

127
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,060
Hi.

128
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:32,781
I was two away from all girls.

129
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:35,859
I'm going to be training you,

130
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:39,866
so we might be spending
a lot of time together.

131
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,219
Yeah, it's an intensive process.

132
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,307
You don't smell like ham.

133
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:49,545
Thank you.
I've worked really hard on that.

134
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,151
Hey, you like Tears of Blood?
I love that band.

135
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,512
I never thought a girl
like you would like them.

136
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,356
A girl like what?

137
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,678
Pretty.

138
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,271
I don't smell like ham and I'm pretty?

139
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:06,836
I like it here.

140
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:09,402
Hey, Millie,
come over here and I'll show you

141
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:12,086
where Jerry hides
when I'm looking for him.

142
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:18,244
It looks like you should ask Millie out.

143
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,682
You know,
I could be your wingman on this one.

144
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,692
A wingman? What do you know
about being a wingman?

145
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:27,323
I know plenty.

146
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:30,417
All right, fine.
Okay, yeah, you're my wingman.

147
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:34,969
Great. I gotta get some wings
and a hawk mask.

148
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:40,217
No. Dude, a wingman is someone
who says cool stuff about me

149
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:42,539
to Millie to get her to go out with me.

150
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:45,260
You mean cool stuff like:

151
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:48,056
Pretty.

152
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:57,107
So this is where it all happens.

153
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,342
Over there is photography,

154
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:02,435
where they show beautiful girls
so other girls feel inferior.

155
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:08,467
Over there is editorial, where they write
articles that make girls feel inferior.

156
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,430
What's over there?

157
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,873
Oh, that's the kitchen, where people
are too self-conscious to eat.

158
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:18,274
It's just like I imagined it would be.

159
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:21,160
Lots of cool people
not making eye contact with me.

160
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,437
Watch.

161
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:25,401
Hi.

162
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,003
See? She didn't even look up.

163
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:29,690
Alex, this is not show-and-tell time.

164
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,929
Ms. Angela will be here any minute.

165
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:34,571
Ms. Angela is the publisher
of the magazine.

166
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:38,446
She's gonna come by to approve my
bringing-summer-colours-into-fall idea.

167
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,132
Jeffrey.

168
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,376
Where are the treats for my doggie?

169
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,141
Ms. Angela, you don't have a dog.

170
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:48,254
Run down to Petland and get me a dog.

171
00:10:48,863 --> 00:10:50,377
Bye-bye.

172
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:56,019
Jeffrey, who are these people?

173
00:10:56,628 --> 00:10:58,585
Hi, I'm Alex. I'm the new intern.

174
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:02,300
No, no, not you. I was talking about the girl
who's dressed like a giant preschooler.

175
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,467
That was rude.

176
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:12,789
Don't worry, I've rewired my brain
so they come across as compliments.

177
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,550
Thank you.

178
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,678
Jeffrey.

179
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:20,480
Jeffrey.

180
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:24,277
Oh, Jeffrey.
I need to see the new issue.

181
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:38,967
Interesting.

182
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:41,210
Summer colours in the fall.

183
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:43,891
I like it.

184
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,855
I like it a lot.

185
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,048
Great idea, Jeffrey.

186
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:50,297
You are not fired today.

187
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:51,933
Thank you, Ms. Angela.

188
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,174
I try to come up
with the best ideas possible for you.

189
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:58,661
Well, just keep those ideas coming,
Jeffrey. I have big plans for you.

190
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:04,821
Jeffrey, you totally took credit for my idea.
What was that about?

191
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:06,308
That's about you being an intern

192
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:10,983
<i>and me being the next editor-in-chief
of Fashion Fatale Magazine.</i>

193
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:13,149
I can't believe you stole my idea.

194
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:16,148
Don't worry, kid.
You'll have your time to shine.

195
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,750
In the meantime,
how about some coffee?

196
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,714
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink coffee.

197
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:23,433
You don't have to drink it to get it.

198
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:26,274
Everyone, Alex is going on a coffee run.

199
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,442
Can you believe that?

200
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:32,600
I know. It's horrible.

201
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:34,477
I'll have a caramel macchiato.

202
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,682
All right, wingman,
get over there and talk me up.

203
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:47,850
As soon as you feel she's ready,
you give me the high sign.

204
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,726
Got it.

205
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:52,326
What's a high sign?

206
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,178
Finish scratching that itch
and show me the high sign.

207
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,250
Just wave hi, okay? Just like this.

208
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,618
- Got it.
- Good.

209
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:07,934
Hey, Millie.

210
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:11,059
Did you know that Justin
wears his underwear in the shower?

211
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:16,179
I thought I was supposed
to give the high sign.

212
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,750
This does not make it private.

213
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,185
I think it does.

214
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:24,546
No, it doesn't.

215
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,552
Well, here's something
that's cool for sure.

216
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:30,111
He has a lot of comic books.

217
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:33,194
- That's cool.
- But wait, there's more.

218
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,835
He has action figures
of the heroes in the comic books,

219
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:38,841
and he uses them to act out the scenes.

220
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:43,835
She's ready.

221
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,331
The idea was all mine.

222
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:56,092
And Jeffrey made Ms. Angela
think it was all his idea.

223
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:57,886
And then he made you get coffee.

224
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:01,294
By the way,
mine was cold when you brought it back.

225
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:06,018
You know,
since Jeffrey steals my good ideas,

226
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,019
I should just give him a bad idea
and watch him take credit for that.

227
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,178
Well, Ms. Angela hates my clothes.

228
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:12,782
Give him an idea with those in it.

229
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:14,019
Right.

230
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,261
Even though you love my clothes.

231
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,854
Right.

232
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:20,263
So how many outfits do you think
you can make in a day?

233
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:22,266
Let's say 20.

234
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:26,589
I'd say 40, but my dad's using my
sewing machine to make a new saddle.

235
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:29,429
Right.

236
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:37,791
Who is it?

237
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,511
It's me, Alex.

238
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:45,718
Oh, I didn't see you.

239
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,153
My door's closed. Come on in.

240
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:53,042
What have you got?

241
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,843
I have another idea I wanna give you.

242
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:59,087
Fashion for people
who are not into fashion.

243
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:03,128
Isn't that just any clothing store
with the word "barn" in the name?

244
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:08,608
No, it's for those people who are after
a totally, completely unique look.

245
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:10,409
A look so outrageous

246
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:14,977
that only people who have rewired their
brain could feel good about wearing it.

247
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:19,016
Tasty. Why don't you get me
some sketches?

248
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:20,371
I can do even better.

249
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:24,100
By this time tomorrow,
I could organise a fashion show right here.

250
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:27,139
Fashion show. Extra tasty.

251
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:32,663
And you know, I could get Ms. Angela
to come and almost be interested.

252
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:36,421
Well, aren't you just full of good ideas?

253
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,670
We are bursting with flavour.

254
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,952
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

255
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:49,874
I'm sure a lot of guys in gym class
shower in their underwear.

256
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,753
No. I'm the only one.

257
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,918
There are some times
when you should lie.

258
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:01,437
To me and everyone.
And this is one of those times.

259
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:05,323
Oh, my gosh, there she is. Hide me.

260
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:09,481
Justin.

261
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:12,646
Justin. Oh, Justin.

262
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:16,728
There you are.

263
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:19,417
Nice hiding place.

264
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,093
You know, your brother said
some cool stuff about you the other day.

265
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,254
He makes a lot of that stuff up.

266
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:28,943
You mean like playing
with action figures and stuff?

267
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:31,135
Because I thought
that was really awesome.

268
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:36,104
Oh, that.
Well, that's the cold, hard truth.

269
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:39,423
Good.

270
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,940
So I was wondering,
are you busy Friday night?

271
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:43,741
Me?

272
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,943
Friday?

273
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,666
What's up?

274
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:51,954
Well, I have two tickets
to Tears of Blood, and I was thinking...

275
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:53,677
Say no more. I'm in.

276
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:54,833
- Really?
- Yeah.

277
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,074
Okay, great.

278
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,838
So be at my house at 7:30.

279
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,484
I'm going out with Millie on Friday.

280
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:09,878
How's that for a guy who showers
in his underwear? You might wanna try it.

281
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:24,615
Harper, thank you for creating
the most horrible clothes I've ever seen.

282
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:26,807
You're welcome.
What are best friends for?

283
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:29,018
Oh, are you going on the runway too?

284
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,895
No.

285
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:35,180
I know.

286
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:41,818
No, no, no.
Don't wanna ruin the surprise.

287
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:45,099
Everyone is very excited
about the presentation. And so am I.

288
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:48,984
Well, people are gonna be talking
about this for quite some time.

289
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,260
Jeffrey, can we get started?

290
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:53,226
I'm so excited
to see all of your great ideas.

291
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:56,506
You know, Ms. Angela, about that.

292
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,870
I was reading my horoscope,

293
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:00,511
and it's very important
that I do one good thing today.

294
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,910
I'm giving credit where credit is due.

295
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:07,518
And what you're about to see
is entirely our intern, Alex Russo's, idea.

296
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,075
What? Now you give me credit?

297
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:13,083
That's not the plan.
Ms. Angela, we're all a big team here.

298
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,558
Ideas bounce around,

299
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:17,406
and which one lands in whose head,
you never do know.

300
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:18,847
This one is all Jeffrey's.

301
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:20,038
Alex, stop.

302
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:22,047
You were right
when you talked to me earlier.

303
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,724
That plus my horoscope
equals this is Alex's idea, 100 percent.

304
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:28,930
Would somebody please
show me something?

305
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:30,807
Oh, this will be something, all right.

306
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,404
Just give me one minute, please.

307
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:38,172
Harper, change of plans.
We need to change the models.

308
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,531
Jeffrey decided to give me credit
for this whole thing.

309
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:43,296
Wait, that's good then.
Isn't that what you wanted all along?

310
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,097
Yes, but I wanna take credit
for something Ms. Angela would like.

311
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:50,101
- Oh, she's gonna hate these.
- I know.

312
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:54,939
And now,
something that was Alex Russo's idea.

313
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,867
Wait, no. This can't happen. I have
to do something to make you look good.

314
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,986
What do you mean?
I just got the whites of my eyes whitened.

315
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,151
I can't...

316
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:18,519
How can anybody think
with that junk on?

317
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,840
Oh, I hope I have enough time
to do this.

318
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:23,075
Wait.

319
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:25,675
I have all the time in the world.
It's frozen.

320
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:50,011
Okay.

321
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:51,541
Oh, Charley horse. Charley horse.

322
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:54,132
Go, go, go, work it.
Come on now, ladies. Work it.

323
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:55,584
Hey, where's your big pineapple?

324
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:56,934
And she was a butterfly.

325
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:58,500
Oh, this is all wrong.

326
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:06,860
I just made bad outfits differently bad.

327
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:14,745
What is this?

328
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:17,107
It looks like they're half-dressed.

329
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:20,675
Fashion for the non-fashionable.

330
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,082
It's so unfashionable,
it brings out your under beauty.

331
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:27,759
Yes.

332
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:30,678
That's exactly what it does.

333
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,525
I love it.

334
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:34,516
- You do?
- Well, yes.

335
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:35,763
Can't you tell?

336
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:37,487
The way I'm bursting.

337
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,210
Great job, Alex.

338
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,528
I'm going to give you
the highest possible praise.

339
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:47,324
You are not fired
from your unpaid internship.

340
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:51,047
Oh, Alex, I have big plans for you.

341
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:53,613
Actually, I have my own plans.

342
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:55,458
Harper?

343
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:00,777
I quit.

344
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:04,985
And we're gonna go eat.

345
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:06,536
In the kitchen.

346
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:10,104
And we don't care who watches.

347
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,712
Oh, hey, Justin. You're right on time.

348
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:34,561
Yeah. Tears of Blood
is gonna be awesome.

349
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:37,518
I bet they're gonna open with
their hit song, "Crying Blood for You."

350
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:40,114
I know. I know.

351
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:42,716
Oh, am I wearing too much perfume?

352
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,281
No. Perfect.

353
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:48,560
Perfect amount.

354
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,573
Good. Because my boyfriend says
that I wear too much sometimes.

355
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:53,488
Boy-who?

356
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:55,573
Thank you so much for babysitting.

357
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,655
Benji? Come meet Justin.

358
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,046
Baby-what?

359
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:01,938
Hi, Justin.

360
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,413
This is my cousin, Benji.

361
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:06,980
Hi, Benji.

362
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:11,101
Hi, boyfriend.

363
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:14,305
Okay, we'll be home by 10.

364
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:17,984
We'll be here.

365
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:20,587
Hey, did you bring your action figures?

366
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,306
No.

367
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,184
That's okay. I got lots.

368
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:26,910
- Do you have Aqua Avenger?
- Yeah.

369
00:22:27,474 --> 00:22:28,828
Okay. I'll be him.

370
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:30,355
Yes.
