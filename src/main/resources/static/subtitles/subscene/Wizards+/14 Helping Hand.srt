1
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,917
Sorry, kids, don't be upset,

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,652
But I have to cancel
wizard class today.

3
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:07,820
- Yay!
- Yes!

4
00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:09,388
Because you have so
many chores to do.

5
00:00:10,857 --> 00:00:14,126
Seriously, you have a
lot of chores to do.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,462
Oh, good. Recycling is on the list.

7
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:21,266
Uh-uh-uh. And one of the best
things about recycling is...

8
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:24,503
...You get to use it again.

9
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:26,071
mother.

10
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:28,407
You told us to never take
things out of the garbage.

11
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:32,377
Food. And I was
talking to your dad.

12
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:35,013
These kids do not know
how to eat a chicken leg.

13
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:37,416
There's another side.

14
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:43,489
Dad, you know I love chores
because alex hates them.

15
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:45,457
But I can't do them today.

16
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:48,527
I wanted to surprise you,
I'm gonna say it anyway,

17
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:50,295
But I've been working
on my own spell

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,365
For wizard certification. I am.

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,068
Oh, please. Wizard certification?

20
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:57,970
That sounds like something
people would make up

21
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,538
Who aren't very good
at making things up.

22
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:05,244
My son, justin vincenzo pepe russo.

23
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:07,112
I've always wanted my own spell.

24
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:11,884
Pepe. I can't get enough of that.

25
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:15,187
It makes fun of itself. Pepe.

26
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:18,924
This is so exciting.

27
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:22,161
I want you to focus on the spell.

28
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:25,731
Alex and max will
handle your chores.

29
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:28,600
I can't do all these. Harper and I

30
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,536
Are going to creature feature
confidential tonight.

31
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:32,671
They project a scary movie
on a side of a building.

32
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,106
Oh, cool. What movie?

33
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:35,507
That's what makes it confidential.

34
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,042
No one knows the
movie or the location

35
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:38,177
Until you get the texts.

36
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:39,678
Well, that's hardly more important

37
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,915
Than justin creating
an original spell.

38
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,816
Thank you, dad.

39
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,586
Oh, and alex,
when you vacuum the rug,

40
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,688
Try to leave a vertical
light/dark pattern.

41
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:51,657
Mom loves that.

42
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,225
I really do.

43
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,664
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

44
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,632
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

45
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,768
* you can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

46
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:04,403
* yes, please *

47
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:06,238
* but you might find out
it'll go to your head *

48
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,873
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

49
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:10,375
* with the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,211
* that's what I said *

51
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:15,314
* everything is not what it seems *

52
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:19,184
* you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

53
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,754
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

54
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:27,626
* because everything
is not what it seems *

55
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,762
* everything is not what it seems *

56
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:34,566
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

57
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:38,403
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

58
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:42,274
* because everything is not *

59
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,843
* what it seems *

60
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:50,844
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

61
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:54,052
Wow. Justin, I'm proud of you.

62
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:58,056
Your new spell will make the
russo name live on forever.

63
00:02:58,091 --> 00:02:59,858
Thought you said the russo
name would live on because all

64
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:03,328
- The grandchildren you'd have.
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

65
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,330
A spell would be great though.

66
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,400
Ok, I think it's ready.

67
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,002
Stand back.

68
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:13,872
X, x, extra hand take a stand

69
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:16,608
Give us a hand!

70
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:19,544
Lightning. It's alive!

71
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,079
It's alive!

72
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,785
Your new spell is a woman's hand?

73
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,787
I can't wait for the grandchildren.

74
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,656
dad, check it out.

75
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,991
You know how you need an
extra hand around the house?

76
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:36,094
Ok, so you made an extra hand!
What's it do?

77
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,696
It does all kinds of things.

78
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:40,732
Pretend you're a busy wizard
who needs help with something.

79
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:43,201
All right. Uh...

80
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:47,372
I could use a back scratch,
but because I'm so busy

81
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,308
Casting spells with
these hands, I'm...

82
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:52,377
No, wait. I'm painting.
I'm painting with both hands.

83
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,946
No, I know. I'm trapped in a box.

84
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,815
I've always wanted to do this.

85
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,617
Dad.

86
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,054
Hand, do your thing.

87
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:08,860
Ooh. Oh. Little down.

88
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,729
Left. Left.

89
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,564
Little down more. Down.

90
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:13,765
In... It's...

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,134
Over... that tickles.

92
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,704
The other way. Oh, right there. Ah!

93
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:19,771
Wow!

94
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:24,142
That was awesome. Thank you, hand.

95
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:26,745
Plus, it will tie your shoes,
iron your clothes,

96
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,247
Find your glasses,
and it's cpr certified,

97
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,982
Especially since medical
authorities agree

98
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,918
That you don't need
to use mouth-to-mouth.

99
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:38,190
Awesome work, justin,
especially on the cpr thing.

100
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:41,193
You know what? We should write
to the superintendent of spells

101
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,195
- And get this certified.
- Yes.

102
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,296
Hand!

103
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,132
too slow.

104
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,167
Nice one.

105
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:51,536
Even the things I
create do that to me.

106
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:54,339
Oh, no, I'm not falling for that.

107
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,875
Son.

108
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,750
You know who I think is really hot?

109
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:07,018
The guy who invented paper plates.

110
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:09,454
Look on the bright side, alex.

111
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,790
After this, all you've got
to do is mop the floors,

112
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,725
Clean your room, wash the windows,
scrub the restaurant,

113
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:15,560
And then you can go to the
creature feature movie.

114
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:21,233
We're not going to
the movie, are we?

115
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:24,269
Not unless you help me
break some of these dishes.

116
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,638
Hey, that's a good idea.

117
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:28,206
Alex.

118
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:37,949
There's a hand on
your dad's shoulder

119
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,785
And it's not connected to a body.

120
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,753
I'm not sure whether I
should scream or laugh,

121
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:43,455
So I'm going to do
both at the same time.

122
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,998
You know, dad, normally,

123
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:55,333
I'd say something to get
out of work right now,

124
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:58,403
But that hand on your shoulder
is kinda freaking me out.

125
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:01,473
This is justin's spell.
It's called helping hand.

126
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:04,075
- Will it slap him?
- No.

127
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,445
Well, then it's no help to me.

128
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,415
I designed it to lend a
helping hand to busy wizards.

129
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,150
I'm so proud of you, justin.

130
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:15,620
This spell is going to put the
russo name on the wizard map.

131
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:19,257
I've got something that'll put
our name on the wizard map.

132
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,162
Ok. How about a spell
to make clear plastic

133
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:26,798
That's sticky on one
side and it helps wizards

134
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,534
Put drawings on the refrigerator.

135
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:35,273
I'll call it russo's sticky strips.

136
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:38,643
You know, that sounds
vaguely similar to something

137
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:41,413
That we have right
here called tape.

138
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,084
Oh, man.

139
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:48,086
This is even better than mine.

140
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,922
It has a convenient, clear holder

141
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,625
And a serrated edge for clean cuts.

142
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,430
All right. I got to prepare
for my presentation

143
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,065
For the superintendent of spells.

144
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,800
- Gotta iron the shirt.
- No, no, son.

145
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,201
You're too busy for that.

146
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:06,671
Alex, add "iron justin's
shirt" to your list.

147
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:08,740
Ok.

148
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:14,579
"burn justin's shirt."

149
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:16,448
Look, I'll help you and maybe

150
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:18,083
We can get the work done
in time for the movie.

151
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:21,353
That sounds like a good idea if
it wasn't for the "work" part.

152
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:25,924
If only we had a box

153
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:31,463
That contained a hand
that liked to work.

154
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:34,866
I thought of that, but I was hoping

155
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,636
You wouldn't get there because,
you know, it's just trouble.

156
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:48,980
Harper, don't you ever hold
back another devious idea again.

157
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:51,182
You're good at it and you
need to start owning it.

158
00:07:56,722 --> 00:08:00,325
Wow, alex, I've never
seen your room so clean.

159
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,360
I didn't even know you had a desk.

160
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:05,564
That's a desk?

161
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,067
All right, nice work, hand.

162
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,670
I couldn't have done
it better myself.

163
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:13,371
Probably because you wouldn't have.

164
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:14,940
Yeah, you got that right.

165
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:18,677
It's the creature feature text!

166
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,813
We are going to see night of the
Halloween sorority party disaster 3.

167
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,748
Awesome. I heard it's
so scary that they have

168
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:26,184
To have emergency medical
technicians standing by.

169
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:29,354
Now all we need is the location
text and we're good to go.

170
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:34,726
Whoa. What do you
think you're doing?

171
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,795
You're not done.
You've barely started.

172
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,064
So roll up your sleeves and
give it some elbow grease.

173
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:41,199
Oh, wait. You don't
have sleeves or elbows.

174
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:43,702
Nope, nope.

175
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:46,371
Stop it. You are not... Ow!

176
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:49,441
You're finishing the chores.

177
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,548
Alex, it's ok. She did a lot.

178
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:58,216
You and I might be able
to finish the rest.

179
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,318
Don't make the freaky hand upset.

180
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,787
No. She's got to finish my chores

181
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,022
Or we don't get to go to the movie.

182
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,391
Then I don't think
we're going. Look.

183
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:17,102
And I was going to get you a
manicure when you were done!

184
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,204
You said you were gonna make
her give you a manicure.

185
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:20,372
Shh.

186
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,099
hey, maxy.

187
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,705
You're not making an antenna to
talk to martians again, are you?

188
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,374
We're wizards.

189
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,310
Why does everyone think it's
crazy that there's martians?

190
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,049
Oh, watch.

191
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,354
Dad, don't you just hate it
when your back starts to itch

192
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,922
While you're brushing your teeth?

193
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,591
Huh? No.

194
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,726
How are your chores going?

195
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,897
Then let me introduce you to
my brand new magical invention:

196
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,767
The russo tooth and back brush.

197
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,269
See, you can brush your teeth

198
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,806
And scratch your back
at the same time.

199
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,276
Max, that's not a
magical invention.

200
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,312
Dad, come on. You know when
you scratch a good itch,

201
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,115
It's pretty magical.

202
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,185
Hey, is that my back scratcher

203
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,187
I keep between my
mattress and box spring?

204
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,689
I need this for when your
mom pretends to be asleep

205
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,358
And won't scratch my back.

206
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,660
Well, I would, honey,
if you'd return the favor,

207
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:32,164
But you're all like... Done.

208
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,901
You know what, I'm gonna come
up with something really good.

209
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,968
You'll see.

210
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,188
Ex, do you think we're really
going to catch the hand this way?

211
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,923
Of course we are. It's a hand.

212
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,291
It's a total knucklehead.

213
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,793
get it? It's not...

214
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,598
It's the location text.

215
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,667
We're gonna see the movie
on the flat iron building.

216
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,535
We've gotta finish
cleaning this place up.

217
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,605
- We haven't caught the hand.
- Or done the chores.

218
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,574
Why do you make it so hard
to take the easy way out?

219
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,609
Alex, why do you make taking
the easy way out so hard.

220
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,011
'cause I like the easy way out.
Shh, there it is.

221
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,939
This thing is strong.

222
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,175
Let's just put it back in the box,

223
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,843
Finish cleaning,
and go to the movie.

224
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,144
No way. Forget that.

225
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,180
This hand is gonna
finish what it started.

226
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,918
You stop it.

227
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,153
Oh. Oh?

228
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,656
Oh, so you don't do windows?
We'll see about that.

229
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,128
Ha. Who's cleaning now?

230
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,966
The hand, that's who.

231
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,141
Ha.

232
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,482
Alex, aren't you
doing all the work?

233
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,184
No. I'm working hard to make
sure the hand does all the work.

234
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,386
Duh!

235
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,758
Are you sure you're not
doing all the work?

236
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,928
Harper, what are you not getting?
Don't you see her?

237
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,904
That's everything on the list.

238
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,007
I think it's tired. Fine.
I'm done with you.

239
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,950
Justin isn't. He needs the
hand for his presentation.

240
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,852
It'll be okay. I'll just
put it back in its box,

241
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,088
She'll get some rest and
we can get to our movie.

242
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,828
wow.

243
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,832
Alex, this place is spotless.

244
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,702
Did harper help you?

245
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,004
Why does everyone find
it so hard to believe

246
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,039
That I did this all by myself?

247
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,810
You see, doesn't it feel
good to do all your chores?

248
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,812
Have fun at your movie.

249
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,652
Alex, you better put that
thing back in the box.

250
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,855
Where is it? It was right
here on the counter.

251
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,824
Justin must have taken it back

252
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,525
Into the lair for his presentation.

253
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,161
Then how are you supposed
to get it back in the box?

254
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,899
I have an idea.

255
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,608
okay, justin, let's go
through your presentation

256
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,478
One more time before the
superintendent gets here.

257
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,181
You seem a little nervous.

258
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,051
Are you sure it's not you?

259
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,121
Oh, I am. You're right.

260
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,989
- I feel faint.
- Ok, sit down.

261
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,724
Let's take a seat.
Breathe. Breathe.

262
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,226
No, it's ok. I'm all right, son.

263
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,794
You, you go ahead.

264
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,863
alex, are you done
with your chores?

265
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,165
Uh, yeah, just one more thing
I need to take care of.

266
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,034
Well, we're busy rehearsing.
Get out.

267
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,603
Oh, let me hear it.
Maybe I can give you a hand.

268
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,807
Ok, fine.

269
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,977
I created helping hand for
wizards who like to multi-task.

270
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,982
So, with helping hand you
can do a number of things

271
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,583
At the same time.

272
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,953
Alex, are you all right?

273
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,789
Yeah, my hand just fell asleep.

274
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,997
The superintendent's here.

275
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,133
All right. Well, good luck.

276
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,202
I'm off to the movie you said
I could go to when I'm done

277
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,437
And I'm done,
so I'm off to the movie.

278
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,771
Oh, alex. No.

279
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,240
Your brother could use an audience.
You have to stay.

280
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,242
You can help with some "
oohs" and "ahhs."

281
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,645
But the movie's about to start.

282
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,914
Alex, your brother needs you.

283
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,587
Ok, uh. "russo, justin."

284
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,589
- Yes.
- You're next.

285
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,559
- Shall we?
- Come on in.

286
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,428
Uh, superintendent spellman,
may I offer you

287
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:33,732
A selection of meats
from around the world?

288
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,001
Are you trying to bribe me with meat
that's sweating more than you are?

289
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,637
Let's get started.

290
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,209
Ooh. Ahh.

291
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,345
Alex, you have to wait
for the presentation.

292
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,415
Man, my dogs are tired.

293
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,217
I've got to air these puppies out.

294
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,353
I can't do this at the office
or I have to fill out a form.

295
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,590
Ok, let's get to it.

296
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,259
- Uh, yes, let's get to it.
- Right away, sir.

297
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,162
Who wants iced tea?

298
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,798
I'd love some iced tea.

299
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,433
Oh, great.

300
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,575
Tastes like somebody
washed their hands in this.

301
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,646
Oh.

302
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,685
I'm really thirsty.

303
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,555
Ok, here we go.

304
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,326
I created the helping hand for
wizards who like to multi-task.

305
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,228
Ooh.

306
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,030
so...

307
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,699
You're answering your
wand phone with one hand,

308
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,701
While battling a
dragon with the other.

309
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,204
Then suddenly your feet get tired.

310
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,540
No problem for the helping hand.

311
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,675
How about a foot rub?

312
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,552
Foot rub.

313
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,121
no problem for helping hand.

314
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:10,295
I said, "no problem
for the helping hand."

315
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,198
I haven't got a lot of time.

316
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,933
Either your spell
works or it doesn't.

317
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,501
Oh, no, it works, I've seen it.

318
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,703
Wake up! Rub his feet.

319
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:23,741
Um. I know, why don't I
just get it started here.

320
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,746
Ooh. Ahh.

321
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,750
Come on, you're supposed
to be helping people.

322
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,292
A spell with an attitude?

323
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,895
I might be able to overlook it,
if it actually worked.

324
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,473
Ow!

325
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,310
This is not looking
good for you guys.

326
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,613
Sorry.

327
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,514
Bad, bad.

328
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,453
Introducing the cooperative foot.

329
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,322
Really? Now?

330
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,525
I can't believe I'm about to say
this but alex, do something.

331
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,063
If you ever feel like kicking
something but you're too tired?

332
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,636
Jerry! What are you doing?
He just wants your attention.

333
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,140
Oh, I'm sorry. Alex, zap him back.

334
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,175
In about a half an hour.

335
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,483
We have to leave for
the movie right now.

336
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,351
We'll end up sitting in the bushes

337
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,220
Looking up from the
bottom of the wall.

338
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,688
I know, I'm trying.

339
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,324
We need to wait for a little
more chaos and we can sneak out.

340
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:59,370
Uh, superintendent spellman,
I am so sorry.

341
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,939
I had no idea that any
of this would happen.

342
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,707
This morning, the hand was...

343
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,043
- ...So helpful.
- Just give my son a minute.

344
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,945
I'm sure we'll be
able to work this out.

345
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:11,983
Ok, I'm backing out.
I'm backing out. And I'm out!

346
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,554
You can't leave justin like this.

347
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,556
He created the helping
hand to help others,

348
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,291
But instead you
used it to help you.

349
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,527
- Don't you feel responsible?
- Don't you?

350
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,263
You're my best friend.
You know I'm up to no good

351
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,132
All the time. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

352
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,501
- Alex.
- Harper.

353
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,872
Oh, I hate it when you're right.

354
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,675
Excuse me, don't go anywhere.

355
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,544
I just need a moment
with the helping hand.

356
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,846
Alex, what are you doing?
It's over.

357
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,849
Fixing something. The kind of
thing you told me not to tell you

358
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,019
Because you don't want to get involved
and then... I'll be right back.

359
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,401
Look, hand. My brother
worked really hard on you.

360
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,636
Just because I don't enjoy
hard work doesn't mean

361
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,672
I don't appreciate
it when I see it.

362
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,246
Besides, you're mad at me.

363
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,715
Don't hate him because you hate me,
we're nothing alike.

364
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,384
Believe me.

365
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,419
Please do this for justin.

366
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,088
And for me. Oh!

367
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,392
Ok, fine. Only for justin.

368
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:50,415
- And we are back on track.
- Hand, do your thing.

369
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,785
Oh! Oh! Yeah, down.

370
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,421
Down, down. Oh! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

371
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,955
Oh, ooh, ooh, right there.

372
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,492
Right there. Right there.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, oh.

373
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,261
Mama.

374
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,065
Do you mind if I show
this to the board?

375
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,635
They're always looking for a good back
scratcher at the wizard gift shop.

376
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,579
Whoa. Oh, that was crazy.

377
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,782
I sold the foot,
made a fortune, lost it,

378
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,318
Brought a hundred-year-old
man from india back to life,

379
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,419
And got a new nickname.

380
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,957
Anyway, I'm gonna go to bed.

381
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,692
Wait, max.

382
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,161
Listen, you know I'm
proud of you too, right?

383
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:40,131
Dad, I know.
The man from india told me.

384
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,768
He also said that one day humans
are gonna have gills again.

385
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,736
Can't wait!

386
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,507
Gills.

387
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,944
He makes it so hard to be proud.

388
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:59,046
You know, I never thought
I'd say this but,

389
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:03,300
Night of the Halloween sorority party
disaster 3 was better than one or two.
