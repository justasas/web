1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:05,606
(serious music)

2
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:09,840
- Sticks and stones may break my bones

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,090
but this story may break your heart.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,081
Good evening and welcome to a very special

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,418
edition of No Nonsense.

6
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:20,750
This past month has been
dominated by a single story,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,793
the fate of one little boy, Baby Bones.

8
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:27,047
The product of a dark wizard's curse,

9
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:30,380
Baby Bones was rejected
by his biological parents

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,793
simply because he was born without skin.

11
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:36,292
On tonight's episode we
take an exclusive look

12
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:39,807
at the life of Baby Bones
and his adoptive parents.

13
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:44,182
A Channel Bueno exclusive,
let's take a look.

14
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:47,304
- Me and Harry had been trying for a baby

15
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:49,214
ever since the wedding,

16
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:51,347
but it just wasn't happening.

17
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:52,790
Adoption seemed like the only way

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,577
for us to have a real family.

19
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:59,027
And the orphanage just broke our hearts.

20
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,818
So many beautiful children who needed

21
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:03,925
the loving care of parents.

22
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:05,165
But there was one child who needed love

23
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,051
more than any other.

24
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:11,647
That child was Baby Bones.

25
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,983
- Yep.

26
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:16,279
- [Deborah] It's been a
little over two months

27
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,302
since the couple adopted
the innocent child,

28
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:21,065
unaware of the celebrity
status the media had

29
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:23,361
cruelly forced upon him.

30
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,600
- We would like to go up.

31
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,494
- Hopefully.

32
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:27,993
- Baby Bones get down from there.

33
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:31,515
(screeching)

34
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:39,113
That's our Baby Bones.

35
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:47,016
(phone ringing)

36
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:49,529
- Hello this is the
mobile telephone of Jack.

37
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,663
May I ask to whom that I speak?

38
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,487
- Hey Jack, I'm at the studio already.

39
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:56,905
Where are you?

40
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:59,585
- I'm sitting in my motorized vehicle

41
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,577
in a seemingly endless queue of other

42
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:04,056
motorized vehicles, and it is boring

43
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:06,636
and it feels natural
and it just feels right.

44
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:10,172
- Okay yeah, they have run
the Baby Bones retrospective.

45
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,370
- Oh fuck.

46
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,894
- Oh fuck is right Jack.

47
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:14,601
Look, wizards aren't in the
public's good graces right now

48
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,023
and if you don't get to
this interview on time,

49
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:18,197
Quinn is gonna tear you a new one.

50
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:19,639
Are you sure you can't
get here any faster?

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,630
They've got fish and chips.

52
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,621
- I don't know what to do.

53
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,875
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.

54
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,578
Fuck okay, so Baby Bones has
reared his ugly head again.

55
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:31,568
Did the show make us look that bad?

56
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,874
- Of course his life
would be easier with skin.

57
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,044
Of course I wish those damned
awful wizards hadn't cursed

58
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:43,683
an innocent child to live without skin.

59
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:48,045
But he's my Baby Bones.

60
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:50,117
I wouldn't change him for the world.

61
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:51,173
Excuse me.

62
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:54,079
Baby Bones stop eating
the cat this instant!

63
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:58,575
(screeching)

64
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,109
- Look um, I'm not gonna lie.

65
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:13,034
Hilde was more on the
Baby Bones bandwagon,

66
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:14,558
the triple B.

67
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:17,870
However, I love my wife.

68
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,812
And now I love my son.

69
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:26,812
My son who is a Baby Bones.

70
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:35,241
Nutritionists weren't quite
sure what would sustain

71
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:38,695
Baby Bones, but after some
research into the occult,

72
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,052
Hilde and I discovered that
he really likes something

73
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:44,689
we like to call four blood salad.

74
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:47,269
Basically you take the
blood from an animal,

75
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,646
put that in a bowl, and
you take the blood from

76
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,617
another animal, put that in a bowl.

77
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:55,436
Followed by two more types of blood.

78
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,244
A little pinch of nutmeg, give it a stir,

79
00:03:57,244 --> 00:04:01,664
and you've got yourself a salad.

80
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,260
It's actually a recipe from
Curtis Stone's new book.

81
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,060
It's a weird shift from
his previous books.

82
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,373
- Aww, my two boys.

83
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:18,971
(screeching and squealing)

84
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,763
- I was hoping they had
forgotten about Baby Bones.

85
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,369
I mean well that's it. I'm fucked.

86
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,970
I'm completely, utterly,
shittingly fucked.

87
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,799
- Just get here ASAP Jack.

88
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,383
- I'm stuck in fucking traffic.

89
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:34,537
- Technically you're not in
traffic, you are traffic.

90
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:40,011
What possessed you?

91
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:43,090
- What possessed you to
turn that baby into a bones?

92
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:44,289
I mean of all your plans to fuck me,

93
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,508
that one's fucking me rotten.

94
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:46,604
It's fucking me frontways.

95
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:47,845
It's fucking me sideways.

96
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:49,287
Thanks to you I'm pretty much a big soggy

97
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:50,729
fuckbag of cum.

98
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,274
- Well you're very welcome, Jack.

99
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,777
I don't do that for everyone.

100
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,525
- And now on the one nationwide interview

101
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:57,515
that I've booked, my one
chance to redeem myself,

102
00:04:57,516 --> 00:05:00,258
I'm gonna miss it 'cause
I'm stuck in traffic.

103
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,326
- Aw yeah I heard there was
a big accident up there.

104
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:04,951
It's caused all this traffic.

105
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:07,105
Also I saw it.

106
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,975
Also I did it.

107
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:12,709
(laughing)

108
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,416
Why don't you just teleport there?

109
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,260
I mean use a bit of, you
know, as the French say

110
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,988
they'd just say magic wouldn't they?

111
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:23,821
I mean they're French.

112
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:24,592
They're people.

113
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:26,279
They're fucked but they're people.

114
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,616
- Or I could just sit down

115
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:31,948
like a civilized person and wait.

116
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:34,183
- Because you're an idiot.

117
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,560
And just to show you how idiot you are,

118
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,348
I'm gonna skip across the globe.

119
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:40,504
Excuse me.

120
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:45,723
I'm back.

121
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:46,881
Gee whiz I had a lot of fun.

122
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,705
Glad I'm not stuck in
traffic like a bloody drongo.

123
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:54,655
Oh and by the way, the rain in
Spain falls mainly on nothin'

124
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,316
'cause I evaporated Spain.

125
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:59,592
It's gone. Cha cha.

126
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,299
No jamon for you.

127
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,046
That's Spanish ham.

128
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,042
Fuckin' buy it in a Safeway.

129
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:05,580
Buy a whole leg into your cart now.

130
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:09,643
- We love you Baby Bones!

131
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:13,215
- He may not have skin, but certainly

132
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:14,678
he has fans.

133
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,222
- I love his bones.

134
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:19,716
- If I have a baby, I'm gonna
rip off all his skin too.

135
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:22,825
- Appeared on tee shirts,
mugs, his hip-hop single,

136
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:25,777
or the wildly successful
line of children's toys.

137
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:30,324
♫ Baby Bones Baby Bones Schmampftz ♫

138
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,396
- Baby Bones merchandise
is a must-have accessory

139
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:34,680
for kids this summer.

140
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,956
- I like Baby Bones because
he doesn't listen to teachers.

141
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:38,256
(screaming)

142
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:41,777
- I love those bones!

143
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:44,913
- Baby Bones has become a media darling.

144
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:47,879
Mr. and Mrs. Pottinger
have faced harsh scrutiny,

145
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,374
forcing their child to undergo
a life-threatening procedure

146
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:54,482
to have its bones surgically removed.

147
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:57,302
Needless to say, Baby Skin has failed

148
00:06:57,302 --> 00:07:02,302
to capture the imagination
of the Australian public.

149
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,469
But is it all too much?

150
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:08,720
Child Psychologist and mother
of four, Miranda Merhtens

151
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,071
believes Baby Bones should
be Baby Left Alones.

152
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:14,165
- I just don't think it's healthy

153
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:17,518
that the youth of our
country is so obsessed

154
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:22,387
with what is objectively
a spooky, scary skeleton.

155
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:24,459
- And do you have any words tonight

156
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:28,813
for all those fans watching you?

157
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:32,890
(screeching)

158
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,360
- All your skins shall cast asunder

159
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,360
and all that will remain will be bones!

160
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,805
(laughing)

161
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:51,503
- What a darling little trooper.

162
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,790
- He may not look like a normal baby.

163
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,630
But he's an extraordinary Baby Bones.

164
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,313
- [Deborah] And what do you
think of the media's obsession

165
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:11,558
with your Baby Bones?

166
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:15,174
- I consider it an invasion
of my family's privacy.

167
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:18,486
I beg of everyone please,
stop making my family

168
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:20,590
into a media circus.

169
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,720
(disturbing rasping and whispering)

170
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:28,198
- Well we thank you for letting
our crew into your home.

171
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,378
- Oh you're welcome.

172
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,795
It's been my pleasure.

173
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:36,637
(horns honking)

174
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,730
- Whew these Cubans are delicious.

175
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,437
Cigar's not bad either.

176
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:45,469
Yak yak yak yak yak yak yak.

177
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:48,496
Seriously bud, I ate
a lot of Cuban people.

178
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:50,141
And most of them were delicious,

179
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:51,157
except Diego.

180
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,214
- Shut up!

181
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:54,611
I'm trying to listen to this
interview that I am missing.

182
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:56,948
- [Voiceover] Talk about
Jack the Ripper, Ripoff.

183
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,411
Jack the Ripoff.

184
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,528
This is typical.

185
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:01,194
This is the mark of a coward.

186
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:02,224
They're good aren't they.

187
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:04,028
You create a level playing field.

188
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:06,949
And he hasn't got the guts to turn up.

189
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,082
Why? What's he hiding?

190
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,519
It's disrespectful to
your wonderful listeners

191
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,698
whom I adore.

192
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:15,177
It is rude, crude, it's kangarooed.

193
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:18,407
It's absolutely fair
dinkum, unfair dinkum.

194
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,541
He's a dirty, rotten coward.

195
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,451
This is appalling, Paul Hogan.

196
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:27,451
(screech snoring)

197
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,725
- And now for some unfortunate news.

198
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,695
Since we recorded that
episode, there have been

199
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,118
some alarming developments

200
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:40,251
in the Baby Bones saga.

201
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:43,095
Two days ago, Baby Bones's adoptive father

202
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,757
Harry Swinton disappeared.

203
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:49,223
While no full body has been
recovered, his undamaged skin

204
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:53,530
has been found in the crawlspace
beneath the family home.

205
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,939
The whereabouts of Baby Bones
is currently Baby Unknowns.

206
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:01,189
However the police have
released this security footage

207
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,607
taken from a mechanic's mere blocks

208
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:06,736
from the Swinton residence.

209
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,478
(creepy music)

210
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,761
Baby Bones is considered
at large and dangerous.

211
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:24,667
Here at Channel Bueno, we
strongly urge all our viewers

212
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,800
to keep children and pigs inside,

213
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,213
doors and windows firmly
fastened, and please

214
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,390
lock up your bones.

215
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,950
(reporters shouting at man on television)

216
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,144
- I have no official comment tonight.

217
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:39,918
But I will say this, this latest business,

218
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,662
the quadruple B, the
bigger Baby Bones business,

219
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:44,062
this is disgusting.

220
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:45,404
It sticks in my craw.

221
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,172
They've gone too far this time.

222
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:48,898
They went too far the other times as well.

223
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,909
But this time they've gone even further.

224
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,535
It's time for us to do
a little bit of magic

225
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,669
and make the bastards disappear

226
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:57,066
next Saturday at the ballot box.

227
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,720
We've had enough!

228
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:04,626
- I'm totally boned.

229
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,638
(screeching)

230
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:11,601
(gentle music)

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,027
(quirky music)

232
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:20,916
- I cannot believe this
many people showed up.

233
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,931
- I can't believe it's not butter

234
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,905
but I am!

235
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,512
- Get out of here, Butter Man!

236
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:28,289
- It's pronounced Butterman.

237
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,039
I wasn't planning on staying.

238
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,657
The cry of a dry crumpet calls to me.

239
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,629
Til we melt again!

240
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,214
- How don't we just change the
law so that only I can stay?

241
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:41,476
- Mhmm.

242
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:44,666
There, Jack, look at this crowd.

243
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:47,263
The public are coming around,
this isn't a lost cause

244
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:49,137
so just get up there and say something.

245
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:49,931
- Okay, okay, okay, just gotta

246
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:51,324
get that butter guy out of my head,

247
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:53,129
it's a fucking dude, man.

248
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,744
- [Butter Man] You butter believe it!

249
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,491
- Quiet!

250
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:58,605
- Hey!

251
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:02,597
Jackie, Jackie Chan, yeah yeah yeah yeah!

252
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,729
I didn't know you were having a party.

253
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,923
It's really cool, man (laughs).

254
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:08,934
- Hello.

255
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,137
- Oh good day, love.

256
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:12,685
(woman shrieks)

257
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:15,693
- Skulldrich, did you
come here just to mock me?

258
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:18,603
- Is that popcorn?

259
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,766
- Yes and no.

260
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:25,405
Yes I am here to mock you but
no, these are scarab beetles.

261
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:30,916
Sorry, mate, they're a little dry.

262
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,140
- But of course!

263
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:36,527
- Neat-o, neat-o petit-o.

264
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:37,657
But I've got a little speech to make

265
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:40,283
so maybe you could just
butter off, bugger off.

266
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:41,563
- Good on you, Jack.

267
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:42,090
Break a leg.

268
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:44,199
- Yeah, leg, spine.

269
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,103
Hell, break it all.

270
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,409
Yeah.

271
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:55,585
You texting?

272
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,477
That's cool.

273
00:12:57,478 --> 00:13:01,488
(marching music)

274
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,967
- Okay.

275
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,445
Hi.

276
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,614
- Hey!

277
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,656
- Guys, girls.

278
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:16,647
Whatever that is.

279
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:19,084
(baby crying)

280
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,980
Thank you so much for
coming, what a turn out.

281
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:26,345
It really means so much that
you all care about my cause,

282
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:30,626
this cause, our cause, really
matters to this many people.

283
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:32,979
I'm Jack.

284
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,181
- Boo!

285
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:35,843
Boo, am I right?

286
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:37,875
- You might remember
me from Fishy Thursday

287
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,857
or the time I blew up Morgan
Wright's eardrum on television.

288
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:43,626
- Yeah, nice one ya dickhead!

289
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:46,494
- Or a positive example...

290
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,746
- What'd do ya think of that?

291
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,724
- And I have run out of words.

292
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,862
Lotus.

293
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:04,118
- Hello, he tried.

294
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,208
Okay, guys, well we
all know why we're here

295
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,388
so let's just open the
floor for public discussion.

296
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,994
- Hi, Marvolo Loprego.
- [Woman] Get up.

297
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:14,839
- Sorceror, level 16.

298
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,404
- Hi, Marvolo.

299
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:18,798
Enjoy that level sweet 16, mate,

300
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,655
it'll be over before you know it.

301
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:22,295
- What level are you?

302
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,566
- Oh, I'm level...

303
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,185
- You know, you're not
the only wizard in town.

304
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,196
Some of us have been here for centuries,

305
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:35,357
going completely unnoticed
and then you turn up,

306
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,635
turn a railway station into a fish

307
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:40,641
and suddenly we're all
being told to fuck off.

308
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:43,419
- I am (stutters).

309
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,487
- I uh, I uh (spits).

310
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:46,725
What a cunt!

311
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:49,898
(dramatic sting)

312
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,624
- Hey, Zandark, necromancer.

313
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,499
- Hey, Zandark.

314
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,362
- Hey, Skulldrich.

315
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:57,643
So Zach, so Jack, my bad.

316
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,530
It seems your petition calls for any acts

317
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,483
of raising the dead to cease forthwith.

318
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,012
I think that's pretty unfair considering

319
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:07,642
some of our professions, fetishes.

320
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:08,689
- Gross.

321
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,025
- And what's with no murdering people?

322
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,591
- What?

323
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,136
- Aw, boo!

324
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:16,092
(crowd heckles)

325
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,173
- Stick it up your--

326
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:18,655
- Beanbag.

327
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:21,060
- Cool it, guys, come on.

328
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:23,577
- Hello, I'm Snot-beak Fuck-Nuggs,

329
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:25,984
spokesgoblin for Saint
Cook's Wizards Council

330
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:28,841
for Equal Rights for the
attractively impaired.

331
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:29,407
- Hello.

332
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,621
- Oh yes, your documentation,

333
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:35,715
you have no options for
aesthetically-challenged members

334
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:37,555
of the magical community whatsoever.

335
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:39,149
What's the story there, mate?

336
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,695
- I didn't think of it.

337
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:41,965
I don't know man, look,
if you wanna fit in

338
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,010
why didn't you change your
name from, what was it?

339
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:49,011
Shitbird Dicklips, into
something like Tim.

340
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:53,454
- I'll have you know that
Fuck-Nuggs is a proud goblin name.

341
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,527
- You gotta tick on you, mate.

342
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,143
(crowd heckles)

343
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:57,775
- Boo!

344
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:59,492
- You fraudulent poet.

345
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,777
- I hate this man.

346
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:05,445
- Oh, I've got such a
hard-on right now, man.

347
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:09,252
Fucking Medusa, she took a
peek of this and (sputters).

348
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,321
(dog barks)

349
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,326
- He hates them.

350
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:15,602
Look at his shirt!

351
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:17,059
- What?

352
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,346
- Skulldrich.

353
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:23,566
(laughs)

354
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,015
- Now that is very offensive.

355
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:26,945
- He tried to get me to stop Barbie.

356
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,872
Hell, what Australian is that?

357
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:31,010
- She just wanted to be an astronaut.

358
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,951
You murderer!

359
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:36,439
- Won't anyone think
about my poor baby bones?

360
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,048
- And he can't even keep
it up, unlike Enrique.

361
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:43,581
- And my hot water hasn't
been working for days!

362
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,803
- That's right, he's a pervert!

363
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:50,621
- He got me so wet in a
restaurant that I was late

364
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:54,960
for a date with Brendan
Frazier and Rachel Weisz,

365
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:58,540
star of The Lovely Bones and
Monkeybone, respectively.

366
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,192
- I like him.

367
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,432
- Thank you, Terry.

368
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:02,808
- Fuck you, Terry!

369
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:05,121
- Why don't we just send him back?

370
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:06,893
He caused this whole mess.

371
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:11,275
Why blame the majority for
the actions of a minority?

372
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,303
- Yeah, what a dickslit.

373
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:14,992
Send him back!

374
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,597
Send him back!

375
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,195
Send him back!

376
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:19,940
Send him back!

377
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:23,266
(crowd heckles)

378
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:27,314
- This has been, like
a complete and utter,

379
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:30,912
what's the expression,
like a locomotive disaster,

380
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:33,472
like a bunch of people on
the metro who die in a crash.

381
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:34,880
- A trainwreck?

382
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:38,879
- No, anyway, why did I
think this was a good idea?

383
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,092
I left home to escape these lunatics,

384
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,990
and now I've given them
a rallying point, me.

385
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:45,335
- Jack, this was a good idea.

386
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:47,846
And granted, it maybe against you now

387
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:51,298
but for good reason (mumbling)

388
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,726
but they all need this vote to go through

389
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,810
so just get them on side.

390
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:59,053
- I can't do that, they hate my guts.

391
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:01,210
I'm pathetic.

392
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:03,329
- You're not pathetic.

393
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,941
Okay, look, you've made some mistakes

394
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:08,290
but you're a good guy.

395
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,911
Just

396
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:13,511
stand up and speak from the heart.

397
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:15,798
You've got this.

398
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:18,986
I believe in you.

399
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:24,375
Be charming.

400
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:25,845
(laughs)

401
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,994
You can do charming.

402
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:30,765
- [Voiceover] Boo!

403
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:33,622
(melodramatic music)

404
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:35,597
- Hey, this baby-eating fuck is--

405
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:41,159
(dramatic music)

406
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,875
- Hey!

407
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:50,238
Listen, I know I'm nobody's
favorite person right now

408
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,563
and I know that I got us into this mess

409
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,809
but please let me get us out of it.

410
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,118
Why are you all here?

411
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,324
Why would anybody leave their home

412
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:02,142
for somewhere so different and so strange?

413
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:04,189
I can tell you why I came here

414
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,878
and it's cheesy but I came
here 'cause I love this city

415
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,281
and I love this country.

416
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,310
I love that I can check my mail without

417
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:13,155
being buried in owls, I love
that I can go to the beach

418
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:15,394
without fear of kraken attack.

419
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,984
I love, that by and large,
there aren't many butter people

420
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:20,356
here trying to assault my toast
with slip-free cholesterol.

421
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:22,900
- I'll get you yet.

422
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:26,199
- But what I love the most is
that in spite of my accidents,

423
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,810
in spite of all the times I've fucked up

424
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:31,825
I've actually felt pretty welcomed here.

425
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:35,398
And for someone like
me, that's everything.

426
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,182
And do you not all feel welcome?

427
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:41,972
All of us, outsiders,
black sheep, eye kings.

428
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,215
- Aye!

429
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,012
- Wizards.

430
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:45,130
- Aye!

431
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:46,224
- Necromancers.

432
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:48,057
- Aye!

433
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:50,432
- Terries.

434
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,507
- Aye!

435
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,066
- Goblins and mummy lords.

436
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,449
- He and I once strangled a
puppy to death for no reason.

437
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,024
We were just bored.

438
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:00,291
- And assorted others.

439
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:02,553
- [Butter Man] You're churning me on!

440
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,067
- Fuck you, Butter Man!

441
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:07,276
New settlers have always
been welcomed in this country

442
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,643
but let's show them that
we're worth the effort.

443
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:14,072
Let's show 'em that we
can be Australians too.

444
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:17,799
(crowd cheers)

445
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,825
(dramatic music)

446
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:24,707
(crowd cheers)

447
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:29,069
(dogs barking)

448
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:38,985
- Well, Jack, I never
knew how passionately

449
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:40,923
you felt about this place.

450
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:43,836
I mean, look, I feel
like a bit of a bloody

451
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:46,648
dill pickle saying this, but, the reason

452
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:49,478
I wanted you back home
was because I miss you.

453
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,233
I miss having someone
around that I could just

454
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:55,216
fucking hate, you know, and I do.

455
00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:56,492
I hate you.

456
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:58,275
- I hate you too, man.

457
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,538
(laughing)

458
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,710
- Gotta admit though, I did
get you to use magic again.

459
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,567
- Yes, you did, you cheeky fucker.

460
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:04,681
(laughing)

461
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:07,340
- Watch your language you cunt.

462
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:10,955
Alright, I'm outtie (sighs).

463
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:23,579
(light melodic music)

464
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:30,668
(woman laughing)

465
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:31,655
- You did it, Jack.

466
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:32,782
- We did it, Kylie.

467
00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:34,313
This is the start of something great,

468
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:36,145
a long life here in Melbourne.

469
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:42,657
It's beautiful.

470
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,140
Allow me.

471
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:52,214
(twinkling sound)

472
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,240
(twinkling sound)

473
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,151
- Yeah, okay, stop it, stop it, Jack.

474
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:04,620
I know how to eat.

475
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:05,427
(laughs)

476
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:07,049
I am happy for you, though.

477
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,897
And I'm proud of the
small part that I played

478
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:10,400
in helping you find a home.

479
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:11,661
- Small part?

480
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,490
Thanks to you I found a new home

481
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:17,774
and I think I've found
someone I wanna share it with.

482
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:24,193
- Oh! (laughs)

483
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:28,422
(light melodic music)

484
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:33,051
- Jack, Jack, what do you
think you're doing, Jack?

485
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,473
- What do you mean?

486
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:37,253
We won, now we kiss, that's how this ends.

487
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:38,523
- No, no it isn't.

488
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,247
Look, you're a really nice guy

489
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:43,460
but I'm aggressively unattracted to you.

490
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:47,089
- But where I'm from, we win the quest,

491
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,679
we kiss the maiden.

492
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,390
- Oh, well that's fucked up!

493
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:52,301
Just because I'm the only
woman you know, Jack,

494
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:54,549
doesn't mean that we are
destined to be together.

495
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,569
If I was interested, I
probably wouldn't have

496
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,395
taken you speed dating.

497
00:22:58,396 --> 00:23:00,218
- But you kissed me.

498
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:02,117
- Jesus Christ, there is
a big difference between

499
00:23:02,118 --> 00:23:04,531
a kiss on the cheek
and a cock in my mouth.

500
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:05,305
- What?

501
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:08,012
- What do you mean, whoa, what?

502
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,570
- It's gross.

503
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:12,142
I don't know, it's weird, it's vulgar.

504
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:13,898
- Fuck you, it's vulgar!

505
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,469
You just pulled me against my will

506
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,028
to your gaping moor and I am not

507
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,791
into wispy, beard mouth.

508
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:27,119
- I'm not sure I understand
what's happening right now.

509
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,271
- Typical.

510
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:30,351
Look, Jack, I'm really happy that

511
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:33,440
I could help you, really I am.

512
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:37,941
Maybe I'll see you around.

513
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:46,645
(melancholy music)

514
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:53,618
- Well, at least wizards
can live in Melbourne now.

515
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:01,444
Yay!

516
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:07,521
Well, at least I haven't
ruined everything.

517
00:24:07,522 --> 00:24:09,909
I have ruined everything.

518
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,308
(exploding sounds)

519
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,818
- Good question.

520
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:28,519
I think Melbourne has
changed since the wizards,

521
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,466
you know, showed up
now that you mention it

522
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:32,190
but it's always been a hectic city,

523
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:33,902
so much hustle and bustle, you know?

524
00:24:33,903 --> 00:24:34,882
I love it.

525
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,615
- As a vegetarian, I couldn't be happier

526
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:39,006
since my husband was
turned into a cauliflower.

527
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:40,698
- As a pescatarian, I couldn't be happier

528
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:42,300
with my new neighbor.

529
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:44,008
- Good day.

530
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,207
- Since the wizards took
over, metro trains have been

531
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:49,544
running on time if not
slightly in the future.

532
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:51,344
(mumbles)

533
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:52,839
- Good day, hello, good to see you.

534
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,406
Yeah, look, alright I'll admit

535
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:56,843
when the johnny-come-latelies
first turned up

536
00:24:56,844 --> 00:25:00,684
I was on serious bloody tender
hooks, you know what I mean?

537
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:04,078
But when they showed me the beauty

538
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,470
of the self-battering fish

539
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,501
well I've been making
some yahoo serious dosh.

540
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:14,221
- Why must everything I love die?

541
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:17,780
I mean, I finally got a
place that I fit in, sort of.

542
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:19,201
I left to escape this bullshit

543
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:22,644
now I'm knee, no cock, no
neck fucking deep in it!

544
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:26,669
It all followed me over, all of it!

545
00:25:28,224 --> 00:25:29,355
Huh.

546
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:36,495
(light pleasant melodic music)

547
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:47,064
At least it's peaceful.

548
00:25:47,065 --> 00:25:49,820
I mean, fucked up a good
city, ruined a lot of lives

549
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:53,671
(sighs) but hey, this is nice.

550
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:58,348
(light pleasant music)

551
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:14,010
- Well, everyone else is gone but

552
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:17,025
I'm glad you changed your mind.

553
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:19,766
It feels right, doesn't it?

554
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:22,148
Like old times.

555
00:26:23,572 --> 00:26:25,878
- I don't know, man,
it's been a weird month.

556
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:27,190
I mean, everything I have ever loved

557
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:30,559
has either died or turned to shit.

558
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,594
Maybe I should just
embrace something I hate.

559
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:44,175
- I hate you, Jack.

560
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,734
- And I hate you, Skulldrich.

561
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:01,140
Now and forever.

562
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:13,219
(dramatic music)

563
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:21,726
(moaning)

564
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:28,717
(vomiting sounds)

565
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:33,619
(screaming)

566
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,950
(light pleasant music)

567
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:02,114
- Thus, the circle of life continues

568
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:05,166
its dance into eternity.

569
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:18,148
- That is a beautiful thing.

570
00:28:18,994 --> 00:28:23,793
- I cannot articulate how
much I regret this decision.

571
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:31,493
(spaghetti music)
