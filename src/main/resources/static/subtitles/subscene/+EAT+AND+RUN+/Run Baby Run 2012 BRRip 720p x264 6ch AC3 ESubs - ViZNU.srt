ln pursuit of dreams,

2
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,805
My desires remain far, far away

3
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,517
ln search ofdreams we run on and on

4
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,352
Do we see them?

5
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,853
Do we perceive?

6
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,630
ln pursuit of dreams,
l run even today

7
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,300
My desires remain far, far away

8
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,096
ln search ofdreams we run on and on

9
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,848
Do we see them?

10
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,808
Do we perceive?

11
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,959
ln pursuit of dreams,
l run even today

12
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,880
My desires remain far, far away

13
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,592
ln search of dreams we run on and on

14
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,427
Do we see them?

15
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,345
Do we perceive?

16
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,308
Christ's Grace

17
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,644
Jesus protects this house

18
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,072
Oh Lord!

19
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,493
Has she returned so quickly?
Chey!

20
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,205
Alleluia!

00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,837
Good morning sir

25

- Aiyo! Sh...!

29
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:37,943

lchaya(hubby), Lucy speaking
5 minutes more and l am done

31

No, in the police force

48
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,079
Deputy Superintendent of Police
Benny Tharakan

49
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,336
Selling pirated movie CDs
is your business, eh?

50
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,086
Sir?!

51
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,173
Be quiet! So convenient
coming in with evidence, like this

52
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,800
Non-bailable offence, understood?

53
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,012
Please don't betray me, sir
l desperately need the money

54
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,681
Please sir
l'll do anything you ask me to

55
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,189
Do have only movie CDs?

56
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,607
Other kind?

57
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,026
Don't you have adult movies?

58
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,196
Yes or no?

59
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,823
Take it out

60
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,542
Wait here

Aiyo! lsn't that me?

63
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,410
Christ! lt's me!

64
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,206
You!!!

65
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,680
Reporter, Bharath vision

66
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,722
Jesus!

67
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,017
My dear sister,
don't get me into trouble

68
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:20,939
l've just got back into service
After 2 suspensions and 2 meditations

69
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,401
Please, l'll do
what ever you want me to

70
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,904
Sir, answerthat call
Must be from the Tv channel

71
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,157
Hello?

72
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,325
venu, that's my name

73
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,496
A well known camera man
ofa well known TV channel

74
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,040
l know you, sir
l've met you

75
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,710
- So, further introductions not needed
- Not at all

76
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,463
lf prime time
news today decides to air...

77
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,591
...your antics with that chick
what will be your opinion?

78
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:52,846
Aiyo! l no longer will exist
Tell me sir, what should l do?

79
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:02,647
Rs 3 lakhs, in notes of 1000
Send it with that girl

80
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,648
Okay, sir

81
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,399
Okay

82
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,241
Why has no one taken this?

83
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,452
We don't want any lOUs, sir
Just give us our salary

84
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,329
This is not an lOU
Just a security

85
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,789
Look, only 2 minutes left
Go and begin the news telecast

86
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,124
By then the money will be here

87
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,919
Money that's not come since 4 months
do you think will come in half an hour?

88
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,170
On its way

89
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,213
Then l'll read the news
after it arrives

90
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,508
Or you do it yourself, after all
you were a lion in Bharath vision, right?

91
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,592
Yes dude, l was indeed, a lion

92
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,093
When l started my own channel
l became a cat

93
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,803
Okay, don't read, you pig
l'll do it, give me that coat

94
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,639
No need to remove the coat
l got the money

95
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,648
Here, Rs 3 lakhs

96
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,732
Did you see how we got the money?

97
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:50,111
Here's Rs 3 lakhs, take your dues
lf anything's left, leave it there itself

98
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,615
Bro, l have to go read news
Please keep my 40 aside

99
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,699
Brother, where's mine?

100
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,245
A Bharath vision lD card?
Are you back with that channel?

101
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,706
l went for an 'operation', dear
My old card came of use, that's all

102
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,291
Stop your chatter
Come with me

103
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,465
Were you going to explain
all that happened, to them?

104
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,968
You can as well air it on news time!
Let everybody here be aware!

105
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,262
Great! Remember the way
you followed ethics so strictly?

106
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,432
When it didn't work, you quit
Bharath vision to start a new channel

107
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,522
As the head, you are resorting
to 3rd rate tactics, to pay the salaries...

108
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,109
...and that too mimicking
a decent guy, like venu sir

109
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,363
Go and tell venu everything!
You can get married to my dead body

110
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,447
He'll kill me!

111
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,076
l've not made it a habit, right?
This was only the first time

112
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,827
Sir?

113
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:39,953
What is it?

114
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,748
Minister Kunjumoideen will land at 1:00 PM
None of us will be there to coverthe event

115
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,334
Select some good channel
and just reproduce their content

116
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,669
lsn't that what we do every time!

117
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,505
Hey! Also include an 'it seems'
in every other sentence

118
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,464
What's that sir?

119
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,343
Like...the Minister is involved in
the sex racket case 'it seems'

120
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,512
Or...there is a chance
he'll resign 'it seems'

121
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,724
Like this, we include 'it seems'
in all matters, we are not sure of

122
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,766
Understood?

123
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,143
-Yes, now l do
- Then go

124
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,691
What a big media staryou were
Rs 1.5 lakh salary and...

125
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,280
...post of chief operating officer
What went wrong at Bharath vision?

126
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,743
Conceit! l have only myselfto blame
A kind ofsmugness, dying to be pricked!

127
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,207
Oh Lord!
lt's venu!

128
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,126
Would he have somehow
come to know what l did?

129
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,254
Aiyo! Would Benny Tharakan
have talked to him, about it?

130
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,672
Will the Town Hall
be free tomorrow?

131
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,590
Why?

132
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,425
To keep my dead body
for public viewing

133
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,887
Hello?
What's up dude?

134
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,557
ls it?
He doesn't know!

135
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,063
Aren't you ashamed
to go cover a silly 'lathi charge'?

136
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,941
Oh, you call itjust time pass, eh?
Definitely not! You are itching for kudos!

137
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:57,072
Returning from Delhi after 5 years
just a cheap trick to say you are back

138
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,366
Ow!
He's swearing!!

139
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,622
He can't be idle even for a day
without taking up some work

140
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,040
Probably needs the money

141
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,083
He?

142
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,587
The money he earns for
each assignment of Reuters and CNN...

143
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,050
...no camera man would get
even after 3 or4 years oftoil

144
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,887
When sensitive issues crop up
channels in Delhi bid for his services

145
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,056
4 lnternational awards
including the Rory Peck Award

146
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,849
This is not for money
Just to show off, that's all!

147
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,059
Forwhich channel could it be?

148
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,853
Certainly not, for Bharath vision

149
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,327
Look here Suraj
Renuka Ma'am has come

150
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,871
lfyou confront her,
you'll need to look out for anotherjob

151
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,082
Her attitude is
'Just take a leap ifyou cannot'

152
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,544
l will take it up, not with her
but with CEO vijayakumar sir

153
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,548
She separated me and my wife allotting
different shifts without a word to us

154
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:01,720
My shift is from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM
and hers, from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM

155
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,723
l have been gazing at stars
the whole of last month

156
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,974
- Be quiet, dude
- Get lost, buddy

157
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:11,229
When she joined as junior reporter
l was already here, as sub-editor

158
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,648
Now she claims
to be executive editor!

159
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,607
Arun, come here

160
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,319
On the run down, first item should be
Minister Kunjumoideen and sex racket

161
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,281
The women's activist Sharada
and the retired old DySP Ramarajan

162
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,950
l want both ofthem on phone
connected to me, right time

163
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,413
lfyou come up with stories like unable
to connect, and so on, l'll blast you!

164
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,005
- Revathi?
- Ma'am

165
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,393
Greetings, l am Renuka
The news, headlines

166
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,062

implicated in Vadakara sex racket case...

167
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,731
...says retired DySP Ramarajan

168
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,277
ln Kuttikanam adivasi zone,
Land mafia faked 420 documents

169
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,653
The news in detail

170
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,157
Minister Kunjumoideen's part in the case
is now a topic ofcontroversy

171
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:10,789
The girl who'd been harassed had named
the minister too in her original statement

172
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,667
This claim by DySP Ramarajan, the officer
who was investigating the case then...

173
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,628
...has sparked off
these fresh controversies

174
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,548
Arun, didn't you get connection?

175
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,091
l am trying, but not getting through

176
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,177
You'll get it from me
ifyou don't get it, right now

177
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,845
Get lost from here
ifyou can't, dude!

178
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,102
The ministerwho was in Delhi
since the last 4 days, will be here...

179
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:37,190
...in Nedumbashery airport
by afternoon...is the latest report

180
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,528
Sir may l?

181
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,487
Yes

182
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,031
What's it, dude?

183
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,199
l have a complaint

184
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,492
You oryourwife?

185
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,577
So this game was
with your approval, eh?

186
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,956
Dude, l'll know even
if a leaf moves in this place

187
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,582
Sir, it's been a month
since anything moved at all!

188
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,000
Sorry, she takes the decisions

189
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,003
She can, but she'll have
to bear my mother's curse

190
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,713
What's your mother's role in this?

191
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,842
Motherwants to die, only after
she sees her grand child

192
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,970
That's being greedy, isn't it?
Didn't she get to see you, as a baby?

193
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,556
- Look here sir
- lfyou want to change shifts, go ask her

194
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,558
ls she Goddess of Chottanikkara
to bow and beg favors from?

195
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,809
Go and ask her directly, useless!

196
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,019
Why use me to test
your sharp tongue?

197
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,731
- Sir, can you help?
- No!

198
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,109
Oh, there she is!
The she-devil!

199
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,612
We don't pay a salary for
couples to coochy-coo during work

200
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,282
There's no question
ofchanging the shift time

201
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,034
May be, on humanitarian
considerations...?

202
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,872
l don't see such considerations
when you force TAM rating on me

203
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,665
Do you think l am a machine?

204
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,377
l've lost out an entire life!
Don't forget that!

205
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:44,924
Hello?

206
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:46,676
ls it?

207
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,305
Did you see?
No, l will come

208
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:51,389
Sir

209
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,643
The minister is in the guest house,
women activists and party members too

210
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,938
We can expect something hot
You take overthe news, l'll come 'live'

211
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:05,069
Did you see that enthusiasm?
Focus channel got venu to shoot for them

212
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,487
You mean Reuter's venu?

213
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,405
Here?

214
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,951
He's come from Delhi and is here
since a week, to testify on some old case

215
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,954
Must have accepted this job
having free time on his hands

216
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,752
Oh Lord! ln today's lathi charge
once, just one beating...

217
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,213
...may this queen ofJhansi
receive on her head, please God!

218
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,715
- What's it, dude?
- Nothing, sir

219
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,905
- Preetha, did you see venu sir?
- ls Reuters venu covering this?

220
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:53,743
- Why is he here, for this lifeless story?
- Ourvice President requested him, come

221
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,370
Where the heck is this man?!

222
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,413
Must be hanging around somewhere

223
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,165
The Ministerwill soon be here

224
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,674
Nothing will happen
till l get out of here

225
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,384
We cannot be too sure, sir

226
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,095
Your own party members
will stir up problems

227
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,847
That's also part of politics
Creating and solving problems

228
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:19,060
You guys need your guns and lathis
l need to use my tongue, just watch

229
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,159
Don't get excited

230
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,246
Stop your slogans

231
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,164
Stop!
Stop, l say

232
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,460
Stop, l say
Don't you understand?

233
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,632
l have only respect
forthe women folk ofthis land

234
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,551
Listen to what l have to say...

235
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:56,097
...afterwhich you can shout
dissent or block my way! Please!

236
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,350
Please...please...please!

237
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,020
Okay, stop
Let him say his piece

238
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,190
Don't bother asking me
l will tell you everything

239
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:11,738
All this hullaballoo is simply because of
the statement ofa retd DySP, 6 years later

240
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,451
Let the police investigate
l am prepared to co operate

241
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,496
Do you want me to step down
during the period of investigation?

242
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,292
Let my party or chief minister demand
l am prepared for that also

243
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:28,171
To counter a false accusation
What more should l do?

244
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,469
How is it?

245
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,096
Enough?

246
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,016
Mohammed, what is
the schedule for this evening?

247
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,854
Renu, don't try to barge in
He subdued everyone with just 4 sentences

248
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,565
Don't think you can play around
with this news, the whole day today

249
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,569
Chey! l came because l heard
venu was covering this for Focus TV

250
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,738
You can expect
fireworks when he's around

251
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,990
Move aside all ofyou

252
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,075
Move!

253
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,543
See you later

254
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,255
Move

255
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,432
Come on finish off
all these sons of guns!!!

256
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,355
Charge!

257
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,655
Get lost you!

258
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,828
Start the car

259
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,053
See that shoe
and that bare foot

260
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,638
- Shoot both, dude!
- Okay

261
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,612
Da!

262
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,369
You are totally useless
Get lost, you...!

263
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,120
Sorry, ma'am

264
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,465
venu sir?

265
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,384
There won't be any more
further issues, will there?

266
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,177
What?

267
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,511
l mean the other one?

268
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,850
Did he see me throwing my shoe?

269
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,019
Well, if he did, let him!

270
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,192
- Here, go and serve it
- Thank you, sir

271
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,071
Talking diplomatically and calmly
the event passed off uneventfully

272
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:45,284
But someone threw a shoe at him
and party members turned violent

273
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,370
Chey! Who could it be?

274
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,715
Did you see the rhythm
in those shots?

275
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,509
Oh!

276
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:13,646
One second, turning on a single leg
a180degree pan, a shot with amazing impact!

277
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,066
Wouldn't you have got it
using both legs for 2 seconds?

278
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,652
Sure you will

279
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,906
But it can be shown only in your cheap,
crappy, sub standard channel

280
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,325
All good channels
will cut them, edit them

281
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,161
Whatever l shoot, will not
give them a chance to edit

282
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,788
- Oh! Forsure
- Look there, my boy

283
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,917
Chey! They chopped
the scenes, those vagabonds!

284
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,629
Smart boys don't
need an excuse to edit

285
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,842
Yes, venu here

286
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,304
l came, created an issue
and shot those scenes foryou

287
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,557
Now, using my footage, you are
teaching your boys editing, eh?

288
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,600
Rascals! With no sense
about rules of continuity!

289
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,102
What? Sorry?

290
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,855
You can stuffyour sorry
under your leg...arms...

291
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,481
...l'll take it when l need it!

292
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,613
What is it, dude?
Giggling away to glory,eh?

293
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,283
Twin screen play writers
What the heck do you know?

294
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:11,370
venu, they are my friends
They have 5 super hit films to their credit

295
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,206
They've come here for my sake
To discuss a program for my NBl Channel

296
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,417
lfyou have anything to say
direct it at me, not them

297
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,585
l will tell this not only
to you, but to them also

298
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,296
l didn'tjump up from the middle
of my dinner, to wield a camera

299
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,175
As a gold medalist from film institute
l refused to step into the film world...why?

300
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,762
My ambition was to shoot visuals
that were authentic, not manipulated

301
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:28,804
Understood?

302
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,098
Humph!
Cinema my foot!

303
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,229
Looks like, a gas bag
sprouted hands and legs!

304
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,067
Like army stories narrated by
tea shop owners with big moustaches

305
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,152
Sure! Army stories indeed

306
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,489
Kargil war! Who covered it
forthe Defense Ministry?

307
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,449
Him

308
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,453
The terrorist attack
at the Taj hotel, Mumbai

309
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,955
Who covered the commando
operation for CNN channel?

310
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,082
Was it Azhagappan?

311
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,334
Not azhag-appan
Your appan (dad)!

312
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,337

313
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,094
Oh, it was you, sir?

Hey, Somarajan sir?

00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,019
When l called
Rishi said you were here

319
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,772
Don't worry, l won't
stay for long and trouble you

320
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,071
So my perjury,
led to something good

321
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,533

But my return has resulted
in something good!

328
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,843
Don't you know him?

News continues

333

Head lines

00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,922
Anyway these guys
don't know anything

342
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,507
What ifthere's scope for a story?

343
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,429
- Should l?
- Go ahead

344
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:34,972
Sir

345
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,016
Please, sir

346
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,982
About 5 years ago...

347
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,949
After nearly 7 days offasting
and in very poor health conditions...

348
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,996
...social activist and poetess Radhadevi
has been arrested and admitted in hospital

349
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,583
Demanding immediate solution
to the Chambakara issue...

350
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,630
...Radhadevi announced solidarity with
the citizens protest and started herfast

351
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,507
venu sir has come!

352
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,467
Did you get it, sir?
The police refuse to allow us in

353
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,843
Here's the Commissioner's permission

354
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,513
lfshe's conscious after an hour
and cooperates, take her interview also

355
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,765
- Let's go to the casualty
- Me?

356
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,934
You want me to shoot
this lifeless interview?

357
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,728
Tojust focus on her mug
watch it and die of boredom?

358
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,188
Get lost, dude!
Go do it yourself

359
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,482
Sir, the permission
is in your name, Reuters venu

360
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,983
lfyou are not there
the police will block our entry

361
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,360
You can go after it begins

362
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,320
You are just harassing me

363
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,781
Come!

364
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,824
lmpossible!

365
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,702
lt's not for an interview
We must tell the public about her condition

366
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,954
Didn't l tell you
that you can't meet her?

367
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,038
Why not?

368
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,206
Not possible, that's all

369
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,457
Let me see if l can

370
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,167
Who is this fiery maiden?

371
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,336
Renuka, junior reporter of Bharath vision

372
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,629
A beginner's enthusiasm

373
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,591
- l must see how you will
- Let me go

374
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,135
You useless, behaving atrociously, eh?

375
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:55,886
You...!

376
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,888
Hey, that was great

377
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,057
You arrogant girl!

378
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,399
You! You dare lay
hands on a policewoman

379
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,443
You fool! Aren't lady-police
assigned to deal with women?

380
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,028
Why do you interfere?

381
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,863
Throw him into the police van, the dog

382
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,494
You dare to lay hands
on media persons, you pig?!

383
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,497
Let me go
Kill him, this son ofa gun

384
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,756
- That's venu sir
-You mean, Reuters venu?

385
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,409
Sir

386
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:03,871
And then?

387
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:04,872
What?

388
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,834
You saw DySP Somarajan
pushing away the reporter Renuka

389
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:09,793
And then?

390
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,923
very calmly and
full of respect, l asked him

391
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:20,763
Sir, is it right to do such things
to a girl, that too, to a media person

392
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,642
He said who are you
to ask me such...come here

393
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,645
And gave me a slap

394
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:32,941
And a kick here...here on my chest

395
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,944
l don't remember anything else

396
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,572
Note it down

397
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,284
The certificate is ready
You go and take that

398
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,455
How are you?
Are you in pain?

399
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,083
Sure, l'm covered by insurance

400
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,584
He asked, if you are in pain

401
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,752
- What?
- Pain

402
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:57,299
Pain, yes it is paining
This thing blocks and l'm unable to hear

403
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,346
Removing that is not going to help
He'll never be able to hear again

404
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,145
l hope there is nothing
seriously wrong, doctor

405
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,822
Ear drum is totally damaged
He'll have to use a hearing aid

406
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,865
Explain it to him gently

407
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:22,783
Okay?

408
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,207
Look here, just take it easy

409
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,125
What?

410
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:39,133
Don't get agitated
You'll be a little upset on hearing this

411
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,845
But how can l tell you this,
in any otherway...?

412
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:43,971
Doctorjust said...

413
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,182
What's this, dude?
Like some melodrama in cinema

414
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,102
With broken words, it is cancer
lts blood cancer, brother...

415
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,562
Tell me whatever it is
you dumb fellow!

416
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,439
l'm not dumb
You are the one now, deaf

417
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,108
Your ear is gone forever, dude

418
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,320
Hereafter, we must fix that thingy
A hearing aid, that's what l meant

419
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,580
So, this is a goner!

420
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:21,216
Once, the artist van Gogh
chopped his ear off, for his lady love

421
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:26,013
My dear girl, l'vejust lost it for you
without love or any such moonshine

422
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,640
Be grateful, okay?
Gratitude

423
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,768
- That thing which you said...
- Gratitude?

424
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,602
No, this love

425
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,771
lt can happen even now and
everything will fall in place

426
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,106
- Will that happen?
- lt's already too late

427
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,691
- Then go get a taxi
- Okay

428
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,151
Get lost, dude and
stop weaving stories

429
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,154
venu!

430
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,548
My God! You should have
seen them after that incident

431
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,844
lt wasn't love,
theyjust took off on a high!

432
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,933
l, was the reason for that love to begin
Since l am not there in the rest ofthe story

433
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,977
l'll say, okay good night

434
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,229
Good night

435
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,774
And then?

436
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,569
And then...

437
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,289
Where were you?

438
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,459
The press meet is about
to begin, l'll call you back

439
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,045
Hey, it's urgent
lt's an exclusive

440
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,421
Needs to be
shot immediately

441
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,339
What is it about?

442
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,174
l'll explain
Come quickly

443
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,259
l am waiting outside

444
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,221
Monacha, l've got
an exclusive, l'm leaving

445
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,556
Shouldn't l come
to cover the event?

446
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:56,728
This is being covered by venu sir
Reuters venu, accompanied by, Renuka

447
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,481
Come, get in

448

- What is so exclusive?
- l'll tell you everything

449
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,286
Which is this place?

450
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,246
Guest house of Kelvin Joseph

451
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,833
He is the guy who is
funding Rishi's new channel

452
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,084
Didn't you say
we have something exclusive?

453
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,547
Yes, there is no one else here
Only 2 of us, exclusive literally, come

454
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,008
- Come on, l say
-venu

455
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,301
Let me go

456
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,433
Come

457
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,894
What are your intentions?

458
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,562
Dishonorable ones, of course!

459
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,148
Sure! Go climb a wall!

460
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,026
Oh! That!

461
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,822
No! Please no...not before marriage

462
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,534
lsn't that what you mean?
Well, l have no such inclinations

463
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,327
Then?

464
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,829
Why that disappointed
expression, when l said that?

465
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,664
Aiyada! Disappointment!

466
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,587
Do you know to cook?

467
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,631
- Sure, to an extent
- Okay

468
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,716
- Where's the kitchen?
- Over there

469
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,176
What do you prefer?
Tea or coffee?

470
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,511
Before that, by the way
have you heard my song?

471
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,596
Song?

472
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,556
Music track, karaoke

473
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,561
ln our future lives, very frequently
we have to face 2 gigantic issues

474
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,855
Your cooking and my music!

475
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,983
Let's begin our interaction
from that point

476
00:32:55,181 --> 00:33:00,477
As rays ofthe fading evening sun,
lay sprawled on the shores unrestrained

477
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,899
Swinging your little tender arms, dear
on a little boat you rowed, my baby dear

478
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:11,488
Tear drops neverfell but brimmed
Eyes that glistened with tears unshed

479
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:16,451
Memories, like a wick of lamp burning
not feeling the heat of the flame brightening

480
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:21,790
oh, why did you leave me and go
My sweet little chirpy red sparrow

481
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:27,170
l wait on these shores foryou on and on
My desires like roots spread far and yon

482
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:32,551
As rays ofthe fading evening sun,
lay sprawled on the shores unshackled

483
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:38,306
Swinging yourtender little arms, dear
in a boat you rowed away, my baby dear

484
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:53,947
As the wheels oftime and age
Turned around on earth's heritage

485
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:59,327
As flowering trees and young Laurel
grew and changed beyond recall

486
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,458
As before my eyes this little stream
faded out of sight, never to be seen

487
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:09,921
l turned into a golden sand boat
that didn't have water to go afloat

488
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:15,260
As rays ofthe fading evening sun,
lay sprawled on the shores uncontrolled

489
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:20,766
Swinging yourtender little arms, dear
in a boatyou rowed away, my baby dear

490
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:41,995
Adorned in anklets on feet so pretty
Bangles aplenty on hands so dainty

491
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:47,292
A garland, you once gave me
with blossoms of Mimusop's Elengi

492
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:52,506
Festivities, dance ofwarfares
Long over are the temple fairs

493
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:57,928
A sentinel l stand in a temple forsaken
Like a burnt out black stone lamp alone

494
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:03,308
As rays ofthe fading evening sun,
lay sprawled on the shores unrestrained

495
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:08,605
Swinging yourtender little arms, dear
in a boat you rowed away, my baby dear

496
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:13,985
As rays offading evening sun,
sprawled upon the shores unrestrained

497
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:19,282
Swinging yourtender little arms, dear
in a boatyou rowed away, my baby dear

498
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:24,621
As rays of fading evening sun,
lay sprawled upon the shores unrestrained

499
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:30,085
Swinging your tender little arms, dear
in a boat you rowed away, my baby dear

500
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,301
Go climb the wall!

501
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:40,929
Cruel fellow!

502
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,475
And then?

503
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,312
Why mood off, sir?
A kind of sadness?

504
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,605
He's sad that
he can't have a baby

505
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,399
Haven't you heard?
Sorrow of being childless

506
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,817
What do the doctors say?

507
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,735
No use!
No use at all!

508
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,155
How can a baby be born
when we didn't have a chance?

509
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,824
Cruel she-devil
Witch, hellcat!

510
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,575
Cheater!

511
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,410
Da! You don't say anything

512
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,164
l will, she cheated me also
l will tell you, the rest ofthe story

513
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,959
lt was when, l quit Bharath vision
and started my own channel, the NBl

514
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,712
lt was 2 or 3 days
before its launch

515
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,215
The day before these lovers
tired after love making...

516
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,259
...decided to get married
at the registry office

517
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:27,267
Well known NRl businessman
and Malayalee Rajan Kartha nominated...

518
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:32,731
...as Rajya Sabha memberfrom Kerala as
decided by Democratic party central powers

519
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:38,570
State party president and possibly future
Chief Minister, Bharathan Pillai...

520
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:42,282
...overcoming objections
ofother parties in Kerala...

521
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,993
...vouched for Rajan Kartha's nomination

522
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:49,039
When Kerala does not have
a single candidate or MP...

523
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,125
Rishi, this is a good omen

524
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,460
Which one?

525
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,715
Our channel is taking off, at a time
when the situation is heating up with news

526
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,218
Our channel won't have
any dearth for news

527
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,095
That's true, but actually it's not
the way you think it is, Jose'aettan

528
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:09,392
From today, all channels will focus on
Rajan Kartha and Bharathan Pillai

529
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:14,689
But we will wake up in 2 days with
an exclusive story that'll divert viewers

530
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,233
All other channels are baffled

531
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,109
What's the story?

532
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,528
4 exclusive stories are ready

533
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,073
We'll just decide what to air
We have 2 more days, right?

534
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:27,285
There is 1 which could be
most exclusive, we can't ignore that

535
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:27,953
venu!

536
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,829
Ah! Has the bridegroom arrived?

537
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,164
Don't you know him?
venu

538
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,916
Who doesn't?

539
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,627
- Kelvin Joseph's partner
- l know him

540
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,879
Don't splurge all your money on him
although he may convince you

541
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,546
Come

542
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,133
We are getting married tomorrow

543
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,594
But not inviting you,
it's a registered marriage

544
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,388
Rishi did mention it, congrats!

545
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,305
Thanks

546
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,599
Give it to me

547
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:56,606
Dude, it's only a signature tomorrow
Don't take way Renu, for another month

548
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,399
She is my sub-editor

549
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,902
Come down to earth dude, just beginning
and thinks he's already a channel bigwig

550
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,320
Go, go

551
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,711
Dad wanted a proper wedding

552
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,715
Find someone else then, to stand
well decorated and smiling...shall we?

553
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,216
l just mentioned dad's wish

554
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,469
Let's find someone for dad then
Will your mom allow it?

555
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,722
God! What a thorny tree

556
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,223
Am l a thorny tree?

557
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,809
Am l not a flower, hmmm?

558
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,855
Hey! Can't you wait till tomorrow?

559
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,400
l've reached limits
of my patience, dude!

560
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,446
Rishi come here,
l'm reiterating what l've always said

561
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,700
l'm not investing, to strut around like
a channel owner, it's only for business

562
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,705
l have no allegiance to
any particular religion or party

563
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,583
Ratings, commercial
value of news, that's all

564
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,127
Also, l'm giving you
the freedom you've always wanted

565
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,047
Correct! Even otherwise
who are we indebted to?

566
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:07,761
A man comes home, freshens up
waits for his kids to sleep, views Tv...

567
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:12,932
...for 2 hours, the programs and news
forwhich we have toiled and sweated

568
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:13,683
Ask him to get lost, l say!

569
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,518
Sheer attitude problem
Let's see you like this always, okay?

570
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,771
Sure, if this attitude shifts...

571
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,358
...l swear l'll work for you,
for your channel, for what you pay!

572
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,530
Renu, its Manilal here

573
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,950
A shocking exclusive!

574
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,792
Okay, Mani

575
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,963

Rishi! Can your channel
go on air today, tonight?

577
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,602
We are on to an exclusive
which nobody may get

578
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,728
Yes or no?

579
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,979
Yes ofcourse!

580
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:11,241

with news, that's going to shock Kerala

583
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,792
Promos have to start
on internet and FM Radio

584
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,337
Rishi, seeing the promos,
people will wait for the shocking news...

585
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,339
...but what if the info is wrong?

586
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,843
We already have 4 other stories
that will shock, we'll start with any ofthem

587
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,719
Forward this now itself to play up

588
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,554
Okay

589
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,647
What is that?

590
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:48,528
5m, waterproof USB wire camera
Usually used in surgical procedures

591
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,990
lt will enter any body organ
or even the intestines, to shoot

592
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,075
But why, for our purpose?

593
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,244
62 degree wide vision view

594
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,998
Av details will be, clear
as crystal, high resolution

595
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,835
Have you prepared
your introduction lines?

596
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,879
Let's shoot it here
in the vehicle itself

597
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,213
Do we have to?

598
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:12,844
lt must be your face before the visuals
You won't get any benefit otherwise

599
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,555
Okay

600
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,390

00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,701
...caught in the act with crores
of money changing hands, watch it!

605
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,245
l hope we get to see all
what was just said

606
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,720
- Camera

607
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,559

Sir, this has come back after repair

00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,814
lt was taken from the office room
Keep it back there

612
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,455
Why does he still have this old fridge?
Can't he buy a new one?

613
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,000
That's our Bharathan Pillai sir
Such humility and modesty

614
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:59,010
varghese, l am feeling very tired
Shall we meet tomorrow?

615
00:43:59,094 --> 00:43:59,719
Okay, sir

616
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,137
Okay, leader

00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,431
Okay, we are leaving

618
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,768
Okay, everything

619
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,378
He is Kartha sir

620
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,050
Come, come

621
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,218

622
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,809
-varghese, don't allow anyone in
- Okay sir

623
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,483
l didn't have much hope
till the decision was made

624
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,235
Party members
protested so vehemently

625
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,698
They raise a hue and cry
only here, none of it reaches Delhi

626
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,450
lsn't that why l extended
my hand, when you asked?

627
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,121
Now, where is that stuff
which must reach my hand?

628
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,748
Oh that, yes!
That is ready

629
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,213
True, it's the key to your fridge

630
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:21,217
l took it by telling varghese,
it needed repair

631
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,770
The entire amount
you've asked is here, count it

632
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,741
This will cover only
the Rajya sabha seat

633
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:49,537
The crown of a central minister
is on its way, don't forget that

634
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:53,916
l shall continue remembering it
like this, all the time, isn't that enough?

635
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:54,792
Sure

636
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,383
Sir is returning

637
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,010
Get the camera

638
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,514
Renu, take it

639
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:24,781
Come

640
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,200
Where?
What is it?

641
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,622
Sign off, it should be with
Pillai's house as a back drop

642
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,960
This is Renuka, with cameraman Venu
from Bharathan Pillai's residence

643
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:38,878
Come

644
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,095
Police!

645
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,263
Don't drive off immediately!

646
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:53,935
Go straight ahead, there is
a roundabout, take a right and ask there

647
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,897
Now take off!

648
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,859
Hey! Come here

649
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,278
Who are you?

650
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,156
Why are you
prowling around here?

651
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,032
Nothing

652
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,325
Who was in that vehicle?

653
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,994
They asked for directions
and l told them

654
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,207
Hello?

655
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,042
Chief lnspector, Anthony

656
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,670
What is it?
You wanted to see me?

657
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,380
l am right in front ofyour house

658
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,591
We've caught a man
who looks suspicious

659
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,385
Looks like a journalist

660
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,639
What?
Ajournalist?

661
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:43,651
Reuters, BBC
Delhi based

662
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,363
Not any local channel eh?
What were you planning?

663
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,993
Look sir, this is wrongful confinement
How can you hold me like a criminal?

664
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,953
l am a media person
with a national rating

665
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:58,332
Okay! How many policemen know
what Reuters means in our town?

666
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,460
Please wait outside
venu, sit please

667
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,461
No thanks

668
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,674
What was the information?

669
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,886
What did you see and shoot?

670
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,721
Open your mouth
and tell me, you...!

671
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,847
Hey, be quiet!

672
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,766
What you've guessed
was the information we got

673
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,229
Later, we realized it was false

674
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,314
How?

675
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,525
Kartha sir came in
with nothing in his hand

676
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,404
He did not carry any briefcase
or bag which could contain money

677
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,659
- Sir
- What is it?

678
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,871
Police chased and caught the van
We've got a wireless message

679
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:39,749
And?

680
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,293
The van belongs
to NBl, a new channel

681
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,629
lt is all set to launch tonight

682

ln the same way NBl

698
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,760
From this minute, foryou, from today

699
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:20,808
As a brand new channel, naturally
we come to you, with exclusive news

700
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,729
Confessions, we have seen them
many times on channel screens

701
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:30,651
But here is a secret which will
shock Kerala, truth brought by a priest

702
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,696
ln 2003 there was a sensational...

703
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,495
Sorry venu
Sorry forthe inconvenience

704
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,583
varghese, drop him
wherever he needs to go

705
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,168
Sorry

706
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,675
What the heck did you build up to?

707
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,178
Was it only me?
Who asked for an ambulance?

708
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:01,223
lfthe news was true
we had to shift stufffrom here

709
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,643
What will l do with that cash?
Thatwas the reason

710
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,649
Who is this priest?
Who knows?

711
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,194
A sinnerwho is not penitent
deserves to be punished

712
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:14,862
Rishi

713
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,572
What happened?

714
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,115
Where is Renu?

715
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,992
You returned
together, didn't you?

716
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,996
We waited for you till the last minute
When you didn't come, we aired another story

717
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,794
Tell me what happened?

718
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:35,382
l sent her offat 9:00 PM
With the footage we shot

719
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,467
And then?

720
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,845
Do you think she could be hurt?

721
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,681
No! Don't panic!
Nothing will happen to her

722
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,726
Why don'twe air
this issue now itself?

723
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,063
Rishi look!

724
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:55,152
Candidate for Rajya Sabha, Rajan Kartha and
Bharathan pillai Democratic party president...

725
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,823
...caught in the act with crores
of money changing hands, watch it!

726
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,634
How can your program on
confessions have any effect...

727
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,760
...when such explosive news is being aired?

728
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,762
This channel was a dead baby
even before it was born

729
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,890
Even a launch program
couldn't be done confidentially...

730
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,519
...and l've wasted my money
Enough, just wind up now

731
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:37,444
This is Renuka, with cameraman Venu
from Bharathan Pillai's residence

732
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:55,963
- Sir
- Where did you drop her?

733
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,340
Sir, at the over-bridge
Another car came and she got into it

734
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,675
Let's go to Bharath vision

735
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,766
Move man

736
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,313
You are finished!!!

737
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,981
You are no more!

738
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,901
Over! l'll just think you died
afterturning insane!

739
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,132
Hello?

740
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:28,180
venu, you dragged and threw me down
from a very great height

741
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,058
l called to let you
know my happiness

742
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:37,189
A deep wound and the sharp pain
When it heals, only l'll feel it

743
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,692
But be sure, you also will know it

744
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,199
Democratic party after its meeting...

745
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:51,870
...decides to strip
Bharathan Pillai's presidential position

746
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,416
They have also requested vigilance...

747
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,546
...to start investigations
against Kartha and Bharathan Pillai

748
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,223
Oh that was a terrible thing to do!

749
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,642
Doesn't matter
Forgiven

750
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:19,231
lf l was 1 day late, l would've had
to stand in a queue at the family court

751
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,190
l've forgiven!

752
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:24,028
l will not forgive!
She ruined my NBl

753
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,488
He wasn't referring to you

754
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,866
Bharathan Pillai would have
been a Chief Minister today

755
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,868
Today he'sjust
a state committee member

756
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:31,577
The rotten corpse!

757
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:35,331
lts 5 years since we heard
anything about NRl, Rajan Kartha

758
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,498
- Da!
- What is it, da?

759
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:39,918
They are all his people
Send them away, quickly

760
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,379
l'm hungry, where's your bike?

761
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:49,845
Da?

762
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,347
Did you pay salary to your staff?

763
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,974
-Yes l did
- How did you manage?

764
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,142
Did you get a windfall?

765
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,270
You refused to loan me
So l sold you

766
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,313
How?

767
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,774
We got incriminating
footage ofthat DySP Benny

768
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,567
Some youngster shot it at some resort

769
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,570
l showed him the footage and
threatened him, mimicking you

770
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,404
Rs 3 lakhs

771
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,697
Stop!

772
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,909
- Stop!
- Don't punch me

773
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,453
Stop the bike!
Aiyo!

774
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,375
l'll kill you

775
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,172
Can't l use your name a bit?

776
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,300
This has a different name
You want to see...?

777
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,052
Will an action do?

778
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,473
- Have you gone away?
- l am here

779
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,062
l will use you also

780
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,399
Don't do that
l am not like that

781
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,442
What's happening?

782
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,652
Police!

783
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,779
Why are you dancing
in the middle ofthe night?

784
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,031
We were just exercising

785
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,118
Exercise? Middle ofthe night?
Put them both in thejeep

786
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,701
Wait!

787
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,620
l will come by myself

788
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,332
Do l have to repeat it to you?

789
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,793
You'll face consequences
ifyou lay your hands on me

790
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,797
Tomorrow, all channels will carry
your stupid face, as its cover story

791
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:11,802
Beware! You are playing games
with Reuters stinger Venu, got it?

792
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,723
You may be big people, but when you
play such public games, what shall we do?

793
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,725
Oh, so what shall we do?

794
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,436
Sir?

795
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,604
This is his usual drama

796
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,442
Any time police catch him
or gets into any other issue...

797
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,485
...he will immediately say
that he's big-wig of a channel

798
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,281
He's nothing ofthat sort
Does video coverage, ofweddings

799
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:36,869
Da!

800
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,579
l will come

801
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,500
Walk quickly, man!

802
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,753
Come in

803
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,338
Move aside!

804
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,635
Francis! Get their bikes
to the police station

805
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,555
Put in a liter of petrol also, okay?

806
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,312
Get up, l say

807
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,315
Get up

808
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,232
What's happening?

809
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,525
This man is a nuisance

810
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,402
He brought the bench
from the veranda to sleep here

811
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,654
Lock me up
Or, l will sleep here

812
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,032
l always sleep at ten
after a glass of milk

813
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,575
Go

814
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,288
This is sheer menace and
l already wrote out the FlR!

815
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,333
lf you want to get out
get someone to bail you

816
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,585
We don't have anyone, sir
We are orphans

817
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,420
We are from the public orphanage

818
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,297
Sir?

819
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,508
Please switch on that fan

820
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,093
Do you hear him?
Switch on the fan

821
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,060
Who is it, middle ofthe night?!

822
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,523
lf it is anyone important
ask him to call tomorrow, l'm offto sleep

823
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,816
Hello, who is it?

824
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,155
lsn't this the number of Venu
stinger cameraman, of Reuters?

825
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,663
Who is it, sir?
ls it from the orphanage?

826
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:04,623
Hello?

827
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,712
l am advocate, Manilal
What is the case?

828
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:15,759
Counsel, it was a mistake
Please ask him to overlook this

829
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:19,846
My police pal, see what happens
when you confront me, at midnight?

830
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,348
- Did you see now?
- Heard now?

831
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,100
Thanks a lot

832
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:25,435
venu?

833
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,774
l've been trying you from
last evening but couldn't get through

834
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,067
Who are you?

835
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,695
l am advocate, Manilal
l have something to tell you

836
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,821
What is it?

837
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,489
lt's about an exclusive

838
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,367
However important it is
l'll see you tomorrow...

839
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:43,036
...when l am fresh
Come let's go!

840
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:00,178
So tell me, what is this
exclusive, all about?

841
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:04,099
An exclusive like this won't ever occur
in the history of news channels again

842
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,560
A story that has
to be shot risking life

843
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:11,148
l've risked my life many times
Forget that, come to the point

844
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:15,611
l will, but before that, l want
a firm affirmation from you

845
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:20,824
This exclusive info was got
from a particular channel

846
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,243
The story has to be
covered, only forthem

847
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,289
Their reporterwill accompany you
Do you have any objections?

848
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,210
Once l disclose information
You can't go back on your word

849
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:37,424
Mr lawyer, l do follow certain ethics
lf l give my word, it is forever

850
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,550
So you agree?

851
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,093
Agreed

852
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:44,222
But l'll be the one to decide
what to do and how to do it

853
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,641
Okay, agreed

854
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:04,868
Now l come to the actual point
What you have to cover, is a murder

855
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:09,539
The murder planned, is on behalf
ofa well known politician of Kerala

856
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,588
Sorry! l cannot do this

857
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,507
Hey! venu!
Please!

858
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,509
A life is more important
than a piece of news

859
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,553
Since we have info,
we have to try and save him

860
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,391
lt may lessen the news value, but
ratings mustn't depend on blood spilt

861
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,101
venu, let me explain

862
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:41,446
lt's not my urge to make money
by 'live' coverage ofa man's death

863
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:46,368
He can't be saved by anyone
even if it's reported to the police

864
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:52,082
Because, Bharathan Pillai still dictates,
even though, he's not yet Chief Minister

865
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,335
- Bharathan Pillai?
-Yes

866
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,587
This murderwill
take place on his behalf

867
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:02,509
We can't prevent it, can't we at least
make sure the culprits don't escape?

868
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,473
Okay, so who is the victim?

869
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:12,227
A man in Bharathan Pillai's group
We don't know who orwhat...

870
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,478
What rubbish is this?

871
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:17,858
l can only assure you
this information is 100% genuine

872
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:25,699
Tell me the place, time and date and
who is the reporter, coming with me

873
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,409
Renu?

874
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:37,586
This woman?!

875
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:42,048
Find someone else!
Lawyer, drop me back!

876
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:47,929
venu, listen to me
You can't go, you agreed...

877
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:51,725
...l disclosed info because
you claimed to have ethics

878
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,852
Did you tell me before hand
this useless creature was coming?

879
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,395
You only said some reporter

880
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,776
Didn't l warn you to disclose info
only after telling him everything, Chey!

881
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:07,365
Think it's not Renuka, but a stranger
X orY, with a professional approach

882
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:13,038
l am totally professional! Such a riskyjob,
l need someone who gels with me

883
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,916
Petty personal issues
mustn't come in the way...

884
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,795
...ofthis exclusive with
such strong social impact

885
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,464
We don't have any option, but Renuka

886
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,261
venu, you can insist on
whatever conditions you want

887
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,722
Please

888
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:35,644
Please venu!

889
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:39,606
Okay

890
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:45,821
These are my conditions
l'll be the sole decision maker

891
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,366
Reporter X or Y is not allowed
to make any suggestions

892
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,201
Sure

893
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,497
A DSNG van, without any crew
must be at my disposal

894
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,541
Okay

895
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:03,713
visuals l 'UP' has to be aired, unedited
With no interference in it, whatsoever

896
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,632
Agreed

897
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,927
My remuneration alone, is Rs 10 lakh

898
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:14,766
- Here, it's got more than what you've asked
- Let it wait, there are more conditions

899
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,019
visuals must accompany
a scrolling script...

900
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,648
'visuals exclusively covered
by cameraman venu'

901
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,819
No intro or sign out by the reporter

902
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,237
Agreed

903
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:36,121
You have 12 hours to plan
and prepare, Renu knows the details

904
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:36,830
Okay

905
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,790
The baton has now
shifted into your hands

906
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,042
venu...Renu?
Shake hands on this

907
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,085
Not necessary!

908
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,588
What's this? You'll be
working together hereafter

909
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:45,547
Be professional

910
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,048
venu please?

911
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,647
Keep the cash in the car

912
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:07,235
You have neither an intro nor sign off
Why the hell are you tagging along?

913
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:12,282
Suppose you run away with the footage
as a revenge forthe old grouse?

914
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:16,661
There is only 1 creature on earth
who'd do such things, and that's you!

915
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:21,458
l forgot to tell you, DSNG receives
poor signal at the crime spot

916
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:25,003
Even if it did, we cannot
go there with the van, right?

917
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,046
Oh, you are right

918
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,965
Okay, now both of you
can chart out a plan

919
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:31,426
Not 'both' of us
Only me!

920
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,282
- Shall l suggest something?
- No!

921
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,201
- Listen first
- Not necessary

922
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,704
Don't get into a fervor
and try to save the victim

923
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,832
You must be so blood thirsty!
Cruel she-devil!

924
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,045
Murder will occur even if we interfere
and finally we'll become defendants

925
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,296
- Are you sure?
-very sure

926
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,967
Then l will surely interfere, l don't care
if l'm accused, you'll also go to jail

927
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:13,885
Come on, be serious

928
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,720
You want me
to be serious? Really?

929
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,723
lf l did, you'll be lying
in lCU, very serious

930
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,476
There are arrears
in plenty against you

931
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:25,855
No need to contribute, be quiet
and just allow me to do my stuff

932
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:27,857
To hell with you!

933
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:59,347
Lean back and sit without
touching me, especially your bust!

934
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,267
You dirty...chi!!!

935
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,746
Turn left

936
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,583
This is the club house

937
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,793
Here? ln such an open area?

938
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,170
Disputed property

939
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:33,631
Government acquired 15 years ago,
not even a watchman will be here

940
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,425
What time is this
crime scheduled for?

941
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,302
Between 8:00 and 9:00 PM

942
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,263
ls it a favorable time?
Like they fix in weddings?

943
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:24,576
Come here

944
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,003
Are you scared to be alone?
l am going up there

945
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,963
A little

946
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,631
Then wait right here

947
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,675
After some time,
your fear will increase

948
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,261
lfyou make a sound,
l'll kill you with one blow!

949
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:01,613
Hey!

950
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:02,780
What is it?

951
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:04,490
A rat!

952
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:09,579
Rat?! l'll stuff cloth down your throat!
Not a sound from you!

953
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:44,299
Don't scare me,
you she-devil!!!

954
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,176
How did you come up?

955
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,680
l too learnt martial art
Kalari, for 6-7 years

956
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,358
Look...a car

957
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:20,585
Let me go, don't kill me
l begged forgiveness at his feet

958
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,129
Take me to him

959
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:26,924
You are great man
Sirwill come to meet you here

960
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,940
Don't hurt me, please
Let me go

961
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,984
Leave me

962
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:47,695
Let me go

963
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,824
Don't harm me

964
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,834
Leave me, aiyo!

965
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,393
Don't harm me, sir
Didn't l confess everything?

966
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:22,730
Will your confessions
give me back, all what l lost?

967
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:28,111
My image, position, the days l spent
idle at home, since last 5 years

968
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:32,407
Suguna, to you, wasn't it
just an itch on your tongue?

969
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:39,122
When you betrayed us
to the channel you knew very well...

970
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:42,083
...it would cost me
and Kartha our political careers

971
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:46,921
Let me at least have
thejoy of deciding your end

972
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,340
Sir, don't kill me

973
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,073
Take him away and hang him

974
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:22,201
Hello, venu?

975
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,202

You have to 'UP' itwith

978
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:29,834
Okay

979
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:35,172
When you switch on, l'll go watch TV
in some place, any editing, remember...?!

980

l am going to that
restaurant to watch TV

Be right here, till l get back

987
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:20,259
A true and shocking incident
that occurred a few moments ago

988
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:26,515
Prompted us to air this special bulletin
Brutal visuals we have never seen before

Cruel revenge against party member Sugunan

My image, position, the days l spent

1003
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:07,575
- They must have shot it, hiding
- No dude, he shot it right from the front

1004
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:11,287
They wouldn't be alive
ifthey'd been caught by those thugs

1005
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,457
Sir, we are on ourway

We've sent ourforces

1014

Do it, kill me

1022
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:14,391
No need for police and courts
You have the right to punish me

1023
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:16,435
Before that, you have
to know certain truths

1024
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,603
You don't have
to say any darn thing!

1025
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,854
We saw everything on Tv

1026
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,857
Just answer the police
when they question you

1027
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:24,360
varghese!

1028
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,429
Look! There's the dead man!

1029
01:20:56,476 --> 01:21:00,020
Whatever l have to say
is here, for you to see, 'alive'

1030
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,940
lt was him, it seems
who l killed and then hanged

1031
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:06,443
What more can l say?!
Ask him whateveryou want

1032
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,738
Mr Suguna, what do you have to say?

1033
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:14,660
l don't know anything, l too saw it
on TV, Pillai sirwill tell you the rest

1034
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,662
Mr Pillai, what do you have to say?

1035
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:21,750
l don't understand why that girl
and cameraman have enmity to me

1036
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,045
l also have no idea
how they created such visuals

1037
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,672
l am not a technical expert

1038
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:30,467
You remember, 5 years ago
the same team hunted and...

1039
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,470
...pinned Kartha and me down
with a bribe charge, using visuals

1040
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:35,264
l couldn't prove anything then

1041
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,516
Break and destroy Bharath vision!
Come, dude!

1042
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,685
Damn his hidden camera!!

1043
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:44,773
Wait there! You can't go
after creating controversies

1044
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:47,735
Go, get into the van
without gaping, you idiot

1045
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:57,661
Don't let them go

1046
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:04,793
Come on, climb

1047
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,673
Abu! van!

1048
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:11,800
Move

1049
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:28,984
Burn it up!

1050
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:55,135
Turn right, we'll go to
Bharath vision

1051
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:56,762
Turn right
lt's safer there

1052
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:57,596
What?

1053
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:01,016
Turn right
We'll go to the studio

1054
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:03,227
Don't utter a word
What do we do at the studio?

1055
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,233
Move aside

1056
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:19,952
Where is he?
Come

1057
01:23:20,036 --> 01:23:22,997
l don't know what happened
The original footage...

1058
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:23,998
Enough! Stop

1059
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,791
- l wasjust talking to the home secretary
- Later

1060
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,461
- Let me discuss this with my legal advisor
- We'll get him to the police station, come

1061
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,589
Move aside!

1062
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:48,939
Get down!

1063
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,442
Today, some shocking visuals
ofa brutal murderthat stunned...

1064
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:54,611
...the conscience of Kerala
were aired by Bharath Vision

1065
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:58,991
But soon after that, within minutes
the man who was claimed to be killed...

1066
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:00,576
- l am venu
- Where are you?

1067
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:02,619
- Are you in your apartment?
- No, at the studio

1068
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:04,329
l am right beneath
your apartment

1069
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:05,664
Right below my apartment?!

1070
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:08,125
Don't you dare go there!
l'll kill the 2 ofyou

1071
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:11,420
You went to favor Bharath vision
Exclusive it seems!

1072
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,881
Go, take her also along
l can't do anything foryou

1073
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,674
Tell me where the keys are, vagabond!

1074
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,596
Only you can go in, not her

1075
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,432
l'll decide that, now tell me
where is the key, useless!

1076
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,393
On the window sill

1077
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:30,898
Don't open the door to anyone, l'll be
ruined if anyone knows you are in there

1078
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,778
Look, you don't broadcast this, okay?
l'll kill you, ifyou do!

1079
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,084
Get inside, you...!

1080
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,838
Oh Lord, am l fated to die
without a drop to drink?

1081
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:39,758
Protestors from Bharathan Pillai's house
were uncontrollable by the time...

1082
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:43,345
...they reached the Bharath Vision studios

1083
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:48,183
Police arrived and stopped them while
breaking the glass and trying to barge in...

1084
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,061
...and on charges of
telecasting false news

1085
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:56,024
...they arrested CEO
and 1 ofthe directors, Vijaykumar

1086
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,570
His granny's information!
He has to be kicked, the pig!

1087
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:03,282
lt was l who got the information
Not vijaykumar, sir

1088
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:04,700
What?

1089
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,912
lt was l who was informed

1090
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:11,081
Tell me, who gave the info to you

1091
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,378
Come on tell me

1092
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:17,546
Go on

1093
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,341
lt was the lawyer, Manilal

1094
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:27,723
So he was the one who betrayed, eh?

1095
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:29,474
He is innocent
l know very well

1096
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:31,435
Not innocent (actor)
ldavela Babu (actor)

1097
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:35,189
How can you trust him?
ls he God, or your dad?

1098
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:40,527
He's my cousin, all exclusive info
l've covered, were based on his tip-offs

1099
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:45,199
His info was always true
including the bribe case

1100
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:46,909
Manilal will not betray

1101
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,453
Pillai deserves a bouquet

1102
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:55,209
He retrieved all he'd lost on a single night
At the same time, made us go into hiding

1103
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:56,627
Yes, now l can hear

1104
01:26:56,794 --> 01:27:01,256
Mr Bharathan Pillai, the incident at
the club house being proved false...

1105
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:04,259
...are you now claiming that
the bribe case charged on you

1106
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:07,888
...and Kartha 5 years back
was totally baseless?

1107
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:09,723
Didn't the truth
come out by itself?

1108
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:12,976
Now let the central committee
decide what l should do

1109
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:16,313
l've suffered for 5 years, in spite of
not having committed a single crime

1110
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:20,359
The people and party members
who rejected me then, are now with me

1111
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:23,779
l'm sure the central
committee will realize this

1112
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:26,240
Thank you

1113
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:33,330
High hopes! l didn't hang that fellow
to get an award for good behavior

1114
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,165
Let them bring it back
All what they took away

1115
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:39,878
The 2 ofthem are in a pathetic state
Must be hiding, not knowing what to do

1116
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,506
Renuka along with camera man venu

1117
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:45,467
Dude, this is simple straight math

1118
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:49,054
Anyone with an ounce of brains
can decipher this move, let alone venu

1119
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:52,891
The credibility he'd destroyed
l managed to get back

1120
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:59,564
Now to ruin theirtrust and careers
l'm taking the same route, a silent chase

1121
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:05,570
Sir, but isn't there a risk?
Will he not come after you again?

1122
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,699
Of course he will
But not immediately, varghese

1123
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,910
They will not get out
until this noise dies down

1124
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:14,955
l too gain time that way,
because by then...

1125
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:17,249
...l'll occupy the chief minister's chair

1126
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:18,917
Let them come after that

1127
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:32,723
- Here, use onions
- l don't want your onions

1128
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,950
Don't show your craving

1129
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,619
- l never asked
- l won't give, even ifyou ask

1130
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:55,829
Shhhh!

1131
01:28:58,541 --> 01:28:59,708
Someone's knocking

1132
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:04,546
Some one's outside

1133
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:05,589
Sure, there is someone

1134
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,740
Greedy devil!

1135
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,291
Thanks

1136
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:07,150
Ask them to come in

1137
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:24,668
Burn it all up, dude!

1138
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,674
Sir, this is venu's l-Pad
All the visuals are in this

1139
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:32,300
So we've got all
the original footage

1140
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:33,427
-Yes sir
- Good!

1141
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:35,303
Settle their accounts

1142
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,559
Having been proved
that the visuals were false...

1143
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:43,270
Police have charged a case
against Venu and Renuka

1144
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:46,648
And they are on the lookoutto find them
The sooner they are...

1145
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:47,774
Switch it off, l say!

1146
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:50,026
Says the city police commissioner

1147
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,112
What do we do now?

1148
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,906
Think! lfyou get
a brainwave, tell me

1149
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,284
We need to know
the legal consequences

1150
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:58,952
Shall l call Manilal?

1151
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:00,912
Who am l, to ask permission?
Your husband?

1152
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:06,168
My phone was lost in that DSNG van
lfyou give me your phone, l'll call him

1153
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:11,465
Call him with the speaker phone
switched on

1154
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,425
l want to hearwhat he says

1155
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:14,050
Okay

1156
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:15,552
Don't tell him about this place

1157
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,057
Stand near me and call

1158
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:25,937
Hello?

1159
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,481
Mani, it's me Renu

1160
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:29,483
Where were you?

1161
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:32,319
Couldn't you call?
l was so worried

1162
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:36,114
Don't ever be caught
by the party men or police

1163
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:37,824
All ofthem are in a frenzy

1164
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:40,035
Tell me, what can
happen to us, at the most?

1165
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:41,661
lfyou are caught
it will be a big problem

1166
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:45,373
Once arrested, you won't
get bail for 40 days

1167
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:52,339
l'll tell you a way out, because
l'm concerned about you

1168
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,092
The 1st one, who's caught
gets 40 days in lock-up

1169
01:31:56,344 --> 01:32:00,472
When the 2nd person surrenders,
it'll be forjust 1or 2 days

1170
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,016
You will surely
get bail, being a woman

1171
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:06,770
Why take a risk?
Get him caught somehow

1172
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:09,231
Tell me the place,
l'll take care ofthe rest

1173
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:17,822
Don't glare at me, he likes me
He must've said that, to save me

1174
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:19,366
Your Mani...l'll...!

1175
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:22,536
You and your people
are all ofthe same kind, cheats!

1176
01:32:23,829 --> 01:32:26,498
Didn't you move away
from me, to talk in secret?

1177
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,202
l've been told the FlR
has not yet been written

1178
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:05,036
Yes

1179
01:33:05,204 --> 01:33:08,373
Tell me, you want to be
defendant or a witness?

1180
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:11,376
There's not much time
isn't it, Anthony?

1181
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,210
Yes, sir

1182
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:18,258
Let's say, you trusted Renuka
and aired the visuals from Bharath vision

1183
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:24,848
You neither knew anything nor
did you entrustvenu this job, that's all

1184
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:31,313
Bharatha vision can continue
functioning as usual from tomorrow

1185
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:32,480
What do you say?

1186
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:37,694
Where are they?
venu and Renuka?

1187
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,738
They are on the run
Don't you know?

1188
01:33:40,656 --> 01:33:42,240
We have decided
not to run after them

1189
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:45,910
Sorry sir, but l'm running afterthem

1190
01:33:47,705 --> 01:33:51,583
Was it for this show-down
he was brought to the police club?

1191
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,335
No sir, the commissioner
wanted to question...

1192
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:54,252
- No!
- Sir!

1193
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,133
You never asked me
why l was running afterthem?!

1194
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,803
l have my doubts, as to why
they wanted to create a footage...

1195
01:34:03,846 --> 01:34:07,098
...ofa man being killed
when he actually was not

1196
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,809
So l thought l'll ask them directly

1197
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:10,769
Benny

1198
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:17,067
You must find them, quickly
Time is running out, for me and you!

1199
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:24,658
You heard that?

1200
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:29,371
Today's 10:00 PM news
has to be neutral

1201
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:34,042
But stress on, Renuka's thirst
for exclusivity and popularity

1202
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:34,584
Okay, sir

1203
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:38,129
And venu, just a camera man
who covered, what she asked him to

1204
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:41,341
See that you protect him
lf possible, we'll drop a bombshell

1205
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,801
An exclusive interview with venu

1206
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:44,177
ls it to be here, in the studio?

1207
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:48,139
You...! Go get your text
ready for the evening news!

1208
01:34:48,557 --> 01:34:50,016
Go, all ofyou

1209
01:34:50,559 --> 01:34:52,686
Dumbo! But not when
he doesn't get his pay!

1210
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:55,146
SP Somarajan sir is calling

1211
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:56,648
Sir?

1212
01:34:56,691 --> 01:35:02,070
Rishi, Police may raid your studio
Their intention is to catch venu

1213
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,739
Come, we have work to do

1214
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:18,712
lfthey begin to shoot
take away the camera

1215
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:21,297
Return it only after
removing the footage

1216
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:26,386
- lndhu, is the sound ready?
- Ready

1217
01:35:26,512 --> 01:35:27,637
vCR must be in position

1218
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,347
Only the indicator must be seen

1219
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:35,437
Don't allow anyone to enter or exit

1220
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:36,604
What is it, sir?

1221
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:38,815
- Where is venu?
- Which venu?

1222
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:40,275
How many venu-s do you know?

1223
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:41,818
lndhu?

1224
01:35:42,194 --> 01:35:43,528

1225
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:47,115
What is the problem, sir?
Don't harass him, innocent chap!

01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:50,577
Sir, there's venu

1227
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:53,455
What is it sir?

1228
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:54,122
This...!!!

1229
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:56,708
What is it, sir?

1230
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:00,378
Are you making fun of me?
Where is he buddy, the Reuters stinger?

1231
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:03,548
Why would he be here?
He must be at Bharath vision studio

1232
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:07,886
Don't play your games with me
l'll deal with you good and proper

1233
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:10,680
Tell me! You must know
His 1 and only friend, right?

1234
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:14,350
Sir, leave his collar
Look, it's going on 'live'

1235
01:36:14,393 --> 01:36:15,226
Live?

1236
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:25,361
Mr Rishikesh, as a responsible channel head
shouldn't you be helping the police?

1237
01:36:25,404 --> 01:36:28,114
Get lost, you useless!!!
Sure, l'll help you catch him, you...!!!

1238
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:31,117
How can you behave like this?

1239
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,911
Sudhi, cut Rishi's audio

1240
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,289
Now onwards it will be
a shower ofswearwords!

1241
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:40,126
Ouch!

1242
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:53,932
Okay, let me know ifyou get info
This is my number, here

1243
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:56,059
Okay, see you then

1244
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:56,768
Sure

1245
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:59,979
Sir, watch out, these rascals might
put a camera even into our innerwear

1246
01:37:03,567 --> 01:37:05,276
lndhu, audio on

1247
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:15,370
The competition for exclusive news
may have put Renuka into thisjeopardy

1248
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:18,081
What you saw now, is how,
based on past events...

1249
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:20,708
...police are treating
the entire media community

1250
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:24,963
This is what DySP Benny Tharakan
wrote,just before he left the studio

1251
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:29,634
l'll deal with you outside, you dog!

1252
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:35,890
ln case you don't see me on this channel
you can conclude, l'm in police custody

1253
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:41,771
We are on to fresh info about
the telecasting offalse news issue

1254
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:46,025
The police who are on the look out
for Reuters stinger camera man Venu ...

1255
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:49,445
...in connection with the controversial
murderfootage, will join us on line now

1256
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:50,363
Hello venu?

1257
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:53,366
Sorry, ourtechnicians
will soon connect us

1258
01:37:56,745 --> 01:37:58,788
Hello?

1259
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,044
Venu?
Can you hear me?

1260
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:07,130
Send me at least
a bottle of brandy, you fool!

1261
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:09,966
Hello?

1262
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:15,096
l'm going insane, there's nothing
to booze, you miserly vagabond

1263
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:17,015
Hello

1264
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:19,809
- Can'tyou hear me?
- Yes, l can, tell me Venu

1265
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:21,895
What actually
happened that night?

1266
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:24,898
What else, itwasjust
a drama by that Pillai

1267
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:27,358
l must be kicked
in the butt for falling for that...!

1268
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:28,985
Hello, Venu?

1269
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,075
You vagabond!

1270
01:38:36,702 --> 01:38:38,995
ln this situation
what have you got to say?

1271
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:43,541
There are unscrupulous fellows
amongst us, who use personal phone calls ...

1272
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,461
...ofeven their closest pals
for exclusivity

1273
01:38:46,545 --> 01:38:50,173
lfthat attitude changes
we can be free of such issues

1274
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,425
Thank you, MrVenu

1275
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,053
A short break before
we move on to othertopics

1276
01:39:06,148 --> 01:39:08,316
Sir, Kakkanad, Skyline apartments

1277
01:39:12,404 --> 01:39:15,490
Sir, we've traced his hide out
Skyline apartments, at Kakkanad

1278
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:16,032
very good

1279
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:18,034
But we couldn't trace
the floor he occupies

1280
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:22,205
We'll enquire if any media person
resides there and search that first

1281
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:38,304
Da! l've favors saved up, to return to you!
You sold me, on 1st chance you got, right?

1282
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:41,015
Forget it, your phone call
was traced and police have located you

1283
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:44,185
Somaraj sir informed me, they'll be
there right now, so go away from there

1284
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:45,853
Where will l go at this time of the night?

1285
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,982
Just move from there for the time being
l'll find another place and call you

1286
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,302
Where are you going?

1287
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,681
Police have traced us here
They'll be here at any moment

1288
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:22,682
Oh Lord!

1289
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:25,476
One minute, l'll go
to the john and come

1290
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,450
l can't bear it any more

1291
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:23,451
What?

1292
01:41:24,036 --> 01:41:25,286
Please stop!

1293
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:26,788
What for?

1294
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:30,666
What?
What is it?

1295
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:32,919
l want to pee

1296
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:36,714
Oh! This will be our ruin!
Couldn't you finish it at the apartment?

1297
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:39,425
You locked the door and
took off before l could, didn't you?

1298
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:45,473
Get off

1299
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:51,729
Please

1300
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:26,764
Chey! That was an ambulance

1301
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,308
Where is the bike's key, you...!?

1302
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:31,018
Here

1303
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:32,603
You were trying
to get me caught, right?

1304
01:42:33,897 --> 01:42:35,815
l did that, so you
wouldn't leave me and go

1305
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:39,652
You cheat! Don't lie
l know...you didn't go to pee

1306
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:40,778
Chey! Get lost da!

1307
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:41,821
You dare say,
'get lost, da' to me?

1308
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,115
Didn't you start the bike
to go off and let me get caught?

1309
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:46,492
l thought l'll be ready
by the time you come back

1310
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,161
Why did you lock me up in the flat?

1311
01:42:48,453 --> 01:42:50,371
So what? Yes l did!!!
To trap you, now what about it?

1312
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,331
Sure, l too did the same

1313
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:04,302
One of us must give ourselves up
We can't live like fugitives, under pressure

1314
01:43:04,386 --> 01:43:07,013
l am not giving myself up
without finding a solution to this

1315
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:10,433
Then drop me at
the police station and go

1316
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:12,351
Don't start being sentimental, okay?

1317
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:16,147
Sentiments?! Sure l don't have any
Remember? Only popularity mania, right?

1318
01:43:16,231 --> 01:43:18,691
Look, no flashbacks, okay?
Pouring oil on troubled waters!

1319
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:21,611
You are a reporter, me, a camera man
That's all, now get on the bike

1320
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:25,114
Unless this is solved
we are not surrendering

1321
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:30,912
A hideout is ready, take the 1st left
afterthe Alpuzha Nedumudi bridge

1322
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:34,624
After about, 1.5 km
you'll see a wooden gate

1323
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:36,751
l'll be there, with Abu

1324
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:37,627
Okay

1325
01:43:38,503 --> 01:43:39,337
Who was it?

1326
01:43:40,839 --> 01:43:41,547
Rishi

1327
01:44:14,164 --> 01:44:14,914
Hi

1328
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:24,257
Come dude, this summer house
belongs to a friend, he's in the USA

1329
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:25,299
Come

1330
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:41,983
l'll come back
tomorrow morning

1331
01:44:42,484 --> 01:44:42,942
What?

1332
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:45,695
l'll be here in the morning
with clothes and a hearing aid

1333
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:48,030
Buy all newspapers
you can lay hands on

1334
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:50,616
l have news foryou

1335
01:44:51,493 --> 01:44:53,327
Bharath vision has
denounced both ofyou

1336
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,621
vijaykumar presented it
on the late night report

1337
01:44:55,747 --> 01:44:57,290
Tell this to hertomorrow

1338
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,542
- lt's not over
- What else?

1339
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:05,089
News from Delhi, yourjob
at Reuters has been terminated

1340
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:09,802
What else?

1341
01:45:10,053 --> 01:45:11,971
Nothing much

1342
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:16,475
Bharathan Pillai is being
considered for CM post

1343
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:21,564
The central committee is meeting
Swearing in may happen soon

1344
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,943
- Okay
- See you, dude

1345
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:37,455
Abu
These clothes are for them

1346
01:45:37,873 --> 01:45:40,541
Da, give me those newspapers

1347
01:45:43,503 --> 01:45:46,213
- These are clothes for both ofyou
- Thank you

1348
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:52,303
Here's your hearing aid

1349
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:16,702
Rishi, the original footage
is missing from the DSNG van

1350
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:19,872
Without that
how can we prove the truth?

1351
01:46:20,248 --> 01:46:23,334
That's how they planned it
The screen play was fool-proof

1352
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:28,756
From the time we passed info
to the restaurant drama, a neat script!

1353
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:31,467
Written and directed
by Bharathan Pillai

1354
01:46:31,843 --> 01:46:35,221
lfso, Rajan Kartha
must be the producer

1355
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:38,599
He's here in Kochi
since the last few days

1356
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:41,394
Almost from the day
you came from Delhi

1357
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:46,065
Didn't you say, swearing in
ofthe CM will happen shortly?

1358
01:46:46,775 --> 01:46:48,526
We have time
only till then, Rishi

1359
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,863
Now Sugunan must be
made to talk, isn't it?

1360
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:53,781
Yes

1361
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:00,663
Ouch!

1362
01:47:00,872 --> 01:47:01,622
Oh mother!

1363
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:14,427
What happened?

1364
01:47:15,554 --> 01:47:17,638
He hit me and took off
Some rascal!

1365
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:20,307
Aw, my hand

1366
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:21,851
Hey! Aren't you Sugunan sir?

1367
01:47:21,935 --> 01:47:24,395
Just give me a hand, brother
Let's go to the hospital

1368
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:26,522
- Ouch my hand!
- Gently, take care

1369
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:36,574
- ls it still paining?
- No, it's better now

1370
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:41,412
Siryou are very smartly dressed
Don't you wear Khadi usually?

1371
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:45,666
lt is to avoid Tv
Nuisance!

1372
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:53,466
Look! That's the vehicle that hit me

1373
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,718
Really?!
l'll find out right now

1374
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:00,639
Don't step out, you'll be recognized
l'll go find out

1375
01:48:05,353 --> 01:48:08,647
- What's all this?
- Exactly what we also want to know!

1376
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:14,612
1st die, then come alive
Are you the Lasser of modern times?

1377
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:17,323
1st let him get over his shock
Then he'll talk, our Sugunan-Lasser

1378
01:48:17,365 --> 01:48:18,199
Okay

1379
01:48:34,716 --> 01:48:36,842
We saw you being killed

1380
01:48:36,885 --> 01:48:39,762
We showed it to the public also
No confusion about this at all!

1381
01:48:40,138 --> 01:48:42,306
But after some time
you reappeared alive

1382
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,433
- Public became confused
- And so did we

1383
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:48,145
We are not going to clearthat
We are going to increase it

1384
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:52,316
On the same place and rope
you will swing, hanging dead

1385
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:55,528
We'll shoot it very smartly
and show it to the public

1386
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,447
The public will go mad
What must they believe?

1387
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:01,116
l swear, l have not done
anything intentionally

1388
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:04,453
l really thought
they were going to kill me

1389
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:12,670
l did tell Manilal, about the bribe
You guys flashed it, as hot news

1390
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:17,132
lt was only recently Pillai sir
came to know it was l who had informed

1391
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:24,348
l fell at his feet, cried begging his pardon
He asked me to pass 1 more info to Manilal

1392
01:49:25,016 --> 01:49:27,977
That a murder would happen,
on behalf of Pillai sir

1393
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:31,188
After l did that,
he asked me to leave

1394
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:34,275
But the next day...

1395
01:49:42,367 --> 01:49:45,244
Sugana, come with me
Bharathan Pillai sir, is asking foryou

1396
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:50,332
Hello, take this

1397
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:55,254
What is it, sir?

1398
01:50:06,891 --> 01:50:08,559
What are you doing?

1399
01:50:10,061 --> 01:50:10,894
Leave me

1400
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:12,021
What is it, sir

1401
01:50:13,815 --> 01:50:14,690
Stop it!

1402
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:16,567
Don't harm me

1403
01:50:16,818 --> 01:50:18,193
Didn't l confess everything, sir?

1404
01:50:18,987 --> 01:50:22,489
Confession to the holy person
in a church will do you good

1405
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:26,660
But what's inside my chest
is not a holy heart, Suguna

1406
01:50:36,379 --> 01:50:38,213
- Ready, sir
- Lift him now

1407
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,138
How is it?
lsn't it okay?

1408
01:50:52,812 --> 01:50:54,229
Leave me, l say

1409
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:11,622
Go, hang him!

1410
01:51:26,429 --> 01:51:28,931
Afteryou left
they returned

1411
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:40,025
Shibu, this is an antidote
Make him inhale it, he'll wake up

1412
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,740
They took me
to Pillai sir's house

1413
01:51:47,742 --> 01:51:51,328
When people turned nasty
He asked me to come out

1414
01:51:54,582 --> 01:51:57,292
l was only a dupe sir, a dupe of
the person who was to be, actually killed

1415
01:51:57,377 --> 01:51:58,127
Dupe?

1416
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:04,508
ln that club house
there will be an actual murder

1417
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:06,844
ln the same place
almost in the same manner

1418
01:52:06,886 --> 01:52:10,139
Who?
Who will it be?

1419
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:11,890
l don't know, sir

1420
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:18,021
But l know for sure
it's on the 12th night

1421
01:52:20,358 --> 01:52:21,525
How do you know this?

1422
01:52:21,901 --> 01:52:25,362
l heard Pillai sir's assistant
varghese, tell my captors...

1423
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,490
...that they must leave the club house
as soon as the deed was done

1424
01:52:28,658 --> 01:52:33,078
That their tickets have been booked
forthe 2:00 AM train, on13th morning

1425
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:37,040
That they should return, only after
Pillai sir, was sworn in, as Chief Minister

1426
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:43,839
Abu, go drop Suguna
at the nearest hospital

1427
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:49,136
- Do you know who's going to die?
- No

1428
01:52:49,304 --> 01:52:50,721
lt's you

1429
01:52:51,139 --> 01:52:54,141
Pillai wants to frame us
with that crime

1430
01:52:54,976 --> 01:52:58,896
Don't try to run and escape
Even ifyou try, they won't allow you

1431
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:00,981
Remember, we haven't met

1432
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:04,276
We'll be there on the 12th
We want to shoot that event

1433
01:53:04,903 --> 01:53:07,362
Go, don't be scared
Nothing will happen to you

1434
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:08,447
- Abu
-Yes, sir

1435
01:53:12,118 --> 01:53:15,621
Here, ask that lawyer Manilal
to meet me before noon tomorrow

1436
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,289
He started all this, right?

1437
01:53:23,421 --> 01:53:25,839
Mani, l have to see you urgently
Come tomorrow afternoon

1438
01:53:25,924 --> 01:53:27,925
- What is it?
- l'll tell you

1439
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:31,804
We've found a way out ofthis mess
You have to stand by us

1440
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:32,721
Sure

1441
01:53:33,723 --> 01:53:35,307
- What did you think?
- Poor fellow

1442
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:36,975
Yes

1443
01:53:37,435 --> 01:53:41,271
He's a great actor, noticed his tears
without a drop of glycerin? Cheat!

1444
01:53:41,439 --> 01:53:44,233
We did not get him, dude
Pillai threw him at us, a bait

1445
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,317
What are you saying?

1446
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:48,111
lt's the next scene in
Pillai's frivolous drama

1447
01:53:48,988 --> 01:53:55,828
Believing his story, Renuka and l will
go on 12th, to shoot the original murder

1448
01:53:56,246 --> 01:54:01,041
Pillai, Kartha and their boys will wait
Because it is we who are going to die

1449
01:54:01,459 --> 01:54:02,584
Simple

1450
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:05,587
Gosh! This is getting
more and more complicated

1451
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:12,970
lfwe remain free, they are clueless
as to the extent we'd go, to prove the truth

1452
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:17,474
So we have to be
eliminated forever

1453
01:54:17,725 --> 01:54:22,271
They will make us, fugitives forever
Police, government and the media

1454
01:54:22,438 --> 01:54:26,358
We have no option but to go
to their butcher shop on 12th

1455
01:54:27,026 --> 01:54:30,112
This is a trap for us, as well
as our only way to escape

1456
01:54:30,572 --> 01:54:36,118
lfwe win, we can regain all we lost
As well as ensure, Pillai's political funeral

1457
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,454
- lfyou lose?
- Death

1458
01:54:40,665 --> 01:54:43,667
Like your usage, 'it seems'
they committed suicide

1459
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:53,552
On 12th we are shooting
the incident, whatever the risk

1460
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:56,179
Look at the irony of it

1461
01:54:56,264 --> 01:54:59,558
However priceless, this exclusive
we shoot now is, no channel will air it!

1462
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:01,059
Except for his NBl

1463
01:55:01,102 --> 01:55:02,978
Ours is a small channel...

1464
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:06,189
...ifyou intend giving it to some
gigantic one, please let me know

1465
01:55:06,816 --> 01:55:09,234
We don't have to trouble
ourselves unnecessarily

1466
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:13,238
Only l will be going, to shoot this

1467
01:55:13,656 --> 01:55:14,907
What if l come?

1468
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:18,285
You want to sign-out, as usual
Just forthat, you needn't come

1469
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:21,038
This is an issue
involving my credibility

1470
01:55:21,748 --> 01:55:24,499
l will come!
Whoever objects, l'll come!

1471
01:55:27,003 --> 01:55:28,587
Go, let me plan this out

1472
01:55:44,395 --> 01:55:47,689
l have been tolerating
innuendos for last 3-4 days

1473
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:50,901
l don't want considerations
Nor do l even expect it

1474
01:55:51,027 --> 01:55:52,194
You don't deserve it also

1475
01:55:53,488 --> 01:55:55,364
l don't need to
convince you ofthat

1476
01:55:56,074 --> 01:55:59,701
The 1 who was supposed to be
convinced, has never come forward

1477
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:01,620
l am not interested
in a reconciliation talk

1478
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:02,371
Me too

1479
01:56:02,413 --> 01:56:03,038
Then?

1480
01:56:03,164 --> 01:56:05,123
This is a social issue
which involves me too

1481
01:56:05,249 --> 01:56:07,167
l cannot stay away
whateveryou say

1482
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,336
This is to make you
stay away from death, you...!

1483
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,716
After all, he did have you
in his heart, for some time

1484
01:56:15,134 --> 01:56:17,594
He is now going
into the arena of death

1485
01:56:18,262 --> 01:56:22,474
- What?
- Nothing

1486
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:27,187
Tell me, Rishi
What is happening?

1487
01:56:28,064 --> 01:56:31,400
lt's not Sugunan, who will die
lt will be you and venu

1488
01:56:38,616 --> 01:56:39,950
Do you really want to go now?

1489
01:56:43,037 --> 01:56:46,957
lf l don't go after knowing this
l won't exist anymore, Rishi

1490
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:55,382
l thought we had time, that when
l get a chance, l could explain

1491
01:56:55,758 --> 01:56:59,970
l expected such a chance, when
l set out with him on this venture

1492
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:02,764
Since that is no longer a surety...

1493
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:05,892
l'll tell you the truth,
l never betrayed you

1494
01:57:09,772 --> 01:57:13,233
That day, fearing the police
when venu sent me off in the van

1495
01:57:15,945 --> 01:57:20,115
l was on my way
to our...sorry, yourstudio

1496
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:21,658
But...

1497
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:25,871
Abu make it fast, its already 9:15 PM
lt has to be edited and aired by 10:00 PM

1498
01:57:25,913 --> 01:57:28,957
Renu, be assured
l'll reach you there in 15 minutes

1499
01:57:42,346 --> 01:57:45,557
Mani! Success! l'm on my way
to the studio with the footage

1500
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:48,185
Renu l know, l was there nearby

1501
01:57:48,728 --> 01:57:51,897
lt's all a mess now and venu
has been caught by the police

1502
01:57:51,981 --> 01:57:54,191
Now, they'll soon be after you

1503
01:57:54,776 --> 01:57:56,359
Aiyo!
Oh God!

1504
01:57:56,402 --> 01:58:03,909
l am right behind you, a black lnnova
Stop and get into my car, that will be safer

1505
01:58:04,035 --> 01:58:06,411
- Abu, stop here
- Renu, time is...?

1506
01:58:06,496 --> 01:58:07,662
Abu, just stop!

1507
01:58:15,254 --> 01:58:16,505
Get in, quick!

1508
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:24,513
Mani quickly, it has to be
aired at 10:00 PM

1509
01:58:32,396 --> 01:58:35,607
Be on Bharath vision's pay roll
and get the story for NBl Channel, eh?

1510
01:58:35,691 --> 01:58:39,486
But l am no longeryourstaff
l resigned 5 days back

1511
01:58:39,529 --> 01:58:43,448
We've not got any such resignation
And even if there is, l've not accepted it

1512
01:58:44,325 --> 01:58:46,034
Mani, stop! l want to get out

1513
01:58:46,077 --> 01:58:51,289
He will not, because if he does
this footage will go to Bharathan Pillai

1514
01:58:51,332 --> 01:58:52,707
Drive us to the studio, dude!

1515
01:58:54,043 --> 01:58:57,921
He has taken Rs 2 lakhs
from us for this story

1516
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:03,343
How can this become
NBl's launch story?

1517
01:59:03,386 --> 01:59:07,139
My mistake sir, l didn't know
she had committed to NBl

1518
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:10,976
l will return that money
today itself...sir, please!

1519
01:59:11,018 --> 01:59:13,270
That's all over
Nothing more to discuss

1520
01:59:13,354 --> 01:59:14,271
Sir, but...

1521
01:59:14,313 --> 01:59:15,564
lt's not money alone

1522
01:59:15,606 --> 01:59:22,320
Once you did this story, he'd bargained
and fixed senior editor's post for you

1523
01:59:22,363 --> 01:59:25,240
Mani, l don't want any post
Get me that footage back

1524
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:30,829
This will come only in NBl

1525
01:59:31,622 --> 01:59:32,956
lt will not

1526
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:36,543
lt can come in any other
channel, but never NBl

1527
01:59:36,627 --> 01:59:40,046
l am sitting in the chair
Rishi discarded and left

1528
01:59:40,131 --> 01:59:46,219
How can l let this explosive
story, be launched by Rishi?

1529
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:51,474
Mani, for them it's channel war
To me it's a question of trust and my life

1530
01:59:51,601 --> 01:59:55,103
Mani please, tomorrow
venu and l are getting married

1531
01:59:55,438 --> 01:59:56,605
Sir, please!

1532
01:59:56,647 --> 01:59:58,481
You don't talk anymore

1533
01:59:59,775 --> 02:00:02,903
l will not air this
without your permission

1534
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:07,699
But l'll use this to
make sure NBl is not born

1535
02:00:08,284 --> 02:00:11,870
Simple, l'll just hand this overto Pillai

1536
02:00:13,748 --> 02:00:18,752
NBl will remain, a dream to Rishi
And venu is in police custody

1537
02:00:19,253 --> 02:00:22,505
l won't be able to even guess
in what state, he will return

1538
02:00:22,924 --> 02:00:27,135
You have time till
Pillai attends this call

1539
02:00:28,262 --> 02:00:31,598
Sir, no
l beg you

1540
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:34,184
Sir, it's her future
that will be affected

1541
02:00:34,685 --> 02:00:37,520
- Hello?
- ls it Bharathan Pillai?

1542
02:00:37,813 --> 02:00:39,314
Yes

1543
02:00:40,316 --> 02:00:40,941
Sir...

1544
02:00:47,031 --> 02:00:49,491
l became 'all alone
in one single night'

1545
02:00:50,326 --> 02:00:57,958
With nothing left, l had only
Bharath vision, as an option for survival

1546
02:01:00,586 --> 02:01:03,213
Renu, 5 years you have...

1547
02:01:04,966 --> 02:01:05,757
Oh God!

1548
02:01:06,968 --> 02:01:09,928
-venu must be told...
- Don't, Rishi

1549
02:01:10,221 --> 02:01:13,515
He must not know this now
He won't take me along otherwise

1550
02:01:14,392 --> 02:01:18,520
l know his concern, for people
he cares for, please don't tell him

1551
02:01:20,564 --> 02:01:21,648
Okay, l won't

1552
02:01:45,172 --> 02:01:46,881
What is that secret meet there?

1553
02:01:46,966 --> 02:01:48,925
Will that she-devil
betray us, in this also?

1554
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:51,386
Da! Don't be so mean

1555
02:01:52,847 --> 02:01:55,515
Are you on her side or mine?

1556
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:59,311
This is why we say
you should also be there

1557
02:01:59,687 --> 02:02:03,064
Your cousin is risking
her life for this

1558
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:05,400
Convince her not to,
she refuses to listen to me

1559
02:02:05,443 --> 02:02:06,651
venu, is there
some other way out?

1560
02:02:06,694 --> 02:02:07,736
You tell us

1561
02:02:07,778 --> 02:02:09,529
Mani, let venu explain

1562
02:02:10,364 --> 02:02:12,907
Today is the 10th
Day after tomorrow, it is12th

1563
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:17,495
Only ifwe convincingly shoot
our act, that we are going to die...

1564
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:20,081
...Pillai and Kartha's
intentions can be proved

1565
02:02:20,666 --> 02:02:22,292
But how and who will shoot this?

1566
02:02:22,668 --> 02:02:25,962
lt's impossible to shoot in
the club house or surroundings

1567
02:02:26,047 --> 02:02:26,796
Then?

1568
02:02:27,548 --> 02:02:28,506
Come, l'll explain

1569
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,261
500 meters away, that is
halfa kilometer away, on top...

1570
02:02:33,346 --> 02:02:37,098
...ofthe pavilion, cameras with
telescopic lenses, will be set up

1571
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:39,517
Rishi's camera crew
will operate them

1572
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:45,065
Pretending to cover Sugunan's murder
we will reach the club house, on 12th night

1573
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:47,275
We'll get surrounded by them
and a little struggle will ensue

1574
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:50,904
A little action sequence by me
And finally, we get caught

1575
02:02:51,238 --> 02:02:54,532
lf Kartha comes, we can
expect a cinema style dialog

1576
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:56,451
l'll have a voice recorder in my pocket

1577
02:02:56,535 --> 02:02:59,454
After shooting what we want
you and Abu should interfere

1578
02:02:59,497 --> 02:03:01,664
Don't delay my friend,
orwe'll never come out alive!

1579
02:03:01,832 --> 02:03:02,707
l agree, sir

1580
02:03:03,376 --> 02:03:04,376
Can l tell you what l fear?

1581
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:06,669
Those who fear need not come
Didn't l warn you?

1582
02:03:06,712 --> 02:03:08,588
Let her tell her opinion

1583
02:03:10,424 --> 02:03:11,007
Yes, Renu?

1584
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:13,676
ln case we are not able
to pull this off, Pillai and Kartha...

1585
02:03:13,719 --> 02:03:17,097
...will escape for ever
We can't take a chance

1586
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:20,600
That is what l'm also coming to, silly

1587
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:26,106
- This will not be exclusive to NBl
- What?

1588
02:03:26,607 --> 02:03:30,402
We will allow 2 more channels
to shoot, without our involvement

1589
02:03:30,444 --> 02:03:31,611
That's why l asked,
Manilal also to come

1590
02:03:31,695 --> 02:03:32,779
Go climb a wall!!!

1591
02:03:32,863 --> 02:03:35,573
lt's impossible!
This is exclusive to NBl

1592
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:36,116
Dude?

1593
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:40,453
Don't say 'no'! l've pinned all my hopes
on this and planned a lot for its success

1594
02:03:40,621 --> 02:03:42,539
Does our friendship have
the value of, just an exclusive?

1595
02:03:42,581 --> 02:03:45,417
l have not gained anything
with this friendship, l've only lost

1596
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:51,840
- l will do this story alone, if not...
- lf not...?

1597
02:03:52,591 --> 02:03:55,176
lf not, don't expect
anything more from me

1598
02:03:59,014 --> 02:04:02,892
Then so be it!
You are not doing this story

1599
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:13,653
Abu! Start the vehicle

1600
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,446
Rishi!

1601
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:17,824
Didn't you hear me?

1602
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:20,326
You can take it yourself, sir

1603
02:04:23,539 --> 02:04:25,081
Rishi? Please!

1604
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:40,513
ls your father dead? Everybody
thinks only oftheir own benefits

1605
02:04:40,556 --> 02:04:44,851
This is not the 1st time
Abu can operate my camera

1606
02:04:45,019 --> 02:04:49,522
Lawyer Mani, 12th is day after tomorrow
Tomorrow we set up camera at the stadium

1607
02:04:49,607 --> 02:04:52,150
Fix up a couple of more
channels and let me know

1608
02:05:13,464 --> 02:05:19,636
Park it near the north ofthe stadium
When it gets dark, we'll be there

1609
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:04,889
Abu, don't wait, it'll take time
Come only when l call you

1610
02:06:04,932 --> 02:06:06,140
Okay, sir

1611
02:07:08,621 --> 02:07:11,623
- What is it?
- A mosquito

1612
02:07:12,207 --> 02:07:13,666
Mosquito?!

1613
02:07:40,527 --> 02:07:43,988
This is field limit, whatever happens
don't move away from this limit

1614
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:46,991
Find all possibilities and fix the limit

1615
02:08:14,061 --> 02:08:17,105
-venu, there's a car!
- l saw it too, you useless!

1616
02:08:43,549 --> 02:08:45,007
Bharathan Pillai!

1617
02:09:12,161 --> 02:09:15,496
Rishi has cheated us
lt's not what we thought, lets escape

1618
02:09:15,539 --> 02:09:16,497
Be quiet, girl!

1619
02:09:35,309 --> 02:09:39,187
venu, it will happen today!

1620
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:42,356
The camera is gone
Now what's the point?

1621
02:09:42,524 --> 02:09:45,067
Whatever happens
you won't die, enough?

1622
02:09:51,784 --> 02:09:54,869
Without getting into trouble
come with me, you shrew!

1623
02:10:15,432 --> 02:10:19,477
l was in a hurry to die sir
So, l came here today itself

1624
02:10:20,938 --> 02:10:25,691
There lies your camera, how will you
shoot and show it to the public now?

1625
02:10:51,301 --> 02:10:54,637
Call that lawyer
Call Manilal

1626
02:11:10,195 --> 02:11:11,362
Call that lawyer!

1627
02:11:51,236 --> 02:11:52,153
Don't!

1628
02:11:56,241 --> 02:11:59,201
Take it away, there mustn't be
even a small scratch on the body

1629
02:11:59,244 --> 02:12:03,706
They have to be hanged
Not murdered but as suicide

1630
02:12:05,167 --> 02:12:08,294
Why do you need a binocular
camera to shoot such a near event?

1631
02:12:08,378 --> 02:12:13,549
Not binoculars, a microscope
is enough for a worm like you

1632
02:13:31,586 --> 02:13:32,795
What are you glaring at?

1633
02:13:32,879 --> 02:13:36,215
Where are your contraptions
witnesses, 2-3 channels, etc?

1634
02:13:36,425 --> 02:13:40,511
People ready tojump to save you
from death, where the hell are they?

1635
02:13:40,929 --> 02:13:43,806
When you sent him away
l knew, you'd smelt trouble

1636
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:45,725
Stop lecturing and call that punk

1637
02:13:45,767 --> 02:13:49,145
Pillai waves from 1.5 KM away
and now hiding in the kitchen

1638
02:13:49,187 --> 02:13:50,146
l'll give you a sound sla-!

1639
02:14:05,912 --> 02:14:07,079
Why should l hide, venu?

1640
02:14:07,539 --> 02:14:08,831
lt's you who are still in hiding

1641
02:14:08,915 --> 02:14:12,334
venu, Manilal is trapped
l heard his phone ringing

1642
02:14:12,419 --> 02:14:13,586
He's here somewhere

1643
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:18,466
Lawyer, don't hide
Come into the arena, you pig

1644
02:14:19,843 --> 02:14:24,680
Come out! lt'll be awkward only
if have to see them, ever again

1645
02:14:33,148 --> 02:14:34,231
Son ofa mongrel!

1646
02:14:37,027 --> 02:14:42,198
l don't have any cinema dialog
l will go away after just 1, okay?

1647
02:14:42,532 --> 02:14:46,410
This is not revenge, if it was
l'd have had time, only for that in life

1648
02:14:47,204 --> 02:14:52,166
This is just a precaution!
Allow me to rule and live peacefully, dude

1649
02:14:52,209 --> 02:14:58,339
Taking cameras into people's bedroom,
bathroom and calling it media activism!

1650
02:14:58,715 --> 02:15:00,674
This is the only medicine
for all that, okay?

1651
02:15:00,801 --> 02:15:04,929
2 media persons who've lost
credibility and life, commit suicide

1652
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:06,555
Shall l hang them, sir?

1653
02:15:07,766 --> 02:15:10,476
Do you have anything to say?

1654
02:15:10,977 --> 02:15:18,150
l don't, but she has...a sign-off
After all we are going to die, right?

1655
02:15:19,486 --> 02:15:20,903
Go ahead!
Look somewhere and say it

1656
02:15:30,831 --> 02:15:35,501
From the place ofevents
this is Renuka with cameraman venu

1657
02:15:35,627 --> 02:15:36,961
More cameras?

1658
02:15:39,923 --> 02:15:44,718
lfthere are cameras here
ask your people to bash them up

1659
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:48,055
Don't panic, these are
last minute tactics to escape

1660
02:15:48,098 --> 02:15:49,098
Hang them both!

1661
02:15:58,441 --> 02:15:59,441
Freeze!

1662
02:16:20,839 --> 02:16:23,424
- Are we on time?
- Perfectly on time!

1663
02:16:28,013 --> 02:16:30,306
What other contraptions
do you want to see?

1664
02:16:30,849 --> 02:16:33,642
Open your eyes wide and look!

1665
02:16:34,144 --> 02:16:35,144
Lights on!

1666
02:16:36,646 --> 02:16:38,272
See, how many cameras!

1667
02:16:49,075 --> 02:16:51,368
No other channel
Only NBl

1668
02:16:52,412 --> 02:16:54,997
Because, this is
an exclusive for his channel

1669
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:00,085
Arrest them

1670
02:17:00,337 --> 02:17:03,631
Lawyer, when Rishi stormed off
angrily, what did you think?

1671
02:17:03,715 --> 02:17:04,924
Thatwe had parted ways?

1672
02:17:05,383 --> 02:17:08,344
He had ajob here
which needed 24 hrs

1673
02:17:10,222 --> 02:17:13,182
When l learnt that itwas you
who had fixed up a story for her...

1674
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:16,936
...at Bharath vision, l knew
it was you, who was their pimp

1675
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:26,487
You want to give him a couple?
You can't, once we are out of here

1676
02:17:26,613 --> 02:17:28,239
That's not myjob

1677
02:17:28,448 --> 02:17:29,615
But l want to!

1678
02:17:34,871 --> 02:17:35,746
Excellent!

1679
02:17:36,456 --> 02:17:37,623
Thatwas personal

1680
02:17:40,752 --> 02:17:41,919
Come on, get going

1681
02:17:53,431 --> 02:17:54,306
