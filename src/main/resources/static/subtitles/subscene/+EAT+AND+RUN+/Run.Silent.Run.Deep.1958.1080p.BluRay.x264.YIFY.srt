1
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:43,840
Setup on leading freighter.

2
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:02,442
Range.

3
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,404
- Mark?
- 1-5-0-0.

4
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:09,949
50 port. Open outer doors,
tubes 1 and 2. Stand by.

5
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,993
Open outer doors, 1 and 2. Stand by.

6
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:21,878
Firing two fish forward. Watch your depth.

7
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:25,048
Two degrees down bubble. Hold her at 60.

8
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:29,094
- Outer doors open on 1 and 2, sir.
- Final bearing.

9
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,555
- Mark.
- 3-2-0.

10
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,350
- Set.
- Fire 1.

11
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,396
- 1 is fired, sir.
- Fire 2.

12
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:44,025
- 2 is fired, sir.
- Time on that first torpedo.

13
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,444
Should hit in about 42 seconds, sir.

14
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:06,464
Crash-dive! 300 feet! All ahead full!
Destroyer coming in fast!

15
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:08,800
Rig for depth charge! Silent running!

16
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,468
Dive!

17
00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:13,972
10... 9... 8... 7... 6...

18
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:11,214
Better hold on to these reports
to Admiral Bowers, sir.

19
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,050
- Why?
- His car had a flat tyre this morning.

20
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:16,553
Right rear. He's fit to be tied.

21
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,596
- Send 'em tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:21,391
Captain Field's a little touchy
this morning, too.

23
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,560
Another flat tyre?

24
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:27,772
Almost the same thing. His wife.
They had a quarrel last night.

25
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:30,108
- Oh, that.
- I'm ready for action.

26
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:32,819
Passing up the decoy, sir. In position.

27
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:35,196
Heading straight on towards the Akikaze.

28
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,490
- Stand by to dive.
- Aye aye, sir.

29
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:39,325
Range 1800.

30
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:42,203
Akikaze bearing down on us, bow on.

31
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:46,708
- Clear the bridge. Dive.
- Ready to shoot in 25 seconds.

32
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,668
Bearing. Mark.

33
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:50,128
Fire.

34
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:51,588
Fire 1.

35
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,214
24 seconds, sir.

36
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,176
Torpedo running hot, straight and normal.

37
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:59,554
You sunk him again, sir.

38
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,308
That makes 200 times
you've sunk Bungo Pete in...

39
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,810
200 days.

40
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:08,897
- He only sunk you once!
- Just once.

41
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:11,066
But it wasn't on a desk.

42
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:15,445
Where do you get all these things?

43
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:18,907
- Tables, desks.
- Mueller, you're a thief.

44
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,076
I'm a collector, sir.

45
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:24,871
Bungo Pete! Let's put him
next to his Akikaze destroyer.

46
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,124
The unknown factor.
The sea dragon of Area 7.

47
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:30,919
There's nothing superhuman
about him or the area.

48
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:34,130
<i>Too bad they'll never give you
another chance in that area.</i>

49
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:36,466
Four submarines sunk
in the Bungo Straits,

50
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:40,553
<i>and they keep you behind a desk
for something they can't even figure out.</i>

51
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:43,973
How many subs? You said four, I think.

52
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:47,435
- Yes, sir.
- The count was three a month ago.

53
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,023
It's only scuttlebutt, but the word's around
that the last boat sent out

54
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:54,192
was lost three days ago.

55
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,905
Get these things outta here!

56
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,286
Mueller,

57
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,455
when's the next sub due in?

58
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,582
Two weeks, sir. The Nerka.

59
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,920
Her skipper was wounded, but
the Executive Officer's due to take over.

60
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:17,132
- He qualified for command?
- Yes, sir.

61
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:21,011
- They'll send her out to 7.
- I suppose so.

62
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:26,266
Get the Chief of Staff on the phone.
Tell him I'm coming over.

63
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:47,537
<i>Executive Officer to duty section.
Now hear this.</i>

64
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,789
The repair crew will take over at 1300.

65
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:52,542
Duty section will stand by
with the repair list.

66
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:56,254
You beach boys who'll be checking in
at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel,

67
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,673
the hotel does not have a repair crew.

68
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,843
So have fun,
but keep the damage to a minimum.

69
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:11,019
Break it up! Russo, Cullen, break it up! I...

70
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,024
For the next captain of the Nerka, sir.

71
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:19,069
What we mean to say, Mr Bledsoe...
Congratulations!

72
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:22,197
Good luck, sir.

73
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:25,992
- So this is the way we start! Bribery!
- Don't know what you mean, sir!

74
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:29,746
Next it'll be special privileges!
Sunbathing, two-hour watches.

75
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,624
A sunburned crew is a happy crew!
An old Navy axiom!

76
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,793
That you just made up!

77
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:42,759
Thanks a lot, men. Don't any of you
get the idea I can be had.

78
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:45,178
- It never entered our heads.
- I'll bet!

79
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:48,723
- Go on, try it on, sir.
- You'll look very sharp in that rig.

80
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:55,105
- See you a moment, Bledsoe?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,482
We were just leaving, Captain.

82
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,734
I said we were leaving!

83
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:07,701
It's sort of a gift, sir. The men, they...

84
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,869
It's all right. Never mind.

85
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:12,872
- Any milk left in the galley?
- Yes, sir.

86
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:15,542
- Oh, it's powdered, sir.
- That'll do.

87
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:19,462
She belongs to the chief of the boat.
Good-luck token.

88
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:23,508
The men give her a little... pat
on their way to battle stations.

89
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,468
Interesting.

90
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:27,637
I'll get the milk, sir.

91
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,854
Submarines. They ruined my liver.

92
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,898
Couldn't take one again.

93
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:42,318
Terrible thought. Makes me old.
Makes me antique.

94
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:45,321
- Do you like subs?
- I chose the service, sir.

95
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:47,490
Of course.

96
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:54,122
- Good record.
- Thank you, sir.

97
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:57,125
It's a fact, not a compliment,
so don't thank me.

98
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,171
I told you two years ago you were
hot stuff, that you'd have a sub one day.

99
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,548
- Remember?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

100
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:05,717
Well, you're going to, Jim.

101
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:07,761
But not this time out.

102
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:11,222
The Nerka is being assigned
to Commander Richardson.

103
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:13,808
He'll be your skipper for this patrol.

104
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:20,940
You see, Jim, she's going to Area 7.
Richardson is acquainted with the area.

105
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:25,487
7 is a hot spot.
We lost four subs there the last year.

106
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,740
All of 'em sunk by an Akikaze
off the Bungo Straits.

107
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:32,994
His sub was the first. The Navy Board
feels he deserves another chance.

108
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:36,706
That command was mine.
Don't they think I can handle her in 7?

109
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:39,751
Of course not.
Your ability isn't being questioned.

110
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:42,671
It's just that Richardson's suggestion...

111
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:45,382
He presented a very strong case.

112
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,763
This whole thing
is suddenly very clear to me.

113
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:55,767
- That all, sir?
- That's all.

114
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:03,233
You won't mind if I keep this
out of mothballs, Captain?

115
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:06,027
There are other boats besides the Nerka.

116
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:10,115
Rich?

117
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,243
Hey, be careful!

118
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:16,413
- What's the matter?
- Like me to fix some lemonade?

119
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:19,624
Sure, honey, you go ahead.
I'll be down by the time...

120
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,507
- Better make enough for three.
- Three?

121
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:31,636
- We have company arriving.
- I can't see anyone like this!

122
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:33,972
I don't think this is a social visit.

123
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:39,561
You'd better put some gin
in that lemonade.

124
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,981
Looking for me?

125
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,822
- Commander Richardson?
- That's right.

126
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,033
I'm Bledsoe. Jim Bledsoe.

127
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:56,536
A pleasure. Mind throwing me up
that insect spray, Jim?

128
00:10:56,661 --> 00:10:59,372
Excuse me, sir,
but I didn't come to spray insects.

129
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:03,585
Well, it's the leaves you spray.
But it doesn't matter.

130
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:07,839
- What's on your mind?
- A request, sir.

131
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:10,050
I'd like you to ask for another Exec.

132
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:14,512
- Just like that, huh?
- My privilege, sir. Navy regulations.

133
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:17,807
- I'd have to take it to the Board.
- You went to them before.

134
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:21,227
That's just it. I got what I wanted.
Why should I change it?

135
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:24,856
Maybe I can enlighten you.
The crew's accepted me as its captain.

136
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:26,816
They have me decked out as a groom.

137
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:30,153
Now you're taking my place,
I'd rather not go to the wedding.

138
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:33,656
Are we discussing your pride
or are you embarrassed to face them?

139
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:36,034
You'll be facing them in a couple of days.

140
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,829
The resentment's going to be
twice as great with me on board.

141
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,207
Mr Bledsoe, let me be honest with you.

142
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,918
I don't care about
their resentment or yours.

143
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:48,296
I wanted a boat. The Board gave it to me.
That's all there is.

144
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,256
The Board didn't give you a thing.

145
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:53,802
You went to them, the poor
desk commander with a tear in his eye.

146
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:58,473
<i>You told them if you could have me
for a backstop, you could do the job.</i>

147
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:00,642
Mr Bledsoe,

148
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,228
your request for release is denied.

149
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:13,238
Well, Commander, I'm glad I came over.

150
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:17,117
- Get things straightened out.
- We're going to get along just fine.

151
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:20,078
Don't worry, Jim.
I'll take good care of the bride.

152
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:23,081
Anyone for a slug of gin?
We're out of vermouth.

153
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:25,417
- Lt Bledsoe, Laura. My Exec.
- Hello.

154
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,962
Thanks, Mrs Richardson.
I'll take a rain check on the drink.

155
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,923
- Some other time.
- Lieutenant?

156
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:34,592
If there isn't another time, good luck.

157
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,220
Take good care of my husband.

158
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,349
I'll take care, ma'am.

159
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,479
- Take over, Mr Conwell.
- Aye aye, sir.

160
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:37,906
Captain's off the bridge.
It won't be long now.

161
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:40,075
Captain's off the bridge.

162
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,078
- Order's coming up soon, Chief.
- OK, Carver.

163
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:46,623
- Is he downstairs yet?
- Below, Jessie. The Captain's below.

164
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:50,251
- How much is in the pool?
- 200 bucks. Are all the areas covered?

165
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:54,297
- I got a five spot on Area 22.
- 16 for me! I hear it's a pleasure cruise!

166
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:56,132
I took 7.

167
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:58,385
- You what?
- I took 7.

168
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,680
- That's a one-way ticket, idiot!
- Trying to jinx us all?

169
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:05,934
- What do you mean, one-way?
- No return, Jessie. No return.

170
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:11,106
But I was born on the 7th.
What with all that money in the pool, I...

171
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:13,942
7 is lucky for me, ain't it?

172
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:19,197
The money's all locked up inside.

173
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:22,450
Wilson, tell the engine room
we're standing by.

174
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:25,662
- Hey, Chief, can I change areas?
- Too late.

175
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:28,039
Gentlemen, I ask for silence.

176
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:30,375
The next voice you hear

177
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,585
will be the dealer.

178
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:35,922
<i>This is the Captain.</i>

179
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:41,636
<i>I know all of you are vitally interested
in our area assignment.</i>

180
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:47,225
Here is a rundown of the orders under
which we will operate during this patrol.

181
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,310
Number one.

182
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:54,399
<i>And I'm sure you've heard this
many times: Sink enemy shipping.</i>

183
00:14:54,524 --> 00:15:00,196
<i>Number two: Proceed
on a specified course to Area 7...</i>

184
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:04,325
- I knew it! I just knew it!
- For Pete's sake, turn it off!

185
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:10,457
Number three: Avoid the section
in Area 7 known as the Bungo Straits.

186
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:16,463
<i>Number four: Take coast intelligence
photos wherever possible.</i>

187
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:20,759
<i>A third of you are new men, and I know
there are bound to be some questions.</i>

188
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:24,012
<i>Feel free to ask
your division officer any time.</i>

189
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:26,681
<i>That's all. Thanks for your attention.</i>

190
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:28,975
Hey, where are the Bungo Straits?

191
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,144
- Why?
- He said we'll avoid it.

192
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:33,938
He didn't say anything about avoiding 7.

193
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:36,816
OK, give everyone back
his money, Kohler.

194
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:39,486
No dice. Somebody took Area 7.

195
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:42,697
<i>- Who?
- He did.</i>

196
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,038
Jeez, fellas, I didn't know!
Well, it's my birthday!

197
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:51,915
7's my birthday!

198
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:11,101
Simulated target dead ahead, sir.

199
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:14,979
<i>Range 2,000. All hands
standing by for drill.</i>

200
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,816
Bail out. Lookouts, below!

201
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:30,036
Clear the bridge!

202
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,378
Dive! Dive!

203
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,761
- What's the depth?
- 38 feet, sir.

204
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:51,766
- Ruby, where's the scope?
- We're not at periscope depth yet.

205
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,977
Stand by to surface.

206
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:56,938
Now let's get this straight.

207
00:16:57,063 --> 00:17:00,900
- I want this scope up as we dive.
- As we dive, sir?

208
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,737
I wanna be ready to fire
once we level off at 50 feet.

209
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:07,282
I know this is new to you,
but you'll have to get used to it.

210
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:11,536
The purpose of this drill is
to dive and fire as soon as we level.

211
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,955
Let's try it again. Surface!

212
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:18,168
Blow main ballast. Hard rise on planes.

213
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:51,743
- Blow negative!
- Level off. 8-degree angle,

214
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,954
- Depth: 40 feet.
- Steady on course, Captain.

215
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,291
- Mark: 50. Levelled off.
- Fire 1. Time?

216
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,043
42 seconds, sir.

217
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:03,254
- Not fast enough. Open the vents sooner.
- Aye aye, sir.

218
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,840
Stand by to surface. We'll try it again.

219
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:16,184
<i>Dive! Dive!</i>

220
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:19,688
- Open the vents on the diving alarm.
- Taking a chance, isn't it?

221
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:22,691
You can always shut 'em
if you don't get a green board.

222
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,442
Aye aye, sir.

223
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,909
Dive! Dive!

224
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,870
Open 'em up! Flood those tanks!

225
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,763
<i>Dive! Dive!</i>

226
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:12,282
- Mark: 50. Levelled off.
- Fire 1.

227
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,995
- 37 seconds, sir.
- That's good. Very good.

228
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,914
By the time we reach Area 7,
I want it down to 33.

229
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,083
- 33, sir?
- 33 is right.

230
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,170
- Yes, sir. Secure from battle stations?
- Yes, Jim.

231
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:28,840
- Take the conn, Mr Cartwright.
- Secure from battle stations.

232
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,176
Secure. Third section, take watch.

233
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,305
All ahead one third.

234
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,474
Light the smoking lamp.

235
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:50,779
I said secure. Your tails
can't be dragging that much.

236
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:53,740
What's the matter? No gripes, no groans?

237
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:57,077
Isn't anyone gonna say
it's a four-second difference?

238
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:59,245
Not a boat in the fleet could make it?

239
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:01,331
Ruby, you worried about drills?

240
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:04,417
- No, sir.
- Poplin?

241
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:09,631
I never keep anything from a crew. I don't
expect 'em to keep anything from me.

242
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:11,299
So, come on, speak up!

243
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:17,138
Well, I... I guess it's...
It's Area 7, Mr Bledsoe.

244
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:20,141
- You heard the operation orders.
- That's just it, sir.

245
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:23,687
- They mentioned the Bungo Straits.
- What difference does that make?

246
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:27,732
That's the section where
those subs were lost - the graveyard.

247
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:30,652
- We've got orders to avoid it.
- The Bungo Straits!

248
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:32,862
- Well, for Pete's sake!
- Great!

249
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:35,824
- Lieutenant, we thought...
- Don't think.

250
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:39,369
Grab some coffee.
In 30 minutes, you got another drill.

251
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:41,037
33 seconds!

252
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:44,165
Leave the hatch open,
the boat might go down faster.

253
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,424
I heard you, Lieutenant.

254
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,176
Now that you've explained the orders,

255
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,513
how do you explain
the purpose of these drills?

256
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,488
Captain to the bridge!

257
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:28,293
Easy, fellas! She's gotta last the patrol.
One pat to a customer now.

258
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:32,839
- All ahead, standard on board.
- OK, I got it.

259
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:36,301
Radar contact dead astern, sir.
We think it's a Jap sub.

260
00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:39,179
Has he seen us?

261
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:42,515
Hard to tell. Shall we open
the outer doors on the stern tubes?

262
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,684
No. Keep her on present course.

263
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:57,113
Conning tower,
aft engine room manned and ready.

264
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:03,953
Conn, forward torpedo room
manned and ready.

265
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,539
How long shall we hold this course, sir?

266
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,126
Before we double back to get 'em.

267
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:12,337
We're not going to double back.

268
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:15,965
- Sir?
- He might get lucky. I'm not risking it.

269
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:19,469
- We're faster. We could outmanoeuvre it.
- Hold her steady.

270
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:22,389
- Aye aye, sir.
- Keep a sharp lookout astern!

271
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:25,183
<i>Lost radar contact at 6-5-0-0 yards, sir.</i>

272
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:28,144
Very well. Secure from battle stations.

273
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:30,313
Secure from battle stations.

274
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:32,982
Second section, take the watch.

275
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:38,697
I'll take the conn. Lay below.

276
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:40,865
Aye aye, sir.

277
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:50,458
Well, you've had the boat for a week now.

278
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,503
I guess you noticed
how quickly she responds.

279
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:58,133
Always a shudder when you push her
too hard. Best to ease her into it.

280
00:22:58,258 --> 00:23:01,344
- Thanks. Anything else?
- Just one thing, sir.

281
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:05,223
She hates showing her backsides
to Japanese submarines.

282
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:08,727
Permission to go below, sir?

283
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:10,895
Granted.

284
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:18,153
Now hear this, now hear this.
Orders of the day.

285
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:22,615
To your sacks, men. You've got
25 seconds to lay flat on your backs.

286
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:25,285
Any of you gripers want a sleeping pill?

287
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:28,121
He's a caution. Isn't he a caution!

288
00:23:28,246 --> 00:23:30,498
Give the skipper a couple, will ya?

289
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:34,711
A Jap sub and all these drills.
The Captain must be running scared.

290
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:38,131
It's the craziest war patrol
I ever started on.

291
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:42,385
Who said anything about a war patrol?
You're all confused, my friend.

292
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,848
We're on a drill patrol. First time
in the annals of the Navy Department.

293
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:50,560
What's it all mean?
What's he got in mind, huh?

294
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:54,272
Haven't you heard? He's gonna
challenge the Japs to a drill.

295
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:57,776
The winner will get
an all-expense-paid honeymoon

296
00:23:57,901 --> 00:24:00,445
with Tokyo Rose in the Bungo Straits.

297
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:05,116
Gentlemen, we are indeed fortunate.
Let us pay tribute to that great motto.

298
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:08,370
"Caution with safety
and safety with caution."

299
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:10,538
Now. Let's do better than that.

300
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:14,250
Let's drink a toast to
our beloved captain, the drillmaster!

301
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:17,504
For he knew our fleet boat
was faster than a Jap sub.

302
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:19,464
I've had enough kidding, Jerry.

303
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:22,133
Why? A cautious captain
with orders to "avoid"?

304
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,220
If we stay out of Area 7
as well as the Straits, we're in.

305
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:28,932
- I bet he's thinking of a way now!
- Excuse me, sir. Your watch list.

306
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:31,851
What about that, Mueller?
You're chummy with him.

307
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:35,647
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr Cartwright. Do you, sir?

308
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:38,733
Come back here, Kraut!

309
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:40,944
Get out, Mueller. Go on.

310
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:48,868
If you have any questions, you come
to me, not the crew. Understand?

311
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:52,080
And that goes for your opinions, too.

312
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:56,584
Maybe we'd better break this up.
It's getting late.

313
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:12,642
Shut up.

314
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:41,338
<i>Battle stations manned.
Standing by for drill.</i>

315
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,474
Lookouts, below!

316
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:57,520
Clear the bridge!

317
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:05,779
Dive! Dive!

318
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,262
Surface! Surface!

319
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,270
- Someone up topside, sir!
- All stop!

320
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:41,773
- All stop, sir.
- Emergency! Surface!

321
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,762
Open up!

322
00:27:32,657 --> 00:27:35,827
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right, sir. I'm OK.

323
00:27:35,952 --> 00:27:38,872
Who gave you permission
to dump the garbage?

324
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:42,000
- Mr Cartwright, sir.
- I thought he'd asked the OD.

325
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,502
- I was on the bridge. I...
- Get below.

326
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:46,296
Yes, sir.

327
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,300
Only the captain gives permission
to dump the trash.

328
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:54,179
Instead of losing time on this drill,
we almost lose a man!

329
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,724
Stand by to dive!

330
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:00,769
- Check the watch, Mr Kohler.
- Aye aye, sir.

331
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:03,938
Mr Bledsoe.

332
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:07,359
Yes, sir?

333
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:10,945
- Have you been with this boat long?
- Over a year, sir.

334
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:15,075
And is this the kind of cooperation
you usually get?

335
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,287
No, sir.

336
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:21,539
A man could've been killed today.

337
00:28:21,706 --> 00:28:25,752
The responsibility is yours.
You're in charge of the drills.

338
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:29,923
I have no excuses. But under the
circumstances, the crew did their best.

339
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:32,092
- What circumstances?
- Don't press it.

340
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:33,385
I want an answer.

341
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:36,846
It's one thing to drill a crew.
But when you duck a Jap sub,

342
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:41,226
they wonder why they should care when
the Captain has no stomach for attacking.

343
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:43,812
Does he want obedience, efficiency,

344
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:46,398
or the best-drilled cowards in the Navy?

345
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:54,072
Mr Bledsoe, tell them I'm doubling
the drills, starting tomorrow.

346
00:28:54,197 --> 00:28:55,824
Yes, sir.

347
00:28:58,034 --> 00:29:00,704
You might as well know, sir.
I don't believe it.

348
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:02,247
Believe what?

349
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:05,458
That you ran away from that sub
from cowardice.

350
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:23,977
I know what ya mean, but what's the cook
supposed to do - eat the garbage?

351
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:27,188
- We haven't had a minute...
- Hey, Vince.

352
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:34,362
SJ contact, SJ contact!

353
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:37,574
Bearing 3-3-0, range 15 miles.

354
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:41,619
- A big one, huh?
- It's not a fishing boat, friend.

355
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:47,542
Picking up two of them now, sir.

356
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:54,049
Range closing.
Enemy on southerly course.

357
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:55,800
Very well.

358
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:59,512
Right full rudder,
come right to course 3-3-0.

359
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:02,515
Right full rudder, sir,
coming right to 3-3-0.

360
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,477
<i>- Very well.
- Looks like he's going to go in.</i>

361
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:07,979
Sightseeing, Pat. Just sightseeing.

362
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:23,536
I can see them now.

363
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:28,917
Lead ship, possible Momo destroyer.
Trailing ship, a large tanker.

364
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:34,464
We'll wait until the destroyer passes,
then take on the tanker.

365
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,883
<i>Shifting to TBT. Bearing coming down.</i>

366
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:53,983
Bearing 0-2-0.

367
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:55,735
Set, sir.

368
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,114
Right full rudder,
come right to course 0-3-0.

369
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:01,282
<i>Open outer doors on tubes 1 and 2.</i>

370
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:04,744
- Open outer doors on tubes 1 and 2.
- Open outer doors on 1 and 2.

371
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:17,841
Angle on the bow now. Starboard 70.

372
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:20,385
Torpedo spread - one right, one left.

373
00:31:20,552 --> 00:31:23,596
Solution checking. Everything's set, sir.

374
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:27,892
Destroyer's well clear now.
Tanker range 3-2-0-0.

375
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:31,688
<i>- All ready to fire, sir.
- Very well. Stand by, tube 1.</i>

376
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:33,481
Stand by, tube 1.

377
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:46,369
- What's the torpedo run?
- 2500 yards, sir.

378
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:48,079
- Commence firing.
- Fire 1.

379
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:50,915
Fire 1.

380
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:54,336
- 1 fired, sir.
- Stand by, 2.

381
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,755
- Spread set.
- Fire 2.

382
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,923
Fire 2.

383
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:03,470
- 2 fired.
- No.1 running hot and straight, sir.

384
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:47,764
Destroyer's angle on the bow
now zero. Bearing?

385
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:56,523
- Bearing 0-4-5.
- He's heading right at us.

386
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:59,317
Keep the sound down.
We'll have orders to go deep.

387
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:00,777
Aye aye, sir.

388
00:33:02,153 --> 00:33:06,700
If you've had any questions about
the drills, you'll have 'em answered now.

389
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:09,577
<i>We're taking on the Momo.</i>

390
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:14,332
<i>Right standard rudder,
come right to course 0-4-5.</i>

391
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:17,127
- Coming right to 0-4-5.
- Very well.

392
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:20,755
Open outer doors on tubes 3 and 4.

393
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:24,175
Open outer doors on tubes 3 and 4.

394
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,928
Range to destroyer: 2,000.
Bearing steady.

395
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:29,097
Closing in fast. Coming head on.

396
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:45,572
At range 1-5-0-0, we'll crash-dive.
At 50 feet, we'll give her two fish.

397
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:48,366
Down the throat? It's a bow shot.

398
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,618
Range 1,800.

399
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:09,179
Lookouts, below!

400
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,475
Stand by to dive.

401
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,727
<i>- Stand by to dive.
- Clear the bridge!</i>

402
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,194
<i>Dive! Dive!</i>

403
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:45,340
- Bearing.
- Mark: 0-4-4.

404
00:34:45,507 --> 00:34:47,550
- Set.
- Depth: 34 feet.

405
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:50,220
- 10-degree angle.
- 39 feet.

406
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:52,263
Level off.

407
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,849
- 44 feet.
- Steady on course, Captain.

408
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:58,103
- Stand by on tube 3.
- Stand by on 3.

409
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:03,900
- Levelled off at 50, Captain!
- Fire 3.

410
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:06,069
Fire 3.

411
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:08,238
3 fired, sir.

412
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:11,783
Fire 4.

413
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,786
- 4 fired, sir.
- Stand by to take her down fast.

414
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:18,832
- Stand by to take her down fast!
- Aye aye, sir. Standing by.

415
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:38,435
- Captain, we got 'em!
- In 32 seconds!

416
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,478
32 seconds!

417
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:50,488
Left full rudder, all ahead one third.

418
00:35:51,281 --> 00:35:53,950
Very well. Now hear this.
Captain speaking.

419
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:58,204
You just gave a Jap tin can the deep six
with a bow shot in 32 seconds.

420
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,624
This boat is ready for anything.
Let's keep it that way.

421
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,960
Drills - no more than usual tomorrow.

422
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:06,963
Mr Bledsoe, take the conn
and get us back on course.

423
00:36:07,088 --> 00:36:09,132
Aye aye, sir.

424
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:11,926
- Boy, that skipper!
- He knocks 'im down!

425
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:14,095
Observation.

426
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:26,733
Hey, come here, you guys. Listen to this.

427
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:30,570
"Dear Commander,
Japanese Imperial Fleet,

428
00:36:30,695 --> 00:36:34,074
be it hereby known that on July 31st 1943,

429
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,952
the USS Nerka, under the command
of Captain PJ Richardson,

430
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:40,038
sunk a Japanese destroyer."

431
00:36:41,706 --> 00:36:45,210
"One down, 20 fish to go."
Signed, Kraut Mueller.

432
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:48,755
How about that? We've been
drilling for a bow shot all the time.

433
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,550
- Hey, Ruby, you were up there.
- Right on the pickle, dear friend.

434
00:36:52,717 --> 00:36:55,804
That tin can zigs right into us.
I tell ya, I was shaking!

435
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:59,599
- What did the old man do?
- Calm, you know. No excitement.

436
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:04,104
Orders two fish right down the throat.
Just like you'd order ham and eggs.

437
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:08,233
If we'd missed, we wouldn't have lived
long enough to get into Area 7.

438
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:12,487
- We won't live long enough to get out.
- Lf, if, if! Go back to Sears Roebuck!

439
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:14,614
<i>Forgive me if I interrupt the music.</i>

440
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:17,617
<i>You are listening to the voice
you call Tokyo Rose,</i>

441
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:21,246
<i>speaking to you from the heart
of the Japanese empire,</i>

442
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:25,041
<i>telling you in your own language
of a war you cannot win.</i>

443
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:30,088
<i>It has been substantiated that we have
destroyed 16 enemy ships this month.</i>

444
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:34,509
Oh, come on, Rosie, get up to date!
You're missing one Jap tin can!

445
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:38,972
Jessie! Jessie, dear friend!

446
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:41,182
We've decided to be big about it.

447
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:44,769
We're not gonna hold you responsible
for Area 7 any longer.

448
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:47,105
- We'll take back the money.
- Gosh!

449
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:49,607
Well, that's nice of you fellas,

450
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,486
but my conscience hurt me so much,
I threw it overboard.

451
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:03,538
- Not now, Kohler.
- Don't shut me up again, Lieutenant.

452
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:07,375
I've seen all kinds of captains.
We've seen 'em together.

453
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,878
But I never saw one
run away from a Jap sub,

454
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:13,673
then take on a destroyer with a shot
I didn't even know was in the book.

455
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,884
There has to be a reason.

456
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:20,805
That bow shot didn't just happen.

457
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,808
The drills were planned for it.
The whole thing was...

458
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:29,731
I never heard of a bow shot
being set up except in desperation.

459
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:31,900
It's all like some experiment.

460
00:38:32,025 --> 00:38:35,779
Suppose a bow shot was the only way
he thought he could get an Akikaze.

461
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:38,823
An Akikaze isn't a Momo.
There's a helluva difference.

462
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,326
This Akikaze's in the Bungo Straits.

463
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:44,788
But that's impossible.
The orders say to avoid it.

464
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:49,000
I know.

465
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:59,469
Look, I know how you feel about him
taking the boat and all.

466
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:03,556
But don't you think
you're working at it overtime, sir?

467
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:06,434
We'll be hitting Area 7 tomorrow morning.

468
00:39:58,486 --> 00:40:00,530
Four,

469
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:02,157
five,

470
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,702
six.

471
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:09,998
It's a convoy all right, sir.
Bearing 3-2-0 relative.

472
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:18,673
Sounds like a whole lot of 'em, sir.

473
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:22,260
- Cullen.
- Aye aye, sir.

474
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:24,429
I have the dive. Depth: 60 feet.

475
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:28,183
- Forward torpedo room ready, sir.
- We're undetected, sir.

476
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,352
Aft torpedo room manned and ready.

477
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:33,980
We're dead ahead of the convoy.
What firing position shall we take?

478
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,194
Captain?

479
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:42,322
Take her down, sir?

480
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:46,826
Take her down to 100 feet.

481
00:40:46,951 --> 00:40:48,995
100 feet. Aye aye, sir.

482
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:52,290
Five degrees down bubble.
Take her to 100 feet.

483
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:55,293
Secure from battle stations
when we level off.

484
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:58,922
- Come right to course 2-8-0.
- Right to course 2-8-0, sir.

485
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:01,675
Very well. Mr Cartwright,
take over the conn.

486
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,967
Yes, sir.

487
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,346
What's he doing? What's going on?

488
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,228
- Give me a line on course 2-8-0.
- Sir?

489
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:16,272
- A line on course 2-8-0 now!
- Aye aye, sir.

490
00:41:16,398 --> 00:41:19,317
- What's the skipper up...
- Later, Beckman.

491
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:23,196
- Start levelling off.
- Aye aye, sir.

492
00:41:39,546 --> 00:41:42,090
There it is. You might as well post it.

493
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:46,761
A whole area to patrol and you pick
the graveyard - the Bungo Straits!

494
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:50,348
It's the only place we can get the Akikaze.

495
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:52,517
The one spot you're ordered to avoid.

496
00:41:52,642 --> 00:41:55,687
You make it sound like
a snap decision. It wasn't.

497
00:41:55,812 --> 00:42:00,025
That's quite obvious. Passing
a Jap submarine to save your torpedoes.

498
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,820
Risking a bow shot. Ducking a convoy
so they can't radio our position.

499
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:07,532
You planned it, all right! You knew it
the day I came to your house!

500
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:11,578
I knew it before that, Jim. I knew it
a year ago when my boat went down.

501
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:16,207
We have explicit orders. We have a crew
that expects the captain to follow them.

502
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,793
You know that a captain
can redefine orders

503
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:20,962
if he feels he has an advantage.

504
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:23,381
- What advantage?
- You named it. A bow shot.

505
00:42:23,548 --> 00:42:25,842
We did it with a Momo.
We can do it again.

506
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:30,221
You call that an advantage when
four subs before us never had a chance?

507
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,350
They were detected.
Not even Pearl knows where we are.

508
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:35,518
What about the Japanese navy?

509
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:38,772
<i>No, sir, that's no advantage.
Not in my book.</i>

510
00:42:38,897 --> 00:42:40,940
But you're not the captain.

511
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,569
If you should fail
but come out of this alive,

512
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:47,864
there won't be a desk
small enough for you this time!

513
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:51,826
That's strange, Jim.
I never even thought of failing.

514
00:42:53,078 --> 00:42:56,998
You've got a lot of guts, sir,
with other people's lives.

515
00:42:57,165 --> 00:42:59,417
That's my decision and my responsibility!

516
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,628
To whom? To a crew
that died a year ago?

517
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:04,422
Yes! To a dead crew, a dead sub!

518
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:11,137
Believe what you want.

519
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:16,601
Well, this crew's still alive.

520
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:21,106
They have a right to know where
they're going. Do I have to tell them?

521
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,151
What's the matter? Surely
you've got guts enough for this, too.

522
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,906
This is the Captain.

523
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:32,701
Due to conditions of special advantage,

524
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:36,371
I have decided to take this boat
to the Bungo Straits.

525
00:44:07,152 --> 00:44:10,447
Bungo Straits, broad on the port beam.

526
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,835
We're there.

527
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:28,006
Bungo Straits.

528
00:44:28,798 --> 00:44:30,842
We're at the Straits.

529
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:34,929
Bungo Straits.

530
00:44:45,523 --> 00:44:47,984
We're there. We're in the Straits.

531
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:54,866
If I'd only been born on the 8th.

532
00:44:56,451 --> 00:44:58,578
See you a moment, sir?

533
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,423
- What is this?
- We... We want to talk to you, Jim.

534
00:45:10,548 --> 00:45:13,760
- I looked through the Navy rules.
- We want you to take over.

535
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,307
That's very flattering, gentlemen.

536
00:45:19,432 --> 00:45:21,267
Let's go. Everyone outside.

537
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:23,520
- They're Navy orders!
- What right...

538
00:45:23,645 --> 00:45:25,939
A captain's right. That's all he needs.

539
00:45:26,064 --> 00:45:28,108
We might as well
make up our minds now.

540
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:31,069
- We'll follow his orders.
- Where? To the bottom?

541
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:34,072
If that's what he's got in mind,
that's where we'll go.

542
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:36,658
This boat - any boat - has one captain.

543
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,704
Is that right, Kohler?

544
00:45:41,496 --> 00:45:43,331
Yes, sir.

545
00:45:43,456 --> 00:45:46,960
- Is that right, Mr Cartwright?
- Yes, sir.

546
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:49,129
Let's break this up.

547
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:03,643
Mr Cartwright, with all due respect
to your rank,

548
00:46:03,768 --> 00:46:06,438
may I say that I think you're an ass?

549
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:11,651
I see by this report that
you called Mr Cartwright an ass.

550
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:13,862
- Yes, sir.
- An officer?

551
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:15,822
That's right, sir.

552
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:19,284
- Mueller, you're a damn fool.
- Yes, sir, I know.

553
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:22,704
But as long as I overheard,
you might as well know, too.

554
00:46:22,829 --> 00:46:25,749
They wanted Mr Bledsoe to take over.

555
00:46:25,874 --> 00:46:28,543
- He put an end to that fast.
- He would.

556
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:32,422
- Would you tell me something?
- If I can, sir.

557
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:35,675
- Am I a damn fool, too?
- Sir?

558
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,472
Mr Bledsoe seems to think I am,
and I have a great respect for his opinion.

559
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:43,892
Maybe you have to be, Captain,
to do something like this.

560
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:47,687
You nailed that Momo with a bow shot.
Why not the Akikaze?

561
00:46:47,854 --> 00:46:51,191
The Akikaze never misses, Mueller. Never.

562
00:46:51,316 --> 00:46:53,777
Well, he will this time, sir.

563
00:46:53,902 --> 00:46:57,739
Is that a classified opinion
or am I at liberty to repeat it?

564
00:46:57,906 --> 00:46:59,949
It's a fact, sir.

565
00:47:00,075 --> 00:47:03,453
A fact they'll all realise
at Bungo Pete's funeral!

566
00:47:55,964 --> 00:48:00,135
<i>Convoy now bearing 3-1-3.
Range 7,000 yards.</i>

567
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:04,139
Are we gonna set up
on the leading ship, sir?

568
00:48:04,264 --> 00:48:08,393
That's a decoy. Shallow craft.
Used to draw fire away from the convoy.

569
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:13,273
You could shoot ten fish.
They'd only run under it.

570
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:24,326
There! There she is,
pulling up to the convoy!

571
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:26,286
- The Akikaze.
- Yes.

572
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:29,289
She'll keep astern of both columns
until they zig.

573
00:48:29,414 --> 00:48:32,459
Look at her cut through there!
Must be making 30 knots!

574
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:35,628
Doesn't stay in position long enough
to give you a target.

575
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:37,797
Not unless he's coming toward you.

576
00:48:37,922 --> 00:48:42,385
Take over in the conning tower. Track
the next-to-last ship in the port column.

577
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:45,555
We'll give you a bearing.
Right standard rudder!

578
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,724
Very well.

579
00:48:52,604 --> 00:48:57,359
This is the Captain. The convoy we've
been waiting for is on our starboard bow.

580
00:48:57,484 --> 00:49:01,988
<i>The plan of attack is as follows.
First, we'll strike a freighter going in.</i>

581
00:49:02,113 --> 00:49:04,991
<i>If that doesn't bring
the Akikaze toward us,</i>

582
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:07,869
<i>we'll attack the freighter nearest him.</i>

583
00:49:07,994 --> 00:49:11,915
<i>When the Akikaze does head toward us,
we'll dive and give him two fish</i>

584
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,376
<i>at 1500 yards, just like the Momo.</i>

585
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:16,586
Let's go. All ahead standard.

586
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:18,672
- All ahead standard, sir.
- Very well.

587
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:30,517
How's the target course
and speed check with the TDC?

588
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:33,186
Course checks. Speed, one knot slower.

589
00:49:37,357 --> 00:49:39,901
Plane contact, sir.

590
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:46,241
Captain, radar's picked up enemy planes.

591
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:49,452
Lookouts, planes coming in.
Watch for them.

592
00:49:49,577 --> 00:49:51,371
Aye aye, sir.

593
00:49:51,496 --> 00:49:56,209
- 15 miles. Range closing.
- Planes 15 miles. Range closing.

594
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:07,387
They're closing fast, sir.

595
00:50:09,264 --> 00:50:13,852
- Planes closing fast, sir.
- The Japs must've known we were here.

596
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,021
We're going in according to plan.

597
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,523
<i>Give me the setup.</i>

598
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,942
- Stay on that freighter.
- Aye aye, sir.

599
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:24,904
<i>Range on freighter 2,000, sir.
Track 70, gyro 20 right.</i>

600
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:29,451
<i>- Recommend firing course 2-9-7.
- Come right to 2-9-7.</i>

601
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:33,496
- Right to course 2-9-7, sir.
- Planes six miles.

602
00:50:34,956 --> 00:50:38,376
- They'll be on us in a minute.
- Stand by.

603
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:42,213
Ready on tubes 1 and 2.
Outer doors open. Standing by.

604
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:44,716
Range 1800 yards.

605
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,053
- Commence firing.
- Fire 1.

606
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:50,180
Fire 1.

607
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,476
- 1 has been fired.
- 1 fired, sir.

608
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:57,520
- 1's away. Fire 2.
- Fire 2.

609
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:01,816
- 2 has been fired.
- 2 is fired, sir.

610
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:04,778
- 2's away.
- Make ready stern tubes!

611
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:07,572
Make ready stern tubes.

612
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:11,993
- Aircraft now one mile.
- Come to course 0-8-9.

613
00:51:12,118 --> 00:51:14,120
Coming to course 0-8-9!

614
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:16,956
Very well. Time check on first torpedo.

615
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:19,417
Five seconds, four...

616
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:30,762
Both fish hit. She's headed down.

617
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:32,764
Stern tubes ready, sir.

618
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,976
Aircraft range steady.
Appear to be circling overhead.

619
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:45,276
Right full rudder, all ahead flank.

620
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:50,865
Shift target to Akikaze.
He's coming on. Bearing coming down.

621
00:51:55,704 --> 00:51:57,747
- Bearing 2-5-0.
- 2-5-0, sir.

622
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:21,938
Radar to bridge. Aircraft returning.

623
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:32,115
Range 4,000. Tubes 3 and 4 ready.
Outer doors open.

624
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:53,720
- Want me to take her down, sir?
- Not yet, not yet! Lookouts, below!

625
00:52:54,846 --> 00:52:56,473
Range 3,000.

626
00:52:56,598 --> 00:52:58,892
We'll have to fire from surface. Stand by.

627
00:53:06,524 --> 00:53:08,568
- Commence firing!
- Fire 3.

628
00:53:12,197 --> 00:53:14,240
- 3 fired, sir.
- 3's away, sir.

629
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:25,126
Clear the bridge!

630
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:30,215
Dive! Dive!

631
00:53:41,893 --> 00:53:44,270
- Take her down to 300 fast!
- Aye aye, sir!

632
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:48,066
- Gimme a time check on that fish.
- 24, 23...

633
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:51,569
Torpedo screws, sir.
Heading toward our port side.

634
00:53:58,118 --> 00:54:00,787
- Must be that last torpedo, sir.
- It's a runaway.

635
00:54:00,912 --> 00:54:04,833
Coming back at us! Crash-dive!
Sound collision alarm!

636
00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:33,903
Passing 7-5 feet, sir.

637
00:54:36,614 --> 00:54:38,325
Passing 9-0 feet, sir.

638
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,370
Destroyer coming in, sir.

639
00:55:26,665 --> 00:55:29,668
He's shifting to attack frequency, sir!

640
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:47,310
Picking up splashes, sir.
Depth charges on the way down.

641
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,980
Passing 150 feet.

642
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:50,290
It's all right! Leave it!
The governor'll stop it at 2100rpm.

643
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:03,678
<i>Forward torpedo room reporting.
Hatch was blown on the main...</i>

644
00:57:03,803 --> 00:57:05,847
<i>We cannot make...</i>

645
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:08,016
Forward torpedo room.

646
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:15,857
Forward torpedo room.

647
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:22,405
- Phone circuit's out, sir.
- Check on the damage.

648
00:57:56,356 --> 00:58:00,402
- Captain wants a damage report.
- A couple of dogs sheared off the hatch.

649
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:02,654
- Can you fix it?
- I'll know in a minute.

650
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:08,785
Turn on emergency lights.

651
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:13,289
Torpedo room.
Forward torpedo room, report.

652
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:16,918
Forward torpedo room.

653
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:19,713
Take the conn. I'm going to check.

654
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:23,133
<i>- Levelling off.
- All ahead one third!</i>

655
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:37,814
- Is the hatch sprung?
- A couple of dogs sheared off.

656
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,970
Close the hatch! Close the hatch!

657
00:59:11,973 --> 00:59:14,017
Close the hatch!

658
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:43,254
<i>Losing depth control.
Heavy forward. Request more speed.</i>

659
00:59:43,421 --> 00:59:46,925
Forward room must be flooding.
All ahead standard!

660
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:58,645
- You OK, sir?
- Yeah.

661
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:03,316
- Is the compartment flooded?
- Partially.

662
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:05,485
Three dead.

663
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:15,829
They're coming in for the kill, sir.

664
01:00:18,957 --> 01:00:22,544
Only way to get out of this alive
is to make 'em think we're all dead.

665
01:00:22,711 --> 01:00:26,631
- Send up an oil slick?
- Send up blankets, gear, everything.

666
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:28,383
Jim,

667
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:34,597
<i>the men that were killed,
send them up through the tubes.</i>

668
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:38,018
Yes, sir.

669
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,483
Screws diminishing, sir!

670
01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:12,547
Captain? Captain, there's
something else here. Listen.

671
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:18,094
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

672
01:03:51,002 --> 01:03:53,046
What's the situation in the hatch?

673
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:58,301
It's OK. The engineer should have
the new parts ready in a couple of hours.

674
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:01,471
It's well secured
with block and tackle, sir.

675
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:06,142
Clear the compartment.

676
01:04:06,267 --> 01:04:10,397
OK, everybody out. Come on.
On the double. Let's go, fellas.

677
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:27,247
<i>What is it, sir? I can't make that out.</i>

678
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:41,511
Here. Better take a swallow, sir.

679
01:04:42,554 --> 01:04:46,391
- What is it?
- A stimulant from the medical safe.

680
01:04:46,558 --> 01:04:49,019
It's 100 proof, sir.

681
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:54,232
- How long have I been out?
- Just a few minutes, Captain.

682
01:04:59,404 --> 01:05:03,325
You'd better worry about yourself.
You'll be in for a rough time.

683
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:06,953
Hendrix knows his stuff.
You've had a pretty bad concussion.

684
01:05:07,078 --> 01:05:10,081
It's worse than that.
There's a medical term for it,

685
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:14,461
but it all adds up to blacking out
now and then for quite a while.

686
01:05:14,586 --> 01:05:19,424
If you don't keep off your feet, sir,
you'll be blacking out permanently!

687
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,764
- You'll keep this to yourselves.
- But, sir...

688
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,932
That's an order, Hendrix.

689
01:05:32,103 --> 01:05:34,147
Send for Mr Bledsoe.

690
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:38,276
- Well, go on!
- Yes, sir.

691
01:06:06,513 --> 01:06:10,183
The torpedo firing circuits
will take 24 hours to repair.

692
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:13,061
We'll have to set up
a jury-rig for the radio,

693
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:15,563
and the radar needs some work, too.

694
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,774
That's another 24 hours.

695
01:06:17,899 --> 01:06:23,363
Not bad, considering. We'll lay over
for two days, then we can get moving.

696
01:06:23,488 --> 01:06:28,618
Yeah, the timing's perfect.
Those convoys come out every 48 hours.

697
01:06:30,537 --> 01:06:33,832
- You really got shook up, didn't you?
- No.

698
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:38,211
- No, I couldn't feel better.
- Then maybe I didn't hear you right.

699
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:41,631
You heard me right.
I'm talking about the Straits.

700
01:06:41,756 --> 01:06:44,300
Going back to the Bungo Straits.

701
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:52,142
We're through playing with lives.
It's the end of the line.

702
01:06:52,267 --> 01:06:54,436
Why? Because a torpedo went wild?

703
01:06:54,561 --> 01:06:57,022
You know that's 100 to 1, an accident.

704
01:06:57,147 --> 01:07:01,943
The whole Japanese air force...
dropping everything it's got.

705
01:07:02,068 --> 01:07:06,239
- That's an accident, too?
- Next time around, we'll make it.

706
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:11,786
What are you gonna do? Swim back
to the Straits or use a lifeboat?

707
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:14,914
Because that's all the help
you're gonna get.

708
01:07:15,623 --> 01:07:19,919
Those are tall words.
You'd better stop and think a minute.

709
01:07:20,045 --> 01:07:24,382
I have thought about it. That wasn't
a tea party the crew held before.

710
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:28,261
They wanted me to take over then.
They'll feel the same way now.

711
01:07:28,386 --> 01:07:32,891
You make one move to take over and,
I swear, I'll see that you're hung!

712
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:37,354
Then we'll hang together. Orders
were disobeyed. No more technicalities.

713
01:07:37,479 --> 01:07:41,399
A fleet boat of the Navy,
a sub with her fighting power intact,

714
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:43,568
and you'd take her back to Pearl?

715
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,403
I don't believe it!

716
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:53,411
Mr Cartwright!

717
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,211
Yes, sir?

718
01:08:01,336 --> 01:08:05,256
We'll lay over two days for repairs
before returning to Pearl.

719
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,217
I'll be in command.

720
01:08:07,342 --> 01:08:09,594
Get a detail started right away.

721
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:13,056
- Yes, sir.
- That's all, Cartwright.

722
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:16,601
Yes, sir.

723
01:08:20,772 --> 01:08:23,525
The best Exec I could get
in the whole Navy!

724
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:25,694
The backstop, I think you said!

725
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:30,073
And the first command you give
as a captain is to order a retreat!

726
01:08:53,805 --> 01:08:57,934
Goodbye, Bungo! Hello, Pearl!

727
01:08:58,059 --> 01:09:01,146
- Funny, funny, funny!
- What's with you?

728
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:03,398
We're trying to eat. Knock it off.

729
01:09:03,565 --> 01:09:06,985
- Is this a private dining room?
- Wanna sing? Go to the head!

730
01:09:07,152 --> 01:09:09,696
<i>It'll take more than you to put me there!</i>

731
01:09:09,863 --> 01:09:12,782
Break it up!
What's the matter with you guys?

732
01:09:12,907 --> 01:09:15,285
We're going back to Pearl, aren't we?

733
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:21,249
How many patrols have you had,
Mr Sears Roebuck?

734
01:09:21,374 --> 01:09:24,878
- This is my second.
- Well, I've had five since '42.

735
01:09:25,003 --> 01:09:28,298
I've taken depth charges, shells, strafings,

736
01:09:28,423 --> 01:09:31,301
even a bombing run off the Solomons.

737
01:09:31,426 --> 01:09:35,889
This is the first time I've gone back
to Pearl with 15 torpedoes still aboard.

738
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,809
Kohler, better start the torpedo check.

739
01:09:39,934 --> 01:09:42,020
- Aye aye, sir.
- Mr Cartwright?

740
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,814
- Do you think we could've had 'im?
- What?

741
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:47,609
Suppose that fish hadn't gone wild, sir.

742
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:52,155
You think that aircraft was playing
games? The Japs had us detected.

743
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,824
- The Captain said...
- He's flat on his back.

744
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:57,452
Be better if somebody
had put him there sooner.

745
01:09:57,619 --> 01:10:00,246
- Kohler, get started.
- Mr Cartwright...

746
01:10:00,372 --> 01:10:02,832
This time words just fail me!

747
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:11,925
- It's this way, sir. I...
- Why didn't you stop it?

748
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:14,928
- I didn't know it was gonna happen.
- You let it go on.

749
01:10:15,053 --> 01:10:17,263
- No, sir...
- Then it didn't happen?

750
01:10:17,389 --> 01:10:20,058
If I have to put every crew member
on report, I will!

751
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:22,227
It was my fault, sir.

752
01:10:23,645 --> 01:10:26,940
Go on up to the bridge.
Tell the OD you're on report.

753
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,901
- Sir...
- What did you say?

754
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:33,697
I told you once
to keep your opinions to yourself!

755
01:10:33,822 --> 01:10:35,865
Now get out of here!

756
01:10:35,991 --> 01:10:38,034
Yes, sir.

757
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:45,375
I'm not going to stand for
any fighting or insubordination.

758
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:49,671
If you think you've got a soft touch,
you're mistaken! You hear?

759
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:56,970
Wow! How about that?
Chewing out an officer in front of us!

760
01:10:57,137 --> 01:11:01,266
He was chewing us all out.
What's he so sore at us for?

761
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:09,149
- Turn it up a bit.
- It's OK. Let's leave it.

762
01:11:13,611 --> 01:11:16,364
What are you trying
to do - break the plate?

763
01:11:18,283 --> 01:11:22,412
<i>You are listening once again
to the voice you call Tokyo Rose.</i>

764
01:11:22,537 --> 01:11:24,581
- Turn it off.
- Yes, sir.

765
01:11:24,706 --> 01:11:29,044
<i>I play the music for the wives and
sweethearts of the submarine Nerka.</i>

766
01:11:29,169 --> 01:11:33,089
<i>You'll never see these men again.
The Nerka has been sunk.</i>

767
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:37,302
<i>- It's at the bottom of the Bungo Straits.
- They bought it. They chalked us up.</i>

768
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:41,556
<i>We send our regrets to the relatives
of Captain PJ Richardson,</i>

769
01:11:41,681 --> 01:11:45,226
<i>of officers James Bledsoe,
Gerald Cartwright,</i>

770
01:11:45,352 --> 01:11:47,228
<i>Carl Beckman.</i>

771
01:11:47,354 --> 01:11:50,190
<i>Of seamen Jessie Warner, Kraut Mueller...</i>

772
01:11:50,315 --> 01:11:52,484
- Kraut Mueller? How...
- Listen!

773
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:55,528
<i>You'll never see them again.
Think about it.</i>

774
01:11:55,654 --> 01:11:58,531
<i>Think what your country
has done to these men</i>

775
01:11:58,657 --> 01:12:00,700
<i>as you listen to the music.</i>

776
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:03,286
They even named us!
The officers, the crew!

777
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:05,497
How could they possibly know?

778
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:14,631
- Welsh?
- Yes, sir?

779
01:12:14,756 --> 01:12:17,634
Were any messages sent
after we entered Area 7?

780
01:12:17,759 --> 01:12:20,845
No, sir. We cut off all transmission.
Captain's orders.

781
01:12:20,971 --> 01:12:24,182
No information, no transmitting
of any kind left this boat?

782
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:26,351
That's right, sir.

783
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:37,070
Yes, sir?

784
01:12:37,195 --> 01:12:39,864
Did you ever sign your name
"Kraut" Mueller?

785
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:43,493
Only on that notice I put up
about the Momo destroyer.

786
01:12:48,581 --> 01:12:50,792
- Where's Russo?
- Yes, sir?

787
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:53,837
The trash you put in the sacks -
how do you weight it?

788
01:12:53,962 --> 01:12:57,549
- How do you weight it? Answer me!
- Tin cans, broken tools.

789
01:12:57,674 --> 01:13:01,052
- Anything I can find to weight it down.
- Does it sink?

790
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:03,221
<i>- I think so, sir.
- You think so?</i>

791
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:05,807
I can't say for certain, Mr Bledsoe.

792
01:13:05,932 --> 01:13:08,184
Did you dump any sacks off the Straits?

793
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:10,353
Yes, sir.

794
01:13:14,065 --> 01:13:16,109
What have I done now?

795
01:13:20,947 --> 01:13:22,991
How do you feel?

796
01:13:23,116 --> 01:13:24,951
I'm all right.

797
01:13:25,076 --> 01:13:28,204
Repairs are completed.
We're ready to move.

798
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,373
The crew must be very happy.

799
01:13:33,668 --> 01:13:36,671
Aren't you?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

800
01:13:38,798 --> 01:13:40,842
That's what I wanted.

801
01:13:43,136 --> 01:13:45,180
I see.

802
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:49,601
- You're going back to the Straits.
- That's right.

803
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:51,770
What changed your mind?

804
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:53,980
I found out how they detected us.

805
01:13:54,105 --> 01:13:57,776
Those fishing barges along the coast
have been picking up our garbage.

806
01:13:57,942 --> 01:14:01,237
For the first time,
we have a real advantage.

807
01:14:01,363 --> 01:14:03,198
Sure, Jim.

808
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:05,367
I made the same speech.

809
01:14:05,492 --> 01:14:09,954
But you and I both know that
the odds are still against us.

810
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,000
There's always a calculated risk,
the unknown factor.

811
01:14:16,086 --> 01:14:18,129
Let's not kid ourselves.

812
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:21,466
You're going back
because you've been through it,

813
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:23,635
<i>because you have to go back.</i>

814
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,304
You knew all along I would.

815
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:31,476
Let's say I had a hunch your order
to retreat wouldn't be carried out.

816
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:37,065
OK, Rich.

817
01:14:38,066 --> 01:14:41,361
I guess the real reason I came in here
was to tell you that I...

818
01:14:41,486 --> 01:14:43,363
Good luck, Jim.

819
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:28,241
We know they think we're sunk. There's
no way for them to know we're here.

820
01:15:28,366 --> 01:15:31,661
Every angle has been covered
except the risk of battle.

821
01:15:31,786 --> 01:15:34,039
We're gonna make that risk pay off.

822
01:15:35,915 --> 01:15:37,959
Any more questions?

823
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:41,921
There must be something you wanna ask.

824
01:15:42,088 --> 01:15:44,299
Well, sir, we all thought...

825
01:15:45,759 --> 01:15:48,887
Would you mind
stepping over here a moment, sir?

826
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,144
Be my guest, Mr Bledsoe.

827
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:07,697
Thanks, Kohler. It's a privilege.

828
01:16:23,088 --> 01:16:25,131
Decoy leading as before.

829
01:16:31,179 --> 01:16:33,223
There she is - the Akikaze.

830
01:16:33,348 --> 01:16:36,017
Travelling about 30 knots and coming up.

831
01:16:39,145 --> 01:16:42,023
Stand by to surface.

832
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:45,276
Surface.

833
01:16:52,033 --> 01:16:56,162
<i>What is it, sir?
I can't make that out. What is it, sir?</i>

834
01:16:56,496 --> 01:16:58,707
<i>What is it, sir? I can't make that out.</i>

835
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:31,656
Port side clear, sir.

836
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:33,825
Steady on course 0-5-0.

837
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:37,078
- Due course 0-5-0, sir.
- Very well.

838
01:17:38,413 --> 01:17:40,623
<i>What is it, sir? I can't make that out.</i>

839
01:17:44,502 --> 01:17:47,339
All ahead one third, sir.

840
01:17:47,464 --> 01:17:50,967
Very well. Lookouts, to the bridge!

841
01:17:51,926 --> 01:17:54,262
Mr Cartwright, same plan of action.

842
01:17:54,387 --> 01:17:58,224
We'll attack the last freighter
in the starboard column.

843
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:02,354
When the Akikaze comes in,
we'll give her a bow shot as before.

844
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:04,564
All tubes ready for firing, sir.

845
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:15,116
In firing position.
Good setup on freighter.

846
01:18:15,241 --> 01:18:18,328
- Outer doors open on tubes 1 and 2.
- Fire 1.

847
01:18:18,453 --> 01:18:20,288
Fire 1.

848
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:24,292
- 1 fired, sir.
- 1's away, sir.

849
01:18:25,043 --> 01:18:27,087
Fire 2.

850
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:31,216
- 2 fired, sir.
- 2's away, sir.

851
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:35,011
Left 10-degree rudder.
Come to course 0-4-1.

852
01:19:15,927 --> 01:19:19,597
Akikaze moving up starboard side
of burning freighter.

853
01:19:22,225 --> 01:19:24,269
Bearing on Akikaze.

854
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:29,524
- 0-8-9, sir.
- Come right to course 0-8-9.

855
01:19:29,649 --> 01:19:32,027
Coming right to course 0-8-9, sir.

856
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:34,279
At what range will we fire, sir?

857
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:37,365
1,500 yards. We'll take her
with decks awash.

858
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,701
Shift to battery. All ahead one-third.

859
01:19:39,826 --> 01:19:42,912
Shifting to battery.
All ahead one third, sir.

860
01:19:43,038 --> 01:19:45,498
<i>- Control room.
- Control room, aye aye.</i>

861
01:19:45,623 --> 01:19:47,042
Flood down to 26 feet.

862
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:51,504
Aye aye, sir. Open main ballast
tank vents. Flood down to 26 feet.

863
01:19:53,048 --> 01:19:56,551
- Range to Akikaze?
- Range 2400 yards.

864
01:19:56,676 --> 01:20:00,430
<i>- Use tubes 3 and 4 on this run.
- Tubes 3 and 4. Aye aye, sir.</i>

865
01:20:09,648 --> 01:20:11,691
Rig out bow planes.

866
01:20:22,577 --> 01:20:24,621
Range 2,100 yards.

867
01:20:26,081 --> 01:20:28,333
Open outer doors on tubes 3 and 4.

868
01:20:29,626 --> 01:20:31,836
Stand by to fire tubes 3 and 4.

869
01:20:32,003 --> 01:20:35,131
Ready on tubes 3 and 4.
Outer doors open.

870
01:20:37,926 --> 01:20:39,761
Range 1,800.

871
01:20:39,886 --> 01:20:41,930
Lookouts, below!

872
01:21:00,865 --> 01:21:02,701
Range 1-6-0-0.

873
01:21:04,035 --> 01:21:06,079
Commence firing at 1-5-0-0.

874
01:21:06,204 --> 01:21:07,956
Stand by to fire.

875
01:21:18,883 --> 01:21:20,969
Fire 3.

876
01:21:22,429 --> 01:21:24,514
- 3 fired, sir.
- 3's away, sir.

877
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,891
Fire 4.

878
01:21:27,017 --> 01:21:29,394
- 4 fired, sir.
- 4's away, sir.

879
01:21:29,519 --> 01:21:31,062
Clear the bridge!

880
01:21:32,522 --> 01:21:34,566
Dive! Dive!

881
01:21:40,155 --> 01:21:42,407
15-degree angle. Take her deep!

882
01:21:57,005 --> 01:21:58,631
That's it! We got her!

883
01:22:00,133 --> 01:22:01,635
All ahead one third!

884
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,554
Level off and bring her up
to periscope depth!

885
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:10,268
<i>What is it, sir? I can't make that out.</i>

886
01:22:16,024 --> 01:22:18,068
Take a look.

887
01:22:18,193 --> 01:22:20,654
Sir, listen.

888
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:25,659
That transmission again.
I can't make that out.

889
01:23:10,537 --> 01:23:14,457
Bledsoe! Take her down!
Sound collision! Take her down fast!

890
01:23:14,582 --> 01:23:18,003
Sound collision! All ahead full!
Flood negative! Take her down!

891
01:23:18,128 --> 01:23:20,505
Flood negative! Hard dive on planes!

892
01:23:47,866 --> 01:23:51,077
- Torpedo coming! Another runaway!
- But both were hits!

893
01:23:51,202 --> 01:23:54,956
It's not ours. It's theirs.
It's from another sub.

894
01:23:55,123 --> 01:23:59,044
That's what sunk all our boats.
A Japanese submarine.

895
01:24:15,185 --> 01:24:17,228
She missed us.

896
01:24:18,146 --> 01:24:20,523
Captain, hadn't you better go below?

897
01:24:21,608 --> 01:24:23,652
Passing 90 feet, sir.

898
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:26,154
All ahead one third.

899
01:24:26,821 --> 01:24:28,865
Level off at 120.

900
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,868
Rig ship for silent running.

901
01:24:33,328 --> 01:24:37,457
Shift to manual control. Shut down
ventilation. Secure all machinery.

902
01:24:37,582 --> 01:24:39,918
No unnecessary movement or talking.

903
01:24:49,761 --> 01:24:51,388
Here he is, sir.

904
01:25:42,314 --> 01:25:44,357
I've lost him.

905
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:46,860
They've stopped their motors.

906
01:25:48,028 --> 01:25:50,071
Let's make it a standoff.

907
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:53,783
All stop.

908
01:25:54,409 --> 01:25:56,036
All stopped, sir.

909
01:26:32,364 --> 01:26:36,034
Can't hold her down
too long without some speed.

910
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,370
We'll have to start the motor soon.

911
01:26:38,536 --> 01:26:40,872
Let's hope they start theirs first.

912
01:27:23,123 --> 01:27:26,209
- What was his last true bearing?
- 1-3-5.

913
01:27:27,002 --> 01:27:29,879
The bearing's no good
without knowing his depth.

914
01:27:30,005 --> 01:27:33,591
And we can't get that.
We gotta get him to surface.

915
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:36,720
There's a convoy still up there.

916
01:27:36,845 --> 01:27:40,515
With the Akikaze gone, he'll have to
come up to protect those ships.

917
01:27:40,682 --> 01:27:42,726
Suppose we sink a couple.

918
01:27:44,978 --> 01:27:48,815
- Do I have your permission, sir?
- You're the captain now.

919
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:51,151
- Stand by to surface!
- Standing by!

920
01:27:51,276 --> 01:27:53,903
Secure from sound running and collision!

921
01:27:54,029 --> 01:27:55,864
All ahead full!

922
01:28:05,665 --> 01:28:08,209
Re-Ioad forward tubes when we surface.

923
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:21,806
Shift targets. Angle on the bow
70 starboard, bearing coming down!

924
01:28:21,931 --> 01:28:23,975
Commence firing when set!

925
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:27,395
- Radar, any sign of that sub?
- Not yet, sir.

926
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,649
- Keep a sharp lookout, Johnson!
- Aye aye, sir.

927
01:28:30,774 --> 01:28:32,859
Fire 3.

928
01:28:34,277 --> 01:28:35,987
Fire 4.

929
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:48,249
New radar contact. Bearing 3-0-3 relative.

930
01:28:49,209 --> 01:28:51,252
That should be our friend.

931
01:28:54,172 --> 01:28:56,007
There he is.

932
01:29:01,137 --> 01:29:03,181
He's changing course.

933
01:29:03,306 --> 01:29:06,434
Moving in behind the decoy.
Using it as a screen.

934
01:29:06,559 --> 01:29:09,729
Right standard rudder,
come right to course 0-6-9.

935
01:29:13,066 --> 01:29:14,317
Very well.

936
01:29:14,442 --> 01:29:17,112
That decoy,
you say it has a shallow draught?

937
01:29:17,237 --> 01:29:20,991
Yeah, that's right. We could
shoot under it and hit the sub.

938
01:29:22,033 --> 01:29:26,997
Open outer doors on tubes 5 and 6.
Set torpedo depth at 16 feet.

939
01:29:31,209 --> 01:29:33,253
Steadied on new course, sir!

940
01:29:36,214 --> 01:29:39,301
Range 1-5-0-0. Standing by to fire, sir.

941
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:49,394
He's all yours, Captain.

942
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:55,817
Fire 5.

943
01:29:59,404 --> 01:30:02,407
- 5's away, sir.
- Fire 6.

944
01:30:58,213 --> 01:31:00,757
SJ radar contact! Aircraft coming in fast!

945
01:31:00,882 --> 01:31:03,259
- Clear the deck.
- Lookouts, below!

946
01:31:03,426 --> 01:31:06,680
Hurry! Clear the decks! Stand by to dive!

947
01:31:08,431 --> 01:31:10,058
Dive! Dive!

948
01:31:38,753 --> 01:31:41,840
It's 38 days now
since we left Pearl Harbor.

949
01:31:41,965 --> 01:31:46,094
I know how some of us felt then.
I think I know how some of us feel now.

950
01:31:47,053 --> 01:31:50,181
But let no one here,
no one aboard this boat,

951
01:31:50,307 --> 01:31:52,600
ever say we didn't have a captain.

952
01:31:59,065 --> 01:32:03,403
Unto Almighty God we commend
the soul of our shipmate departed,

953
01:32:03,528 --> 01:32:07,699
and we commit his body to the deep
in the sure and certain hope

954
01:32:07,824 --> 01:32:10,493
of the resurrection unto eternal life

955
01:32:10,618 --> 01:32:15,040
when the sea shall give up her dead
in the life of the world to come.
