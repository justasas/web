POLICE RESIDENCE

6
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,496
Hello!

7
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,120
Sir, the car has come
and is waiting downstairs.

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,828
Okay.

9
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:59,952
Hey, pass the towel.

10
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,910
I'm asking you for the towel.

11
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,535
Hey!

12
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:28,743
There is hardly any sugar in this.

13
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:31,367
There is no sugar.
What can be done?

14
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,783
Who are you? Damn it!

15
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:37,824
Are you looking for your gun?

16
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,282
Are you trying to call the police?

17
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:47,323
I will help you.
Hello, police darling!

18
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:50,655
CI Sharma got kidnapped
from his apartment.

19
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:53,571
Hey, what do you
think of the police?

20
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:02,154
Pack up!

21
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,945
- What happened, brother?
- We forgot the keys upstairs.

22
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,653
- What a silly thing!
- I will go and get it.

23
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:25,069
If one gets to do the final action,
it gives great joy.

24
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,152
Thanks, darling.

25
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:39,693
Hey Laxman, not that side,
go to the fifth floor.

26
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:40,859
- Come on, hurry up!
- Okay, sir.

27
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:47,692
- Something happened here.
- Some sound is coming from inside.

28
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,941
- Crap! Krishna, check up over here.
- Okay, sir.

29
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:01,149
Crap!

30
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:14,940
This morning some unidentified miscreants
kidnapped Bowenpalli CI Sharma.

31
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:18,023
The kidnappers wore masks
of famous Telugu film heroes.

32
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:21,356
Are the kidnappings that happened fourteen
years ago repeating again?

33
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:24,480
Are you conducting some special
training courses for the kidnappers?

34
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,479
How are they managing it in such
a planned and organized manner?

35
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,270
- How much did they demand?
- One crore, sir.

36
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,227
One crore?!

37
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:32,768
He is our man.

38
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:37,809
Give whatever they ask
and settle the matter.

39
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,141
- Where are you?
- We came to buy pizzas.

40
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:43,765
- Do it fast.
- Okay, sir.

41
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:48,598
- There is a cellar next to the stairs.
- There is one, sir.

42
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:51,181
Put the money in the pizza bag next to it
and tell me the number of the vehicle.

43
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,430
Okay, sir.

44
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,138
AP09 AS 1234, sir.

45
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:04,888
AP09 AS 1234.
Stop the pizza bike immediately.

46
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:08,845
Breaking up is normal
and quite common these days.

47
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,761
It takes some time.

48
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,636
AP09 AS 1234.

49
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,427
A person started driving the bike
that you mentioned, sir.

50
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,093
Keep following him
without missing out.

51
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:29,843
Just keep following him.

52
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:31,634
Okay, sir.

53
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,550
He has taken a left turn
at the journalist colony.

54
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,591
- He's going towards the lake.
- Keep following him.

55
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,465
He parked the bike and is going towards
the garbage heap with the money bag.

56
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:48,172
I'll be on the phone.
You catch him and recover the money.

57
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:50,255
It seems that he realized
that I am following him.

58
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:51,421
He is unloading himself.

59
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:52,629
Hands up!

60
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,086
Turn this side.

61
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,085
Did you catch him?

62
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,376
Sir, the matter is..
It may not be nice if we catch him.

63
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:04,167
- What is the matter?
- It is--

64
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,250
Stop! Stop right there!

65
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,458
Sir, if you want a pizza,
you must order over the phone.

66
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,666
- You must not snatch like this.
- This too is an order.. law and order!

67
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:21,582
Stop!

68
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,956
This is the number
that sir mentioned.

69
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,039
- Sir!
- Hello!

70
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,580
We found the vehicle
with number 1234.

71
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:27,954
1234.

72
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:31,537
Hello!

73
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,328
We caught the pizza bike
with number 1234.

74
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:35,744
1234 again!

75
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:55,327
Sir, tell me.

76
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,368
He gave the same number
to all the bikes and fooled us.

77
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,201
Here the signal is a bit week, sir.

78
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:02,492
Don't let any vehicle off till I come.

79
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,116
Hello!

80
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,157
- Hello. Hey, wait.
- I'm speaking to you.

81
00:06:10,198 --> 00:06:11,323
Get lost.

82
00:06:11,406 --> 00:06:14,489
Bhadram,
don't let any vehicle go till I come.

83
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,280
I should not let any vehicle go?!

84
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:18,946
Okay, sir.

85
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:28,112
1234.

86
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,361
Sir!

87
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,236
Sir!

88
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:55,193
He won't come on time at all!

89
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:01,317
Will he come...

90
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:02,733
...or not?

91
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:08,858
Will he come...

92
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:11,108
...or not?

93
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:20,899
- "It's a mad world!"
- Tell me.

94
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,315
Your marriage is to happen
in 10 minutes.. where are you?

95
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:25,023
Any problem if I arrive there in 9 mins?

96
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:27,689
All the guests have come
and are waiting for you.. come quickly.

97
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:28,897
I must increase the speed in that case.

98
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:47,188
Here he comes.. hey, wait.

99
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:52,479
Where is the ring?

100
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:54,978
I am asking you where the ring is.

101
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:57,519
Here it is.

102
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,269
C'mon, everybody inside..
C'mon.

103
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:05,935
You brought it at the right time..
superb!

104
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,309
The marriage isn't cancelled because
he brought the ring in time.

105
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:09,517
Alas!

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,058
- Where is he?
- Hey, come on.

107
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:13,933
No!

108
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:15,724
She broke up with me...

109
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,890
...and the foolish girl got me
to buy the ring for her marriage!

110
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,348
- Drop the both of them.
- What?!

111
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:23,764
Sorry, I left them.

112
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,180
Raja Harishchandra Prasad.

113
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:27,554
How come you have breakups
with so many girls?

114
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,886
<i>"I am an emperor who
does not make compromises."</i>

115
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:05,802
<i>"Oh God, no girl falls for me."</i>

116
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:10,760
<i>"I never lie to my girlfriends."</i>

117
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:15,551
<i>"That is my virtue,
what is wrong with it."</i>

118
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:23,301
<i>"Oh girl, I always speak the truth
and this nature has brought me doom."</i>

119
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:33,133
<i>"You told the facts to your girlfriend...
your friendship stands broken."</i>

120
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:40,507
<i>"I am an emperor who
does not make compromises."</i>

121
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,381
<i>"Oh God, no girl falls for me."</i>

122
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,005
I saw her.

123
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,796
I love you, dad.

124
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:57,045
It is a blank check.

125
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:59,669
Hey, how is the birthday party
that I arranged?

126
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:02,335
Forget the party.. whose dress
between the both of us is better?

127
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,001
Your dress is crap and
your friend's one is superb!

128
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,167
What happened?

129
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,625
She slapped me since
I told the truth.

130
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,291
Oh... so sweet!

131
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:23,707
<i>"I told the truth that her face,
looks, shoes and nails are not good."</i>

132
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:33,498
<i>"When the lover's father inquired,
I gave proof that I am jobless."</i>

133
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:39,122
<i>"On learning the truth, the girl
got angry and changed her address."</i>

134
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,996
<i>"In that manner I lost my lover."</i>

135
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,995
<i>"You told the facts to your girlfriend."</i>

136
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,828
<i>"Your friendship stands broken."</i>

137
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,786
- Thank you, papa!
- Hey, careful!

138
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:31,118
<i>"Things work out well
if you praise anyone."</i>

139
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:35,284
<i>"The beautiful girl is approaching."</i>

140
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:44,866
<i>"When I create my magic
all girls fall for me."</i>

141
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:50,615
<i>"When my eyes meet hers
I get the feeling of floating in the air."</i>

142
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:54,281
<i>"Why should I tell the truth
and cause my love to fail."</i>

143
00:11:55,614 --> 00:12:00,489
<i>"You didn't tell lies to your girlfriend."</i>

144
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:04,697
<i>"What if your friendship is broken."</i>

145
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,363
<i>"You didn't tell lies to your girlfriend."</i>

146
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:14,821
<i>"What if your friendship is broken."</i>

147
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:19,529
Cousin! Cousin!
Please open the window.

148
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:20,862
Wait!

149
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,361
Go and enjoy.

150
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:26,902
Thanks, cousin. I wish that you
get a lovely figure like me.

151
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,152
- Get lost!
- Good morning, sir.

152
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:31,610
- Tell me what the matter is.
- It is about an insurance policy.

153
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:32,901
I will call you later.

154
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,983
Brother! Brother!

155
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:38,107
- Do you have sugar complaint?
- How do you know that?

156
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,582
Because you cannot
control going to the loo.

157
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:40,873
- Hey!
- Get lost!

158
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,706
These people must be bashed.

159
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:46,122
Do you all in the city
have sugar complaint?

160
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:02,413
- You will all have a hard time.
- Hey!

161
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:04,246
Drive the car fast.

162
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:06,620
- They are coming, go fast.
- Madam!

163
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,745
You must have mistaken this
to be an auto. It is a Nano car.

164
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:11,202
That is an auto and this a Nano.

165
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,493
This is a Nano and that is an auto.

166
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:17,659
Please get down from the car.

167
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:19,617
Please!
The traffic is jammed. Hello!

168
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,741
Oh my God!
My Nano car! Who the hell was that?

169
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,282
Do you think that this road
belongs to your dad.

170
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:25,448
Why did you park the car in the middle!

171
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,114
Who are you to tell me to get lost?

172
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,405
How dare you hit my car?!

173
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:30,279
What do you think of yourselves?

174
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:34,028
Where are you taking my car?
Take your leg off the accelerator.

175
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:35,694
- I am removing my leg.
- Do it soon!

176
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:46,693
Why are they chasing you?

177
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:48,192
If they catch me
I will be forced to marry.

178
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:50,442
It seems that I am the one
who is going to suffer.

179
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,483
Can we escape in
this rat-sized car?

180
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:55,315
Cats cannot enter
the holes that rats can!

181
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,147
That's my baby Nano!

182
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,397
Oh crap!

183
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:11,271
- Go back quickly!
- Don't shout!

184
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,146
Hey, stay in your seat
or you will die.

185
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:30,895
They are coming close.

186
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,228
Her dress is flying
out of the car. See it.

187
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:38,644
Hold the steering.

188
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,310
- Hold the steering.
- Okay.

189
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:43,809
Take this and cut it.

190
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,600
- What should I cut?
- Cut it!

191
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,516
Cut the dress that
is flying out of the car.

192
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,557
Go fast!

193
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:07,557
Hey! Why did you put the tanker
in the middle of the road?

194
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,681
Wonâ€™t you let people pass?

195
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:11,139
- How long will it take, bro?
- 10 min.

196
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:14,013
Hey! Come in.. let us sit
in a jolly way inside the car.

197
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:16,429
Why do you say jolly when we are
in trouble? First get out of the car.

198
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,678
Get out. Out now.

199
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,594
My girl, did you escape
from your marriage ceremony?

200
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:24,593
What is it my boy?

201
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,926
Yes, we just saw a love movie
and decided to elope!

202
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,300
Go and mind your business.

203
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:30,133
- Go on now.
- Take good care of the girl.

204
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:31,841
Who should I take good care of?
Your daughter or this girl?

205
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:35,882
Who are you in the first place
and why did you enter my car?

206
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:37,048
Clarify it to me.

207
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:41,714
It seems that I did not cry
when I was born.

208
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:46,422
My father wrapped me in
a blue towel and held me close.

209
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:47,880
Stop your nonsense.

210
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,546
I did not say that to you. Go on.

211
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:51,337
What are you talking about?

212
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,378
You were the one who asked me
to clarify everything.

213
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,252
That is why I am saying the entire story!

214
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:56,293
You are a legend.

215
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:59,334
Just tell me why you
entered my car in this dress.

216
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,500
- Tell me quickly!
- So strange!

217
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,458
Whenever I fall in love with someone
they get married before I could propose.

218
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,291
The same thing happened with Yusuf.

219
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:13,248
It got repeated again
with Jaswinder Singh.

220
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:14,539
It fits you.

221
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:16,997
- At the same time--
- What happened?

222
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:19,330
I met Joseph.

223
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,204
Why did I fall in love with Joseph when
there are so many others in the world?

224
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:26,120
He was my English professor.

225
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:29,870
Everyone used to bunk going to college.

226
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:33,244
But I used to bunk going home
and go around him.

227
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,118
One day I thought of proposing to him
and sought the blessings of all gods.

228
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:53,534
In the world--

229
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:54,617
Why did you fall in love
only with Joseph...

230
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,741
...when there are so many
others in the world?

231
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:58,949
Is that all? It would be better
if you ask this to him instead of me.

232
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:03,990
I have an idea.

233
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,406
If the wedding dress goes missing,
the marriage is postponed.

234
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:11,030
That's why I stole the wedding dress,
escaped from them and got into your car.

235
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,863
When there are so many love stories
in the world, why is only yours so bad?

236
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,696
- Is that so?
- Yes!

237
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,737
Give me your phone.

238
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,653
- Give me your phone.
- I am giving it. Will you kill me?

239
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,027
What is she going to do?

240
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,318
- Hello!
- Hello!

241
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,234
- Tell me, Priya!
- Did the marriage get cancelled?

242
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,400
- What actually happened was--
- Just wait a minute.

243
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:32,732
Tell me now.

244
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:36,315
Mad girl, would the marriage get cancelled
just because you stole the wedding dress?

245
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:37,731
The marriage was over long ago.

246
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:39,022
It is my turn.

247
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:43,354
- But still--
- Alas! Please check whom you are hitting.

248
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,020
You get lost!

249
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:47,144
Did you not find one
telugu boy to fall in love?

250
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:50,352
How is that possible when
everyone maintains 2-3 girls?

251
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:54,185
- What about your love story?
- Love?!

252
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,018
When Soundarya entered my life,
my heart beat fast...

253
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:02,059
...and my phone got busy too!

254
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:04,308
- What are all these gifts?
- They are all for Soundarya.

255
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:05,391
I am going there now.

256
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:08,974
<i>"Wherever I am I always
feel like being beside you."</i>

257
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,098
Isn't that so?

258
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:12,222
I see Soundarya everywhere.

259
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:15,722
There.. There.. And here!

260
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,596
Oh God.. Soundarya!

261
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,387
Alas! My Soundarya!

262
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,845
She is my Soundarya! Soundarya!

263
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:27,344
Who is he?

264
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:29,135
All the jewelry set that I gave you!

265
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,926
Soundarya... it is me Raja!

266
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:37,425
Soundarya!
Hello... Please wait, Soundarya!

267
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:50,174
- Okay.
- There... Here.

268
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,465
Where is your Soundarya?

269
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,089
Having faith in girls is
like keeping a bomb in the pocket.

270
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,255
It can blast any time.

271
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:01,712
My love did not get set because
I did not find the right girl.

272
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:04,503
Otherwise I too would
have been happy like them.

273
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,960
What type of girl
does the Master prefer?

274
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,960
It is enough if it is a girl...
Why need more options?

275
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:16,876
What type of boy do you want?

276
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:22,917
His body should be strong
and his heart should be soft.

277
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,708
He should be a software engineer.

278
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,957
But I am 10th fail!

279
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:42,457
All newspapers
and news channels say that...

280
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:47,539
...how can those who cannot save
themselves, save the people!

281
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:52,247
We need to do something
before the issue becomes serious.

282
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,080
Sir, I believe that Dilip is
the correct person for this case.

283
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,038
Dilip means--

284
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,121
Do you remember that...

285
00:19:58,204 --> 00:20:00,245
...a few years ago kidnappings by masked
men happened in the same manner.

286
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:03,744
At that time they didn't stop at one
or two and even kidnapped MLA Govindaraju.

287
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:06,535
When the entire government
was feeling the heat...

288
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:08,784
...Dilip Kumar was the person
who easily solved that case.

289
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,117
He is the correct
person for this case.

290
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:14,075
Call him right now.

291
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,241
- Hello!
- Sir has come to the old police station.

292
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:28,990
What?!
The commissioner has come there?

293
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:44,114
What is he doing?

294
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:46,155
He is making a list from old files...

295
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:47,654
...assuming that the kidnapper
must be an old criminal.

296
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,779
<i>"It is all clear so beat it."</i>

297
00:20:51,237 --> 00:20:52,903
<i>"Just beat it."</i>

298
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:56,653
<i>"You better do it when you can."</i>

299
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:59,986
<i>"Don't want to see you idle, macho man."</i>

300
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:03,360
<i>"You wanna be there better do it."</i>

301
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:05,068
<i>"So beat it."</i>

302
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:11,067
Come along!

303
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:14,358
Dasanna, listen to me once!

304
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,316
Hey, tell us the truth!

305
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:18,607
Sir... what I mean is.--

306
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:22,790
They are not the kidnappers.
It is a waste of energy bashing them.

307
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:23,956
Hey, mind your business!

308
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:26,955
- Tell me the truth!
- I don't know anything.

309
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,496
Tell me who did it!

310
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:32,662
We have checked all of them.
Only Basavayya remains.

311
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:34,495
Where will he go?

312
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:36,119
We will catch him for sure.

313
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:39,118
Basavayya!

314
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,951
- 9!
- 6!

315
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:52,950
- I say 9.
- Make it 6 rupees.

316
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:55,658
You don't bargain for condoms
but do so for vegetables!

317
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:01,407
Hey! Why do you speak and dress like that?

318
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:02,782
It is not just appearance
but a necessity.

319
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:04,948
How many days should
we run this market?

320
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,489
I want to enter the software
field and try my luck.

321
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:08,988
Who threw the stone?!

322
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,362
Hit and miss!

323
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:14,737
Luck is not enough..
you need brains too for it.

324
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,903
It means that the boy
has all the qualities.

325
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:21,486
He is a strong person
with a soft heart...

326
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:23,527
...we only need to find whether
he is a software engineer or not.

327
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,902
You didn't tell me why
you dressed up like this.

328
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:29,401
It is...
I found the girl of my heart.

329
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:31,567
Is that all?

330
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,108
She is not a part-time affair
but more like a life-time thing.

331
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:38,941
Father will like him.
Once you see him for yourself...

332
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,107
...you too will appreciate him.

333
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:43,273
Let's check it out.

334
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:46,897
<i>"This is a bottle gourd!"</i>

335
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,521
How much is the bottle gourd for?

336
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:51,520
- 9!
- 6!

337
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,728
I am saying that is costs 9!

338
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:58,311
Raja!

339
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:05,893
His brains are bust!

340
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:11,434
What a fantastic guy!

341
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,267
- A wasteful life!
- What happened?

342
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:16,808
I would have hanged myself
had this tie been a little longer.

343
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:19,349
You won't gain anything
if you feel sorry like this.

344
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,807
I feel like crying.

345
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,431
This time I will give you a great idea.

346
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:25,222
- What is it?
- Love!

347
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,388
That is a useless thing.

348
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:29,304
Enough of the depression that
he suffered due to the ideas you gave him.

349
00:23:29,804 --> 00:23:31,012
I will give the idea now.

350
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:33,345
Uncle, this is not of the old generation.

351
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:34,844
This is the age of the new generation.

352
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,926
Be it old generation or the new one,
the ramp walk is still the same.

353
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:47,676
Who is the fool that
gave you the software idea?

354
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,384
Yeah! It is me of course.

355
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:51,758
Tell me once again!

356
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:55,174
What does it matter
if he is not a software engineer?

357
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:58,215
It seems that they have
4 to 5 shops in the market.

358
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:00,964
His daddy must surely be very rich.

359
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:03,047
He can start a software
company with that money.

360
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:05,796
And I can convince
my father easily.

361
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:08,295
Raja!

362
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:12,294
When you speak to girls,
only your honesty must be visible.

363
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:18,127
If you try to show something else,
there won't be a second meeting.

364
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:19,627
Oh!

365
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,418
What should I do now, daddy?

366
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:23,667
You should go
and meet that girl immediately.

367
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:27,250
Is he like some movie hero
to appear immediately before me?

368
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,749
- Where is chicken?
- Over here!

369
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,123
Hi girls... greetings!

370
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:35,206
- Raja sir.
- No!

371
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:36,497
- Raja.
- I'm coming.

372
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,663
- Excuse me, biryani.
- You want biryani.. Just a second.

373
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:42,079
I like this since childhood.

374
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:44,078
- Please take this and enjoy.
- Thanks.

375
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:47,078
Sambar.

376
00:24:48,494 --> 00:24:49,660
I love social service.

377
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,409
- Here.
- Over there.

378
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:56,658
Look over there.

379
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,240
What is that?

380
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:01,656
Oh!

381
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:03,447
You too eat here?

382
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,821
Oh.. so you work over here.. Okay!

383
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:11,404
Hey, Sunny!

384
00:25:13,237 --> 00:25:15,737
This is the dress my dad brought
from Singapore.

385
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,445
It is oversized for me. You wear it,
girls will fall over for you.

386
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:21,944
Hey!

387
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:23,485
Stop your recollection.

388
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:26,901
Every dialog that you
speak should impress the girl.

389
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,359
Okay, I'll handle it.

390
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:31,275
My heart has a liking for you.

391
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:35,149
And I like your heart too.

392
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,940
<i>"This heart of mine."</i>

393
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,898
<i>"Don't melt it and leave."</i>

394
00:25:43,981 --> 00:25:46,022
What magic did you do, darling?

395
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:47,938
I didn't do any magic.

396
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,896
You are the one who
is imagining things.

397
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:53,312
Why don't you have
some more pieces?

398
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:54,812
They may charge extra for it.

399
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:58,728
This is an unlimited buffet...
you can eat as much as you want.

400
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,852
You are already fat..
eat in a limited way now.

401
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:14,935
When I look at you,
I get intoxicated as if drunk.

402
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:17,934
My eyes start to wink
and legs shudder.

403
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:21,058
I feel like I fell in love at last.

404
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:26,307
Your poetry is better than
that of the great poet Kalidas.

405
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,681
- I write poems... do you read poems?
- No!

406
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:34,264
He is acting over-smart.
I shall set him right.

407
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:40,846
- Ladyfingers 20 rupees a kilo!
- No... it is only 9... 9! 9!

408
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:55,679
This is not a market, Mr. Raja!
It is a restaurant.

409
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:56,970
It is indeed.

410
00:26:58,011 --> 00:26:59,719
I'm always busy in making market software.

411
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:01,927
I do it as a hobby for my dad.

412
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,176
Actually,
the entire market belongs to us.

413
00:27:05,842 --> 00:27:07,133
What is the name of
your software company?

414
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:11,340
Dull.. Dull Private Limited.

415
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:12,547
Where is it?

416
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,505
In high-tech city..
Very far from the city.

417
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:15,921
Where is it located in high-tech city?

418
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:18,046
Why is she asking so many questions?

419
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:19,628
Do you know the place called Silpa Ramam?

420
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,252
- Is it located there?
- Not there.

421
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,001
Do you know the KFC next to it?

422
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:24,209
I know that. Is it there?

423
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:28,542
Not there. Do you know
the Cream Stone next to it?

424
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,292
- I don't know that.
- That is exactly where it is located.

425
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,125
The ice cream there is very good.

426
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,416
Do you want to
order some ice cream?

427
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:40,707
You must be able to guess her taste
before she tells you. Go ahead!

428
00:27:41,082 --> 00:27:42,165
I will have a blast.

429
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:43,789
Let me guess your taste.

430
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:50,371
Vanilla delight with
extra sauce and extra nuts.

431
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:56,454
Vanilla delight with
extra sauce and extra nuts.

432
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:05,703
Now let me guess yours.

433
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:10,411
Strawberry delight with
extra nuts and chocolate sauce?

434
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,493
Good for nothing!

435
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:35,034
How is my costume?
Doesn't it look great?

436
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:36,575
It looks fantastic.

437
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,574
Go and manage that fatso.
My work will become easier.

438
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:42,490
You go on. I will handle her.

439
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:45,240
I will tell it concisely
and accurately.

440
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,948
There is a flower and the bee.
Why does the bee go around the flower?

441
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:49,698
Let me ask one more thing.

442
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:53,656
There is a balloon and there is air.
Why does air go inside the balloon?

443
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:55,697
There is this plate
and there is your head.

444
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,530
What will happen
if I bash your head with this plate?

445
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:58,821
What would happen?

446
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,862
It seems that your friend is very busy.
Shall we go?

447
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:04,403
Okay!

448
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:08,027
Man, these are your car keys.

449
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,068
Bye!

450
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:16,443
Bye!

451
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:32,484
Idea.

452
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,608
- What you should now do is--
- I got it.

453
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,524
If I remove the air from my bike tires,
I can go with her in her car.

454
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,708
Is that so? I understood it.

455
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,458
Hey, you have grown smart.

456
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,082
Go away and stop your comments.

457
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,081
Raja!

458
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:51,706
My car is not starting. If you don't
mind will you drop me on your bike?

459
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:53,622
One second!

460
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:14,621
Sir, she is your daughter.

461
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,829
Do you want me to stop the car?

462
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,079
Drive on!

463
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,078
Sir.

464
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:45,327
The kidnapper Basavayya is not revealing
the truth even after we bashed him.

465
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:48,534
Good morning, sir.

466
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:54,117
Sir, please don't do anything to me.

467
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:55,658
- Sit down.
- Please, sir.

468
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:57,491
Don't worry and sit down.

469
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:58,699
Laxman, bring me that file

470
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,240
- Tea?
- No need, sir.

471
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:02,031
- Would you prefer coffee?
- No, sir.

472
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:06,489
There is no link between
those kidnappings and me.

473
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:08,655
I stopped all such things
and am managing my business.

474
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:10,529
I too am thinking the same.
Sign here.

475
00:31:10,862 --> 00:31:12,070
As you say, sir.

476
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:14,820
As you say, sir.

477
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:17,361
Sir.

478
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,277
Get one cup of milk.

479
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:24,901
Sir, please don't beat me.

480
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:26,901
You just signed on the paper confessing
that you did the kidnappings.

481
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:28,359
Now you want milk!

482
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:30,025
He is the only one
remaining in the list.

483
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:32,275
If he is kicked hard,
he will confess the truth.

484
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:33,316
Okay, I take your leave.

485
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,940
Sir, he is innocent.

486
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:37,773
There is no connection
between him and the kidnappings.

487
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:38,981
I know that.

488
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,647
I know how to connect
and correct things.

489
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,605
- Sir, What I mean is--
- Call for the press.

490
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:50,062
Okay.

491
00:31:50,853 --> 00:31:52,436
Hey man..
Switch on the TV.

492
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:58,061
The new police commissioner is about to
speak about the kidnappings in the city.

493
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:01,102
The case of the kidnapping
of Bowenpalli CI Sharma...

494
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:04,268
...and in the case of the kidnapping
of the PA of Minister Govindaraj...

495
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:06,101
...we captured the main
kidnapper of those cases.

496
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:08,601
Now people will get
to hear about kidnappings...

497
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:10,975
...only in movies and in dictionaries.
People wonâ€™t see them in real life.

498
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,266
- Sir!
- What is it?

499
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,015
We got news that another
MLA Munuswamy has been kidnapped.

500
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:15,597
Why don't you speak loudly?

501
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Sir, It seems that they kidnapped
MLA Munuswamy.

502
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:18,888
Oh God!

503
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,096
News we just received.

504
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:23,262
The city has been put on red alert
after the kidnapping of MLA Munuswamy.

505
00:32:23,345 --> 00:32:25,720
Is the officer Dilip who solved
many kidnapping cases earlier...

506
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:27,261
...checkmated this time?

507
00:32:28,886 --> 00:32:31,052
Had that kidnapper
kidnapped you and me...

508
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:32,801
...the torture from above
could have been avoided.

509
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:34,633
Sir, please listen to me.

510
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:37,007
The kidnappings which started with the
police are now targeting politicians.

511
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:38,715
Hey! Put the phone down.

512
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:46,923
Hey, release Basavayya.

513
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:52,964
I told him earlier that
this person is not the kidnapper.

514
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,713
But no one cared to listen to me.

515
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:57,504
What are you mumbling to yourself?
Come here.

516
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:00,003
Nothing, sir.

517
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:02,086
I was just saying that I mentioned
earlier that he is not the kidnapper.

518
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:04,585
In that case tell me about
the kidnappers and I will listen.

519
00:33:05,835 --> 00:33:08,460
Sir, they are not
some ordinary kidnappers.

520
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:13,085
It seems that they are not
doing it for cash or such things.

521
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:16,001
There seems to be a police
point of view in their deeds.

522
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,125
What do you suggest that we do now?

523
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,207
Please give me a minute.

524
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,873
Dasanna, I have a dry throat.
Get me a cup of tea.

525
00:33:24,248 --> 00:33:26,831
Sir, we should not think
like policeman for some time.

526
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,914
We must think like the
kidnappers do to catch them.

527
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,705
- Interesting!
- Thanks.

528
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,371
Sir I have a plan. Can I say it?

529
00:33:35,454 --> 00:33:38,245
- First listen to my plan.
- Tell me, sir.

530
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:42,619
Take an auto from here
and go to RTC crossroads.

531
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:44,452
Eat a biryani in
hotel Bawarchi there...

532
00:33:44,993 --> 00:33:49,076
...it seems that they are selling tickets
in black in the movie hall opposite to it.

533
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:52,950
Go and take care of them.

534
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:58,407
He wants tea!

535
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:02,365
Father, check!

536
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:05,489
What do you want it for?
To propose to someone?

537
00:34:07,155 --> 00:34:09,571
She put her hand on me here.

538
00:34:09,654 --> 00:34:12,112
- Is that so?
- Oh boy, do you have snake gourd?

539
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:16,403
I want some big sized ones.

540
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:18,235
- You want only big ones?
- Yes.

541
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:19,943
Get lost from here!

542
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:26,651
Just because she put her hand on you, do
you think that she's ready to marry you?

543
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,567
I'm not just thinking.
It is a fact!

544
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,900
When I put my hand on his shoulder
I got a positive reaction.

545
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:34,024
- She may have got used to it!
- What did you say?

546
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:38,482
If so many girls deserted him,
it means that...

547
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:41,856
...there is some
problem with the boy.

548
00:34:42,189 --> 00:34:45,605
The must observe him closely
and do the correct analysis.

549
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:47,896
Do you suggest that
I should buy a good calculator?

550
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:51,979
I love you Geeta.
I love you so much.

551
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:56,728
Bye!

552
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,852
- Who are you talking to over the phone?
- Geeta!

553
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:01,977
- Who is she?
- My mother.

554
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,643
- Your mom?
- Yes, my mother.

555
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:07,726
Dad, I asked you for some idea
but you are watching a movie.

556
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:10,226
I think--

557
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:16,475
Every time that you are with that girl
I shall call you using the name Bujji.

558
00:35:16,558 --> 00:35:18,266
- Okay.
- You should talk to me.

559
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,890
- Talk to you?!
- I mean you should talk to Bujji.

560
00:35:19,973 --> 00:35:22,098
In a close and romantic manner.

561
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,430
If she feels jealous like the heroine of
the movie then you must use that reaction.

562
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:29,763
What should I do with that reaction?

563
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,595
Put up a romantic expression on your face.

564
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:42,136
- Who are you scaring?
- It is a romantic expression.

565
00:35:42,386 --> 00:35:44,677
It feels like violence
and not romance.

566
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,218
Okay, one more important thing.

567
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:48,051
You must use all your experience.

568
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:49,384
But don't repeat any of those things.

569
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:51,300
- All the...
- Best!

570
00:35:51,675 --> 00:35:52,883
Yes!

571
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:57,590
<i>"Bad boys bad boys. Whatcha gonna do."</i>

572
00:35:57,673 --> 00:35:59,881
<i>"Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?"</i>

573
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:00,964
Bujji!

574
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:02,797
<i>"Whatcha gonna do."</i>

575
00:36:04,672 --> 00:36:06,588
Oh! Is he his girlfriend?

576
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:08,713
Why is she calling so many times?

577
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:12,463
It seems that this plan might work out.

578
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:15,963
- It's very hot here.
- You got a phone call.

579
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:17,795
Must be some useless fellow.

580
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:19,128
Someone by the name Bujji.

581
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,877
Bujji called?! Oh my dear Bujji!

582
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:24,501
- I shall call her back.. hello!
- Who is this Bujji?

583
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,751
Oh God!
Don't you know who Bujji is?

584
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:29,667
Come on I will tell you.

585
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:44,542
<i>"Once upon a time there was a girl."</i>

586
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,541
<i>"She became my friend unexpectedly."</i>

587
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:57,457
<i>"Once upon a time there was a girl."</i>

588
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,665
<i>"She became my friend unexpectedly."</i>

589
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:04,331
<i>"She has a slim waist
and is like a golden doll."</i>

590
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:07,664
<i>"She has got piercing looks."</i>

591
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:11,247
<i>"She dresses up well
and looks very cute."</i>

592
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,663
<i>"That is my dear Bujji."</i>

593
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:18,037
<i>"That is my cute Bujji."</i>

594
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,495
<i>"That is the Bujji of my heart."</i>

595
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:24,911
<i>"That is my little beauty Bujji."</i>

596
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,702
Bujji! Bujji! Bujji!

597
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:28,284
Bujji!

598
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:30,408
I am not Bujji... It is his Bujji.

599
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:44,907
This is superb!

600
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,365
<i>"She is like a clever bird."</i>

601
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,697
<i>"You may want to have some cool drink."</i>

602
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:55,738
<i>"Bujji is a lively young girl."</i>

603
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:58,904
<i>"She is like a cute little puppy."</i>

604
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:02,403
<i>"She is like a teddy
bear with soft cheeks."</i>

605
00:38:02,653 --> 00:38:05,819
<i>"She is like a cute
baby saying cute words."</i>

606
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,443
<i>"She is the one that
I made friends with."</i>

607
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:12,859
<i>"She called me to meet in
the evening and I shall meet her."</i>

608
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:16,275
<i>"She is my cute Bujji."</i>

609
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:19,649
<i>"She is my Bujji
who drives me mad."</i>

610
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:23,208
<i>"She is the Bujji of my heart."</i>

611
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:26,666
<i>"She is my dear little Bujji."</i>

612
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:53,582
<i>"She is lovely like an angel
but her anger is real danger."</i>

613
00:38:54,207 --> 00:39:00,832
<i>"She is short tempered and
speaks straight from the heart."</i>

614
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:07,832
<i>"She is a hummingbird who sings sweetly
and is also explosive like a bomb."</i>

615
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:14,706
<i>"She always wins whenever she fights
and has always the upper hand."</i>

616
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:18,080
<i>"She is my cute Bujji."</i>

617
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:21,538
<i>"She is the Bujji who drives me mad."</i>

618
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:24,954
<i>"She is my cute Bujji."</i>

619
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:28,412
<i>"She is the Bujji who drives me mad."</i>

620
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:31,828
<i>"Once upon a time there was a girl."</i>

621
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,244
<i>"She became my friend unexpectedly."</i>

622
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:38,743
<i>"She is my cute Bujji."</i>

623
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:40,367
<i>- "She is the Bujji who drives me mad'
- Bujji!."</i>

624
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,116
Bujji! Bujji!

625
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:45,532
<i>"She is the Bujji of my heart."</i>

626
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:47,073
What happened?

627
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:48,281
My heart is burning.

628
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:50,030
- What is the reason?
- Bujji!

629
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:52,529
The heart is burning! It is not!

630
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,903
I don't understand this, dad.

631
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:59,110
Even if your heart is burning
stay calm like a cucumber.

632
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:01,359
In that case,
we should not stop with words.

633
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,108
We should do something more.
You go now.

634
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:05,691
They started a game.
Let us hit back now.

635
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:08,107
Bujji and victory shall
always be with you.

636
00:40:13,232 --> 00:40:15,148
- Are you Bujji?
- My name is Masala Manga.

637
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:18,522
Hey!

638
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,271
Are you Bujji?

639
00:40:22,062 --> 00:40:23,312
I am not Bujji.

640
00:40:24,562 --> 00:40:25,978
This is the dress for Bujji.

641
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:28,727
You spoke about some surprise but are
asking for the prices of these clothes.

642
00:40:30,768 --> 00:40:31,851
Bujji.

643
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:35,350
<i>"She is my dear Bujji."</i>

644
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,058
- "She is my cute Bujji."
- Bujji!

645
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:41,641
<i>- Yeah!
- "My dear Bujji."</i>

646
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:43,182
My Bujji!

647
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:44,390
- My dear.
- Bujji!

648
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:46,014
Enough of it. Don't over do it.

649
00:40:46,097 --> 00:40:47,722
- Okay!
- Priya.

650
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:50,222
- She is my Bujji.
- Priya!

651
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:51,430
Hello!

652
00:40:51,513 --> 00:40:54,388
We can exchange greetings later.
There is a discount sale going on.

653
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:57,221
- Let us go and clean up the shop.
- Let's do it.

654
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:58,804
This is what happens
when ladies go shopping.

655
00:40:58,887 --> 00:41:00,262
Come on!

656
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:01,761
Please come!

657
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,718
Why do you address me like that.

658
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:07,676
See my dear,
how he is addressing me.

659
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,842
I am seeing her.

660
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:11,716
Damn it!

661
00:41:12,257 --> 00:41:14,215
I am asking you to
see here and not there.

662
00:41:14,548 --> 00:41:15,464
- Oh, you want me to see here!
- Please come!

663
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:16,797
- I shall--
- Please don't do that.

664
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:19,588
- Welcome, Madam!
- Lead the way.

665
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:21,754
My dear, is this fine?

666
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:23,879
- It looks great.
- Indeed!

667
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:25,378
- What about this?
- Superb!

668
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:26,752
- And this one?
- Great!

669
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:29,501
Madam, why don't you go to
the trial room and take a trial?

670
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,833
- What did you say?
- Why don't you take a trial?

671
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:33,957
- A trial?
- Yes!

672
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,081
You mean that after
I go into the trial room...

673
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,539
...you want to capture
my video secretly, you scoundrel!

674
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:39,622
Pack them!

675
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:44,955
After I go home, I shall try
them on in front of my dear one.

676
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:46,829
Are you shocked?

677
00:41:46,912 --> 00:41:48,287
- I am shaken!
- One and the same.

678
00:41:48,537 --> 00:41:49,620
Pack all of these too!

679
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:52,953
She is mad after shopping.

680
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:54,661
That is why she bought
the entire shop.

681
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,327
<i>"Bad boys."</i>

682
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,201
Phone call for me.

683
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:00,575
Tell me, father.

684
00:42:00,658 --> 00:42:03,199
It seems that the drama
artist I arranged got fever.

685
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,906
She says that she cannot come.

686
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,530
Postpone your program
till tomorrow.

687
00:42:08,113 --> 00:42:09,113
It means--

688
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:12,237
Our plan worked out. He thought
the man that we set up as Bujji.

689
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:16,862
I shall wait outside.
Pay the bill and come.

690
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,736
Hey! The bill!

691
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:29,235
- How much is it?
- Only 1,99,999.

692
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,610
- Did it cost that much?
- Yeah!

693
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:32,651
Is it a bill or the rent
for this building?

694
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:34,900
- It is the bill indeed.
- It is indeed dead cheap.

695
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:36,149
Yeah!

696
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:39,065
- Take this.
- Why did you give your identity card?

697
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,648
- What is written here?
- All cards are accepted.

698
00:42:42,898 --> 00:42:43,981
That is why I gave that.

699
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:46,564
Hey! All cards does
not include identity cards.

700
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,105
Where are you escaping to?

701
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:51,438
You didn't buy even a single saree,
you cheap faced woman!

702
00:42:51,521 --> 00:42:53,104
Make her work for days on end--

703
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:54,770
Never mind the load.

704
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:56,019
Don't spare her at all.

705
00:42:56,102 --> 00:42:57,185
My dear!

706
00:42:57,601 --> 00:42:59,017
Priya! Priya!

707
00:43:00,475 --> 00:43:01,850
Forget about Bujji.

708
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:03,808
There is no other woman in my life.

709
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:06,682
None other than you.

710
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:08,056
As if I don't know.

711
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:10,805
Uncle! Uncle!

712
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,138
They beat me black
and blue in there.

713
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:15,220
Uncle, please give me a hundred.

714
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:18,011
I can't wear this dress and live.

715
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:20,427
Sister, please give me some money.

716
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,885
When your brother-in-law is there,
why do you ask me?

717
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:26,926
A hundred, brother-in-law.

718
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:29,675
Why just a hundred?
Take the entire purse.

719
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:32,049
- Go and enjoy!
- Uncle, you are great.

720
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:50,673
<i>"The heart shines resplendently."</i>

721
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:54,506
<i>"The heart brims with joy."</i>

722
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:58,713
<i>"Like an unexpected
shower of jasmines."</i>

723
00:43:58,796 --> 00:44:02,796
<i>"My heart got a new experience."</i>

724
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:06,670
<i>"Love has come to me
with pleasant greetings."</i>

725
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:10,836
<i>"My sweet dreams have come true."</i>

726
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:34,710
<i>"The heart shines resplendently."</i>

727
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:38,501
<i>"Like an unexpected
shower of jasmines."</i>

728
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:49,376
THE MLA MUNUSWAMY
WHO WAS KIDNAPPED

729
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,500
Hey, who are you all?

730
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:55,749
How dare you play
with MLA Munuswamy?!

731
00:44:58,749 --> 00:44:59,999
Choose one of these five fingers.

732
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,540
One, two, three, four, five.

733
00:45:04,623 --> 00:45:06,331
Tell your people to
get 5 crore cash ready.

734
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:09,247
- Give me one more chance.
- Okay!

735
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:12,413
One, two, three, four, five.

736
00:45:12,496 --> 00:45:13,912
- Tell them to ready five crores!
- Alas!

737
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:15,495
Hey, give me one last chance.

738
00:45:18,578 --> 00:45:20,119
Tell them to keep
3 crores cash ready!

739
00:45:20,202 --> 00:45:22,952
This is utter injustice.
Who are you guys?

740
00:45:23,035 --> 00:45:24,243
Hey, don't do it!

741
00:45:26,076 --> 00:45:29,076
It is more than 10 days that
MLA Munuswamy has been kidnapped.

742
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:33,575
People are surprised that the police
still doesn't have any clue in this case.

743
00:45:33,658 --> 00:45:36,949
- Those people might harm him.
- The case of these kidnappings.

744
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:39,032
You must get him freed somehow.

745
00:45:39,115 --> 00:45:43,073
Don't cry like that...
I can't bear it. Who is Munuswamy?

746
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:45,656
This throat pain is bothering me.

747
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:49,531
Who is Munuswamy?
He is like my younger brother.

748
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:52,197
He is my own brother.

749
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:56,030
Madam, I am giving you my word.

750
00:45:56,488 --> 00:46:02,071
Your husband shall eat the
food you cook for dinner tonight.

751
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:03,362
This is my word.

752
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,278
- What happened to sir's voice?
- The matter is--

753
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:08,986
Some years ago a
policeman fired at him.

754
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,068
The bullet remained in his throat.

755
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,651
- If that is taken out.
- He may lose his voice or even his life.

756
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:16,067
- PA!
- I'm coming, Sir.

757
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:21,192
We must find the whereabouts of
Munuswamy anyhow by today evening.

758
00:46:21,275 --> 00:46:22,316
I will take care of that.

759
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:24,107
Greetings.

760
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,708
<i>"Just beat it!"</i>

761
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:28,833
Hello!

762
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:31,666
We have put the three crores
in a bag as they said...

763
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:33,040
...and put it in the middle of the road.

764
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,831
We will recover the money
as soon as they release the MLA.

765
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:38,538
- How many of our guys are there?
- We have 10 men incognito.

766
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:42,704
We should not miss Mumuswamy
or the cash in the bag.

767
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,079
Okay, sir.

768
00:46:54,537 --> 00:46:55,578
What are you looking at?

769
00:46:56,661 --> 00:46:57,619
Nothing, brother.

770
00:46:57,702 --> 00:47:01,035
As per my calculation it appears that
they are observing every move of ours.

771
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,285
How do you know that?

772
00:47:02,368 --> 00:47:05,243
Das, we get a salary of 10 thousand
and make plans at our level.

773
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:07,575
The are doing kidnaps
and making away with crores.

774
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,157
How deep do you feel they shall think?

775
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:12,407
By the way,
how did they kidnap Munuswamy?

776
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:15,781
When some students were pinning
the national flag on his shirt...

777
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:17,447
...the pin pricked him.

778
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,113
The MLA could not bear that
and put his hand on his heart.

779
00:47:20,196 --> 00:47:23,071
Everyone thought that he got a heart
attack and took him to the ambulance.

780
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:25,945
Only after it crossed some signals,
the truth dawned on everyone.

781
00:47:26,028 --> 00:47:27,653
That he did not get a heart
attack but it was a planned move.

782
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:30,403
It looks like the
climax of a great movie.

783
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:35,236
If they took him in the
ambulance when they kidnapped...

784
00:47:36,527 --> 00:47:38,527
...how will they bring
him at the time of his release?

785
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:42,402
The MLA is somewhere
in the vicinity.

786
00:47:43,818 --> 00:47:45,609
Check all the vehicles
in the area without sparing any.

787
00:47:45,692 --> 00:47:46,733
Come, let's go!

788
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:51,149
Hey, stop it.

789
00:47:51,857 --> 00:47:53,232
- Come! Come!
- Hey!

790
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:55,773
Mental fellow!

791
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:03,355
What happened?

792
00:48:03,438 --> 00:48:04,354
It seems that Munuswamy
is somewhere in the vicinity.

793
00:48:04,437 --> 00:48:06,187
He's creating a scene unnecessarily.

794
00:48:32,187 --> 00:48:33,562
Munuswamy!

795
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:38,603
Some madman is running away
with the cash bag into Indira Nagar.

796
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:40,477
Please come quickly.

797
00:48:40,935 --> 00:48:41,935
Crap!

798
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:44,393
Come on quickly.

799
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:57,518
Stop, I said.

800
00:49:02,393 --> 00:49:04,559
- That is a lot of money. Give it back!
- Money?!

801
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:05,892
Yes, give it back.

802
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:08,183
Why would I need any money?

803
00:49:08,266 --> 00:49:11,057
- I'll throw it away.
- Don't throw it! Don't throw it!

804
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,181
I threw it away.. I threw it!

805
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:15,930
I threw it away!

806
00:49:23,013 --> 00:49:24,263
Stop!

807
00:49:36,138 --> 00:49:37,513
Get the entire area searched and...

808
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:39,887
...find out what happened to
that cash bag. I need a report.

809
00:49:44,012 --> 00:49:44,970
- What happened?
- Sir!

810
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:58,428
- Hey!
- Don't run away with the money.

811
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,511
Can't you see, you bastards?

812
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:16,552
Are you blind?

813
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:18,510
Hey, stop!

814
00:50:29,801 --> 00:50:31,051
Start it quickly!

815
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:39,051
- You wait, brother!
- Drive on quickly.

816
00:50:42,884 --> 00:50:44,967
There are always two steps
ahead of us in everything.

817
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,675
The bullet missed by a whisker. Crap!

818
00:50:48,383 --> 00:50:50,841
If you wish to consider,
I have a plan to catch them.

819
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,674
Wait... hold on one second.

820
00:50:54,632 --> 00:50:57,382
<i>- "Got to beat it!"
- This DGP is bothering me.</i>

821
00:50:57,923 --> 00:50:59,923
They are making calls every
moment and building the pressure.

822
00:51:02,256 --> 00:51:03,547
You said that you want
to discuss some plan.

823
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,171
When the attacks happened in Mumbai on
26/11, since we manage to capture Kasab...

824
00:51:08,254 --> 00:51:09,545
...the pressure on
the government eased.

825
00:51:09,628 --> 00:51:11,044
The anger of the public shifted to Kasab.

826
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:15,085
If we have to capture the kidnappers
we must first reduce the pressure on us.

827
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:18,376
- What do you mean?
- I mean that...

828
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:20,334
...this time it will be us and
not they who will make the plan.

829
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:23,958
Let us get a big shot kidnapped
by an officer of Department.

830
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:25,541
After that we shall call
the press and say that...

831
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,165
...the same person did this kidnap
also and that we are investigating...

832
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:29,331
...and take two months time.

833
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:32,830
The person who is doing
this will attempt it again.

834
00:51:33,413 --> 00:51:36,163
But while he attempts this
time our bullet will not miss him.

835
00:51:36,246 --> 00:51:37,329
Since the bullet already hit him...

836
00:51:38,287 --> 00:51:39,245
...he may stay quiet for some time.

837
00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:44,452
These plans are good to hear but
getting permission is difficult.

838
00:51:44,952 --> 00:51:46,035
It is called permission
if we ask for it.

839
00:51:47,826 --> 00:51:49,034
If we do it without asking,
Then it becomes a mission.

840
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:56,492
The interval of Mahesh babu's movie
Pokiri was shot in this location.

841
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:58,616
Is that so?

842
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:03,032
They may have done that...
what do we care?

843
00:52:03,573 --> 00:52:07,239
Hot groundnuts and tasty nuts!

844
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:08,530
Everyone is enjoying well.

845
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,738
Tasty nuts... fresh nuts.

846
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:18,404
Madam, instead of biting your nails,
please buy some nuts and eat.

847
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,986
There are doing match fixing for my
marriage at home without my consent...

848
00:52:22,277 --> 00:52:24,360
...and you advise me
to eat these lousy nuts!

849
00:52:24,443 --> 00:52:26,734
- I will break your teeth!
- Priya, calm down!

850
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:27,942
You go away.

851
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:32,608
You didn't tell me about the match
fixing but you told that to him.

852
00:52:36,774 --> 00:52:37,815
What is the actual matter?

853
00:52:44,773 --> 00:52:48,064
Hey girl, do you want
to say anything to my son?

854
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,063
Do you want to speak to the girl?

855
00:52:52,729 --> 00:52:54,687
I wish to speak... tell me.

856
00:52:56,228 --> 00:52:57,728
Stop shaking your head like that.

857
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:00,269
What do you mean
that you don't like him?

858
00:53:02,894 --> 00:53:04,227
Are you in love with someone?

859
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:07,102
- That is what dad is asking.
- Hey, get lost.

860
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:10,976
Enough of the nodding.

861
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:12,850
Bring him home.

862
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:16,683
I know that you are there for me.

863
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:22,224
Please make my father
also realize that.

864
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,890
What does your father do?

865
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:27,389
He is the police commissioner.

866
00:53:30,514 --> 00:53:32,430
- What did you say?
- He is the police commissioner.

867
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,721
'The basic things
that we need to live.'

868
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:41,637
'That's right...
Food, water and air.'

869
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,011
'Let's start with air.'

870
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,385
- How are you doing, my boy.
- I'm doing fine.

871
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,218
- Please take this.
- What is the need for all these?

872
00:53:46,551 --> 00:53:47,842
You have come here
for the first time.

873
00:53:48,175 --> 00:53:50,258
- This will be the last time also.
- Hey, Bunty!

874
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:52,007
What happens when
we start working out?

875
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,298
- Naughty boy!
- Which is farther, the Moon or Mumbai?

876
00:53:54,673 --> 00:53:56,173
- Of course it is Mumbai!
- Is that so?

877
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:58,839
We can see the moon
but we cannot see Mumbai.

878
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,046
- Keshav.
- Oh God, daddy is here.

879
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:04,712
Bring those files here.

880
00:54:11,878 --> 00:54:13,044
Hello, uncle.

881
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:21,335
- Tell me.
- Priya must have told you about me.

882
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:24,834
What do you do normally?

883
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,250
I mostly participate
in extracurricular activities.

884
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:30,041
What do you mean?

885
00:54:30,124 --> 00:54:33,957
Like Ganpati festival, 10k Run,
party rallies and whatnot... all!

886
00:54:35,623 --> 00:54:36,748
What do you do in you are free?

887
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:39,289
I do all these when I am free.

888
00:54:39,705 --> 00:54:42,038
I'm very busy at other times.
I watch movies.

889
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:44,371
- Movies?!
- Only Hollywood films, uncle.

890
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:47,495
I mean the Telugu version is
released by the local distributor.

891
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,536
Deyyyala kota, Rakshasa bali...
movies like that.

892
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,119
I watched that movie 10 times.

893
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:57,243
You came to ask for my daughter even
after knowing that I am the commissioner?

894
00:54:58,576 --> 00:55:00,076
Do you think I will backtrack hearing
that you are the commissioner's daughter?

895
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:01,867
Can't we fall in love
with commissioner's daughter?

896
00:55:02,158 --> 00:55:03,783
Won't commissioner's
daughters have husbands?

897
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:09,199
<i>"Beat it! Just beat it!"</i>

898
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,740
<i>"Beat it! Just beat it!"</i>

899
00:55:13,448 --> 00:55:14,573
Hello!

900
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:18,156
Tell that I will kill him.

901
00:55:19,406 --> 00:55:23,906
If he disappoints me I will finish him
in an encounter like I did to his brother.

902
00:55:27,572 --> 00:55:28,613
Would you prefer jam
or butter in your bread?

903
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:29,779
Butter!

904
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:32,404
Take these.

905
00:55:35,362 --> 00:55:37,820
I never denied anything
to my daughter since childhood.

906
00:55:37,903 --> 00:55:39,028
I like her a lot.

907
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:40,694
Me too.

908
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,985
So much that I can
even kill for her sake.

909
00:55:53,943 --> 00:55:57,359
I like her so much that
I'm ready to die for her sake.

910
00:56:17,817 --> 00:56:20,150
Raja! Raja!

911
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,191
Raja, what happened?

912
00:56:27,774 --> 00:56:29,000
Did it fail?

913
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:37,958
See this, uncle?

914
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:40,332
I like your daughter a lot.

915
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:42,915
She likes you a lot.

916
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,873
So it means that you like me a lot.

917
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:49,747
That is why when
I was about to cut my finger...

918
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,455
...you thrust your hand in between.

919
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,954
<i>"Beat it! Just beat it!"</i>

920
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:04,912
You too are--

921
00:57:04,995 --> 00:57:06,786
- A fan of Michael Jackson!
- Wow!

922
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:10,077
I like you.

923
00:57:11,577 --> 00:57:12,702
I know that, uncle.

924
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,285
Hey!

925
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:17,368
Song, uncle!

926
00:57:36,701 --> 00:57:40,034
<i>"This love is a great thing."</i>

927
00:57:40,367 --> 00:57:45,492
<i>"Love has burst open
from the heart, my love."</i>

928
00:57:45,867 --> 00:57:49,283
<i>"This thrill has send
the mind in a tizzy."</i>

929
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:51,574
<i>"The world has turned upside down."</i>

930
00:57:51,657 --> 00:57:55,115
<i>"This is a lucky
and lovely chance."</i>

931
00:57:55,365 --> 00:57:58,740
<i>"I wish to perform
the Gangnam dance."</i>

932
00:57:58,823 --> 00:58:02,448
<i>"Boom boom it's crazy time...
boom boom its cosy time."</i>

933
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:06,156
<i>"Boom boom hits jolly time...
One more time."</i>

934
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,822
<i>"Boom boom it's party time...
Boom boom it's freaking time."</i>

935
00:58:09,905 --> 00:58:13,821
<i>"Boom boom it's jolly time...
One more time."</i>

936
00:58:35,737 --> 00:58:41,820
<i>"I don't remember the alphabet and
numbers... I became like a toddler."</i>

937
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:49,236
<i>"I don't remember any ATM pin code.
My memory is gone."</i>

938
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:56,819
<i>"When I saw you I froze
like a statue and fell in love."</i>

939
00:58:57,402 --> 00:59:04,235
<i>"You are like a high tension
wire who blew out my fuse."</i>

940
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:08,901
<i>"Boom boom it's crazy time...
Boom boom its party time."</i>

941
00:59:08,984 --> 00:59:12,567
<i>"Boom boom it's jolly time...
One more time."</i>

942
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:16,275
<i>"Boom boom it's party time...
Boom boom its freaking time."</i>

943
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:20,066
<i>"Boom boom its jolly time...
One more time."</i>

944
00:59:34,732 --> 00:59:41,357
<i>"I get the feeling of doing
scuba diving in a sea of perfume."</i>

945
00:59:42,232 --> 00:59:48,482
<i>"I feel like having the rainbow
as wings and flying to the sky."</i>

946
00:59:49,523 --> 00:59:55,814
<i>"I realize the thrill of
surfing on the waves of Moonlight."</i>

947
00:59:56,522 --> 00:59:58,730
<i>"Oh girl, when you hug me."</i>

948
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:03,563
<i>"I feel that the thirst for
love inside me is being quenched."</i>

949
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,937
<i>"This is the coma of love."</i>

950
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,686
<i>"Love has burst out
from within the heart."</i>

951
01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:15,269
<i>"This thrill has send
the mind in a tizzy."</i>

952
01:00:15,352 --> 01:00:19,310
<i>"My mind has gone
spinning in a tizzy."</i>

953
01:00:19,393 --> 01:00:22,893
<i>"Let us enjoy with one and all."</i>

954
01:00:22,976 --> 01:00:26,351
<i>"I feel like dancing
the Gangnam style."</i>

955
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:30,059
<i>"Boom boom gets crazy time...
Boom boom its cosy time."</i>

956
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:33,767
<i>"Boom boom its jolly time...
one more time."</i>

957
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:37,433
<i>"Boom boom its party time...
Boom boom it's freaking time."</i>

958
01:00:37,516 --> 01:00:41,141
<i>"Boom boom it's jolly time...
One more time."</i>

959
01:00:41,224 --> 01:00:42,474
<i>"Boom boom."</i>

960
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:44,807
- I told it.
- Rayudu!

961
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,015
- My name is Atama Rayudu.
- Whatever!

962
01:00:47,098 --> 01:00:48,098
- Take this and put this in the car.
- Okay.

963
01:00:48,973 --> 01:00:50,639
I am the great Atama Rayudu.

964
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:53,722
- Why don't you shave and go?
- I will do it in the evening.

965
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:56,597
The mind is very peaceful now.

966
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:00,596
I got very tense thinking that you will
get Priya married to that minister's son.

967
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:03,470
The boy who came here the day before
yesterday... you and I both like him.

968
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:06,303
Just wait a minute...
I will return shortly.

969
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:18,760
I performed the
worship as you said.

970
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,801
But the marriage will
happen as per my wish.

971
01:01:24,342 --> 01:01:25,592
Go inside now.

972
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,799
Hey, tell Raja to come
to the farmhouse tomorrow.

973
01:01:29,882 --> 01:01:30,840
Okay, sir.

974
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,590
Why did he call me to the
farmhouse early in the morning?

975
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:52,631
Will he make the plant some trees?

976
01:01:52,714 --> 01:01:53,797
Hey Raja!

977
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,671
Lord Buddha advised
us to plant trees ages ago.

978
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:56,962
- I'm seeing that in action today.
- Yes.

979
01:01:57,045 --> 01:01:58,545
You planted them well in a line.

980
01:01:58,795 --> 01:02:00,878
- Give it to me, I will do it.
- No, Raja!

981
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:03,253
I participated in that when I was young.
Don't remember the name.

982
01:02:03,336 --> 01:02:04,544
- What is that called?
- Janmabhoomi, sir.

983
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:06,668
That is the name, Janmabhoomi.
I was number one in that.

984
01:02:10,376 --> 01:02:11,501
Hey!

985
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:14,958
This is the result
if you disappoint me!

986
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,624
This is the result.

987
01:02:18,957 --> 01:02:21,082
Raja, Go and wait inside.
I will return shortly.

988
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:24,082
Your father asked me to
come to the farmhouse alone.

989
01:02:24,165 --> 01:02:25,831
- Is that so?
- What do you think could be the reason?

990
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:29,580
Even if my father shouts, tell him
that you love me and won't leave me.

991
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,996
Don't be scared. I won't keep
quiet if anything happens to you.

992
01:02:32,287 --> 01:02:34,078
- Do you expect something to happen to me?
- Bury that corpse!

993
01:02:34,536 --> 01:02:35,702
I'm sharing my address with you.

994
01:02:36,243 --> 01:02:39,118
If you don't get my call after
10 min, send in the ambulance.

995
01:02:40,076 --> 01:02:42,951
If I am not found,
tell them to dig up the place.

996
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:46,159
My boy, you seem to have set aside
some important work to meet me.

997
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,783
I don't have anything more
important than you, father in law!

998
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:51,032
Father in law?!

999
01:02:51,698 --> 01:02:55,031
When you address me like that
I feel the vibration all over my body.

1000
01:02:55,364 --> 01:02:56,447
Father in law!

1001
01:02:56,822 --> 01:02:59,447
You address me like that again!
I like you very much.

1002
01:03:00,363 --> 01:03:02,904
Smart, daring, dashing, intelligent!

1003
01:03:04,404 --> 01:03:06,779
I have no objection
to perform your marriage.

1004
01:03:07,237 --> 01:03:08,862
But there is a small problem.

1005
01:03:09,778 --> 01:03:12,819
Let us postpone the marriage
till that problem is solved.

1006
01:03:13,485 --> 01:03:14,526
What do you say?

1007
01:03:15,734 --> 01:03:17,942
Your problem is indeed my problem.

1008
01:03:18,442 --> 01:03:20,358
Don't say that. If Priya learns about it,
it will become a big problem.

1009
01:03:20,441 --> 01:03:21,899
If you don't tell that to me,
I swear by my life.

1010
01:03:24,482 --> 01:03:26,273
I'm telling you since
you ask me repeatedly.

1011
01:03:28,106 --> 01:03:30,981
You know that there are
kidnappings happening in the city.

1012
01:03:31,064 --> 01:03:32,355
I too don't understand that.

1013
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:35,271
How is it that they can't be captured
when a strict officer like you is around?

1014
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:38,187
Because I'm the one who is doing
all the kidnappings in the city.

1015
01:03:42,395 --> 01:03:45,936
Inspector Sharma, the MLA...
I am doing all that according to a plan.

1016
01:03:48,186 --> 01:03:50,144
Now it has reached the final stage.

1017
01:03:51,185 --> 01:03:52,643
If this plan is to succeed...

1018
01:03:54,018 --> 01:03:56,768
...we can easily catch
a big terrorist group.

1019
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:57,892
What plan are you talking about?

1020
01:04:00,308 --> 01:04:01,266
It is--

1021
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:03,765
Let us get a big-shot kidnapped
by an officer of our department.

1022
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,431
The person who has done this earlier
will attempt it this time also.

1023
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:09,388
But on this attempt,
our bullet will not miss him.

1024
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,887
But we need a very
dependable person to do this.

1025
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:13,303
We need someone very close.

1026
01:04:14,594 --> 01:04:16,594
Do you consider me an outsider,
father-in-law?

1027
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:18,510
I'm there.

1028
01:04:21,343 --> 01:04:22,801
- You can't handle it.
- If it is okay with you...

1029
01:04:22,884 --> 01:04:25,009
...I'm ready this very moment.
I'm ready this moment.

1030
01:04:26,384 --> 01:04:28,467
Do we need to take
any permissions for this?

1031
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:31,717
It is called permission
if we say before doing it.

1032
01:04:33,883 --> 01:04:36,466
If we do it without saying,
it becomes a mission.

1033
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:44,049
I'm there... I'm there.

1034
01:04:44,132 --> 01:04:45,632
- You are there.
- I'm there that's all.

1035
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,006
Sir, when you told him that we're
doing the kidnaps to catch terrorists...

1036
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:50,922
...how did he believe it
without even sparing a thought?

1037
01:04:51,505 --> 01:04:53,921
One needs a brain to think.

1038
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,587
I don't understand
your plan at all.

1039
01:04:58,337 --> 01:05:00,045
Did you hear the story
of one bullet two birds?

1040
01:05:00,128 --> 01:05:01,336
No!

1041
01:05:01,669 --> 01:05:04,877
When I learned that Raja
is in love with my daughter...

1042
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,376
...I got so angry as to kill him.

1043
01:05:08,834 --> 01:05:11,792
But what can I do? My daughter
also fell in love with him.

1044
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:18,583
And there is continuous torture from
above and below to catch the kidnappers.

1045
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:22,874
You mean that you will make him do the
kidnapping, catch him in the act...

1046
01:05:22,957 --> 01:05:24,498
...and finish him before
you finish your cup of tea.

1047
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:26,206
You are like a god, sir!

1048
01:05:31,622 --> 01:05:33,205
Do you think that
he might have overheard us?

1049
01:05:33,288 --> 01:05:34,329
I don't know, sir.

1050
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:40,036
Father in law, a thought flashed
my mind as I crossed the gate.

1051
01:05:41,202 --> 01:05:43,160
What if someone else
catches me other than you?

1052
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:48,992
Oh God, I can't do this.

1053
01:05:51,242 --> 01:05:52,367
Please find someone else for this.

1054
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,533
Sorry!

1055
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:01,241
Hey, call up my number.

1056
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:05,240
<i>"Beat it! Just beat it!"</i>

1057
01:06:05,656 --> 01:06:08,697
Hello... cancel this mission.

1058
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,405
Cancel the order that I gave
about the undercover officer.

1059
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:15,029
Let my job be gone if it comes to that.

1060
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:16,737
Father-in-law, let's do it!

1061
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,320
Let's do it, sir!

1062
01:06:19,945 --> 01:06:21,653
Hope no more thoughts
will flash across your mind.

1063
01:06:21,986 --> 01:06:23,444
I don't sleep when
I'm on a mission!

1064
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:25,026
How will I get any dreams?

1065
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:26,192
- Raja!
- Yes, sir!

1066
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:28,525
You must remember three
rules regarding this.

1067
01:06:29,858 --> 01:06:34,608
The first one is that the person
you shall kidnap must be a big shot.

1068
01:06:36,649 --> 01:06:38,000
The second one.

1069
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:44,708
For one week after that you should
not get caught by anyone including me.

1070
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,999
All one needs is 2 min
to catch this fool!

1071
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,748
- The third one?
- You should not disappoint me.

1072
01:06:53,373 --> 01:06:55,123
This is what happens
if anyone disappoints me!

1073
01:06:56,539 --> 01:06:58,414
- This will be the result!
- Okay, sir.

1074
01:06:58,497 --> 01:06:59,997
From this moment your
name shall not be Raja.

1075
01:07:01,205 --> 01:07:02,538
Run Raja!

1076
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:05,745
Run Raja?!

1077
01:07:06,995 --> 01:07:08,120
Run!

1078
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:12,369
Tell me, brother. The engagement
will be on the ninth, isn't it?

1079
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:14,994
Okay, brother.

1080
01:07:16,827 --> 01:07:18,827
Sacrificial lamb!
I noted, brother.

1081
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,493
Hey Raja! Sorry, Run Raja!

1082
01:07:25,576 --> 01:07:29,326
- When are you starting your mission?
- I already did the kidnapping.

1083
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:31,575
Is that so?
Superb! Who is the person?

1084
01:07:31,658 --> 01:07:34,074
Rather than choosing someone else,
I kidnapped the Commissioner's daughter.

1085
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:35,865
Who can be a bigger shot
than the Commissioner's daughter?

1086
01:07:35,948 --> 01:07:37,364
Which Commissioner
are you talking about?

1087
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:39,322
I kidnapped Priya since it is very easy.

1088
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:40,696
Priya! No!

1089
01:07:44,821 --> 01:07:47,446
Hello! Seems like
the phone got discharged.

1090
01:07:52,404 --> 01:07:54,570
- Are you mad? Why did you kidnap me?
- Quiet!

1091
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:56,486
I cannot tell you that.
It is a top-secret.

1092
01:07:57,361 --> 01:07:58,819
It is not wrong for us
to stay together before marriage.

1093
01:07:59,444 --> 01:08:01,319
I even took your
father's permission.

1094
01:08:01,402 --> 01:08:02,735
I never loved you.

1095
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:09,192
Why do you say that?

1096
01:08:09,275 --> 01:08:12,608
My plan was to go off
to Australia after my exams.

1097
01:08:12,899 --> 01:08:16,190
But at the same time my father got
me engaged to the minister's son.

1098
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:19,189
I just said off the hook
that I have a boyfriend.

1099
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:23,605
If my father knows that I don't
have one, he is sure to kill me.

1100
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:28,979
Hey, I have a super idea.

1101
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:32,145
You must trap someone and
make him believe that you love him.

1102
01:08:32,228 --> 01:08:34,019
After that he will come
to convince your father.

1103
01:08:37,644 --> 01:08:39,144
Priya, what are you thinking about?

1104
01:08:39,602 --> 01:08:42,477
Wondering where I can
find such a sacrificial lamb!

1105
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,560
His name is Raja.
He is the dumbest person in the world.

1106
01:08:50,643 --> 01:08:52,934
He ends up breaking with
his girlfriends in a trice.

1107
01:08:53,392 --> 01:08:54,600
- That is the matter.
- Yes!

1108
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:57,391
She broke up with me
and is getting married.

1109
01:08:57,932 --> 01:08:59,265
We got our sacrificial lamb.

1110
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:02,681
If you set him up,
he will set your father up.

1111
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,097
It means that I must change my getup.

1112
01:09:07,347 --> 01:09:08,347
Drive fast!

1113
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:10,555
3 2 1... hit him!

1114
01:09:12,388 --> 01:09:13,471
Chase him!

1115
01:09:16,096 --> 01:09:17,804
You would not get
hurt even if we broke up.

1116
01:09:19,012 --> 01:09:22,595
And it is not new to you.
So I acted as if I was in love with you.

1117
01:09:24,303 --> 01:09:26,511
You believed it as it is your habit
and became a sacrificial lamb.

1118
01:09:27,469 --> 01:09:28,844
Sacrificial lamb!

1119
01:09:30,927 --> 01:09:32,135
Yes.

1120
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:34,092
I'm used to being a sacrificial lamb.

1121
01:09:37,342 --> 01:09:38,467
But not this time round.

1122
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,508
- Hello! Father in law!
- Raja, tell me where my daughter is.

1123
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:50,716
Your daughter disappointed me a lot.
But I won't disappoint you.

1124
01:09:51,174 --> 01:09:52,924
I know what will happen
if I disappoint you.

1125
01:09:53,382 --> 01:09:55,882
Do you remember, father-in-law?
My name is Raja.

1126
01:09:59,215 --> 01:10:00,381
Run Raja!

1127
01:10:02,256 --> 01:10:05,214
My legs are faster than wheels
and mind costlier than a diamond.

1128
01:10:05,505 --> 01:10:07,380
- Don't play with me!
- Forget catching me...

1129
01:10:07,463 --> 01:10:09,463
...it is a waste even to
think of catching me.

1130
01:10:09,546 --> 01:10:12,879
- Raja, I am telling you not to do it.
- Because you can't catch me.

1131
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:14,045
Raja, don't do it!

1132
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:16,294
This is a punch dialogue
used in most movies after a kidnap.

1133
01:10:17,502 --> 01:10:19,585
If kidnappers talk more than this,
the call will be traced.

1134
01:10:19,668 --> 01:10:20,751
You know it better.

1135
01:10:20,834 --> 01:10:23,292
On duty, this is Run Raja...
Reporting, Sir!

1136
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:24,708
Reporting, Sir!

1137
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,666
Raja, I am telling you not to do it.

1138
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:40,041
Hey, stop!

1139
01:10:43,624 --> 01:10:45,040
Where are your pants?

1140
01:10:45,123 --> 01:10:47,081
They did not even give me the time
to wear them and brought me here.

1141
01:10:47,622 --> 01:10:48,663
What is the work for me here?

1142
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:50,787
- Hello, Doctor!
- Hello!

1143
01:10:52,245 --> 01:10:53,370
Can't he see?

1144
01:10:53,995 --> 01:10:55,036
Hello!

1145
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:56,702
Go there!

1146
01:10:59,743 --> 01:11:01,951
- Hello, sir. How are you?
- No!

1147
01:11:02,617 --> 01:11:04,158
- Not fine.
- Sir!

1148
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:08,115
I am Dr Subramaniam.
FRCS... Returned from London.

1149
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:09,990
I'm specialist in
public and private parts.

1150
01:11:10,323 --> 01:11:12,656
- Which part?
- Any part.

1151
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:14,572
How did this happen?

1152
01:11:14,988 --> 01:11:16,071
Reporting, Sir!

1153
01:11:18,737 --> 01:11:19,737
I slipped and fell
down on the bathroom.

1154
01:11:20,237 --> 01:11:22,237
Why don't you take precaution even
after it is shown in many movies?

1155
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,278
I will tell you a love story.

1156
01:11:24,653 --> 01:11:27,611
Doctor, why are you doing
entertainment instead of treatment?

1157
01:11:27,694 --> 01:11:29,194
Hey, come here.

1158
01:11:29,444 --> 01:11:32,069
Did you call me or your man?
He is calling you.

1159
01:11:32,152 --> 01:11:33,943
Come here.
This is the correct position.

1160
01:11:34,026 --> 01:11:35,567
That is very good, sir. Fantastic!

1161
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:38,108
The tablet name is
'Tinnevaru Karyam Light Kuma'.

1162
01:11:38,191 --> 01:11:40,316
- What is that?
- 'Tinnevaru Karyam Light Kuma'.

1163
01:11:40,732 --> 01:11:42,273
Okay? Go and get it.

1164
01:11:43,689 --> 01:11:45,355
- Sir!
- You speak, doctor.

1165
01:11:46,855 --> 01:11:48,730
Once upon a time in
a place called Pithapuram...

1166
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:53,771
...there used to be a powerful police
officer who suffered from neck pain.

1167
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:56,020
He used to have a daughter
who drove him mad.

1168
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:59,227
- Every house has the same problem.
- Well said!

1169
01:11:59,893 --> 01:12:02,768
There used to be a hero
who made her mad in love.

1170
01:12:04,018 --> 01:12:09,309
The father devised a special
plan to get them separated.

1171
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:13,641
There used to be Chandramukhi Mahal
on the outskirts of the village.

1172
01:12:14,974 --> 01:12:19,057
They used to say in the village that
people who entered it never came out.

1173
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,431
As per the plan, if the hero stayed
in that place for one week...

1174
01:12:22,514 --> 01:12:25,264
...the father committed to give
his daughter in marriage to him.

1175
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:30,972
Our hero entered
the mansion as expected.

1176
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,888
Since he won't have time
pass if he went alone...

1177
01:12:33,138 --> 01:12:36,346
...he took the police
officerâ€™s daughter also inside.

1178
01:12:38,346 --> 01:12:40,471
- After going in--
- This seems like it is my story.

1179
01:12:41,179 --> 01:12:45,220
On learning about it the
police officer got startled.

1180
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:50,886
Since he did not have the courage to go
inside, he managed to go in after a week.

1181
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:54,135
Meanwhile another
man followed him...

1182
01:12:54,218 --> 01:12:58,926
...caught him from behind
and twisted his neck like this.

1183
01:12:59,717 --> 01:13:02,133
- Alas!
- Don't move! Don't move! Yeah!

1184
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:05,966
It is very tender..
Don't move it till it becomes strong.

1185
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,757
- What are you talking about?
- Your neck.

1186
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:11,756
- Okay, see you.
- Doctor!

1187
01:13:13,131 --> 01:13:14,797
What happened next in the story?

1188
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:18,671
Only recently my grandma
told me the story.

1189
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:24,503
The hero raped the
heroine and killed her.

1190
01:13:24,753 --> 01:13:26,169
Doctor!

1191
01:13:26,752 --> 01:13:28,710
- You said that it is a love story.
- It is indeed one!

1192
01:13:29,293 --> 01:13:32,001
It is a romantic rape story.
Understood?

1193
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,792
Go away!

1194
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,416
What is that sound again?

1195
01:13:47,332 --> 01:13:48,415
Pizza, sir.

1196
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,873
A pizza!

1197
01:13:53,456 --> 01:13:55,331
Take this hot pizza and eat it.
You will calm down.

1198
01:13:55,789 --> 01:13:57,789
Hey, who ordered for this?

1199
01:13:57,872 --> 01:14:00,663
Who is this quack of a doctor?
He doesn't know anything.

1200
01:14:05,663 --> 01:14:07,371
- Sir, bomb! In this box.
- Damn!

1201
01:14:07,454 --> 01:14:11,370
Take this...
Take it that side and check.

1202
01:14:11,453 --> 01:14:12,619
But sir.

1203
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:15,327
I'm telling you to go.
Go that side and check.

1204
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,951
- What is there in that?
- The pizza, sir.

1205
01:14:27,034 --> 01:14:28,867
- What did you say?
- I speak the truth. Come and see.

1206
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,200
Let me see.

1207
01:14:31,825 --> 01:14:33,450
- A cellphone!
- What is this?!

1208
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:38,991
Since I knew you would tap a cellphone,
I made this arrangement, father-in-law.

1209
01:14:39,324 --> 01:14:41,199
Sir, he is not a normal person.

1210
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,574
Get lost!

1211
01:14:49,782 --> 01:14:51,323
- Hello, father in law!
- Hello!

1212
01:14:51,614 --> 01:14:53,364
- Hello father-in-law, over.
- You are finished!

1213
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,197
Father-in-law, say 'over'
after you complete your message.

1214
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,696
You are overdoing it.

1215
01:14:56,946 --> 01:14:59,362
You must say 'over' at the end
of the message and not during it.

1216
01:14:59,903 --> 01:15:00,986
- Over!
- Over!

1217
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:02,402
- Over!
- Over!

1218
01:15:02,693 --> 01:15:03,693
I said â€˜overâ€™!

1219
01:15:03,776 --> 01:15:05,359
You mean that your message is over!

1220
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:08,316
Father-in-law, I heard that you
have a broken neck. Please take care.

1221
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:10,708
I can do anything for the
happiness of my father-in-law.

1222
01:15:11,249 --> 01:15:14,124
I forgot to tell you that there is
a famous psychiatrist in our area.

1223
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:15,248
Come here!

1224
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:17,372
Sir?

1225
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:20,455
This cannot cover
an area beyond 1 km range.

1226
01:15:20,538 --> 01:15:24,079
Don't spare the railway
station in the vicinity.

1227
01:15:24,162 --> 01:15:25,912
Search everywhere! Go now!

1228
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,786
Where are you now, Raja?

1229
01:15:29,869 --> 01:15:32,035
- I am... I am.
- Yes!

1230
01:15:32,368 --> 01:15:33,493
I am right in your home!

1231
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:34,617
- Hey!
- Over!

1232
01:15:34,992 --> 01:15:36,033
You are finished!

1233
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:38,866
Father-in-law is done and so am I!

1234
01:15:39,324 --> 01:15:41,949
How dare you tell stories
that you are in my home?!

1235
01:15:47,824 --> 01:15:48,949
I love you!

1236
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:59,032
Wait, my boy...
Take this lemon juice.

1237
01:15:59,115 --> 01:16:00,406
It is sweet like sugar.

1238
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:01,989
You pamper me a lot.

1239
01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:06,239
- Drink some more of it.
- Drink, brother-in-law.

1240
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,530
Brother-in-law?! Naughty boy!

1241
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:14,988
Aunty... I take your leave. Bye!

1242
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,071
Bye!

1243
01:16:18,321 --> 01:16:19,404
What are you doing?

1244
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:22,320
These mosquitoes
are bothering us a lot!

1245
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:34,444
Did it hurt badly?

1246
01:16:36,402 --> 01:16:37,443
Take this band aid.

1247
01:16:50,901 --> 01:16:53,859
Priya, wait! Go away if you like.

1248
01:16:54,734 --> 01:16:58,859
Go directly to your father and
tell him that your love is a drama.

1249
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:03,734
He will call the Minister and tell him to
get ready for his son's marriage with you.

1250
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,191
Only then will
your itch be reduced.

1251
01:17:06,274 --> 01:17:07,649
Who asked you to kidnap me?

1252
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:09,107
It was your father.

1253
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:16,439
Your father told
me to kidnap a big shot.

1254
01:17:17,314 --> 01:17:19,689
Rather than spending time with an
unknown big shot for an entire week...

1255
01:17:19,772 --> 01:17:21,647
...I thought it would be better to
make romance with a big shot I know.

1256
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:25,604
After coming here I realized
that it is only violence.

1257
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,186
If you stay with me you need
not disappoint me...

1258
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:31,727
...and I won't disappoint your father.

1259
01:17:34,143 --> 01:17:37,184
I need to land a police job.
What do you say?

1260
01:17:39,892 --> 01:17:41,017
Okay.

1261
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,391
Keshav, what is the update?

1262
01:17:44,474 --> 01:17:46,640
I assembled a team
as per your order.

1263
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:47,765
Good!

1264
01:17:47,848 --> 01:17:51,598
If we put the city on high alert
we can trace Priya madam very quickly.

1265
01:17:51,973 --> 01:17:54,223
People will say that a man
who can't protect his daughter...

1266
01:17:54,306 --> 01:17:58,181
...how he will
be able to capture the kidnappers.

1267
01:17:58,264 --> 01:18:00,555
Search very silently
without anyone knowing it.

1268
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:02,554
Okay, sir. Let's go!

1269
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:17,095
I forgot to ask you.
Where are we spending this one week?

1270
01:18:17,636 --> 01:18:21,052
It is... Just a minute.
Hello!

1271
01:18:21,135 --> 01:18:22,593
- Where are you?
- First listen to what I say.

1272
01:18:23,634 --> 01:18:26,759
Take your tablets without fail.
And put some cash in my bank account.

1273
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,091
- Bye!
- Bye!

1274
01:18:30,341 --> 01:18:31,382
Where are we going to stay?

1275
01:18:38,298 --> 01:18:40,964
I made all the
arrangements except wine.

1276
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,171
Let's go in.

1277
01:18:47,462 --> 01:18:50,128
- Nice house!
- Feel free as if it were your house.

1278
01:18:50,211 --> 01:18:51,461
Come! Come!

1279
01:18:51,544 --> 01:18:53,710
This fatso leads a lavish life!

1280
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:08,418
Oh... So much has happened.

1281
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,292
<i>"Twirl your mustache round."</i>

1282
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:21,250
<i>"Wear Goggles like the boss."</i>

1283
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:24,208
<i>"Mix lassi in coconut water."</i>

1284
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,791
<i>"Make up your mood and come."</i>

1285
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:29,999
<i>"Twirl your mustache round."</i>

1286
01:19:30,082 --> 01:19:32,915
<i>"Wear Goggles like the boss."</i>

1287
01:19:32,998 --> 01:19:35,748
<i>"Mix lassi in coconut water."</i>

1288
01:19:35,831 --> 01:19:38,497
<i>"Make up your mood and come."</i>

1289
01:19:38,788 --> 01:19:41,704
<i>- "All the Rajni fans!
- Great leader."</i>

1290
01:19:41,787 --> 01:19:44,662
<i>- "Don't miss the chance!
- Great leader!"</i>

1291
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:50,787
<i>"Do the lungi dance!"</i>

1292
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:53,703
<i>"Do the lungi dance!"</i>

1293
01:19:53,786 --> 01:19:56,327
<i>"Do the lungi dance!"</i>

1294
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:58,285
<i>"Do the lungi dance!"</i>

1295
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,618
How is my performance?

1296
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:11,409
Is there any other way to go out?

1297
01:20:11,784 --> 01:20:14,200
There are steps leading to
the terrace next to the kitchen.

1298
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:47,741
Uncle, is it you?
What brings you so suddenly?

1299
01:20:48,282 --> 01:20:49,323
I came just like that.

1300
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:55,197
The doctor gave me medicine
for my headache. But not cured.

1301
01:20:55,655 --> 01:20:58,446
My friends gave this
medicine which cured me.

1302
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:13,070
When checking, people don't spare
even a square inch inside the house.

1303
01:21:17,153 --> 01:21:19,069
But they don't guess that...

1304
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,818
...the house can have
a terrace where one can hide.

1305
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:24,400
What happened, uncle?

1306
01:21:24,483 --> 01:21:26,691
My father is not a constable
but the commissioner.

1307
01:21:28,524 --> 01:21:29,815
He might even come to the terrace.

1308
01:21:30,981 --> 01:21:33,522
- See who has come!
- Uncle!

1309
01:21:39,772 --> 01:21:43,855
That is why we are hiding on
the terrace of the next building.

1310
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,021
Hi Maggi!

1311
01:21:54,521 --> 01:21:55,646
Mosquitoes!

1312
01:22:03,979 --> 01:22:06,479
<i>"Beat it! Just beat it!"</i>

1313
01:22:07,812 --> 01:22:08,728
One sec!

1314
01:22:08,811 --> 01:22:10,561
<i>"You better run,
you better do what you can."</i>

1315
01:22:10,644 --> 01:22:13,352
<i>"Don't wanna see no blood,
don't be a macho man."</i>

1316
01:22:13,435 --> 01:22:16,185
Cut the call! Cut the call!

1317
01:22:16,601 --> 01:22:17,809
Sir, your phone.

1318
01:22:17,892 --> 01:22:21,350
<i>"So beat it, but you wanna be bad."</i>

1319
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,683
Cut it!

1320
01:22:23,016 --> 01:22:25,099
- Hello... Tell me, sir.
- Dilip, what is happening?

1321
01:22:25,182 --> 01:22:28,223
I'm searching for some
clue regarding the kidnappers.

1322
01:22:28,473 --> 01:22:29,681
We will definitely catch him, sir.

1323
01:22:30,264 --> 01:22:31,264
Bye, sir.

1324
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:35,847
Maggi, It is very cold outside.

1325
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:37,263
Close the door and sleep.

1326
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:39,137
Okay, uncle.

1327
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:42,469
This police and thief play is thrilling.
Let's play everyday.

1328
01:22:42,552 --> 01:22:43,552
I don't like it at all.

1329
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:45,634
I can't live in fear like this.

1330
01:22:46,509 --> 01:22:48,342
I have exams from
the day after tomorrow.

1331
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,550
Who asked you to live in fear?

1332
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:53,674
You will go to the dance class
and beauty parlor as usual.

1333
01:22:53,757 --> 01:22:55,590
You will go to the college
and take your exam also.

1334
01:22:56,048 --> 01:22:58,548
Hey, give it.
That is your hall ticket.

1335
01:23:01,589 --> 01:23:04,797
You are free as of now.
Can we try something?

1336
01:23:07,338 --> 01:23:09,796
There are mosquitoes here.
Light the coil so that she can study.

1337
01:23:09,879 --> 01:23:10,962
Okay!

1338
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,253
Priya! Priya!

1339
01:23:13,794 --> 01:23:15,335
Where are you? Come out.

1340
01:23:15,418 --> 01:23:16,918
- Let me go.
- Come with me!

1341
01:23:17,001 --> 01:23:18,334
No!

1342
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,625
How dare you take Priya?

1343
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:34,666
Priya! What happened?

1344
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:39,291
I got a feeling that
the minister's son came.

1345
01:23:40,499 --> 01:23:42,124
Does that stupid
man come to your dreams?

1346
01:23:44,207 --> 01:23:47,082
Don't feel tense and
prepare for the exam instead.

1347
01:23:47,165 --> 01:23:48,248
I'm not able to do it.

1348
01:23:57,539 --> 01:23:59,039
I'm not good with words.

1349
01:24:00,539 --> 01:24:03,247
But when I see you in a dull mood--

1350
01:24:06,413 --> 01:24:07,538
Shall we go out?

1351
01:24:30,621 --> 01:24:32,746
Why do you take the Ameerpet bus but
ask ticket for a different place?

1352
01:24:32,829 --> 01:24:34,579
You fool! Throw him out of the bus!

1353
01:24:35,454 --> 01:24:37,454
I never got into
a bus in my entire life.

1354
01:24:37,537 --> 01:24:38,995
And today you made
me to board a running bus.

1355
01:24:39,078 --> 01:24:41,036
The bus was running...
How did they get in?

1356
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:42,827
Where do you want to go?

1357
01:24:43,243 --> 01:24:44,826
Where are we going now?

1358
01:24:46,492 --> 01:24:47,742
Where are we going?

1359
01:24:48,367 --> 01:24:50,117
I'm coming across more such idiots.

1360
01:24:50,367 --> 01:24:51,742
Tell me where you want to go
and I will give you the ticket.

1361
01:24:52,992 --> 01:24:54,200
No one knows where bus will go.

1362
01:24:54,741 --> 01:24:56,032
Don't know where it will stop.

1363
01:24:56,115 --> 01:24:58,031
But I know that the destination
will be a surprising location.

1364
01:24:59,281 --> 01:25:02,406
I decided to enjoy
that surprise tonight.

1365
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:22,822
<i>"Will you come along
as my companion."</i>

1366
01:25:22,905 --> 01:25:26,488
<i>"Will you extend your
hand of friendship."</i>

1367
01:25:26,571 --> 01:25:30,487
<i>"Will you see this world through my eyes."</i>

1368
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:37,736
<i>"Will you set aside
your tensions and problems."</i>

1369
01:25:37,819 --> 01:25:41,235
<i>"Will you get ready to
enjoy the taste of happiness."</i>

1370
01:25:41,568 --> 01:25:45,734
<i>"Will you set yourself free
and enjoy the romantic moments."</i>

1371
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:56,483
<i>"Shake your bridles away and welcome
to see the beauty of this world."</i>

1372
01:25:56,566 --> 01:26:04,107
<i>"Shake your bridles away and welcome
to see the beauty of this world."</i>

1373
01:27:11,499 --> 01:27:15,249
<i>"Life is full of anxiety and tears."</i>

1374
01:27:15,332 --> 01:27:19,123
<i>"Even this moment can
slip away very quickly."</i>

1375
01:27:19,206 --> 01:27:23,497
<i>"You are the smile that
makes this moment precious."</i>

1376
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,455
<i>"Live for the day."</i>

1377
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:33,996
<i>"Laughter effuses from you and this world
is like a mirror reflecting your nature."</i>

1378
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:38,745
<i>"The secret of happiness
is in your hands."</i>

1379
01:27:41,495 --> 01:27:48,786
<i>"Shake your bridles away and welcome
to see the beauty of this life."</i>

1380
01:27:49,036 --> 01:27:56,577
<i>"Shake your bridles away and welcome
to see the beauty of this life."</i>

1381
01:27:56,952 --> 01:28:03,743
<i>"We are carefree and just
going where life takes us."</i>

1382
01:28:04,118 --> 01:28:10,826
<i>"You have seen the white
light and the dark shades."</i>

1383
01:28:11,867 --> 01:28:19,408
<i>"Come close to me and lets
enjoy this moment together."</i>

1384
01:28:26,491 --> 01:28:33,866
<i>"Shake your bridles away and welcome
to see the beauty of this life."</i>

1385
01:28:34,116 --> 01:28:41,574
<i>"Shake your bridles away and welcome
to see the beauty of this life."</i>

1386
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:22,323
Hey, eat this.

1387
01:29:23,823 --> 01:29:26,114
I don't want it. Eat it and sleep.

1388
01:29:26,614 --> 01:29:29,072
- No, father.
- You must eat.

1389
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:30,863
I don't feel hungry.

1390
01:29:32,738 --> 01:29:35,529
I don't know how many days you went
without food when I was not with you.

1391
01:29:36,362 --> 01:29:38,987
You must not do that
when I'm with you.

1392
01:29:50,528 --> 01:29:52,236
You must never go to
sleep on an empty stomach.

1393
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:57,318
I'm there to feed you to your fill.
Eat well and sleep.

1394
01:30:03,443 --> 01:30:06,318
- Do you like it?
- Don't ever leave me and go.

1395
01:30:08,151 --> 01:30:11,151
Why would I do that? Eat now.

1396
01:30:13,859 --> 01:30:17,400
When someone used to ask me about
mother, I would show them her photo.

1397
01:30:19,108 --> 01:30:21,483
But when they asked
me about mothers love.

1398
01:30:22,941 --> 01:30:24,399
I used to show you to them.

1399
01:30:29,899 --> 01:30:32,024
Did you have any
fight with that girl?

1400
01:30:33,315 --> 01:30:34,690
Tell me what happened.

1401
01:30:36,565 --> 01:30:38,190
I like Priya very much.

1402
01:30:38,981 --> 01:30:41,064
Everything happens
for the good eventually.

1403
01:30:41,355 --> 01:30:43,438
It is very late, go to bed now.

1404
01:30:47,813 --> 01:30:50,563
- Hello, Commissioner!
- Hello, brother.

1405
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:53,812
My son wants to speak your daughter.

1406
01:30:54,228 --> 01:30:55,603
Please send her across once.

1407
01:30:56,061 --> 01:30:58,686
- Someone kidnapped Priya.
- What kidnap?!

1408
01:30:58,769 --> 01:31:02,144
I mean that she went
for the college excursion.

1409
01:31:02,435 --> 01:31:06,643
The engagement is within a week and
you have sent her on an excursion!

1410
01:31:06,934 --> 01:31:08,267
She will return tomorrow.

1411
01:31:08,642 --> 01:31:10,975
- I wanted to tell you that.
- Okay.

1412
01:31:11,516 --> 01:31:14,391
- Remember that we have only one week.
- Okay, brother.

1413
01:31:15,141 --> 01:31:16,057
What happened, Sir?

1414
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:19,056
People normally are happy
when they have a son.

1415
01:31:19,472 --> 01:31:22,013
But this mad son of
mine is driving me crazy.

1416
01:31:22,096 --> 01:31:23,429
- Papa!
- Here he comes!

1417
01:31:25,887 --> 01:31:27,595
You did not wish
me happy birthday today.

1418
01:31:28,261 --> 01:31:30,302
But you celebrated
your birthday last month.

1419
01:31:30,593 --> 01:31:31,759
Today is my birthday.

1420
01:31:31,842 --> 01:31:34,425
<i>"Happy birthday to you."</i>

1421
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,008
Where is my gift?

1422
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:39,674
- The gift.
- You forgot it again.

1423
01:31:39,924 --> 01:31:41,049
That is why I brought it myself.

1424
01:31:41,382 --> 01:31:42,757
- What is that?
- My gift!

1425
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:43,965
- Where is it?
- There!

1426
01:31:45,548 --> 01:31:46,548
Greetings, Sir.

1427
01:31:46,631 --> 01:31:48,672
A policeman as a gift?! Who is he?

1428
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:50,630
Why did you do that?

1429
01:31:51,713 --> 01:31:53,671
Just wait a minute!
Oh girl, come here.

1430
01:31:53,754 --> 01:31:54,837
- What is it now?
- Just wait.

1431
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:55,920
- Come here.
- What is it?

1432
01:31:56,003 --> 01:31:58,378
Oh girl, did you tell him
that I slapped you on your behind?

1433
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:00,294
Did you slapped my behind?
I didn't even know.

1434
01:32:00,377 --> 01:32:02,085
It seems she did not
even know that I did it.

1435
01:32:04,251 --> 01:32:05,417
Why are you beating me?

1436
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,750
Did you inform him before beating?
Brother, is it okay?

1437
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:14,499
You are my real brother.

1438
01:32:16,249 --> 01:32:17,165
That is what happened.

1439
01:32:17,248 --> 01:32:19,664
- Don't pull hard at my throat!
- Papa, do you love me?

1440
01:32:20,455 --> 01:32:21,788
- You spoke English?
- Yeah!

1441
01:32:22,163 --> 01:32:23,871
Shut up and put the phone down.

1442
01:32:24,162 --> 01:32:27,203
The chairman is acting over smart.
I will stab him!

1443
01:32:27,286 --> 01:32:30,661
Don't shout so loud.
My son is here.

1444
01:32:30,744 --> 01:32:31,744
The bald uncle is a bad man.

1445
01:32:32,035 --> 01:32:34,951
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Are you doing fine, Sir?

1446
01:32:35,034 --> 01:32:37,159
Brother, he's the one who saved me.

1447
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:38,658
He's a very sharp guy.

1448
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:41,991
- He should be here always.
- The bullet in my throat!

1449
01:32:42,532 --> 01:32:43,573
- Okay?
- Okay!

1450
01:32:43,948 --> 01:32:46,781
- Papa, where is Priya?
- Priya... she is--

1451
01:33:06,197 --> 01:33:07,280
I caught you!

1452
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:09,529
Come on! Quick!

1453
01:33:09,612 --> 01:33:12,278
The photo should go to all the police
stations in the State in 10 min.

1454
01:33:12,361 --> 01:33:14,111
Okay, come on. Send it fast.

1455
01:33:14,861 --> 01:33:17,402
Come on, quick! Send it fast.

1456
01:33:17,485 --> 01:33:19,818
The photo will go to all
stations in the next 5 min.

1457
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:20,942
We will surely find him.

1458
01:33:21,025 --> 01:33:22,025
- Is that so?
- Yes!

1459
01:33:22,108 --> 01:33:23,399
Do one thing in that case.

1460
01:33:23,482 --> 01:33:25,315
- What is it, sir?
- Bring sweets for everyone.

1461
01:33:25,398 --> 01:33:26,606
Okay, sir.

1462
01:33:37,147 --> 01:33:39,730
I'm the one who is doing
the kidnappings in the city.

1463
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:43,730
Inspector Sharma, the MLA..
I'm doing it all in a planned manner.

1464
01:33:45,563 --> 01:33:48,771
Hello, father-in-law. You always cut
the call before I complete my sentence.

1465
01:33:49,187 --> 01:33:51,812
The matter is that if you
try to target me or my people.

1466
01:33:52,312 --> 01:33:54,895
I will make an MMS of this video
and send it to all news channels.

1467
01:33:55,395 --> 01:33:56,978
I saw that in a movie.

1468
01:33:57,061 --> 01:33:58,686
I should take my precautions.

1469
01:34:00,352 --> 01:34:03,602
One more thing.
Run Raja reporting, Sir!

1470
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,310
Stop it! Stop sending the photo!

1471
01:34:06,601 --> 01:34:08,892
Stop it immediately!

1472
01:34:08,975 --> 01:34:11,641
There are many systems, Sir.
It is very difficult to stop them all.

1473
01:34:13,474 --> 01:34:16,849
- Where is the main switch?
- It is on the outside.

1474
01:34:18,807 --> 01:34:21,682
Move aside. Make way for me!

1475
01:34:27,682 --> 01:34:29,640
Why is he behaving
in a strange manner?

1476
01:34:35,806 --> 01:34:37,056
- Hey, come here.
- What is it?

1477
01:34:38,056 --> 01:34:40,097
Do you think it is safe
for Priya to come to the temple?

1478
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:42,388
It is not safe in the first place
to kidnap and keep her in the city.

1479
01:34:42,971 --> 01:34:45,512
Sir, what should I do
about the sweets? I understood!

1480
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:51,636
Do you want us to search the homes
of all your daughter's friends?

1481
01:34:51,927 --> 01:34:55,593
Where did Mahesh babu and Aarti Agarwal
go when their parents opposed them?

1482
01:34:55,676 --> 01:34:57,051
They went to Jaipur.

1483
01:34:57,842 --> 01:34:59,300
Where did Pawan Kalyan
go in the movie Balu?

1484
01:34:59,925 --> 01:35:01,175
He went to Agra via Taj Mahal.

1485
01:35:01,716 --> 01:35:05,466
So forget the city and split the
team and send them all over India.

1486
01:35:05,757 --> 01:35:06,840
Since they will think like that...

1487
01:35:06,923 --> 01:35:09,048
...we will think differently
and keep her in the city.

1488
01:35:09,131 --> 01:35:11,297
Hey, if you both get
caught the girl will be safe.

1489
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,463
But you will be finished
in an encounter. You want that?

1490
01:35:14,046 --> 01:35:16,004
Why should we worry
about what happens tomorrow?

1491
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:17,962
She's happy at this moment.

1492
01:35:19,003 --> 01:35:20,378
I can do anything for that.

1493
01:35:21,461 --> 01:35:23,169
Why are you being emotional?
Let's go.

1494
01:35:34,794 --> 01:35:36,044
Hey, see front ways.

1495
01:35:44,169 --> 01:35:45,460
Hey!

1496
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:07,918
<i>"I came close to you even
though I did not intend to."</i>

1497
01:36:11,293 --> 01:36:19,293
<i>"I liked you as my life even
though I wanted to reject you."</i>

1498
01:36:21,459 --> 01:36:27,375
<i>"This is the real truth."</i>

1499
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:34,083
<i>"This is what my heart says."</i>

1500
01:36:34,749 --> 01:36:40,332
<i>"My heart is anxious
to reach you with love."</i>

1501
01:37:11,415 --> 01:37:18,081
<i>"I was not aware of this turbulence
growing inside my heart."</i>

1502
01:37:18,164 --> 01:37:24,747
<i>"The love is my heart
swelled and flowed towards you."</i>

1503
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:31,496
<i>"This heart is out of control
and does things on its own."</i>

1504
01:37:31,579 --> 01:37:37,829
<i>"It has liked you a lot and
has decided to reach you today."</i>

1505
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:44,578
<i>"I became yours without
knowing it myself."</i>

1506
01:37:44,661 --> 01:37:51,327
<i>"I am floating in the
waves of joyous moonlight."</i>

1507
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:57,743
<i>"I am in love, baby...
I am in love, baby."</i>

1508
01:37:58,076 --> 01:38:04,742
<i>"I am in love, baby...
I am in love, baby."</i>

1509
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:31,325
<i>"My lips blossomed like
a flower taking your name."</i>

1510
01:38:31,408 --> 01:38:34,658
<i>"There is something in
you that has taken over me."</i>

1511
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:37,699
<i>"The world around me has changed."</i>

1512
01:38:38,115 --> 01:38:44,698
<i>"The steps I take in your
company make me float in joy."</i>

1513
01:38:44,781 --> 01:38:51,156
<i>"The more I know you and the more I
move with you, my love for you increases."</i>

1514
01:38:51,406 --> 01:38:58,031
<i>"I find solace in your shadow and have
a desire to spend my life with you."</i>

1515
01:38:58,114 --> 01:39:04,739
<i>"Shall I become your life
partner who shall never leave you."</i>

1516
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:11,071
Why didn't you get ready yet?

1517
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:12,737
What is that?

1518
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,195
The hall ticket?!

1519
01:39:15,653 --> 01:39:17,653
What about your higher
studies in Australia?

1520
01:39:18,278 --> 01:39:19,569
Raja won't be there.

1521
01:39:31,152 --> 01:39:33,485
<i>"Beat it, just beat it!"</i>

1522
01:39:34,776 --> 01:39:36,192
- Sir?
- Dilip, will you come home once?

1523
01:39:36,567 --> 01:39:37,900
Yes, sir.

1524
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,816
What is the status
of the kidnappers case?

1525
01:39:39,899 --> 01:39:42,208
We got entire north India searched.

1526
01:39:42,916 --> 01:39:44,582
We send the force
now to South India.

1527
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,915
We will catch Raja somehow.

1528
01:39:48,206 --> 01:39:49,872
Who is this Raja?

1529
01:39:49,955 --> 01:39:54,788
I refer to the kidnapper
who thinks he's the king.

1530
01:39:55,121 --> 01:39:57,454
- That's all!
- Sir!

1531
01:39:57,704 --> 01:39:59,037
Why is the minister calling all the time?

1532
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,703
- Phone?
- I'm in a meeting. Go away now.

1533
01:40:03,203 --> 01:40:04,536
Some lady is on the line.

1534
01:40:05,619 --> 01:40:07,327
Sir, You have an offer
for a free SIM. Do you want it?

1535
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:08,743
No!

1536
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:13,826
Listen! Don't disturb me
even if the prime minister calls.

1537
01:40:14,659 --> 01:40:16,367
You will never get a call from him.

1538
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:19,200
Sir, what if it is very urgent?
Oh God, sorry!

1539
01:40:19,533 --> 01:40:21,699
Tell them that I went into a coma.

1540
01:40:24,115 --> 01:40:26,073
Coma!

1541
01:40:27,031 --> 01:40:28,781
- Hello!
- Is father there?

1542
01:40:28,864 --> 01:40:30,072
He went into a coma.

1543
01:40:30,322 --> 01:40:31,738
- When?
- Just a second back.

1544
01:40:31,988 --> 01:40:32,988
I am collecting the proofs.

1545
01:40:33,071 --> 01:40:34,487
- Okay... okay.
- I take your leave.

1546
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,778
Close the kidnap
case soon as possible.

1547
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:39,444
Did you ever go into coma?

1548
01:40:39,527 --> 01:40:40,985
- No, I went to Goa.
- But sir went.

1549
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:42,526
- When?
- Just a second back.

1550
01:40:42,776 --> 01:40:45,984
Hey baboon. I am talking to you.
Why are you going away?

1551
01:40:46,484 --> 01:40:47,942
Why are you laughing?

1552
01:40:50,525 --> 01:40:52,816
If you tell me I too will laugh.

1553
01:40:53,149 --> 01:40:54,940
They believed when I said
that you went into a coma.

1554
01:40:56,523 --> 01:40:58,231
- Who was that?
- It was your daughter Priya.

1555
01:41:00,981 --> 01:41:02,272
Give me the phone!

1556
01:41:02,647 --> 01:41:04,188
I am giving it, sir.

1557
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:10,813
Hello... Priya!

1558
01:41:11,313 --> 01:41:13,146
Do one thing.
Come out of there immediately.

1559
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:16,729
Take an auto and go to the nearest
police station and call me from there.

1560
01:41:16,812 --> 01:41:19,687
What is the need for us to
take an auto? We have a Nano car!

1561
01:41:21,645 --> 01:41:23,103
Don't worry about Priya.

1562
01:41:23,186 --> 01:41:25,019
She's eating biryani
and enjoying herself.

1563
01:41:25,435 --> 01:41:28,976
One more thing, father-in-law.
It was I who called with Priya's voice.

1564
01:41:31,517 --> 01:41:34,892
It seems that you went into a coma!

1565
01:41:38,892 --> 01:41:40,475
He is torturing me!

1566
01:41:40,766 --> 01:41:42,391
He always disappears
without informing.

1567
01:41:42,849 --> 01:41:44,765
Sir! Sir!

1568
01:41:45,265 --> 01:41:48,056
- Tell me.
- The engagement date is getting close.

1569
01:41:48,139 --> 01:41:51,680
Please inform the Minister
that the girl got kidnapped.

1570
01:41:57,305 --> 01:42:00,680
Why did you not inform
me even after all this happened?

1571
01:42:03,638 --> 01:42:06,554
You have so much power but
are unable to catch a small fish!

1572
01:42:08,304 --> 01:42:09,762
He's definitely not alone, sir.

1573
01:42:16,928 --> 01:42:18,136
Hello!

1574
01:42:20,261 --> 01:42:22,469
- Sir, phone call for you.
- For me?!

1575
01:42:22,552 --> 01:42:23,802
Yes, sir.

1576
01:42:26,135 --> 01:42:27,343
Hello!

1577
01:42:28,009 --> 01:42:30,800
Why did you switch off the phone?
The battery got low?

1578
01:42:31,716 --> 01:42:34,549
- He is the boy!
- Put the speaker on.

1579
01:42:36,049 --> 01:42:38,757
I had to make a call
to your stooge's phone!

1580
01:42:39,632 --> 01:42:41,590
Kidnappers always speak like this.

1581
01:42:41,673 --> 01:42:44,256
There are three stages
in a kidnap as you mentioned.

1582
01:42:44,714 --> 01:42:46,839
The first is to kidnap a big shot.

1583
01:42:46,922 --> 01:42:48,922
The second is to hide for
a week without getting caught.

1584
01:42:51,547 --> 01:42:52,880
And the third?

1585
01:42:53,296 --> 01:42:55,879
If you want your daughter back single,
get 5 crores cash ready.

1586
01:42:55,962 --> 01:42:57,170
Your daughter will
reach you even otherwise.

1587
01:42:57,420 --> 01:42:59,586
But not single but
with a family pack.

1588
01:43:02,711 --> 01:43:05,752
My name is Raja! Run Raja!

1589
01:43:06,502 --> 01:43:10,043
- Legs are faster than wheels!
- Mind is costlier than a diamond!

1590
01:43:10,126 --> 01:43:13,001
Forget catching me... even thinking
about that is a waste of time.

1591
01:43:14,251 --> 01:43:15,501
Because... he can't be caught!

1592
01:43:15,751 --> 01:43:17,667
Why can't he be caught?
He'll surely be caught!

1593
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,916
Raja, till now you only
saw what a policeman can do.

1594
01:43:21,999 --> 01:43:24,165
Now you will see the
power of a politician.

1595
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:26,790
You are superb!

1596
01:43:29,456 --> 01:43:32,206
That's fine...
how will you collect the money?

1597
01:43:37,247 --> 01:43:38,705
The kidnappings in the city.

1598
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:41,746
I understood.

1599
01:43:44,037 --> 01:43:45,245
Let's go.

1600
01:43:50,036 --> 01:43:51,411
Brother, as you say.

1601
01:43:53,411 --> 01:43:54,494
Hey, get down.

1602
01:43:54,577 --> 01:43:56,493
- Get up and move.
- Cut it!

1603
01:43:57,159 --> 01:43:58,534
Are you saying that about me?

1604
01:43:58,617 --> 01:43:59,700
Not you, brother.

1605
01:43:59,783 --> 01:44:02,366
The entire money is here.
We just have to handover when he says.

1606
01:44:02,449 --> 01:44:04,365
We want both the
money and the girl.

1607
01:44:04,448 --> 01:44:05,989
Okay, brother.

1608
01:44:07,864 --> 01:44:09,655
He won't pay but will
always demand everything.

1609
01:44:09,988 --> 01:44:11,154
Get up.

1610
01:44:15,154 --> 01:44:16,320
Brother!

1611
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:23,652
They all are our men.
No one can harm us.

1612
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:32,568
Take the bag and
put it on the table in front of you.

1613
01:44:33,068 --> 01:44:34,234
Give me the pen.

1614
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:37,816
He should add one more letter
and it means... 'dog'.

1615
01:44:37,899 --> 01:44:40,149
How dare he call me a dog?!
He calls me a dog?!

1616
01:44:40,232 --> 01:44:42,232
Let him say so. Where is the table?

1617
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:46,190
Go and put it on the table.

1618
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:54,731
I put the bag there.

1619
01:44:54,814 --> 01:44:57,147
Why did you put the bag?
Did someone come?

1620
01:44:59,313 --> 01:45:00,646
<i>- "Oh God!"
- Hello!</i>

1621
01:45:00,979 --> 01:45:03,437
Brother, I cannot hear you.

1622
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,436
First check if the
bag is there or not.

1623
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:17,977
Brother!

1624
01:45:20,518 --> 01:45:21,976
Actor Rajni is here!

1625
01:45:24,976 --> 01:45:26,601
He has come to take the bag.

1626
01:45:26,934 --> 01:45:28,850
What is this nonsense about Rajnikant?

1627
01:45:29,141 --> 01:45:33,057
He is the superstar who said that his
saying once is as good as a hundred times!

1628
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:35,723
Did you get drunk early
in the morning, useless fellow?

1629
01:45:36,598 --> 01:45:37,723
Do you get the smell?

1630
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:40,056
First check where the bag is.

1631
01:45:41,014 --> 01:45:44,389
- "Oh lord of Tirumala!"
- He is taking the bag away.

1632
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:52,805
<i>"Jumma! Jumma!"</i>

1633
01:45:52,888 --> 01:45:55,929
<i>"Jumma! Jumma!"</i>

1634
01:45:56,012 --> 01:45:58,512
It is not Rajnikant!
It is Amitabh Bachan!

1635
01:45:59,012 --> 01:46:00,553
Why would he come here?

1636
01:46:00,636 --> 01:46:04,427
<i>"Give me a kiss!"</i>

1637
01:46:04,927 --> 01:46:07,427
<i>- "Give me a kiss!"
- Enough of the dancing... let's go.</i>

1638
01:46:07,510 --> 01:46:09,593
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1639
01:46:13,884 --> 01:46:16,384
- Who is he behind the saree?
- Hey, come out.

1640
01:46:20,009 --> 01:46:21,384
I'm coming.

1641
01:46:22,384 --> 01:46:23,884
It is actor Brahmanandam.

1642
01:46:26,842 --> 01:46:29,675
- Babu Mohan is also here.
- Catch whoever is there.

1643
01:46:31,091 --> 01:46:32,007
- Bye!
- Bye!

1644
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:33,590
Is this an airport to see them off?
Let's go.

1645
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,465
What is the problem?
I need to go to the loo.

1646
01:46:41,548 --> 01:46:44,548
You drink so much beer
that your bladder is full! Idiot!

1647
01:46:46,881 --> 01:46:48,839
Why did Mumbai and
Delhi shift to Hyderabad?

1648
01:46:50,214 --> 01:46:51,630
Even Sonia madam has come.

1649
01:46:53,755 --> 01:46:55,713
The politicians all are
going for lunch, brother!

1650
01:46:56,254 --> 01:46:58,420
I will catch them before
they finish their lunch.

1651
01:46:58,670 --> 01:47:01,378
Catch at least one of them.

1652
01:47:01,628 --> 01:47:03,169
Now see what I'll do, brother.

1653
01:47:03,877 --> 01:47:08,210
Who are you, bastards? Are you
thieves who came to steal something?

1654
01:47:08,293 --> 01:47:09,709
I am getting bashed up.

1655
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,583
Bro, the bag is over here.

1656
01:47:12,666 --> 01:47:15,041
We found the bag, boss.

1657
01:47:15,124 --> 01:47:18,415
- Bring it here.
- What do you think about our mettle?

1658
01:47:23,873 --> 01:47:25,748
- Brother!
- What?

1659
01:47:25,831 --> 01:47:28,206
We have been deceived thoroughly!

1660
01:47:28,289 --> 01:47:29,330
What?!

1661
01:47:35,455 --> 01:47:37,121
- Good morning, sir.
- Why did you call me urgently?

1662
01:47:37,204 --> 01:47:39,287
- Please come with me for 2 min.
- Good morning!

1663
01:47:42,370 --> 01:47:44,120
This is the voice of the kidnapper...

1664
01:47:44,203 --> 01:47:45,578
...who called when Inspector
Sharma was kidnapped.

1665
01:47:46,786 --> 01:47:47,869
One second, Sir.

1666
01:47:56,869 --> 01:47:58,035
Now please listen to this.

1667
01:47:58,535 --> 01:48:00,368
This is the voice
of Munuswamy's kidnapper

1668
01:48:02,201 --> 01:48:03,867
They both are the same. So what?

1669
01:48:10,367 --> 01:48:12,283
Brother, we found the cash.

1670
01:48:12,574 --> 01:48:14,240
Did you get it? I'm coming.

1671
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:16,031
Now listen to this voice.

1672
01:48:16,531 --> 01:48:20,489
This is the voice that I recorded
when Raja called up my cell.

1673
01:48:28,364 --> 01:48:31,030
It is Raja who did
all the kidnappings.

1674
01:48:38,071 --> 01:48:39,571
Oh my God!

1675
01:48:52,696 --> 01:48:53,862
Super shot!

1676
01:48:55,445 --> 01:48:56,820
Rajni style it is!

1677
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:07,778
This is how kidnappers speak.

1678
01:49:09,861 --> 01:49:11,069
You cannot catch me.

1679
01:49:13,069 --> 01:49:14,569
I must catch him somehow.

1680
01:49:16,152 --> 01:49:17,235
I must catch him.

1681
01:49:32,526 --> 01:49:33,651
Hello, uncle.

1682
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:38,525
Is it true that you kidnapped
me for the sake of money?

1683
01:49:40,608 --> 01:49:43,233
What is it that you
showed me all these days?

1684
01:49:45,983 --> 01:49:47,774
I'm speaking to you, Raja.

1685
01:50:25,333 --> 01:50:28,458
- We found the girl.
- They found her it seems.

1686
01:50:28,541 --> 01:50:31,832
What is the delay? Make all
arrangements for the engagement.

1687
01:50:32,082 --> 01:50:33,665
Okay, I take your leave.

1688
01:50:44,873 --> 01:50:47,248
I did not rest even for
a second when I beat you.

1689
01:50:50,539 --> 01:50:52,414
But you still smile like a groom.

1690
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,955
I should have got the doubt
when I couldn't catch you.

1691
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:01,621
This is the pistol that
I use when doing encounters.

1692
01:51:03,037 --> 01:51:05,953
Tell me where you put
the cash before I count three.

1693
01:51:08,661 --> 01:51:10,869
- Three.
- I like your daughter a lot.

1694
01:51:11,494 --> 01:51:14,119
- She too likes me very much.
- Two.

1695
01:51:14,202 --> 01:51:15,827
But there is no resemblance
between you and her.

1696
01:51:17,368 --> 01:51:19,493
- One.
- You want to know about the money?

1697
01:51:19,868 --> 01:51:21,534
I retained it as dowry.

1698
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:24,534
The only thing remaining is for you
to get your daughter married to me.

1699
01:51:25,909 --> 01:51:28,367
I will never disappoint
you as a son-in-law!

1700
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:29,616
I will kill you!

1701
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:31,282
I will give it right away.

1702
01:51:31,532 --> 01:51:32,907
Sir, the minister is on the line.

1703
01:51:35,073 --> 01:51:36,156
What happened, brother?

1704
01:51:37,864 --> 01:51:40,322
Tommy! Tommy!

1705
01:51:40,405 --> 01:51:41,405
Tommy!

1706
01:51:52,488 --> 01:51:54,113
What is Tommy's belt doing here?

1707
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:57,320
Alas!

1708
01:52:02,195 --> 01:52:04,570
You are the next target,
Govinda Raju!

1709
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:06,945
- What is that crap?
- Please don't tear it, brother.

1710
01:52:07,028 --> 01:52:10,528
I too got a similar letter.
It means that the next target is you!

1711
01:52:12,486 --> 01:52:14,652
Who is there behind him?

1712
01:52:15,652 --> 01:52:18,485
Sir, he is definitely not alone.

1713
01:52:19,318 --> 01:52:21,026
We must find out his
relation with the kidnappers.

1714
01:52:21,984 --> 01:52:23,567
Let us go about as per your plan.

1715
01:52:24,275 --> 01:52:27,441
If you kill him in an encounter
you will be a hero with the masses.

1716
01:52:27,524 --> 01:52:29,274
And your daughter will
consider him useless.

1717
01:52:29,649 --> 01:52:30,815
Father-in-law!

1718
01:52:32,398 --> 01:52:33,981
Let the Minister take precaution!

1719
01:52:34,731 --> 01:52:36,606
Sir, don't mind him.

1720
01:52:36,689 --> 01:52:39,480
Let the marriage happen first.
We will take care of him after that.

1721
01:52:40,188 --> 01:52:43,646
Sir, the plan that I gave now.

1722
01:52:43,729 --> 01:52:45,854
I hope it will help in my promotion!

1723
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:00,353
We wanted to fix the marriage
towards the month end.

1724
01:53:00,436 --> 01:53:03,269
Send in the plumber.
There is no water in the house.

1725
01:53:03,602 --> 01:53:06,102
Priest, make it fast
without any delay.

1726
01:53:08,893 --> 01:53:13,226
Why did you put your hand
suddenly without calling me first?

1727
01:53:13,559 --> 01:53:16,059
He is already in the station...
why worry now?

1728
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:18,350
Is it enough if he alone is captured?

1729
01:53:18,683 --> 01:53:20,724
You said that there
are many others in his team.

1730
01:53:21,099 --> 01:53:23,349
- It is better we take precautions.
- Hey!

1731
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:26,140
Do it fast.
We came to fix the water tank.

1732
01:53:26,223 --> 01:53:28,431
- Where is the terrace?
- Take the stairs and go up there.

1733
01:53:28,514 --> 01:53:29,805
Please send them.

1734
01:53:32,555 --> 01:53:33,721
How long will it take?

1735
01:53:33,804 --> 01:53:35,887
It is almost done.
We just need to put the tank up.

1736
01:53:35,970 --> 01:53:37,303
Okay, do it fast.

1737
01:53:55,386 --> 01:53:58,761
- Sir! What is happening?
- Mukund!

1738
01:53:59,302 --> 01:54:00,677
- Mukund!
- Sir!

1739
01:54:07,343 --> 01:54:08,843
What happened, Sir?

1740
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:11,384
Sir! Sir!

1741
01:54:11,467 --> 01:54:13,633
We searched the entire
house but cannot find Mukund.

1742
01:54:13,716 --> 01:54:15,757
Nonsense!
Are you not ashamed to say that?

1743
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,798
Mukund Is nowhere to be seen.
He has been kidnapped.

1744
01:54:18,214 --> 01:54:20,214
But he said that he will kidnap me.

1745
01:54:20,547 --> 01:54:21,963
Why did he do it to my son?

1746
01:54:22,254 --> 01:54:23,545
Who is he?

1747
01:54:23,628 --> 01:54:26,586
He said he'd target the minister, and
not that the minister would be kidnapped.

1748
01:54:28,086 --> 01:54:30,086
What is the use?
What are you doing?

1749
01:54:30,169 --> 01:54:31,544
Don't unnecessarily abuse us.
We're doing our duty!

1750
01:54:31,627 --> 01:54:32,960
Naeem, calm down.

1751
01:54:33,043 --> 01:54:36,209
Listen, put up check
posts all over the city.

1752
01:54:36,292 --> 01:54:39,833
Get all the hotels in the city and
the resorts on the outskirts checked.

1753
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:41,749
Don't give any room
for their ideas to succeed.

1754
01:54:42,124 --> 01:54:43,124
- Go!
- Yes, sir.

1755
01:54:43,207 --> 01:54:44,373
Fast!

1756
01:54:46,623 --> 01:54:47,914
Take a left turn.

1757
01:54:48,414 --> 01:54:50,997
Why towards the left?
Our house is on the right.

1758
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:52,246
Ramu, take a left turn.

1759
01:55:01,371 --> 01:55:03,662
- Priya, where are you going?
- Uncle!

1760
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:06,703
Is it not enough that you
kidnapped me and took the money?

1761
01:55:06,786 --> 01:55:08,827
Why did you kidnap the minister's son?

1762
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:10,410
How many more kidnaps will you do?

1763
01:55:10,493 --> 01:55:12,409
How many more will
you fleece and torture?

1764
01:55:12,492 --> 01:55:16,033
Priya! What do you know
for you to speak like that?

1765
01:55:17,408 --> 01:55:19,783
I will tell you many more
things that you don't know.

1766
01:55:19,866 --> 01:55:22,199
- Why reveal all that now?
- This is the right time to reveal that.

1767
01:55:23,032 --> 01:55:24,823
She must know about it.

1768
01:55:25,114 --> 01:55:27,197
You shouted and called
him a kidnapper.

1769
01:55:27,447 --> 01:55:29,697
Do you know that he
was once a police officer?

1770
01:55:31,155 --> 01:55:34,905
Your father and Prakash uncle
were good friends once upon a time.

1771
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,238
- Please keep this.
- Don't do it... I don't want.

1772
01:55:51,321 --> 01:55:53,321
- Please keep it, sir.
- No... I don't want.

1773
01:55:53,404 --> 01:55:55,779
- Please keep it, sir.
- I'm telling you I don't want it.

1774
01:55:55,862 --> 01:55:58,820
- Don't you understand?
- Please go and mind your business.

1775
01:55:58,903 --> 01:56:01,069
Whoever worked sincerely
in the station...

1776
01:56:01,319 --> 01:56:04,319
...Prakash uncle used
to treat them as his kin.

1777
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:08,568
- Get out!
- Give the cash!

1778
01:56:09,026 --> 01:56:10,442
Take it!

1779
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:16,150
At that time many kidnappings
happened in the city.

1780
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,483
It became a bother
for the police force.

1781
01:56:24,233 --> 01:56:26,774
- Sir!
- Giri, what happened?

1782
01:56:27,357 --> 01:56:29,273
It seems that the
MLA was kidnapped.

1783
01:56:29,356 --> 01:56:31,439
The MLA Govindaraju was kidnapped.

1784
01:56:31,522 --> 01:56:33,230
Our leader must be freed!

1785
01:56:33,313 --> 01:56:35,688
Our leader Govindaraju
must be released!

1786
01:56:35,771 --> 01:56:38,021
We have been searching
in the city the past three days.

1787
01:56:38,104 --> 01:56:39,687
We will find him.

1788
01:56:40,353 --> 01:56:42,728
Why are you doing
duty on your birthday?

1789
01:56:42,811 --> 01:56:45,144
- There is no option!
- Happy birthday!

1790
01:56:45,227 --> 01:56:46,268
Thank you!

1791
01:56:46,851 --> 01:56:50,101
We brought the driver who was
present when the MLA was kidnapped.

1792
01:56:52,142 --> 01:56:55,808
Tell me the truth.
Tell me who kidnapped him.

1793
01:56:55,891 --> 01:56:58,266
I will tell you. The person
who kidnapped is none other than--

1794
01:57:05,724 --> 01:57:07,140
How can we give you...
It is government money.

1795
01:57:07,223 --> 01:57:09,098
What should we do then?
He should be freed somehow.

1796
01:57:09,181 --> 01:57:11,264
What is that man saying?

1797
01:57:11,514 --> 01:57:13,514
What is this meeting?
First our leaders should be freed.

1798
01:57:13,597 --> 01:57:15,930
Please sit down.
I'm talking to him.

1799
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:19,221
Please request them somehow.

1800
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:28,012
They wanted the money to be given
at the farmhouse outside the city.

1801
01:57:28,095 --> 01:57:30,136
Why do you say that you
want to go to the MLA guesthouse?

1802
01:57:30,219 --> 01:57:32,260
The one doing kidnaps
in the city is none other than...

1803
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:34,510
It is MLA Govindaraju himself.

1804
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:37,468
He's doing all this to stash the
money sanctioned by the government.

1805
01:57:37,551 --> 01:57:39,551
Bring the press and police along.

1806
01:57:39,634 --> 01:57:42,675
- And come to the MLA's house soon.
- Prakash, your gun.

1807
01:57:47,175 --> 01:57:50,758
Sir! SI Prakash is beating
our men and entering the house.

1808
01:57:52,299 --> 01:57:54,965
Keep quiet!
all of you wear your masks.

1809
01:57:59,548 --> 01:58:02,589
Police officer!
Please give the bag to them.

1810
01:58:02,672 --> 01:58:04,880
Otherwise these
people might kill me.

1811
01:58:12,421 --> 01:58:14,296
There are only files
in this bag and no money.

1812
01:58:15,712 --> 01:58:17,628
These are the proofs
for your criminal history.

1813
01:58:17,878 --> 01:58:20,628
These are the files pending
in the court for long.

1814
01:58:21,253 --> 01:58:23,961
It is better that politicians
like you should not live.

1815
01:58:24,836 --> 01:58:27,461
We can explain it away saying
that the kidnappers killed you.

1816
01:58:36,294 --> 01:58:38,294
That gun won't fire, Prakash.

1817
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:53,668
Prakash, your gun!

1818
01:58:56,626 --> 01:58:58,959
Instead of doing
small-time kidnappings...

1819
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:03,333
...it is I who advised him to kidnap
big-time politicians to get more money.

1820
01:59:03,416 --> 01:59:05,707
- Yeah!
- We managed the kidnaps.

1821
01:59:05,790 --> 01:59:10,998
But to escape from that we need
someone to own up doing the kidnappings.

1822
01:59:12,331 --> 01:59:15,289
You must confess that it
is you who did the kidnappings!

1823
01:59:15,372 --> 01:59:16,830
Traitor!

1824
01:59:18,371 --> 01:59:19,496
Khalid!

1825
01:59:20,537 --> 01:59:22,870
Hey! Hey!

1826
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:30,870
Khalid!

1827
01:59:32,661 --> 01:59:34,077
Khalid!

1828
01:59:34,952 --> 01:59:36,952
Hey, capture and
take him from here.

1829
01:59:37,368 --> 01:59:38,951
- Khalid!
- Hey!

1830
01:59:39,284 --> 01:59:41,367
Hey, take him away quickly

1831
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:45,075
- Khalid!
- Sharma, take this gun.

1832
01:59:45,491 --> 01:59:47,324
Shoot him!

1833
01:59:52,282 --> 01:59:53,907
My dear!

1834
01:59:56,948 --> 01:59:59,281
Khalid! Get up!

1835
02:00:08,989 --> 02:00:11,614
Happy birthday, Sir!

1836
02:00:12,822 --> 02:00:14,238
Khalid!

1837
02:00:16,363 --> 02:00:17,571
Khalid!

1838
02:00:23,612 --> 02:00:25,862
After crosschecking the
witnesses and evidences...

1839
02:00:25,945 --> 02:00:28,653
...the court has come to the
conclusion that Prakash is guilty...

1840
02:00:28,736 --> 02:00:33,819
...and the court sentences him to
14 years of rigorous imprisonment.

1841
02:00:37,319 --> 02:00:39,569
He was a sincere officer on duty.

1842
02:00:39,652 --> 02:00:42,110
But he was falsely
Implicated and imprisoned.

1843
02:00:43,151 --> 02:00:45,651
His son Raja could not
live alone without his father.

1844
02:00:45,734 --> 02:00:47,317
They made him an orphan.

1845
02:00:54,275 --> 02:00:56,441
I will bear the
Expenses to raise him.

1846
02:00:56,524 --> 02:00:58,625
Please take good care of Raja.

1847
02:00:58,708 --> 02:01:00,166
As you wish, Madam.

1848
02:01:11,582 --> 02:01:12,873
Take this, sir.

1849
02:01:18,123 --> 02:01:20,831
Sir, this chain belongs
to master Mukund.

1850
02:01:24,789 --> 02:01:28,122
Get 15 crores ready.

1851
02:01:29,622 --> 02:01:32,413
You take care of the Minister
and I will handle this one.

1852
02:01:32,496 --> 02:01:33,496
- Okay?
- Okay.

1853
02:01:33,579 --> 02:01:34,995
- Sir.
- Yeah?

1854
02:01:35,078 --> 02:01:36,994
- You asked for the kidnappers sketch.
- Okay.

1855
02:01:40,619 --> 02:01:42,119
Sir, greetings.

1856
02:01:42,202 --> 02:01:44,285
- I brought the CCTV camera tapes.
- Load them.

1857
02:01:51,035 --> 02:01:52,118
Hey, wait.

1858
02:01:53,784 --> 02:01:54,950
Rewind it.

1859
02:01:57,991 --> 02:01:59,449
Play now!

1860
02:02:04,074 --> 02:02:05,407
Pause it!

1861
02:02:14,907 --> 02:02:17,282
Raja is here... who is it there then?

1862
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:37,698
This is a pre-recorded tape.

1863
02:02:37,781 --> 02:02:40,156
Someone has put them in a loop.
He escaped long ago.

1864
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:42,280
I stayed here without
even going to the loo.

1865
02:02:42,363 --> 02:02:44,279
- Did anyone come here?
- No one came, Sir.

1866
02:02:44,570 --> 02:02:45,903
I did not even go to the loo.

1867
02:02:45,986 --> 02:02:48,111
First go and relieve yourself!

1868
02:02:48,986 --> 02:02:51,611
Sir, Naeem came here
a little while ago.

1869
02:02:52,694 --> 02:02:54,235
We all went to have
some tea at that time.

1870
02:02:54,318 --> 02:02:57,151
Naeem was attending the minister's
son's engagement. How can he come here?

1871
02:02:57,234 --> 02:02:59,067
This is the picture of the
character in the movie Chatrapati.

1872
02:02:59,483 --> 02:03:00,733
Is some film shooting happening here?

1873
02:03:00,816 --> 02:03:03,607
- He is that character for sure!
- Hey, give.

1874
02:03:05,815 --> 02:03:07,940
He told a movie
story and cheated me.

1875
02:03:11,148 --> 02:03:13,398
I see a police point
of view in every step.

1876
02:03:16,981 --> 02:03:18,856
He is definitely not alone.

1877
02:03:25,647 --> 02:03:27,813
Find out who is on the phone.

1878
02:03:30,063 --> 02:03:32,688
- Don't give the money to Naeem.
- Okay.

1879
02:03:34,604 --> 02:03:35,812
Who was on the phone?

1880
02:03:36,312 --> 02:03:37,770
He wanted the money
to be brought immediately.

1881
02:03:37,853 --> 02:03:40,478
He will ask for the
money to be sent quickly.

1882
02:03:40,561 --> 02:03:43,602
The one who lost 15 crores
knows the pain.

1883
02:03:43,685 --> 02:03:46,518
Don't worry, brother.
We still have 500 crores up there.

1884
02:03:46,601 --> 02:03:48,351
Why should you reveal that to all?

1885
02:03:50,851 --> 02:03:54,184
Naeem, I spoke in haste.
Don't mind that.

1886
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:57,433
- I won't mind, Sir.
- Oh police man.

1887
02:03:57,891 --> 02:04:00,724
I handed 15 crores cash
to you due to faith in you.

1888
02:04:00,807 --> 02:04:02,515
Get my son released quickly.

1889
02:04:02,598 --> 02:04:04,181
Don't worry, brother.

1890
02:04:04,264 --> 02:04:06,347
There is God above...
And our man here.

1891
02:04:06,430 --> 02:04:09,096
- We can trust them!
- Oh great lord.

1892
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:12,012
It's gone for good!

1893
02:04:19,553 --> 02:04:22,178
- Greetings, Sir. What will you take?
- A cup of tea.

1894
02:04:23,219 --> 02:04:24,594
Make it two!

1895
02:04:32,677 --> 02:04:33,802
Come and sit.

1896
02:04:37,843 --> 02:04:39,009
Come here.

1897
02:05:05,259 --> 02:05:07,009
Super!

1898
02:05:07,884 --> 02:05:11,592
People may have changed...
But not the taste of tea!

1899
02:05:13,133 --> 02:05:16,508
The kidnaps happening in the city.

1900
02:05:17,424 --> 02:05:19,382
Ineffectiveness of the police!

1901
02:05:19,965 --> 02:05:21,340
Is this an ad?

1902
02:05:24,006 --> 02:05:27,839
Could you not find
some sacrificial lamb?

1903
02:05:28,214 --> 02:05:30,047
You are used to it.

1904
02:05:33,505 --> 02:05:36,421
You selected someone
to do the kidnaps.

1905
02:05:36,671 --> 02:05:39,171
He is none other than my own son.

1906
02:05:40,837 --> 02:05:43,337
Raja... Raja Harischandra Prasad!

1907
02:05:52,128 --> 02:05:55,586
You must be wondering what went wrong
when everything happened as per your plan.

1908
02:05:58,794 --> 02:06:01,627
It is actually
we who made the plan.

1909
02:06:02,543 --> 02:06:03,918
Hope you remember the plan.

1910
02:06:04,001 --> 02:06:07,001
We will get some big-shot kidnapped
by an officer of our department.

1911
02:06:09,126 --> 02:06:11,376
The person who told you the plan...

1912
02:06:11,459 --> 02:06:13,500
...Is the son of Khalid Pasha
whom you shot dead.

1913
02:06:17,458 --> 02:06:18,624
Naeem Pasha!

1914
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:32,248
- I put the money here for my tea.
- Okay, sir.

1915
02:06:33,164 --> 02:06:34,955
I don't like being in debt.

1916
02:06:36,413 --> 02:06:37,496
Goodbye!

1917
02:06:49,079 --> 02:06:51,329
I was told to hand
you over this box.

1918
02:07:01,287 --> 02:07:02,995
You look very good on TV,
father-in-law.

1919
02:07:03,078 --> 02:07:06,536
I hope you will appreciate me
for shooting you so well. Run Raja!

1920
02:07:09,577 --> 02:07:12,910
The one responsible for the kidnaps
in the city is none other than...

1921
02:07:12,993 --> 02:07:16,368
...the Police Commissioner Dilip Kumar
who was appointed for the case.

1922
02:07:17,826 --> 02:07:21,492
Inspector Sharma, the MLA...
I'm doing all that as per plan.

1923
02:07:21,575 --> 02:07:24,366
Not just that. He killed
the people who knew the truth...

1924
02:07:24,449 --> 02:07:27,115
...and buried them
in his farmhouse.

1925
02:07:29,531 --> 02:07:32,989
The locals revealed that and it
made a strong case against him.

1926
02:07:33,072 --> 02:07:36,030
The police are exhuming
those dead bodies.

1927
02:08:07,405 --> 02:08:09,030
Please open the door!

1928
02:08:09,113 --> 02:08:11,279
Open the door, please.

1929
02:08:12,404 --> 02:08:14,154
Please stop it.

1930
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:24,153
This is not a sin that will
be washed away by a single bullet.

1931
02:08:27,569 --> 02:08:29,069
You must get proper punishment.

1932
02:08:33,069 --> 02:08:34,694
Sir, the plumber has come.

1933
02:08:34,777 --> 02:08:35,985
Sorry for the delay.

1934
02:08:36,068 --> 02:08:37,693
But you already sent your assistant.

1935
02:08:37,776 --> 02:08:40,359
I don't have any assistant.

1936
02:08:42,650 --> 02:08:46,400
Who is the person who came
in the morning and went up?

1937
02:08:51,316 --> 02:08:52,482
- Papa!
- Ah!

1938
02:08:54,065 --> 02:08:55,273
What are you doing here?

1939
02:08:55,356 --> 02:08:57,606
You did not tell me about this.

1940
02:08:57,689 --> 02:08:59,772
It is all your plan, isn't it.

1941
02:08:59,855 --> 02:09:03,188
Earlier you got yourself
kidnapped and grabbed the money.

1942
02:09:03,271 --> 02:09:06,979
Now since your health is not well,
you wanted me to be kidnapped.

1943
02:09:07,062 --> 02:09:08,728
Who told you all this?

1944
02:09:08,811 --> 02:09:10,936
My brother Naeem told me all this.

1945
02:09:11,019 --> 02:09:14,102
What about the money
in the bathroom in that case?

1946
02:09:16,227 --> 02:09:18,310
Hey, there must be
a lot of money here.

1947
02:09:18,393 --> 02:09:19,851
But it is not there now.

1948
02:09:19,934 --> 02:09:23,934
As per the plan, all of this money
should be stored safely somewhere.

1949
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:30,475
- That's why--
- The entire money?

1950
02:09:30,558 --> 02:09:32,849
- This is all!
- That's what happened, Papa.

1951
02:09:33,890 --> 02:09:35,765
Your son has done a great job.
Right, papa!

1952
02:09:35,848 --> 02:09:37,598
Why do you stand here
and watch the movie?

1953
02:09:37,681 --> 02:09:39,597
Go up and check the tank.

1954
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:40,888
Papa... Check!

1955
02:09:41,304 --> 02:09:42,429
You idiot!

1956
02:09:42,970 --> 02:09:45,095
Sir, please answer the questions.

1957
02:09:45,178 --> 02:09:47,261
The person who supported
me in this is minister Govindaraju.

1958
02:09:47,511 --> 02:09:49,636
- And the MLA Munuswamy.
- Brother!

1959
02:09:49,969 --> 02:09:53,219
We are doomed. The Commissioner
has revealed our names also.

1960
02:09:53,802 --> 02:09:56,927
Sir, the 500 crores stashed
in the tank upstairs...

1961
02:09:57,010 --> 02:09:58,718
...it is entirely gone!

1962
02:10:01,093 --> 02:10:02,759
Brother!

1963
02:10:02,842 --> 02:10:04,092
Sir!

1964
02:10:12,842 --> 02:10:15,342
Why the delay? Start it!

1965
02:10:26,717 --> 02:10:27,967
Hey... wait Naeem!

1966
02:10:28,050 --> 02:10:30,133
If you hit with a stone,
the pain will be temporary.

1967
02:10:30,216 --> 02:10:33,132
But we should hit them in such
a way that the pain stays lifelong.

1968
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:38,215
- We managed it well.
- Why not?

1969
02:10:38,298 --> 02:10:40,756
- Where is the tape?
- Does it hurt a lot?

1970
02:10:41,547 --> 02:10:43,297
Won't it hurt if you beat?

1971
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:45,005
Who are you guys?

1972
02:10:54,713 --> 02:10:58,046
Some strangers donated
around 500 crores...

1973
02:10:58,129 --> 02:11:00,045
...to all the
orphanages in the city.

1974
02:11:00,128 --> 02:11:02,794
This is a superb thing. To find
such good Samaritans these days!

1975
02:11:02,877 --> 02:11:04,793
- Tell me.
- What I'm thinking is--

1976
02:11:04,876 --> 02:11:06,584
This Nano car is a bit cramped.

1977
02:11:06,667 --> 02:11:08,708
I'm asking you about the both of us.

1978
02:11:09,458 --> 02:11:11,041
One moment!

1979
02:11:14,791 --> 02:11:16,082
I--

1980
02:11:16,373 --> 02:11:18,289
- Shall we go to a movie?
- Which one?

1981
02:11:18,539 --> 02:11:20,289
A girl who wears a
lot of golden ornaments...

1982
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:21,913
...and the boy who
claims he can be trusted...

1983
02:11:21,996 --> 02:11:23,996
...such people never
do well in life.

1984
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:25,537
- What are you saying?
- What about you?

1985
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:26,995
Bangaram... calm down.

1986
02:11:27,078 --> 02:11:28,619
She is Priya--

1987
02:11:28,702 --> 02:11:30,368
She might be your ex-girlfriend.

1988
02:11:30,451 --> 02:11:33,034
But would you address
her like that before me.

1989
02:11:33,117 --> 02:11:34,242
Her name is Bangaram.

1990
02:11:34,325 --> 02:11:36,241
- She's not my ex-girlfriend.
- No?

1991
02:11:36,324 --> 02:11:37,949
- Yes!
- Yes?!

1992
02:11:38,032 --> 02:11:40,198
I mean that I'm saying no.

1993
02:11:40,281 --> 02:11:43,322
Don't confuse me
and tell me clearly.

1994
02:11:47,530 --> 02:11:49,238
- Brother!
- Yes?

1995
02:11:51,404 --> 02:11:53,445
If I start here I can go to her father.

1996
02:11:56,153 --> 02:11:58,444
The girl looks good.

1997
02:11:59,777 --> 02:12:02,402
You must trap someone and make
him believe that you love him.

1998
02:12:02,485 --> 02:12:04,568
After that he will make
your father believe it.

1999
02:12:04,651 --> 02:12:07,526
Where can I find such
a sacrificial lamb now?

2000
02:12:11,651 --> 02:12:13,484
I must do a lot for her it seems.

2001
02:12:13,567 --> 02:12:16,400
My dear,
you must understand all this.

2002
02:12:16,483 --> 02:12:17,774
One second.

2003
02:12:18,875 --> 02:12:21,833
Bujji, I love you.

2004
02:12:22,333 --> 02:12:25,666
Hey, why do you take
the name of Bujji?!

2005
02:12:25,749 --> 02:12:27,124
- Why do you take her name again?
- Yes!

2006
02:12:27,207 --> 02:12:28,707
What about me?

2007
02:12:30,498 --> 02:12:33,831
<i>"She is my dear little Bujji."</i>

2008
02:12:33,914 --> 02:12:37,330
<i>"She is my cute little Bujji."</i>

2009
02:12:37,413 --> 02:12:40,746
<i>"My Bujji Is the
darling of my heart."</i>
