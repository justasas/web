1
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>In 1855, England and France
were at war with Russia in the Crimea.</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,193
<i>The English troops were paid in gold.</i>

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:32,824
<i>Once a month £25,000 in gold
was loaded into strongboxes...</i>

4
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,620
<i>..inside the London bank
of Huddleston and Bradford...</i>

5
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,582
<i>..and taken by trusted armed guards
to the railway station.</i>

6
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,003
<i>The convoy followed no fixed route
or timetable.</i>

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:51,301
<i>The gold was loaded into the
luggage van of the Folkestone train...</i>

8
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:55,263
<i>..for shipment to the coast
and from there to the Crimea.</i>

9
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:59,684
<i>The strongboxes
were placed in two Chubb safes...</i>

10
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,605
<i>..constructed
of three-quarter-inch tempered steel.</i>

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,025
<i>Each safe weighed 550 pounds.</i>

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,821
<i>Each safe was fitted with two locks
requiring two keys,...</i>

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,033
<i>..or four keys altogether.</i>

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,497
<i>For security,
each key was individually protected.</i>

15
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:27,295
<i>Two keys were entrusted to the railway
dispatcher, who kept them in his office.</i>

16
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,923
<i>A third was in the custody of
Mr Edgar Trent,...</i>

17
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,218
<i>..president
of the Huddleston and Bradford.</i>

18
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,638
<i>And the fourth key
was given to Mr Henry Fowler,...</i>

19
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,850
<i>..manager of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank.</i>

20
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:44,145
<i>The presence of so much gold
in one place...</i>

21
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:48,149
<i>..aroused the interests
of the English criminal elements,...</i>

22
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:54,947
<i>..but in 1855 there had never been
a robbery from a moving railway train.</i>

23
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:24,137
Is he dead?

24
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:26,472
Mm.

25
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:39,402
Robbery? I'd hardly call it that -
one poor fellow working alone.

26
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:41,612
He had no chance of success.

27
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:44,824
Indeed, speaking on behalf of the bank,...

28
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:50,997
..I must inform you the matter was trivial
and hardly worthy of our consideration.

29
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,916
I think I may say that
without fear of contradiction.

30
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,793
The villain expired?

31
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:59,338
Quite. The guard threw him
from the train at full speed.

32
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:01,632
He died instantly. Poor devil.

33
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:05,344
- He's not been identified?
- I shouldn't think so.

34
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:10,141
The manner of his passing was such
that his features were... disarrayed.

35
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:12,768
He was obviously after the Crimean gold.

36
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,855
- Apparently. Speaking...
- This damnable war...

37
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:19,275
- ..will be the undoing of the nation.
- He's off again.

38
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:23,028
Unrest in the north, and now this
ill-considered war with the Tsar.

39
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:26,699
What do you expect
when one man in seven has the vote?

40
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:29,451
We have shopkeepers voting now!

41
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:32,746
And women next. If they get their way.

42
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:36,292
Women voting! Really!

43
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:40,713
- This robbery had interesting...
- They haven't the capacity for logic.

44
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:45,467
- Too emotional. Quite absurd.
- It's not their logical capacity I enjoy!

45
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:50,597
- Even a good woman's too much trouble.
- Come, Arthur, they do have their uses.

46
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:54,059
Edward's got the proper view
by not marrying at all.

47
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,686
Someone will catch him.

48
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:59,356
- I know one or two with their eye on him.
- No one will catch Edward.

49
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,360
God knows what a man may catch
in London if he's not married!

50
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:07,865
This thief on the train, Henry.
Was there a risk of him stealing the gold?

51
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:12,244
- None. Quite impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

52
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:19,251
Utterly impossible. Two Chubb safes,
four keys separately guarded. lmpossible.

53
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:23,130
- Still, I suppose it could be done.
- I can't imagine how.

54
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:27,509
A thief would have to get all four keys.
Two are locked away in the station.

55
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,848
One is in the hands of our president,
Mr Edgar Trent, who is utterly reliable.

56
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:36,852
<i>I don't know where Mr Trent
keeps his key but I know of the fourth,...</i>

57
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:40,730
..for I am myself
entrusted with guarding it.

58
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:45,360
<i>Damn it, Henry, when are you going to
tell us where you've hidden your key?</i>

59
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:49,489
I keep it about my neck.
I wear it at all times.

60
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,241
Even when bathing?

61
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:54,744
Even while bathing.
It never leaves my person.

62
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:57,330
- Clever.
- Most ingenious.

63
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:01,626
<i>(Henry) So you see, to get all four keys -
quite impossible.</i>

64
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,840
The Crimean gold and all the bank's
other transactions are entirely safe.

65
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:08,967
Thank God for that.

66
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,970
You may count on it, Edward. Count on it.

67
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:18,852
- Who do those men think you are?
- Edward Pierce. A sharp businessman.

68
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:23,106
A sharp businessman?
That covers a multitude of sins.

69
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,275
It does among that group.

70
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:28,778
<i>And what's your business?</i>

71
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:34,909
It's not really clear. I've made a great deal
of money in coal, in the north.

72
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:38,955
- Have you?
- Oh, yes, I have. I'm quite well-off.

73
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,289
Are you?

74
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:45,670
I think so.
I've... made something of myself.

75
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,839
Do they believe all that?

76
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:54,470
Among sharp businessmen
one doesn't ask too many questions.

77
00:07:55,972 --> 00:07:58,850
Do they know of your interest
in the theatre?

78
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:01,561
An unmarried gentleman
must amuse himself.

79
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:05,606
- Must he?
- Oh, yes, he must.

80
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,527
Did they mention the train?

81
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,238
Mm-hm.

82
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:15,116
What did they say?

83
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:18,452
They all agreed that it was impossible.

84
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,497
Simply impossible.

85
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:24,083
You like that?

86
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:41,350
- I can tell it excites you.
- Mm-hm.

87
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,326
<i>(bells chime)</i>

88
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,745
<i>(knuckles crack)</i>

89
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,530
<i>(woman)
Oh! Are you all right?</i>

90
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:38,007
Nice pull.

91
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:45,848
Not bad, if I do say so myself.
You look well.

92
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:47,975
Yes. How was the touch?

93
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,061
You saw it, didn't you?

94
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:52,730
<i>Or was I so fast you couldn't see it?</i>

95
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:56,943
I saw.

96
00:10:57,026 --> 00:11:00,071
- Did you wire her?
- No, just my hands.

97
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:02,490
Hummingbirds.

98
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:10,289
- Thinking of a job, then?
- I may have one or two little things.

99
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:18,089
Those one or two little things...
Could they be crib jobs?

100
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:19,382
They could.

101
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:22,051
- Bit dicey, are they?
- Very dicey.

102
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:24,679
- Is it dipping or keys?
- Keys.

103
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:28,140
- Wax or a straightaway haul?
- Wax.

104
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:32,103
You didn't do the Berkeley Hills job,
did you?

105
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,730
Berkeley Hills? Shit job.

106
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:38,984
A shit job? Well,
they're clean with 2,000 guineas gone.

107
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:42,196
No. I was thinking of something bigger.

108
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:48,619
- This wax. On the fly?
- Mm-hm.

109
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:50,496
Then I'm your man.

110
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,208
- The fastest screwsman you'll ever see.
- So I heard.

111
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:58,128
- What's it to be, then?
- First we must case a square-rigged gent.

112
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:01,882
Good night.

113
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:04,051
<i>(Pierce) Mr Edgar Trent,...</i>

114
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:07,805
<i>..president of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank,...</i>

115
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:10,474
<i>..follows an inflexible routine,...</i>

116
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:14,937
<i>..departing the bank
at the end of each day promptly at 7 pm.</i>

117
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,458
<i>(Pierce's woman friend) Mr Trent resides
at number seven Belgrave Square.</i>

118
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:41,171
<i>It's a mansion of 23 rooms,
not including servants' quarters.</i>

119
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:45,217
<i>His second wife, Emily,
is 30 years his junior...</i>

120
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:52,265
<i>..and with her unmarried stepdaughter
she runs the household very strictly.</i>

121
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:58,647
<i>There are ten servants employed.</i>

122
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,194
<i>(screwsman) Coachman, butler,
gardener, doorman, cook and two maids.</i>

123
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:07,280
<i>All the servants are content
and can't be bribed.</i>

124
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:12,202
- Dogs?
- Two. Terriers. Walks 'em twice a day.

125
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:15,455
<i>Seven in the morning and 8.15 at night.</i>

126
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:18,541
<i>- Children?
- Five.</i>

127
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:22,754
<i>Three at home.
The youngest is a boy who sleepwalks.</i>

128
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:25,048
<i>Which creates a commotion.</i>

129
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,342
<i>(child crying out)</i>

130
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:41,731
No point in cracking a 23-room house
until we find out where the key is.

131
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:45,443
The person who knows
where that key is is Mr Trent.

132
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:49,322
Really?

133
00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:56,913
He must have a weakness.
Gambling, drink... Women?

134
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,957
Well, hello!

135
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,126
<i>(murmured proposition)</i>

136
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,466
No, no, no.

137
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,969
No!

138
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:20,186
<i>No respectable gentleman
is that respectable.</i>

139
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:40,831
<i>(dog barks)</i>

140
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:56,639
- He's a ratting gent.
- Indeed he is.

141
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:10,736
Thank you, gentlemen, please!
Mind your back there, sir!

142
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,405
Thank you! Excuse me, sir!

143
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:16,450
Nothing but the finest, gentlemen.

144
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:22,372
Every one country-born and bred,
not a water ditch among 'em.

145
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:26,668
Who wants to try a rat?
Come on, gents. Who wants to try a rat?

146
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:29,630
<i>(Trent)
15 of your best for my fancy.</i>

147
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:34,927
Weigh the fancy of Mr T.
A very sporting gentleman.

148
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:39,931
Let Mr T's fancy dog through.
There you are.

149
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:45,937
<i>- (man) 14 pounds.
- 14 pounds is Mr T's fancy dog.</i>

150
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,232
And he's called for a try at 15 rats.

151
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,736
- Shall it be three minutes, Mr T?
- Yes.

152
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:57,908
Three minutes it is.
You may wager as you feel fit.

153
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,703
Get him his 15, Tom.

154
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:07,209
You win some, you lose some.

155
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,589
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

156
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,385
And... go!

157
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,743
Time, gentlemen. Three minutes!

158
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:18,789
Get the dog out. Get the dog out.
Thank you, gentlemen.

159
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,875
Pay your debts. Who's next?

160
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,170
Come on! Any man fancy his fancy?

161
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:27,673
A sporting chap.
You win one or two, you lose one or two.

162
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:34,263
Who's going to be next to try the finest
country-bred rats that money can buy?

163
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,897
May I join you?

164
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,774
If you like.

165
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,030
<i>(faint shouts from punters)</i>

166
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,333
Lover wasn't at his best. He lacked bustle.
But he came up well enough.

167
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,794
- My Lover will fight again.
- Indeed.

168
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,922
And I shall wager upon him again
when he does.

169
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,217
- Did you lose much?
- Ten guineas. A trifle.

170
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,095
Ten guineas!

171
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,016
Well, I'm pleased you take it so lightly.

172
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,395
I admire a man
who may keep a fancy and sport him.

173
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:28,525
I should do so myself
were I not so often abroad on business.

174
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,446
Whenever I'm gone,
my wife looks after the animals.

175
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:37,868
I fear I've been too devoted to business
these past few years.

176
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,288
I've never married.

177
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,251
- Of course, I should like to.
- Of course.

178
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,798
It's so hard to meet a suitable girl.

179
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,856
<i>- (Pierce) What are you constructing?
- (woman) A water wheel. Delightful.</i>

180
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:13,737
Especially with the rusted curve of
the water wheel itself. Don't you agree?

181
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:18,033
We are building the rusted wheel
at considerable expense.

182
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:23,830
It is constructed of previously rusted
metal. The craftsmen are ingenious.

183
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:29,627
But we must wait for the weeds to grow
before it takes on the proper appearance.

184
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,422
Oh, I'm sure it'll be a handsome ruin.

185
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,424
Where is Elizabeth?

186
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,385
I have passed many pleasant hours here...

187
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:42,015
..watching the workmen
fit each piece into its precise slot.

188
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,018
Such skill.

189
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,770
They screw it together?

190
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:52,358
No, bolt it, actually,
with long bolts. Fitted tightly.

191
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,738
Yes. Long bolts, fitted tightly.

192
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,286
I've just returned from America,
a country of many prominent erections.

193
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,956
It is exciting to see things come together.

194
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,959
So long as the quality does not suffer.

195
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,629
Tight-fitting joints. That's the secret.

196
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,758
It is so rare these days.

197
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:23,055
It depends on the skill of the workman,
of course.

198
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,309
And he must have the proper tools.

199
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,686
Ah, my darling daughter!

200
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:34,400
Now may I present Mr Edward Pierce?
My daughter Elizabeth.

201
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,571
Miss Trent,
you've taken me completely by surprise.

202
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,365
I cannot tell if that's to my advantage.

203
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,993
I can assure you it is, wholly.

204
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,247
- Would you try one of these, Mr Pierce?
- With gratitude.

205
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,207
Er...

206
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,544
We are just discussing the ruins,
Elizabeth.

207
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:58,090
- It's coming along so nicely.
- That dreadful ruin. I can't bear it.

208
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,844
They've taken away so many flowers.

209
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,429
You're fond of flowers?

210
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,431
- More tea, Mr Pierce?
- Ah, yes.

211
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,768
Yes, I supervise the planting
of all the flowers in the garden.

212
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,687
What there is left of it.

213
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,523
I'm especially fond of the primroses.

214
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,941
Ah, yes!

215
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,318
Perhaps you'd like to see them?

216
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,696
I'd be delighted!

217
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,865
Will you excuse us?

218
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,952
It's quite rare
for a man to take an interest in flowers.

219
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,289
The best of them are just over here.
Let me show you.

220
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,709
I don't know that he's suitable for her.

221
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,296
- Oh, he seems nice enough.
- He has far too much to say.

222
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,425
We also have many daffodils.
They've just come up.

223
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:47,264
It gives me such pleasure to see beautiful
things spring forth. Don't you agree?

224
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,516
Yes, I do agree. But tell me...

225
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,985
He has his charm.

226
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,363
You don't care who she marries, do you?

227
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,534
Is she really plain?

228
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,328
That she is.

229
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,875
- And you find her tedious?
- Unbearably tedious.

230
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,713
- How does she wear her hair?
- On her head.

231
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,924
Really, I never noticed.

232
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,345
You're in a hurry.

233
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,514
I am a relentless suitor.

234
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,143
Besides, she still hasn't told me
what I need to know.

235
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,771
Where did you learn to ride?

236
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,067
- A lady never asks such a question.
- I'm serious.

237
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,319
France.

238
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,488
On an estate in France.

239
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,782
Not in America?

240
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,411
No, I've never been to America.

241
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:55,957
When were you in France?

242
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,002
It's been some time now.

243
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,548
Do you ever tell anyone the truth?

244
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,050
The truth?

245
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,012
The truth?

246
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,348
No.

247
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:01,564
I worry about him so.

248
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:06,318
- He was fearfully nervous this morning.
- Really?

249
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:10,406
Father's always nervous
when he sends the gold to Crimea.

250
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,783
He's a different man on those days.

251
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:15,369
He bears a heavy responsibility.

252
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,913
He acts so strangely!

253
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:26,130
He's entirely opposed to the consumption
of any alcohol before nightfall.

254
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:32,761
- Very sensible.
- I suspect he breaks his own regulation.

255
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:37,224
For each morning of the shipments
he goes alone to the wine cellars.

256
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:42,145
With no servants to hold the lanterns.
He insists on going alone.

257
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:45,148
Perhaps he's just checking the contents.

258
00:24:45,232 --> 00:24:50,237
No, he relies upon my stepmother
to stock and care for the cellar.

259
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:55,200
- Every man has his eccentricities.
- I suppose.

260
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:59,079
What are your eccentricities,
dear Edward?

261
00:24:59,162 --> 00:25:01,248
Mine? I have none at all.

262
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:04,000
Well, one.

263
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:09,422
I am excessively preoccupied
with a certain lovely young lady.

264
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,424
Sir!

265
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:14,177
You're a bold rogue to be so forward.

266
00:25:15,762 --> 00:25:20,809
I might even begin to suspect you
of some motive in your advances.

267
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:23,645
Never, my darling.

268
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:26,439
Oh, dear Edward.

269
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:28,650
I'm so happy.

270
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:31,695
And I am happy too.

271
00:25:32,904 --> 00:25:36,741
<i>(thinks) He keeps the key
in the bloody wine cellar.</i>

272
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,845
<i>(bell)</i>

273
00:26:05,728 --> 00:26:07,814
<i>(faint duet on piano)</i>

274
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:32,588
Good evening, madam.
May I be of service?

275
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:37,176
- Is this the household of Mr Jeffers?
- No, madam. Mr Jeffers' house...

276
00:26:39,512 --> 00:26:41,597
<i>(duet continues)</i>

277
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,491
<i>(duet continues)</i>

278
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:23,514
Thank you, my good man.

279
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:17,901
<i>(creaking)</i>

280
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:24,074
- Shh!
- It's only the wind.

281
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:47,764
Where do you think it could be?

282
00:28:51,726 --> 00:28:53,895
<i>- (sneezes)
- (whispers) Shut up!</i>

283
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,315
Sorry.

284
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:07,033
<i>- (sneezes)
- Shh!</i>

285
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:34,852
John, would you check the cellar, please?

286
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:37,021
Yes, madam.

287
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:46,614
<i>(door opens)</i>

288
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:50,201
<i>(footsteps)</i>

289
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,745
<i>(Trent)
John?</i>

290
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:56,415
- John? Where's John?
- I'm down here, sir.

291
00:29:56,624 --> 00:30:01,504
- What are you doing down there?
- Madam felt she heard a noise...

292
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:04,256
Madam always feels she's heard a noise.

293
00:30:04,465 --> 00:30:07,843
Come along now.
I need you to find my best pipe.

294
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:11,889
- It's misplaced again.
- Certainly, sir.

295
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:15,476
<i>- (door closes)
- That was a close one.</i>

296
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,729
Didn't do my heart any good, I'll say that.

297
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:20,898
Mind the light!

298
00:30:21,315 --> 00:30:23,067
Here.

299
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:28,405
That's not the bloody key. See the rust?
Nobody's touched that betty in years.

300
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:32,660
It's odd, though. I've never seen
the likes of that before, small as it is.

301
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:37,414
Very delicate. It could be a lady's twirl
for some feminine trifle.

302
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,583
Watch the light!

303
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:45,631
It's not my fault you're having trouble.
It's your bloody idea, isn't it?

304
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:49,676
- Here.
- That's a key for a Chubb safe.

305
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,179
Let's see how fast you can wax.

306
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:55,182
Mind the light.

307
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,476
Bastard.

308
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:00,812
<i>(duet continues upstairs)</i>

309
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:12,574
Beautiful, isn't it?

310
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:14,743
Brilliant.

311
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:41,227
<i>(hums)</i>

312
00:31:58,828 --> 00:32:00,622
What does this clause mean?

313
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:03,458
Never mind that.
What about that one over there?

314
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:05,084
In pink?

315
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:09,214
Wouldn't mind making a deposit
in that one, I dare say.

316
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:12,675
If she didn't provoke a hasty withdrawal.

317
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:15,345
Not on my account, I fancy.

318
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:21,476
Besides, she is Sir John Basington's minx
and accustomed to hasty withdrawals!

319
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,771
Quite without principle, don't you think?

320
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,984
But here now - I say!

321
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:37,116
<i>Monsieur, avez... Excuse-moi.</i>

322
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,285
Have you got my deposit account?

323
00:32:39,535 --> 00:32:44,415
That's what I call a proper woman.
Which is to say, not proper at all!

324
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,919
She gives good value, long term or short.

325
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:49,670
Eh?

326
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:51,505
- You know her?
- Mm.

327
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:55,426
Where have you been keeping her,
Edward, you rogue?

328
00:32:56,427 --> 00:33:01,098
She's a vision.
Not at all bad for a foreign woman.

329
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:05,561
I don't think she's your type.

330
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:08,898
She's precisely my type.
Will you make an introduction?

331
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:11,066
- Fowler.
- Trent.

332
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:15,154
Will you make an introduction?

333
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:19,825
Not here, of course.
What are you doing tonight?

334
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,120
Well, I had arranged to go to the theatre...

335
00:33:23,204 --> 00:33:26,665
Come, come, my dear fellow.
Are we not friends?

336
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:32,254
More than that, Henry.

337
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:34,798
Much more.

338
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:50,314
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yes, that's the plan.

339
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,276
That's all you have to say?

340
00:33:54,943 --> 00:33:57,029
It's the job, innit?

341
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:01,742
I suppose you expect me
to dab it up with that fat, repulsive...

342
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:05,120
I suppose you expect me
to go through with it!

343
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,497
It's up to you, innit?

344
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,375
Bloody hell!

345
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:25,932
<i>(dance music and chat)</i>

346
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:40,488
Shall we go, darling?

347
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:03,803
Very nice.

348
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:07,056
- She's here, is she?
- Oh, yeah, she's here.

349
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,808
Evening, gentlemen.

350
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:12,729
<i>(knuckles crack)
How can I be of service to you?</i>

351
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:16,399
My friend would like to see
Madame Lucienne.

352
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,445
Madame Lucienne?

353
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,864
Madame Lucienne.

354
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:25,325
She holds a very rigid standard.

355
00:35:26,617 --> 00:35:29,620
- Well, that's all right, isn't it?
- Yes.

356
00:35:29,912 --> 00:35:31,998
Come this way.

357
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:51,434
You go up the stairs, sir...
and through the first door on your right.

358
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,020
Madame Lucienne
will be with you presently.

359
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:56,188
- Very gay here.
- Yes.

360
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:28,470
- Monsieur...?
- Er... Jones.

361
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,472
Jones.

362
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,851
I am very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

363
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,604
I as well.

364
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:38,063
You are nervous?

365
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:42,151
No, I just thought we might become...
better acquainted.

366
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:45,946
<i>Oh, mon chéri, you are nervous.
There is no need to be.</i>

367
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:50,701
I will take care of every little thing.

368
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:55,038
And every big thing.

369
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,796
Oh...

370
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,300
Such a strong man!

371
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:11,471
Well, yes, I did a bit of sport.
When I was younger, of course.

372
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:13,682
Oh, but you are still young.

373
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:16,768
And very strong.

374
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:20,313
- You want this off as well?
- It is best, no?

375
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,151
The touch of flesh to flesh.

376
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,945
The warmth of the body.

377
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:31,032
<i>- This is the French way, is it?
- Oui, mon cher.</i>

378
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:35,120
- What is this?
- A key. But I'm afraid...

379
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:39,249
Oh, there must be nothing...
nothing between us.

380
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:41,418
Oh, yes.

381
00:37:48,592 --> 00:37:50,552
<i>Now if you will sit on the
lit.</i>

382
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:54,389
<i>- The what?
- The lit - the bed, the bed, the bed.</i>

383
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:02,689
Oh, it is so exciting!

384
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:06,234
You... How do you say...

385
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,571
You inflame me.

386
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:14,576
But, madame,
do you not remove your own clothing?

387
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:18,705
Oh, my own... Why, yes, of course.

388
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:20,790
In just a moment.

389
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:26,713
- Just a moment.
- Do make haste, madam.

390
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,881
Yes, yes, I will.

391
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:40,017
<i>(whistle)</i>

392
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,105
Oh, my God, the police!

393
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:46,441
<i>Quel

394
00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:58,244
<i>(whistle)</i>

395
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,833
Come on, Henry, for God's sake!

396
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,002
I'm coming!

397
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,214
- Police, where are they?
- Downstairs.

398
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:12,383
- But I could be ruined!
- Quite!

399
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,635
I know the back way.

400
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:32,695
<i>(train whistle)</i>

401
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:14,653
You couldn't have picked
something more difficult.

402
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:17,239
- You said you're the bloody best.
- And I am.

403
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:22,286
But that's the devil's own crib.
I've watched it three days. Look there.

404
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:27,332
You have to get past those crushers,
then up those stairs in plain sight.

405
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:30,001
Then into that crib. Anybody can see you.

406
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:33,380
Bloody silly.
lnvitation to prison, that place is.

407
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:36,216
What's your pogue up there?

408
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:39,136
Two Chubb keys in that green cupboard.

409
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:45,141
What might they be, them keys?

410
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:49,271
Two keys that I happen to want.

411
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,776
We're partners, aren't we?

412
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:59,155
If you're trying to say
that you don't trust me completely...

413
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,324
I don't trust you at all.

414
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:04,244
Good.

415
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:08,707
We've been gulling banksmen,
now we're in a railway station.

416
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,793
What's in a station? Trains is in a...

417
00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:15,839
Mother of God!
You're after the Crimean g...

418
00:41:15,922 --> 00:41:19,217
Trying to rob a moving train -
it can't be done.

419
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,760
Why not?

420
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:23,429
<i>- It hasn't been done, has it?
- No.</i>

421
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:26,224
Crimean gold. Mother of God!

422
00:41:26,307 --> 00:41:30,937
That's £25,000, isn't it?
A big shipment, isn't it? 25,000 quid.

423
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,147
- Mother of God!
- Are you ready to go in?

424
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,108
Am I... Yes.

425
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:37,527
Where's the chavy?

426
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,696
There.

427
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,825
He's your son.

428
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,910
I don't have no son.

429
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:47,870
Louisa says he's your son.

430
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:49,872
Hmph! Louisa!

431
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:52,166
She wouldn't know. Is that him?

432
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:56,045
He's not my son.
He's too ugly to be my son!

433
00:41:58,172 --> 00:42:00,007
So what's the sweetener?

434
00:42:00,091 --> 00:42:02,176
A guinea.

435
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:05,638
Well, if he is my son, he'll be worth it.

436
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:16,315
- Are we ready?
- Mm!

437
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:20,277

438
00:42:30,788 --> 00:42:35,125
- Oh, Geoffrey! I've been robbed!
- Stop thief! Stop that boy!

439
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:38,420
Somebody stop him!

440
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:41,840
Police! Stop that boy!

441
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:44,927
Police! Stop that boy!

442
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:48,722
Stop thief! Stop that boy!

443
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:50,891
I've got him!

444
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:04,446
- Stop that boy. He's a thief.
- What's going on?

445
00:43:05,948 --> 00:43:08,033
Oh, I'm sorry.

446
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,578
Take that!

447
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,837
Are you all right?

448
00:43:26,093 --> 00:43:28,178
Under! After him.

449
00:43:30,764 --> 00:43:32,265
Get off!

450
00:43:33,475 --> 00:43:36,645
Oh, my dear chap.
Awfully sorry. Are you all right?

451
00:43:43,527 --> 00:43:45,987
<i>- Gotcha!
- (police whistles)</i>

452
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:59,501
Well done. And thank you, gentlemen.

453
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:02,420
Damn thieves. They're everywhere.

454
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:15,058
- Did you wax them?
- Not a prayer. Not a bloody prayer.

455
00:44:15,141 --> 00:44:17,227
Never crack that crib.

456
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,814
- Not in daylight.
- I said it was impossible.

457
00:44:21,106 --> 00:44:23,483
- What about night?
- Night!

458
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,863
<i>(screwsman) I've marked this crib
for three nights.</i>

459
00:44:28,947 --> 00:44:32,867
<i>There's a jack at the top of the stairs
all night long.</i>

460
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:37,872
<i>(faint voices)</i>

461
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:44,212
<i>He talks to the constable making his
rounds - but he doesn't leave his post.</i>

462
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:52,136
<i>Then at two o'clock he takes his tightener.</i>

463
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:19,872
<i>And right at 2.30 he goes off
to relieve himself from his bottle of beer.</i>

464
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:22,041
<i>And that's when I time him.</i>

465
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:28,381
<i>I time him from when he goes off
to when he comes back.</i>

466
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:45,856
<i>And it's been the same - three nights
running. A very regular bloke, is this jack.</i>

467
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,745
75 seconds.

468
00:46:00,537 --> 00:46:02,498
It's a coopered ken.

469
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:08,128
You say you're the fastest screwsman
in the country. Well, here's a challenge.

470
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:13,509
Challenge? 75 seconds for two keys?
It's nigh impossible.

471
00:46:14,343 --> 00:46:18,055
What if a snakesman comes over the roof
and cracks it from the inside?

472
00:46:18,138 --> 00:46:22,351
What snakesman's to break that drum?
Nobody good enough is out.

473
00:46:22,434 --> 00:46:24,102
The best is Clean Willy and he's in.

474
00:46:24,186 --> 00:46:26,480
- Where's he in?
- Newgate Prison.

475
00:46:26,563 --> 00:46:28,774
And there's no escaping that.

476
00:46:33,945 --> 00:46:36,239
Only Willy can climb that.

477
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,076
Shame he's in Newgate.

478
00:46:49,586 --> 00:46:51,671
<i>(child cries)</i>

479
00:47:30,835 --> 00:47:33,838
No, guv, don't cut me. I'm goin'.

00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:48,895
Hello, dearie. Comin' in for a good time?

481
00:47:49,312 --> 00:47:51,397
You won't be sorry.

482
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:20,301
What's it to be, guv?

483
00:48:21,093 --> 00:48:23,012
Bit of a tickle for you?

484
00:48:23,095 --> 00:48:26,140
You dab it up with Clean Willy
the snakesman, right?

485
00:48:26,223 --> 00:48:28,726
I did. He's in Newgate now.

486
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:30,353
You visit?

487
00:48:30,436 --> 00:48:32,355
I do now and again.

488
00:48:32,438 --> 00:48:35,149
I visits as his sister, see?

489
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:39,153
There's another of those
if you can downy him a message.

490
00:48:39,236 --> 00:48:41,447
What's it to be?

491
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:46,327
- Tell Willy to break at the next topping.
- There's no breaks from Newgate!

492
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:50,206
Tell him he breaks at the next topping
or he's not Clean Willy.

493
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:54,001
Tell him to go to the house
where he first met John Simms.

494
00:48:54,084 --> 00:48:55,961
John Simms.

495
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:58,130
<i>(woman laughs)</i>

496
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:01,884
Are you John Simms?

497
00:49:27,743 --> 00:49:31,413
<i>(crowd)
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.</i>

498
00:49:31,788 --> 00:49:35,500
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

499
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:39,671
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

500
00:49:41,006 --> 00:49:43,091
Fine day for a hanging.

501
00:49:44,092 --> 00:49:46,970
Do you really think he'll make it?

502
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:50,474
- Did you bring the trimmings?
- It's all here.

503
00:49:50,557 --> 00:49:52,559
- Medicine?
- Everything.

504
00:49:52,642 --> 00:49:54,895
- Do you want some cold chicken?
- No.

505
00:49:54,978 --> 00:49:58,690
Willy's the best snakesman there is -
but he can't get out of there.

506
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:02,652
Dearly beloved,
wonder not if the world hate you.

507
00:50:02,736 --> 00:50:07,407
We know that we have passed from death
to life because we love the brethren.

508
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,285
He that loveth not abideth in death.

509
00:50:10,368 --> 00:50:13,121
Whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer.

510
00:50:13,204 --> 00:50:18,168
And you know that no murderer
hath eternal life abiding in himself.

511
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:21,588
In this we have known the charity of God.

512
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:00,501
And in God's house...

513
00:51:06,674 --> 00:51:11,220
Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me...

514
00:51:11,637 --> 00:51:14,390
..and in God's house forevermore...

515
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:19,228
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

516
00:51:23,983 --> 00:51:26,777
They say Willy can climb a wall of glass.

517
00:51:26,861 --> 00:51:29,614
If anyone can do it, Clean Willy can.

518
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:28,672
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

519

533
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:44,890
Well... better than last time.

534
00:54:44,974 --> 00:54:46,225
Two seconds better.

535
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:48,894
But you still haven't broken
the 75 seconds.

536
00:54:48,978 --> 00:54:51,313
Well, it is better.

537
00:54:51,397 --> 00:54:53,482
But not good enough.

538
00:54:54,984 --> 00:54:57,069
We'll try again later.

539
00:54:57,486 --> 00:54:59,572
Where are you going?

540
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:02,199
But you're so tired.

541
00:55:02,616 --> 00:55:04,702
I'm not tired.

542
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:18,007

- Yes.
- All right?

Oh, I'm well enough.

You been at the fight?

563
00:59:55,990 --> 01:00:01,246
Hmph! Fancy Dan and Stunning Bill.
Wasn't my fight, was it?

564
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:03,414

- Mm.

from the train at Romney,...

- Yes, after that!

01:08:31,668 --> 01:08:33,378
What could go wrong?

693
01:08:33,795 --> 01:08:35,881
My dear Mr Simms.

694
01:08:36,173 --> 01:08:38,300
As your humble servant,...

695
01:08:39,217 --> 01:08:42,596
..I would be greatly obliged
and indebted...

696
01:08:43,722 --> 01:08:48,435
..if you could contrive to meet with me
at the Palace, Sydenham...

697
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:51,313
..for the purpose...

698
01:08:52,897 --> 01:08:54,983
For the purpose...

699
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,529
For the purpose
of discussing some matters of...

700
01:08:59,696 --> 01:09:01,698
..mutual interest.

701
01:09:01,781 --> 01:09:03,867
Most respectfully,...

702
01:09:04,367 --> 01:09:06,578
..William Williams, Esquire.

703
01:09:07,787 --> 01:09:09,873
That should do it.

704
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:13,835
Well now, Willy...

705
01:09:14,419 --> 01:09:16,796
What's this fellow Simms up to, eh?

706
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,090
Please, sir, I can't tell you.

707
01:09:19,215 --> 01:09:23,136
Should have thought of that before
we caught you with this purse.

708
01:09:23,428 --> 01:09:25,930
I don't want to go back to prison, sir.

709
01:09:26,014 --> 01:09:28,099
Well, then. Better tell us.

710
01:09:28,975 --> 01:09:30,810
I don't know, sir. I told you.

711
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:35,606
All's I know is that he's a cracksman
planning a flash pull, he is.

712
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,775
The letter will put you on to him.

713
01:09:43,531 --> 01:09:45,324
We'll see.

714
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,785
They'll kill me, they will.

715
01:09:48,744 --> 01:09:51,873
Then see you aren't
running off again, eh?

716
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:57,878
We'll have a look
at this mysterious Mr Simms.

717
01:10:06,429 --> 01:10:08,514
<i>(band plays)</i>

718
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:43,090
Don't turn round, Willy.

719
01:10:48,846 --> 01:10:52,349
- Now, what is it?
- I'm needing a bit, Mr Simms.

720
01:10:53,767 --> 01:10:57,479
- You've been paid.
- I'm needing more.

721
01:10:58,647 --> 01:11:02,651
- You been working, Willy?
- No!

722
01:11:02,734 --> 01:11:05,654
- Did the crushers pick you up?
- I swear it, no!

723
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:14,705
- Willy, if you've turned nose on me...
- I swear it's no flam.

724
01:11:14,788 --> 01:11:18,917
A finny or two's what I need
and that'll be an end to it.

725
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:23,171
There's a finny in your pocket.

726
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:26,675
You're sweating.

727
01:11:26,758 --> 01:11:30,512
If you've turned nose on me,
I'll see you in lavender.

728
01:11:30,595 --> 01:11:32,514
Not me, sir. I swear!

729
01:11:38,812 --> 01:11:40,897
Three crushers.

730
01:12:01,126 --> 01:12:03,211
Edward! Edward Pierce!

731
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:08,174
Edward, we were wondering
what had become of you.

732
01:12:08,258 --> 01:12:10,343
I got married.

733
01:12:11,052 --> 01:12:13,138
Must dash.

734
01:12:16,808 --> 01:12:21,396
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Wouldn't surprise me.

735
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:25,733
Very rough man. Not a good sort at all.

736
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,526
<i>(snoring)</i>

737
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:49,918
<i>(thudding upstairs)</i>

738
01:15:55,233 --> 01:15:59,028
- So, the snakesman is dead.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

739
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:03,282
- And this fellow Simms has vanished?
- Yes, sir.

740
01:16:03,366 --> 01:16:06,118
And we don't know who he is
or what he intends?

741
01:16:06,202 --> 01:16:09,372
- We are entirely without clues.
- No, not entirely.

742
01:16:09,455 --> 01:16:15,211
We know Simms arranged for Clean Willy
to break from Newgate some months ago.

743
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:18,881
- So it's a long-standing plan.
- A plan we don't know.

744
01:16:18,964 --> 01:16:22,885
Quite. But we do know Simms is
a safecracker. He must be after safes.

745
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:27,890
And Willy broke into the dispatcher's
office of the South Eastern Railway Line.

746
01:16:27,973 --> 01:16:30,059
Hmm.

747
01:16:30,392 --> 01:16:35,564
And it occurred to me, could this Simms
be planning to steal the Crimean gold?

748
01:16:35,648 --> 01:16:37,942
Steal from a moving railway train?

749
01:16:39,026 --> 01:16:41,195
Who could imagine such a thing?

750
01:16:41,278 --> 01:16:43,572
The next gold shipment is tomorrow.

751
01:16:43,656 --> 01:16:47,493
I've alerted the railway line
to take extra precautions.

752
01:16:47,576 --> 01:16:50,829
- What's this?
- Precautions, sir.

753
01:16:50,913 --> 01:16:55,250
I will ride the train to Folkestone tonight.
I shall be there tomorrow...

754
01:16:55,334 --> 01:16:58,504
..in case there's any tomfoolery
when the gold arrives.

755
01:16:58,587 --> 01:17:01,882
- Very enterprising of you.
- Thank you, sir.

756
01:17:02,383 --> 01:17:06,053
We've made new security
arrangements throughout.

757
01:17:06,136 --> 01:17:07,638
New lock.

758
01:17:07,721 --> 01:17:13,227
New guard, just in case they do have
the audacity to try for the Crimean gold.

759
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:15,521
Excellent foresight, Mr Sharp.

760
01:17:15,604 --> 01:17:19,107
I must commend you
on your attention in this matter.

761
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:22,569
We certainly wouldn't
want to lose that gold.

762
01:17:38,585 --> 01:17:42,964
It's all changed. Everything.
Everything's changed.

763
01:17:43,048 --> 01:17:47,344
No one's allowed to ride in the luggage
van save Burgess himself as guard.

764
01:17:47,427 --> 01:17:50,180
And they've got a new jack
on the platform...

765
01:17:50,263 --> 01:17:53,266
..who opens all parcels
large enough for a man to hide in.

766
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:58,855
And if that ain't bad enough, they've gone
and fitted a lock on the luggage van door.

767
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:05,111
They're locking it at the station and not
opening it until it gets to Folkestone.

768
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:08,823
A precautionary measure.
All on account of the gold.

769
01:18:09,783 --> 01:18:12,952
Bloody outside lock!
It can't be worked from within.

770
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:16,206
Even if I was to be able to
get inside the van...

771
01:18:16,289 --> 01:18:20,168
..I'd be locked inside there
until it gets into Folkestone.

772
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:25,381
And who do you think's behind all this?
Only the crushers theirselves, that's who.

773
01:18:25,965 --> 01:18:28,134
Two plainclothes jacks were there...

774
01:18:28,218 --> 01:18:32,639
..saying as how a Mr Simms
was planning to rob the Crimean gold.

775
01:18:32,722 --> 01:18:37,310
They don't have a high opinion of your
intelligence. But they credit your nerve.

776
01:18:37,393 --> 01:18:42,565
And they've put crushers on every station
on the line and at Folkestone.

777
01:18:42,649 --> 01:18:44,901
So. Here we are.

778
01:18:47,612 --> 01:18:52,200
Burgess is no use. I can't get into the van
because of that jack opening everything.

779
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:57,747
Even if I could, I couldn't get the gold out
as the door's locked from the outside.

780
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:00,708
So what's it to have four keys, I ask you?

781
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:04,879
Four keys or 40 keys -
it don't make no bloody difference!

782
01:19:04,962 --> 01:19:08,966
It's a waste, the whole thing!
And nothing to be done about it.

783
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:12,929
All on account of they found you out,
Mr Edward bloody Simms Pierce!

784
01:19:13,012 --> 01:19:17,600
That was something you didn't think of.
What have you got to say about that?

785
01:19:23,314 --> 01:19:25,399
Find me a dead cat.

786
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,125
<i>(sobbing)</i>

787
01:19:57,598 --> 01:19:59,892
Now then, missy, now then.

788
01:19:59,975 --> 01:20:02,770
Oh, please, sir, can you help me?

789
01:20:02,853 --> 01:20:05,314
The man is a heartless beast, he is.

790
01:20:05,773 --> 01:20:08,567
- What man?
- That guard upon the line, sir.

791
01:20:09,026 --> 01:20:12,446
He will not let me
set my dear brother on the train.

792
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:16,116
He says it must be...

793
01:20:16,492 --> 01:20:18,035
..opened!

794
01:20:18,118 --> 01:20:21,288
Why... the cruel rogue.

795
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:23,790
We'll have your brother on the train.

796
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:28,212
There's, um...

797
01:20:28,295 --> 01:20:30,380
..no need to open it.

798
01:20:34,968 --> 01:20:38,347
I, um...
I see you have a Bateson's belfry here.

799
01:20:38,764 --> 01:20:40,557
Oh, yes, sir.

800
01:20:40,932 --> 01:20:46,897
Me brother, he was terrible afraid of being
buried alive, so here's the safety.

801
01:20:48,398 --> 01:20:52,986
Very thoughtful, I'm sure.
Just you dry your eyes. All will be well.

802
01:20:54,237 --> 01:20:56,323
Thank you, sir.

803
01:20:56,615 --> 01:20:59,451
I'll just... get this business finished.

804
01:21:04,372 --> 01:21:08,251
- How could you be so cruel?
- I only told her the new rules.

805
01:21:08,335 --> 01:21:12,047
- All containers to be opened.
- Yes, I know.

806
01:21:12,797 --> 01:21:17,260
Do you smell it? I think in this case
we can make an exception.

807
01:21:17,761 --> 01:21:18,970
Whatever you say.

808
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,847
- Nephew!
- Uncle.

809
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,432
Nephew,...

810
01:21:22,515 --> 01:21:27,312
..mind your duties. Open every parcel
and make no exception. No exception.

811
01:21:27,395 --> 01:21:29,856
<i>- Yes, Uncle.
- (sniffs)</i>

812
01:21:30,607 --> 01:21:33,943
- What's that ungodly stink?
- The, er...

813
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:41,242
- Scheduled for the morning train?
- Yes, Uncle.

814
01:21:43,661 --> 01:21:46,706
- See that you open it.
- But, er... Uncle...

815
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:50,793
No stomach for it, eh?

816
01:21:51,628 --> 01:21:54,005
Dear God, you're a delicate one.

817
01:21:54,922 --> 01:21:57,050
All right, I'll do it myself.

818
01:21:57,133 --> 01:21:59,218
For opened it must be.

819
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,973
Oh! Oh!

820
01:22:04,056 --> 01:22:07,727
My dear brother!
Oh, Richard. Richard, he lives!

821
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:09,896
He lives! Oh, he's alive!

822
01:22:10,188 --> 01:22:13,900
Oh, make haste. He's alive!
Oh, praise God, he's alive!

823
01:22:13,983 --> 01:22:15,610
Oh, he's alive!

824
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:18,029
Hurry! Hurry! Lest we are too late.

825
01:22:18,112 --> 01:22:20,197
I knew it was not cholera!

826
01:22:20,531 --> 01:22:21,991
Cholera?

827
01:22:22,074 --> 01:22:25,536
He was a quack to say it. I knew it!
Hurry. Hurry.

828
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:30,416
- Five days I've waited to hear that bell.
- You say cholera? Five days?

829
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:33,544
Richard! Richard!

830
01:22:34,336 --> 01:22:36,422
Ohh!

831
01:22:37,631 --> 01:22:39,717
Oh, no!

832
01:22:52,354 --> 01:22:53,230
Oh...

833
01:22:53,314 --> 01:22:56,567
How can it be? I heard the bell.

834
01:22:57,443 --> 01:22:59,528
Did you not?

835
01:22:59,904 --> 01:23:01,989
I heard it plain.

836
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:04,408
The bell rang.

837
01:23:04,491 --> 01:23:08,120
No, missy.
A gust of wind or a tremor on the ground.

838
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:10,914
I'm sorry.

839
01:23:10,998 --> 01:23:13,083
But I heard it.

840
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:15,711
<i>(supervisor)
Load this on. Sharp now!</i>

841
01:23:16,211 --> 01:23:17,963
Come along.

842
01:23:18,672 --> 01:23:20,758
Steady. Steady now.

843
01:23:21,467 --> 01:23:23,552
Stand aside there.

844
01:23:24,261 --> 01:23:26,305
Careful.

845
01:23:26,388 --> 01:23:28,473
That's right.

846
01:23:28,682 --> 01:23:32,561
Over here. A little to your right.
Set it down.

847
01:23:32,644 --> 01:23:37,816
- There's more colour to you now.
- Yes, I feel much better now, thank you.

848
01:23:37,899 --> 01:23:39,818
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye, miss.

849
01:23:39,901 --> 01:23:44,281
- All right for you. I'll be in here with it.
- Rather you than me, mate!

850
01:23:47,451 --> 01:23:49,536
Oh, the stench!

851
01:23:57,836 --> 01:23:59,004
<i>(whistle)</i>

852
01:24:41,629 --> 01:24:44,716
- Can you do it?
- I think so.

853
01:24:44,799 --> 01:24:46,801
It's a long way back there.

854
01:24:46,885 --> 01:24:51,097
Five carriages, 30 feet each,
that's 150 feet altogether.

855
01:24:51,389 --> 01:24:52,807
I'll manage.

856
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:56,602
- You're not going to get killed, are you?
- Oh, I'd rather not.

857
01:24:57,395 --> 01:24:58,646
Edward!

858
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:02,817
- Edward Pierce, my dear fellow!
- Damn. Henry Fowler!

859
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:05,361
He cannot travel in our compartment.

860
01:25:05,445 --> 01:25:07,697
Henry, what a surprise!

861
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,658
- Fancy seeing you! Are you on this train?
- Yes.

862
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:12,952
As a matter of fact, so am I.

863
01:25:15,329 --> 01:25:20,126
Oh, forgive me.
Miss Bridget Lawson, Mr Henry Fowler.

864
01:25:20,918 --> 01:25:24,672
Miss Lawson is accompanying
her deceased brother but...

865
01:25:24,755 --> 01:25:29,176
..due to the new regulations
she's not permitted in the guard's van.

866
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:32,263
Therefore she is seeking a compartment.

867
01:25:34,056 --> 01:25:35,933
Well, mine is available.

868
01:25:38,185 --> 01:25:40,730
Henry, you're so kind.

869
01:25:42,982 --> 01:25:44,942
You won't join us, will you?

870
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:49,488
As a matter of fact,
I've... made other arrangements.

871
01:25:51,782 --> 01:25:53,868
Oh, I see!

872
01:25:54,368 --> 01:25:57,538
- You're quite sure?
- Oh, yes.

873
01:25:57,997 --> 01:26:00,082
You carry on, Henry.

874
01:26:05,462 --> 01:26:07,006
Miss Lawson!

875
01:26:07,089 --> 01:26:10,301
- You're in capable hands.
- You're too kind.

876
01:26:10,384 --> 01:26:12,886
Not at all.

877
01:27:07,274 --> 01:27:10,152

881
01:27:15,907 --> 01:27:18,326
Of course I am, you damnable flat.

882
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:22,122
- Good God, he's alive!
- Open it! Hurry up. I must be quick!

883
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:27,502
Lift up!

884
01:27:27,919 --> 01:27:30,005
Oh, mother of God!

885
01:27:30,839 --> 01:27:32,924
Oh, the smell!

886
01:27:34,259 --> 01:27:36,344
The things I must do!

887
01:27:40,682 --> 01:27:44,018
Do you have,
er... many gentlemen friends?

888
01:27:45,103 --> 01:27:50,066
Oh, why sure enough.
Gents are ever so friendly to me, they are.

889
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:53,403
- Me mum said I was a heartbreaker.
- I'm certain you are.

890
01:27:53,486 --> 01:27:59,033
Me mum was a heartbreaker herself.
Had many a caller, she did.

891
01:27:59,492 --> 01:28:01,494
Many a caller.

892
01:28:01,911 --> 01:28:04,872
And always with some little token.

893
01:28:04,956 --> 01:28:08,334
Me mum says a man loves you,
he shows you proper.

894
01:28:08,418 --> 01:28:11,462
- With some little token.
- Quite so.

895
01:28:12,964 --> 01:28:16,968
If you will permit me, I should be
delighted to give you a "token" myself.

896
01:28:19,345 --> 01:28:23,266
- Cor, you're a bold gent!
- I'm most serious, I assure you.

897
01:28:23,349 --> 01:28:26,644
- What, here on the train?
- Why not?

898
01:28:26,727 --> 01:28:30,398
Have you not heard of
the 50-mile-an-hour club?

899
01:28:30,481 --> 01:28:33,859
I'm told it's beneficial to the circulation.

900
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:51,752
- But the van's locked from outside.
- It's taken care of.

901
01:28:51,836 --> 01:28:54,463
- How?
- You'll see soon enough.

902
01:28:54,547 --> 01:28:58,634
My friend will come over the top of
the train between Redhill and Ashford.

903
01:28:58,717 --> 01:29:01,887
That's the fastest part of the run!

904
01:29:01,971 --> 01:29:04,056
I suppose it is.

905
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,394
What about all them bridges?
Your friend, mate, he's mad.

- Is he up there now?
- He is.

914
01:35:00,076 --> 01:35:02,161
He's lucky to be alive.

915
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:05,790
- Hold on.
- All right.

916
01:35:13,756 --> 01:35:15,841
Now let it go easy.

917
01:35:16,383 --> 01:35:18,469
Go on.

918
01:35:53,545 --> 01:35:55,839
I can't get over the feeling...

919
01:35:56,798 --> 01:35:58,800
You look very familiar.

920
01:35:58,884 --> 01:36:02,804
- Are you sure we've never met?
- Oh, no, sir.

921
01:36:05,349 --> 01:36:07,476
What does your mum do?

922
01:36:07,559 --> 01:36:09,853
Me mum? Er...

923
01:36:10,354 --> 01:36:12,439
She's a seamstress.

924
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:15,942
An honourable trade.

925
01:36:16,985 --> 01:36:21,907
Me mum's made dresses for Lady
Eversham herself, I'll have you know.

926
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:27,037
I'm acquainted with Lady Eversham.

927
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:30,165

Good. We've got less than a minute.

932
01:37:23,843 --> 01:37:25,803
I look a sight?

933
01:37:25,887 --> 01:37:28,473
No, but you're all covered in soot.

934
01:37:31,601 --> 01:37:33,561
It's the smoke.

935
01:37:33,644 --> 01:37:37,231
- I haven't brought a change of clothing.
- That's brilliant(!)

936
01:37:37,315 --> 01:37:41,569
What are you going to wear
coming off Folkestone station?

937

Oh no!

01:37:45,406 --> 01:37:47,491
Oh no!

01:37:47,783 --> 01:37:53,623
Bloody hell! You paint me green,
make me lie in a coffin with a dead cat...

940
01:37:53,706 --> 01:37:56,083
..and now you strip me bollock-naked. No!

941
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:58,085
- Shut up.
- Bloody hell!

Let's go!

943
01:38:19,106 --> 01:38:22,943
He'll take the river road
and meet us in Folkestone.

944
01:38:32,369 --> 01:38:37,583
Take hold of the rope.
We'll be through Ashford soon. Pull it.

945
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,756
We'll pass Ashford soon.

ones to watch. Full of tricks, they are.

952
01:41:27,626 --> 01:41:34,383
I knew of one caller, wanted me to come
to a room he had, full of whips and such.

953
01:41:35,092 --> 01:41:36,844
- Whips?
- Mm!

01:41:36,927 --> 01:41:39,013

Mmm.

01:41:40,931 --> 01:41:45,102
- Well, me mum, she told me...
- My dear, my dear, my dearest!

The court thanks you for providing us
with so clear an explanation...

968
01:45:21,024 --> 01:45:23,276
..of your manner in committing the crime.

969
01:45:23,694 --> 01:45:27,406
I'm glad to be of help.
The police seemed to be confused.

970
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:31,201
Do spare us your impoverished
witticisms, Mr Pierce.

971
01:45:31,284 --> 01:45:34,579
Your presence here
attests to their efficiency.

972
01:45:34,663 --> 01:45:37,541
You know, you are a very unusual man.

973
01:45:37,624 --> 01:45:40,252
Mr Pierce, I put it to you directly.

974
01:45:40,961 --> 01:45:44,798
Did you never feel at any time
some sense of impropriety,...

975
01:45:44,881 --> 01:45:47,467
..some recognition of misconduct,...

976
01:45:47,551 --> 01:45:52,973
..some comprehension of unlawful
behaviour, some moral misgivings...

977
01:45:53,431 --> 01:45:57,727
..in the performance of these
various and sundry criminal acts?

978
01:45:57,811 --> 01:46:01,773
- I don't understand the question.
- Evidently not.

979
01:46:02,357 --> 01:46:06,236
Sir, it is a recognised truth
of jurisprudence...

980
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:08,697
..that laws are created by men...

981
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:13,034
..and that civilised men,
in a tradition of more than two millennia,...

982
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:17,956
..agree to abide by these laws
for the common good of all society.

983
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:20,333
For it is only by the rule of law...

984
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:26,881
..that any civilisation holds itself above
the promiscuous squalor of barbarism.

985
01:46:27,215 --> 01:46:30,677
Now, on the matter of motive, we ask you:

986
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:38,476
..why did you conceive, plan and execute
this dastardly and scandalous crime?

987
01:46:44,107 --> 01:46:46,192
I wanted the money.

988
01:46:56,869 --> 01:46:58,955
