1
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:22,155
<i>In 1855, England and France</i>
<i>were at war with Russia in the Crimea.</i>

2
00:00:22,487 --> 00:00:25,126
<i>The English troops were paid in gold.</i>

3
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:31,480
<i>Once a month ?5,000 in gold</i>
<i>was loaded into strongboxes</i>

4
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:35,116
<i>inside the London bank</i>
<i>of Huddleston and Bradford</i>

5
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:38,916
<i>and taken by trusted armed guards</i>
<i>to the railway station.</i>

6
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:43,157
<i>The convoy followed</i>
<i>no fixed route or timetable.</i>

7
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:49,205
<i>The gold was loaded into the</i>
<i>luggage van of the Folkestone train</i>

8
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:52,996
<i>for shipment to the coast</i>
<i>and from there to the Crimea.</i>

9
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:57,239
<i>The strongboxes</i>
<i>were placed in two Chubb safes</i>

10
00:00:57,327 --> 00:01:01,002
<i>constructed of</i>
<i>three-quarter-inch tempered steel.</i>

11
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,278
<i>Each safe weighed 550 pounds.</i>

12
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:08,880
<i>Each safe was fitted with two locks</i>
<i>requiring two keys,</i>

13
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,956
<i>or four keys altogether.</i>

14
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,159
<i>For security,</i>
<i>each key was individually protected.</i>

15
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:23,719
<i>Two keys were entrusted to the railway</i>
<i>dispatcher, who kept them in his office.</i>

16
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:27,197
<i>A third was in the custody of</i>
<i>Mr Edgar Trent,</i>

17
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,359
<i>president of the Huddleston and Bradford.</i>

18
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:33,644
<i>And the fourth key</i>
<i>was given to Mr Henry Fowler,</i>

19
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,719
<i>manager of the Huddleston</i>
<i>and Bradford Bank.</i>

20
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:39,879
<i>The presence of so much gold</i>
<i>in one place</i>

21
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,721
<i>aroused the interests</i>
<i>of the English criminal elements,</i>

22
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:50,246
<i>but in 1855 there had never been</i>
<i>a robbery from a moving railway train.</i>

23
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,318
Is he dead?

24
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:27,964
Robbery? I'd hardly call it that -
one poor fellow working alone.

25
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:30,083
He had no chance of success.

26
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:33,165
Indeed, speaking on behalf of the bank,

27
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:39,083
I must inform you the matter was trivial
and hardly worthy of our consideration.

28
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,886
I think I may say that
without fear of contradiction.

29
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,685
The villain expired?

30
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:47,077
Quite. The guard threw him
from the train at full speed.

31
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,283
He died instantly. Poor devil.

32
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:52,837
- He's not been identified?
- I shouldn't think so.

33
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:57,443
The manner of his passing was such
that his features were... disarrayed.

34
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,961
He was obviously after the Crimean gold.

35
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:02,926
- Apparently. Speaking...
- This damnable war

36
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,204
- will be the undoing of the nation.
- He's off again.

37
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:09,802
Unrest in the north, and now this
ill-considered war with the Tsar.

38
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:13,323
What do you expect
when one man in seven has the vote?

39
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:15,967
We have shopkeepers voting now.

40
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:19,125
And women next. If they get their way.

41
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,520
Women voting. Really!

42
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:26,760
- This robbery had interesting...
- They haven't the capacity for logic.

43
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:31,318
- Too emotional. Quite absurd.
- It's not their logical capacity I enjoy.

44
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:36,242
- Even a good woman's too much trouble.
- Come, Arthur, they do have their uses.

45
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:39,558
Edward's got the proper view
by not marrying at all.

46
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:41,126
Someone will catch him.

47
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,643
- I know one or two with their eye on him.
- No one will catch Edward.

48
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:48,481
God knows what a man may catch
in London if he's not married.

49
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:52,799
This thief on the train, Henry.
Was there a risk of him stealing the gold?

50
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:57,005
- None. Quite impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

51
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:03,720
Utterly impossible. Two Chubb safes,
four keys separately guarded. lmpossible.

52
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:07,436
- Still, I suppose it could be done.
- I can't imagine how.

53
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:11,645
A thief would have to get all four keys.
Two are locked away in the station.

54
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:16,756
One is in the hands of our president,
Mr Edgar Trent, who is utterly reliable.

55
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:20,601
I don't know where Mr Trent
keeps <i>his</i> key but I know of the fourth,

56
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:24,316
for I am myself entrusted with guarding it.

57
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:28,766
Damn it, Henry, when are you going to
tell us where you've hidden <i>your</i> key?

58
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,726
I keep it about my neck.
I wear it at all times.

59
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:34,399
Even when bathing?

60
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:37,763
Even while bathing.
It never leaves my person.

61
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:40,236
- Clever.
- Most ingenious.

62
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:44,366
So you see, to get all four keys -
quite impossible.

63
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:49,362
The Crimean gold and all the bank's
other transactions are entirely safe.

64
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:51,403
Thank God for that.

65
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:54,285
You may count on it, Edward. 
Count on it.

66
00:06:55,647 --> 00:07:00,880
- Who do those men think you are?
- Edward Pierce. A sharp businessman.

67
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:04,960
A sharp businessman?
That covers a multitude of sins.

68
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:07,038
It does among that group.

69
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,398
And what's your business?

70
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:16,282
It's not really clear. I've made a great deal
of money in coal, in the north.

71
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:20,155
- Have you?
- Oh, yes, I have. I'm quite well-off.

72
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:21,441
Are you?

73
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:26,601
I think so.
I've... made something of myself.

74
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,678
Do they believe all that?

75
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:35,044
Among sharp businessmen
one doesn't ask too many questions.

76
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:39,240
Do they know of your interest
in the theatre?

77
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:41,841
An unmarried gentleman
must amuse himself.

78
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:45,715
- Must he?
- Oh, yes, he must.

79
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,478
Did they mention the train?

80
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:54,841
What did they say?

81
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:58,045
They all agreed that it was impossible.

82
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,958
Simply impossible.

83
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,438
You like that?

84
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,358
I can tell it excites you.

85
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,238
Are you all right?

86
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:11,878
Nice pull.

87
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:19,405
Not bad, if I do say so myself.
You look well.

88
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:21,443
Yes. How was the touch?

89
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:23,438
You saw it, didn't you?

90
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:25,995
Or was I so fast you <i>couldn't</i> see it?

91
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,041
I saw.

92
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:33,039
- Did you wire her?
- No, just my hands.

93
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,357
Hummingbirds.

94
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:42,839
- Thinking of a job, then?
- I may have one or two little things.

95
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:50,321
Those one or two little things...
Could they be crib jobs?

96
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:51,556
They could.

97
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,115
- Bit dicey, are they?
- Very dicey.

98
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,643
- Is it dipping or keys?
- Keys.

99
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:59,955
- Wax or a straightaway haul?
- Wax.

100
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,760
You didn't do the Berkeley Hills job,
did you?

101
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:06,281
Berkeley Hills? Shit job.

102
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,360
A shit job? Well, they're clean
with 2,000 guineas gone.

103
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:13,445
No. I was thinking of something bigger.

104
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:19,041
This wax. On the fly?

105
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:21,406
Then I'm your man.

106
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:24,957
- The fastest screwsman you'll ever see.
- So I heard.

107
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:28,722
- What's it to be, then?
- First we must case a square-rigged gent.

108
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:32,326
Good night.

109
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,398
<i>Mr Edgar Trent,</i>

110
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:38,003
<i>president of the Huddleston</i>
<i>and Bradford Bank,</i>

111
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:40,555
<i>follows an inflexible routine,</i>

112
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:44,845
<i>departing the bank</i>
<i>at the end of each day promptly at 7 pm.</i>

113
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:05,479
<i>Mr Trent resides at</i>
<i>number seven Belgrave Square.</i>

114
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:10,004
<i>It's a mansion of 23 rooms,</i>
<i>not including servants' quarters.</i>

115
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:13,876
<i>His second wife, Emily,</i>
<i>is 30 years his junior,</i>

116
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:20,641
<i>and with her unmarried stepdaughter</i>
<i>she runs the household very strictly.</i>

117
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:26,761
<i>There are ten servants employed.</i>

118
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:32,080
<i>A coachman, a gardener, a doorman,</i>
<i>a butler, a cook and two upstairs maids.</i>

119
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,045
<i>All the servants are content</i>
<i>and can't be bribed.</i>

120
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:39,757
- Dogs?
- Two. Terriers. Walks 'em twice a day.

121
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,886
<i>Seven in the morning and 8.15 at night.</i>

122
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:45,844
<i>- Children?</i>
<i>- Five.</i>

123
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:49,886
<i>Three at home.</i>
<i>The youngest is a boy who sleepwalks.</i>

124
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,083
<i>Which creates a commotion.</i>

125
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:08,076
No point in cracking a 23-room house
until we find out where the key is.

126
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,637
The person who knows
where that key is is Mr Trent.

127
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:15,357
Really?

128
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:22,638
He must have a weakness.
Gambling, drink. Women?

129
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,558
Well, hello.

130
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,718
No, no, no.

131
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,962
No respectable gentleman
is that respectable.

132
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:19,920
- He's a ratting gent.
- Indeed he is.

133
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:33,445
Thank you, gentlemen, please.
Mind your back there, sir.

134
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,998
Thank you. Excuse me, sir.

135
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,920
Nothing but the finest, gentlemen.

136
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:44,602
Every one country-born and bred,
not a water ditch among 'em.

137
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:48,726
Who wants to try a rat?
Come on, gents. Who wants to try a rat?

138
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,566
15 of your best for my fancy.

139
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:56,637
Weigh the fancy of Mr T.
A very sporting gentleman.

140
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:01,446
Let Mr T's fancy dog through.
There you are.

141
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:07,197
- 14 pounds.
- 14 pounds is Mr T's fancy dog.

142
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,355
And he's called for a try at 15 rats.

143
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,721
- Shall it be three minutes, Mr T?
- Yes.

144
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:18,679
Three minutes it is.
You may wager as you feel fit.

145
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,317
Get him his 15, Tom.

146
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:27,605
You win some, you lose some.

147
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,759
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

148
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,358
And... go!

149
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:00,720
Time, gentlemen. Three minutes.

150
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:04,882
Get the dog out. Thank you, gentlemen.

151
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:07,558
Pay your debts. Who's next?

152
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:10,719
Come on! Any man fancy his fancy?

153
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:14,083
A sporting chap.
You win one or two, you lose one or two.

154
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:20,404
Who's going to be next to try the finest
country-bred rats that money can buy?

155
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,678
May I join you?

156
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,443
If you like.

157
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:47,324
Lover wasn't at his best. He lacked bustle.
But he came up well enough.

158
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:50,644
- My Lover will fight again.
- Indeed.

159
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,639
And I shall wager upon him again
when he does.

160
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:56,799
- Did you lose much?
- Ten guineas. A trifle.

161
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,558
Ten guineas.

162
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,320
Well, I'm pleased you take it so lightly.

163
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,517
I admire a man
who may keep a fancy and sport him.

164
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:12,445
I should do so myself
were I not so often abroad on business.

165
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:16,202
Whenever I'm gone,
my wife looks after the animals.

166
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:21,404
I fear I've been too devoted to business
these past few years.

167
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,678
I've never married.

168
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:29,437
- Of course, I should like to.
- Of course.

169
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:34,763
It's so hard to meet a suitable girl.

170
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:50,166
- What exactly are you constructing?
- A water wheel. It will be so delightful.

171
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:55,800
Especially with the rusted curve of
the water wheel itself. Don't you agree?

172
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:59,921
We are building the rusted wheel
at considerable expense.

173
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:05,479
It is constructed of previously rusted
metal. The craftsmen are ingenious.

174
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:11,039
But we must wait for the weeds to grow
before it takes on the proper appearance.

175
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:13,721
Oh, I'm sure it'll be a handsome ruin.

176
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,638
Where is Elizabeth?

177
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,480
I have passed many pleasant hours here

178
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:22,924
watching the workmen
fit each piece into its precise slot.

179
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:25,798
Such skill.

180
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,445
They screw it together?

181
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:32,839
No, bolt it, actually, with long bolts.
Fitted tightly.

182
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:37,040
Yes. Long bolts, fitted tightly.

183
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:43,326
I've just returned from America,
a country of many prominent erections.

184
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:46,844
It is exciting to see things come together.

185
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,725
So long as the quality does not suffer.

186
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,240
Tight-fitting joints. That's the secret.

187
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,200
It is so rare these days.

188
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:02,277
It depends on the skill of the workman,
of course.

189
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:05,399
And he must have the proper tools.

190
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,443
My darling daughter.

191
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:13,157
Now may I present Mr Edward Pierce?
My daughter Elizabeth.

192
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:17,161
Miss Trent,
you've taken me completely by surprise.

193
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,835
I cannot tell if that's to my advantage.

194
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,361
I can assure you it is, wholly.

195
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:26,440
- Would you try one of these, Mr Pierce?
- With gratitude.

196
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,524
We are just discussing the ruins,
Elizabeth.

197
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:35,885
- It's coming along so nicely.
- That dreadful ruin. I can't bear it.

198
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,476
They've taken away so many flowers.

199
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,000
You're fond of flowers?

200
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:42,918
- More tea, Mr Pierce?
- Ah, yes.

201
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:47,080
Yes, I supervise the planting
of all the flowers in the garden.

202
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,919
What there is left of it.

203
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:51,646
I'm especially fond of the primroses.

204
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,001
Ah, yes.

205
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,282
Perhaps you'd like to see them?

206
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,559
I'd be delighted.

207
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,638
Will you excuse us?

208
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:03,557
It's quite rare
for a man to take an interest in flowers.

209
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:06,764
The best of them are just over here.
Let me show you.

210
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,042
I don't know that he's suitable for her.

211
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,483
- Oh, he seems nice enough.
- He has far too much to say.

212
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:17,442
We also have many daffodils.
They've just come up.

213
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:23,047
It gives me such pleasure to see beautiful
things spring forth. Don't you agree?

214
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:25,197
Yes, I do agree. But tell me...

215
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,238
He has his charm.

216
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,486
You don't care who she marries, do you?

217
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,478
Is she really plain?

218
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,158
That she is.

219
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:49,516
- And you find her tedious?
- Unbearably tedious.

220
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:54,159
- How does she wear her hair?
- On her head.

221
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:57,238
Really, I never noticed.

222
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,478
You're in a hurry.

223
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,558
I am a relentless suitor.

224
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:07,037
Besides, she still hasn't told me
what I need to know.

225
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,518
Where did you learn to ride?

226
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:14,642
- A lady never asks such a question.
- I'm serious.

227
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,798
France.

228
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:18,878
On an estate in France.

229
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:21,078
Not in America?

230
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:24,558
No, I've never been to America.

231
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:28,918
When were you in France?

232
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:31,842
It's been some time now.

233
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:36,195
Do you ever tell anyone the truth?

234
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,598
The truth?

235
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:44,638
No.

236
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:31,838
I worry about him so.

237
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:36,401
- He was fearfully nervous this morning.
- Really?

238
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:40,321
Father's always nervous
when he sends the gold to Crimea.

239
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:42,602
He's a different man on those days.

240
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:45,076
He bears a heavy responsibility.

241
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,517
He acts so strangely!

242
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:55,398
He's entirely opposed to the consumption
of any alcohol before nightfall.

243
00:22:55,487 --> 00:23:01,756
- Very sensible.
- I suspect he breaks his own regulation.

244
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:06,045
For each morning of the shipments
he goes alone to the wine cellars.

245
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:10,757
With no servants to hold the lanterns.
He insists on going alone.

246
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:13,641
Perhaps he's just checking the contents.

247
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:18,517
No, he relies upon my stepmother
to stock and care for the cellar.

248
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:23,279
- Every man has his eccentricities.
- I suppose.

249
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:26,999
What are your eccentricities,
dear Edward?

250
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:29,078
Mine? I have none at all.

251
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:31,718
Well, one.

252
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:36,918
I am excessively preoccupied
with a certain lovely young lady.

253
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:38,838
Sir!

254
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:41,487
You're a bold rogue to be so forward.

255
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:47,842
I might even begin to suspect you
of some motive in your advances.

256
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,564
Never, my darling.

257
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,238
Oh, dear Edward.

258
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,358
I'm so happy.

259
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:58,278
And I am happy too.

260
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:03,122
<i>He keeps the key</i>
<i>in the bloody wine cellar.</i>

261
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:56,681
Good evening, madam.
May I be of service?

262
00:24:56,767 --> 00:25:01,079
- Is this the household of Mr Jeffers?
- No, madam. Mr Jeffers' house...

263
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,518
Thank you, my good man.

264
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,603
It's only the wind.

265
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:06,323
Where do you think it could be?

266
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:12,918
Shut up!

267
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:15,478
Sorry.

268
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,479
John, would you check the cellar, please?

269
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,558
Yes, madam.

270
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:08,640
John?

271
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:12,163
- John? Where's John?
- I'm down here, sir.

272
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:17,043
- What are you doing down there?
- Madam felt she heard a noise...

273
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:19,687
Madam always feels she's heard a noise.

274
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:23,118
Come along now.
I need you to find my best pipe.

275
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:27,002
- It's misplaced again.
- Certainly, sir.

276
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:32,755
That was a close one.
Didn't do my heart any good, I'll say that.

277
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:35,638
Mind the light.

278
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,719
Here.

279
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:42,835
That's not the bloody key. See the rust?
Nobody's touched that betty in years.

280
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:46,920
It's odd, though. I've never seen
the likes of that before, small as it is.

281
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:51,478
Very delicate. It could be a lady's twirl
for some feminine trifle.

282
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,558
Watch the light!

283
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:59,363
It's not my fault you're having trouble.
It's your bloody idea, isn't it?

284
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:03,241
- Here.
- That's a key for a Chubb safe.

285
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,642
Let's see how fast you can wax.

286
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,518
Mind the light.

287
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,718
Bastard.

288
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:25,205
Beautiful, isn't it?

289
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:27,278
Brilliant.

290
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,285
What does this clause mean?

291
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:14,006
Never mind that.
What about that one over there?

292
00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:15,560
In pink?

293
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,522
Wouldn't mind making a deposit
in that one, I dare say.

294
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:22,838
If she didn't provoke a hasty withdrawal.

295
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:25,402
Not on my account, I fancy.

296
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:31,278
Besides, she is Sir John Basington's minx
and accustomed to hasty withdrawals.

297
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,439
Quite without principle, don't you think?

298
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,438
But here now - I say!

299
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,358
Have you got my deposit account?

300
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:53,283
That's what I call a proper woman.
Which is to say, not proper at all.

301
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:56,645
She gives good value, long term or short.

302
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:00,079
You know her?

303
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:03,842
Where have you been keeping her,
Edward, you rogue?

304
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:09,278
She's a vision.
Not at all bad for a foreign woman.

305
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,557
I don't think she's your type.

306
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:16,764
She's precisely my type.
Will you make an introduction?

307
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,838
- Fowler.
- Trent.

308
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:22,764
Will you make an introduction?

309
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:27,237
Not here, of course.
What are you doing tonight?

310
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:30,399
Well, I had arranged to go to the theatre...

311
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:33,797
Come, come, my dear fellow.
Are we not friends?

312
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,158
More than that, Henry.

313
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,598
Much more.

314
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:56,485
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yes, that's the plan.

315
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:00,278
That's all you have to say?

316
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:02,918
It's the job, innit?

317
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:07,439
I suppose you expect me
to dab it up with that fat, repulsive...

318
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:10,678
I suppose you expect me
to go through with it.

319
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:12,958
It's up to you, innit?

320
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:15,718
Bloody hell.

321
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:44,598
Shall we go, darling?

322
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:06,959
Very nice.

323
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:10,084
- She's here, is she?
- Oh, yeah, she's here.

324
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,839
Evening, gentlemen.

325
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:15,518
How can I be of service to you?

326
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:19,043
My friend would like to see
Madame Lucienne.

327
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:27,602
She holds a very rigid standard.

328
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:31,725
- Well, that's all right, isn't it?
- Yes.

329
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,998
Come this way.

330
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:52,644
You go up the stairs, sir...
and through the first door on your right.

331
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:55,116
Madame Lucienne
will be with you presently.

332
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,198
- Very gay here.
- Yes.

333
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:28,166
- Monsieur...?
- Jones.

334
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:33,318
I am very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

335
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:35,965
I as well.

336
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:37,366
You are nervous?

337
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:41,281
No, I just thought
we might become... better acquainted.

338
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:44,916
Oh, <i>mon chéri,</i> you are nervous.
There is no need to be.

339
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:49,478
I will take care of every little thing.

340
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:53,644
And every big thing.

341
00:35:01,407 --> 00:35:04,444
Such a strong man!

342
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:09,400
Well, yes, I did a bit of sport.
When I was younger, of course.

343
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:11,523
Oh, but you are still young.

344
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,483
And very strong.

345
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:17,877
- You want this off as well?
- It is best, no?

346
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:21,557
The touch of flesh to flesh.

347
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:24,238
The warmth of the body.

348
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:27,556
This is the French way, is it?

349
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:32,085
- What is this?
- A key. But I'm afraid...

350
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:36,046
Oh, there must be nothing between us.

351
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:38,118
Oh, yes.

352
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,884
Now if you will sit on the
<i>lit.</i>

353
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:49,686
- The what?
- The <i>lit</i> - the bed, the bed.

354
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:58,521
Oh, it is so exciting.

355
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:01,925
You... How do you say...

356
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,118
You inflame me.

357
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:09,917
But, madame,
do you not remove your own clothing?

358
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,887
Oh, my own... Why, yes, of course.

359
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,878
In just a moment.

360
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,558
- Just a moment.
- Do make haste, madam.

361
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,638
Yes, yes, I will.

362
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:38,245
Oh, my God, the police!

363
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,484
<i>Quel</i>
mess.

364
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,162
Come on, Henry, for God's sake.

365
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:59,238
I'm coming.

366
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:03,287
- Police, where are they?
- Downstairs.

367
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:05,358
- But I could be ruined.
- Quite!

368
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:07,518
I know the back way.

369
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:05,079
You couldn't have picked
something more difficult.

370
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,556
- You said you're the bloody best.
- And I am.

371
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:12,402
But that's the devil's own crib.
I've watched it three days. Look there.

372
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:17,239
You have to get past those crushers,
then up those stairs in plain sight.

373
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:19,795
Then into that crib. Anybody can see you.

374
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:23,038
Bloody silly.
lnvitation to prison, that place is.

375
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,764
What's your pogue up there?

376
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:28,566
Two Chubb keys in that green cupboard.

377
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:34,323
What might they be, them keys?

378
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:38,285
Two keys that I happen to want.

379
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,558
We're partners, aren't we?

380
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:47,761
If you're trying to say
that you don't trust me completely...

381
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,838
I don't trust you at all.

382
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:52,643
Good.

383
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:56,925
We've been gulling banksmen,
now we're in a railway station.

384
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,886
What's in a station? Trains is in a...

385
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:03,765
Mother of God!
You're after the Crimean g...

386
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:06,998
Trying to rob a moving train -
it can't be done.

387
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:08,486
Why not?

388
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:11,035
- It hasn't <i>been</i> done, has it?
- No.

389
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:13,721
Crimean gold. Mother of God.

390
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:18,244
That's ?5,000, isn't it?
A big shipment, isn't it? 25,000 quid.

391
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:20,363
- Mother of God!
- Are you ready to go in?

392
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,245
Am I... Yes.

393
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,557
Where's the chavy?

394
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:26,638
There.

395
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:30,598
He's your son.

396
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:32,604
I don't have no son.

397
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:34,723
Louisa says he's your son.

398
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,603
She wouldn't know. Is that him?

399
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:42,316
He's not my son.
He's too ugly to be my son.

400
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:46,119
So what's the sweetener?

401
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:48,198
A guinea.

402
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:51,526
Well, if he is my son, he'll be worth it.

403
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:01,038
Are we ready?

404
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:19,799
- Oh, Geoffrey! I've been robbed.
- Stop thief! Stop that boy.

405
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,958
Somebody stop him.

406
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,238
Police! Stop that boy.

407
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:32,837
Stop thief! Stop that boy.

408
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:34,918
I've got him!

409
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:47,918
- Stop that boy. He's a thief.
- What's going on?

410
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,358
Oh, I'm sorry.

411
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:54,758
Take that!

412
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,638
Are you all right?

413
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:10,678
Under. After him.

414
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:14,600
Get off!

415
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,804
Oh, my dear chap.
Awfully sorry. Are you all right?

416
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:27,398
Gotcha!

417
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:40,721
Well done. And thank you, gentlemen.

418
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:43,526
Damn thieves. They're everywhere.

419
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:55,642
- Did you wax them?
- Not a prayer. Not a bloody prayer.

420
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:57,718
Never crack that crib.

421
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:01,158
- Not in daylight.
- I said it was impossible.

422
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:03,722
What about night?

423
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:08,886
<i>I've marked this crib</i>
<i>for three nights running.</i>

424
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:12,721
<i>There's a jack at the top of the stairs</i>
<i>all night long.</i>

425
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:23,606
<i>He talks to the constable making his</i>
<i>rounds - but he doesn't leave his post.</i>

426
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:31,197
<i>Then at two o'clock</i>
<i>he takes his tightener.</i>

427
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:57,797
<i>And right at 2.30 he goes off</i>
<i>to relieve himself from his bottle of beer.</i>

428
00:42:57,887 --> 00:42:59,878
<i>And that's when I time him.</i>

429
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:05,962
<i>I time him from when he goes off</i>
<i>to when he comes back.</i>

430
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:22,718
<i>And it's been the same - three nights</i>
<i>running. A very regular bloke, is this jack.</i>

431
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:36,038
75 seconds.

432
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:38,684
It's a coopered ken.

433
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:44,080
You say you're the fastest screwsman
in the country. Well, here's a challenge.

434
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:49,241
Challenge? 75 seconds for two keys?
It's nigh impossible.

435
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:53,596
What if a snakesman comes over the roof
and cracks it from the inside?

436
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:57,726
What snakesman's to break that drum?
Nobody good enough is out.

437
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,399
The best is Clean Willy and he's in.

438
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:01,682
- Where's he in?
- Newgate Prison.

439
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,883
And there's no escaping that.

440
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:11,042
Only Willy can climb that.

441
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:13,764
Shame he's in Newgate.

442
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:06,285
No, guv, don't cut me. I'm goin'.

443
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:20,725
Hello, dearie. Comin' in for a good time?

444
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:23,118
You won't be sorry.

445
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:50,838
What's it to be, guv?

446
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:53,438
Bit of a tickle for you?

447
00:45:53,527 --> 00:45:56,439
You dab it up with Clean Willy
the snakesman, right?

448
00:45:56,527 --> 00:45:58,916
I did. He's in Newgate now.

449
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:00,486
You visit?

450
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:02,398
I do now and again.

451
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:05,081
I visits as his sister, see?

452
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,923
There's another of those
if you can downy him a message.

453
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:11,123
What's it to be?

454
00:46:11,207 --> 00:46:15,803
- Tell Willy to break at the next topping.
- There's no breaks from Newgate.

455
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:19,522
Tell him he breaks at the next topping
or he's not Clean Willy.

456
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:23,156
Tell him to go to the house
where he first met John Simms.

457
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,044
John Simms.

458
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:30,718
Are you John Simms?

459
00:46:55,527 --> 00:46:59,042
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

460
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:10,238
Fine day for a hanging.

461
00:47:11,207 --> 00:47:13,960
Do you really think he'll make it?

462
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:17,316
- Did you bring the trimmings?
- It's all here.

463
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:19,318
- Medicine?
- Everything.

464
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:21,557
- Do you want some cold chicken?
- No.

465
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:25,196
Willy's the best snakesman there is -
but he can't get out of there.

466
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:29,004
Dearly beloved,
wonder not if the world hate you.

467
00:47:29,087 --> 00:47:33,558
We know that we have passed from death
to life because we love the brethren.

468
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:36,320
He that loveth not abideth in death.

469
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:39,046
Whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer.

470
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:43,882
And you know that no murderer
hath eternal life abiding in himself.

471
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:47,164
In this we have known the charity of God.

472
00:48:22,487 --> 00:48:24,478
And in God's house...

473
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:34,764
Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me,

474
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:37,806
and in God's house forevermore...

475
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:42,438
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

476
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,680
They say Willy can climb a wall of glass.

477
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:52,406
If anyone can do it, Clean Willy can.

478
00:49:45,207 --> 00:49:49,041
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

479
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:59,198
Where is he?

480
00:51:25,407 --> 00:51:28,205
Good heavens! He's in a right bad state.

481
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:30,404
Here, come over here.

482
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,717
Sit down.

483
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,044
Cabinet open...

484
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:44,322
Cabinet shut.

485
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:46,878
Door.

486
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,958
Steps.

487
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:53,160
Done.

488
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:54,805
Time?

489
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:56,718
81.

490
00:51:56,807 --> 00:51:59,685
Well... better than last time.

491
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:00,961
Two seconds better.

492
00:52:01,047 --> 00:52:03,515
But you still haven't broken
the 75 seconds.

493
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:05,837
Well, it is better.

494
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:07,918
But not good enough.

495
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:11,358
We'll try again later.

496
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:13,758
Where are you going?

497
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:16,278
But you're so tired.

498
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:18,678
I'm not tired.

499
00:52:29,727 --> 00:52:31,445
Go.

500
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:33,758
Steps.

501
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:36,515
Door.

502
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:39,440
- Cabinet open.
- Fastest bloody screwsman!

503
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:41,677
Shut up. Time?

504
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:42,483
31.

505
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,558
Cabinet shut.

506
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:46,558
Door.

507
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:48,638
Steps.

508
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,038
Time?

509
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,118
74.

510
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:07,678
I always knew I could do it.

511
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:40,519
Shit.

512
00:56:50,127 --> 00:56:52,118
Jed?

513
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:53,805
- Yes.
- All right?

514
00:56:54,087 --> 00:56:55,964
Oh, I'm well enough.

515
00:56:56,047 --> 00:56:58,686
You been at the fight?

516
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:03,079
Fancy Dan and Stunning Bill.
Wasn't my fight, was it?

517
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:05,158
Put a sovereign on Bill.

518
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:10,924
Well, he won. I've a quid to show for it.

519
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,520
I'll take another walk round. See you later.

520
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,998
75 seconds, remember?

521
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,679
Now!

522
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:26,366
13...

523
00:58:26,447 --> 00:58:28,438
14...

524
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:30,398
15...

525
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:39,527
Where are the bloody keys?

526
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:43,604
No Chubb keys.

527
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:49,719
Damn it.

528
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:20,845
73...

529
01:00:21,007 --> 01:00:22,599
74...

530
01:00:22,847 --> 01:00:24,678
75.

531
01:00:38,287 --> 01:00:40,323
I remember when we first met.

532
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:44,682
I gave the most awful performance in
<i>Way of The World.</i>

533
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:50,521
I went to my dressing room and there
were the beautiful flowers you'd sent me.

534
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,638
And then you walked in.

535
01:00:53,207 --> 01:00:54,606
Flowers?

536
01:00:54,687 --> 01:00:57,326
Dozens of them. They were wonderful.

537
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:00,639
I didn't send any.
Must have been someone else.

538
01:01:00,727 --> 01:01:02,843
I walked in and you thanked me.

539
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:05,638
You're teasing me.

540
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:08,406
Bloody waste of good money, flowers.

541
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:12,398
- You didn't?
- No.

542
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,798
Really?

543
01:01:23,887 --> 01:01:25,878
Really?

544
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:29,599
I had them at a good price.
I robbed a grave.

545
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:36,116
All you ever think about is money.

546
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:39,886
All anyone ever thinks about is money.

547
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:05,079
Don't turn.

548
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,123
- Mr Simms, is it?
- That's right.

549
01:02:07,207 --> 01:02:10,199
- You came alone?
- Yes, as you instructed.

550
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:13,558
- Everything the same on the railway line?
- All the same.

551
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,046
Then it'll be tomorrow.

552
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:18,881
- What'll be tomorrow?
- Never you mind. Here's 100 quid for you.

553
01:02:19,127 --> 01:02:21,516
Look the other way and shut your mouth.

554
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:24,075
- Right?
- Right, sir.

555
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:26,635
Now, off you go and don't look back.

556
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:40,120
Get a bowl of water in there.

557
01:02:41,847 --> 01:02:43,963
Put it in the corner, over there.

558
01:02:44,047 --> 01:02:46,163
As far away from me as you can.

559
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:49,364
- He's pretty heavy, ain't he?
- Pretty hungry too.

560
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,566
Sorry, sir.
No one's allowed to ride in the van.

561
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,923
I've got to accompany the animal.
It's very valuable.

562
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:05,002
He gets upset if I'm not with him.

563
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:07,318
Yeah, very well.

564
01:03:18,647 --> 01:03:20,638
Doesn't care for travel.

565
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:29,681
- You mean it's to be you?
- Aye.

566
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:37,045
Where'd you make them impressions?
They keep all them keys separate.

567
01:03:37,127 --> 01:03:39,118
- Do they?
- Aye, they do.

568
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:41,678
How'd you pull 'em?

569
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:45,278
With incredible skill.

570
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:14,040
The next gold shipment is in a week.
This time we take it.

571
01:04:14,527 --> 01:04:17,997
Agar will replace the gold
with these lead bars

572
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,726
and throw the bags
from the train at Romney,

573
01:04:20,807 --> 01:04:24,880
where Barlow will collect them
and then drive to Folkestone.

574
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:26,366
Where will <i>we</i> be?

575
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:30,201
In a first-class compartment
enjoying the journey.

576
01:04:30,687 --> 01:04:32,678
What happens afterward?

577
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,803
We divide the gold as agreed.

578
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,158
After that.

579
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:40,718
- After that?
- Yes, after that.

580
01:04:46,087 --> 01:04:48,078
You and I will go to Paris.

581
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:02,680
You have it all worked out.
We ride on the train and they do the work.

582
01:05:02,767 --> 01:05:06,157
They have to earn their share, don't they?

583
01:05:06,287 --> 01:05:08,278
It's all very smooth.

584
01:05:09,807 --> 01:05:11,923
Unless something goes wrong.

585
01:05:12,607 --> 01:05:14,245
What could go wrong?

586
01:05:14,647 --> 01:05:16,638
My dear Mr Simms.

587
01:05:16,927 --> 01:05:18,963
As your humble servant,

588
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:23,078
I would be greatly obliged and indebted

589
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:28,683
if you could contrive to meet with me
at the Palace, Sydenham

590
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:31,438
for the purpose...

591
01:05:32,967 --> 01:05:34,958
For the purpose...

592
01:05:35,847 --> 01:05:39,317
For the purpose
of discussing some matters of...

593
01:05:39,487 --> 01:05:41,398
mutual interest.

594
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:43,478
Most respectfully,

595
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:46,083
William Williams, Esquire.

596
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:49,238
That should do it.

597
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,038
Well now, Willy...

598
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:55,882
What's this fellow Simms up to, eh?

599
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,083
Please, sir, I can't tell you.

600
01:05:58,207 --> 01:06:01,961
Should have thought of that before
we caught you with this purse.

601
01:06:02,247 --> 01:06:04,636
I don't want to go back to prison, sir.

602
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:06,718
Well, then. Better tell us.

603
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:09,319
I don't know, sir. I told you.

604
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:13,926
All's I know is that he's a cracksman
planning a flash pull, he is.

605
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:15,998
The letter will put you on to him.

606
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:23,245
We'll see.

607
01:06:23,607 --> 01:06:25,598
They'll kill me, they will.

608
01:06:26,527 --> 01:06:29,519
Then see you aren't running off again, eh?

609
01:06:32,127 --> 01:06:35,278
We'll have a look
at this mysterious Mr Simms.

610
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:18,644
Don't turn round, Willy.

611
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:27,523
- Now, what is it?
- I'm needing a bit, Mr Simms.

612
01:07:28,887 --> 01:07:32,436
- You've been paid.
- I'm needing more.

613
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:37,401
- You been working, Willy?
- No!

614
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:40,285
- Did the crushers pick you up?
- I swear it, no!

615
01:07:45,367 --> 01:07:48,962
- Willy, if you've turned nose on me...
- I swear it's no flam.

616
01:07:49,047 --> 01:07:53,006
A finny or two's what I need
and that'll be an end to it.

617
01:07:54,887 --> 01:07:57,082
There's a finny in your pocket.

618
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,444
You're sweating.

619
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:04,122
If you've turned nose on me,
I'll see you in lavender.

620
01:08:04,207 --> 01:08:06,038
Not me, sir. I swear.

621
01:08:12,087 --> 01:08:14,078
Three crushers.

622
01:08:33,487 --> 01:08:35,478
Edward! Edward Pierce.

623
01:08:36,647 --> 01:08:40,242
Edward, we were wondering
what had become of you.

624
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:42,318
I got married.

625
01:08:43,007 --> 01:08:44,998
Must dash.

626
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:52,918
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Wouldn't surprise me.

627
01:08:53,007 --> 01:08:57,080
Very rough man. Not a good sort at all.

628
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:21,636
- So, the snakesman is dead.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

629
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:25,720
- And this fellow Simms has vanished?
- Yes, sir.

630
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:28,446
And we don't know who he is
or what he intends?

631
01:12:28,527 --> 01:12:31,564
- We are entirely without clues.
- No, not entirely.

632
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:37,165
We know Simms arranged for Clean Willy
to break from Newgate some months ago.

633
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:40,683
- So it's a long-standing plan.
- A plan we don't know.

634
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:44,521
Quite. But we do know Simms is
a safecracker. He must be after safes.

635
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:49,317
And Willy broke into the dispatcher's
office of the South Eastern Railway Line.

636
01:12:51,727 --> 01:12:56,676
And it occurred to me, could this Simms
be planning to steal the Crimean gold?

637
01:12:56,767 --> 01:12:58,962
Steal from a moving railway train?

638
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:02,077
Who could imagine such a thing?

639
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,362
The next gold shipment is tomorrow.

640
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:08,122
I've alerted the railway line
to take extra precautions.

641
01:13:08,207 --> 01:13:11,324
- What's this?
- Precautions, sir.

642
01:13:11,407 --> 01:13:15,559
I will ride the train to Folkestone tonight.
I shall be there tomorrow

643
01:13:15,647 --> 01:13:18,684
in case there's any tomfoolery
when the gold arrives.

644
01:13:18,767 --> 01:13:21,918
- Very enterprising of you.
- Thank you, sir.

645
01:13:22,407 --> 01:13:25,922
We've made new security
arrangements throughout.

646
01:13:26,007 --> 01:13:27,440
New lock.

647
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:32,806
New guard, just in case they do have
the audacity to try for the Crimean gold.

648
01:13:32,887 --> 01:13:35,003
Excellent foresight, Mr Sharp.

649
01:13:35,087 --> 01:13:38,443
I must commend you
on your attention in this matter.

650
01:13:38,527 --> 01:13:41,758
We certainly wouldn't
want to lose that gold.

651
01:13:57,127 --> 01:14:01,325
It's all changed. Everything.
Everything's changed.

652
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:05,525
No one's allowed to ride in the luggage
van save Burgess himself as guard.

653
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:08,246
And they've got a new jack
on the platform

654
01:14:08,327 --> 01:14:11,205
who opens all parcels
large enough for a man to hide in.

655
01:14:11,287 --> 01:14:16,566
And if that ain't bad enough, they've gone
and fitted a lock on the luggage van door.

656
01:14:16,647 --> 01:14:22,563
They're locking it at the station and not
opening it until it gets to Folkestone.

657
01:14:22,647 --> 01:14:26,117
A precautionary measure.
All on account of the gold.

658
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:30,084
Bloody outside lock!
It can't be worked from within.

659
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:33,204
Even if I was to be able to
get inside the van

660
01:14:33,287 --> 01:14:36,996
I'd be locked inside there
until it gets into Folkestone.

661
01:14:37,087 --> 01:14:42,002
And who do you think's behind all this?
Only the crushers theirselves, that's who.

662
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:44,637
Two plainclothes jacks were there,

663
01:14:44,727 --> 01:14:48,959
saying as how a Mr Simms
was planning to rob the Crimean gold.

664
01:14:49,047 --> 01:14:53,438
They don't have a high opinion of your
intelligence. But they credit your nerve.

665
01:14:53,527 --> 01:14:58,476
And they've put crushers on every station
on the line and at Folkestone.

666
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:00,717
So. Here we are.

667
01:15:03,327 --> 01:15:07,718
Burgess is no use. I can't get into the van
because of that jack opening everything.

668
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:13,040
Even if I could, I couldn't get the gold out
as the door's locked from the outside.

669
01:15:13,127 --> 01:15:15,880
So what's it to have four keys, I ask you?

670
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:19,880
Four keys or 40 keys -
it don't make no bloody difference!

671
01:15:19,967 --> 01:15:23,801
It's a waste, the whole thing.
And nothing to be done about it.

672
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:27,596
All on account of they found you out,
Mr Edward bloody Simms Pierce!

673
01:15:27,687 --> 01:15:32,078
That was something you didn't think of.
What have you got to say about that?

674
01:15:37,567 --> 01:15:39,558
Find me a dead cat.

675
01:16:10,447 --> 01:16:12,642
Now then, missy, now then.

676
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:15,400
Oh, please, sir, can you help me?

677
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,842
The man is a heartless beast, he is.

678
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,960
- What man?
- That guard upon the line, sir.

679
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:24,683
He will not let me
set my dear brother on the train.

680
01:16:25,927 --> 01:16:28,202
He says it must be...

681
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:30,046
opened!

682
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,164
Why... the cruel rogue.

683
01:16:33,247 --> 01:16:35,556
We'll have your brother on the train.

684
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:39,806
There's...

685
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,878
no need to open it.

686
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:49,836
I see you have a Bateson's belfry here.

687
01:16:49,927 --> 01:16:51,645
Oh, yes, sir.

688
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:57,718
Me brother, he was terrible afraid of being
buried alive, so here's the safety.

689
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:03,558
Very thoughtful, I'm sure.
Just you dry your eyes. All will be well.

690
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,758
Thank you, sir.

691
01:17:07,047 --> 01:17:09,766
I'll just... get this business finished.

692
01:17:14,487 --> 01:17:18,196
- How could you be so cruel?
- I only told her the new rules.

693
01:17:18,287 --> 01:17:21,836
- All containers to be opened.
- Yes, I know.

694
01:17:22,567 --> 01:17:26,845
Do you smell it? I think in this case
we can make an exception.

695
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:28,476
Whatever you say.

696
01:17:28,567 --> 01:17:30,285
- Nephew.
- Uncle.

697
01:17:30,367 --> 01:17:31,800
Nephew...

698
01:17:31,887 --> 01:17:36,483
Mind your duties. Open every parcel
and make no exception.

699
01:17:36,567 --> 01:17:38,558
Yes, Uncle.

700
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:42,844
- What's that ungodly stink?
- The...

701
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:49,836
- Scheduled for the morning train?
- Yes, Uncle.

702
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,079
- See that you open it.
- But Uncle...

703
01:17:57,007 --> 01:17:58,998
No stomach for it, eh?

704
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:02,082
Dear God, you're a delicate one.

705
01:18:02,967 --> 01:18:05,003
All right, I'll do it myself.

706
01:18:05,087 --> 01:18:07,078
For opened it must be.

707
01:18:11,727 --> 01:18:15,242
My dear brother. Richard, he lives!

708
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:17,318
He lives. Oh, he's alive!

709
01:18:17,607 --> 01:18:21,566
Oh, make haste. He's alive.
Oh, praise God, he's alive!

710
01:18:22,887 --> 01:18:25,117
Hurry! Lest we are too late.

711
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:28,200
- I knew it was not cholera.
- Cholera?

712
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:32,317
He was a quack to say it. I knew it! Hurry.

713
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:37,003
- Five days I've waited to hear that bell.
- You say cholera? Five days?

714
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:38,918
Richard!

715
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:45,918
Oh, no!

716
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,084
How can it be? I heard the bell.

717
01:19:02,927 --> 01:19:04,918
Did you not?

718
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:07,278
I heard it plain.

719
01:19:07,967 --> 01:19:09,605
The bell rang.

720
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:13,157
No, missy.
A gust of wind or a tremor on the ground.

721
01:19:14,327 --> 01:19:15,840
I'm sorry.

722
01:19:15,927 --> 01:19:17,918
But I heard it.

723
01:19:18,047 --> 01:19:20,436
Load this on. Sharp now.

724
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:24,925
Steady.

725
01:19:28,647 --> 01:19:30,603
Careful.

726
01:19:32,887 --> 01:19:36,596
Over here. A little to your right.
Set it down.

727
01:19:36,687 --> 01:19:41,636
- There's more colour to you now.
- Yes, I feel much better now, thank you.

728
01:19:41,727 --> 01:19:43,558
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye, miss.

729
01:19:43,647 --> 01:19:47,845
- All right for you. I'll be in here with it.
- Rather you than me, mate.

730
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:52,878
Oh, the stench!

731
01:20:42,847 --> 01:20:45,805
- Can you do it?
- I think so.

732
01:20:45,887 --> 01:20:47,798
It's a long way back there.

733
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:51,926
Five carriages, 30 feet each,
that's 150 feet altogether.

734
01:20:52,207 --> 01:20:53,560
I'll manage.

735
01:20:53,647 --> 01:20:57,196
- You're not going to get killed, are you?
- Oh, I'd rather not.

736
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:59,161
Edward!

737
01:20:59,247 --> 01:21:03,160
- Edward Pierce, my dear fellow!
- Damn. Henry Fowler.

738
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:05,602
He cannot travel in our compartment.

739
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:07,837
Henry! What a surprise.

740
01:21:07,927 --> 01:21:10,680
- Fancy seeing you! Are you on this train?
- Yes.

741
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:12,885
As a matter of fact, so am l.

742
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:19,763
Oh, forgive me.
Miss Bridget Lawson, Mr Henry Fowler.

743
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:24,122
Miss Lawson is accompanying
her deceased brother,

744
01:21:24,207 --> 01:21:28,439
but due to the new regulations
she's not permitted in the guard's van.

745
01:21:28,527 --> 01:21:31,405
Therefore she is seeking a compartment.

746
01:21:33,127 --> 01:21:34,924
Well, mine is available.

747
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:39,521
Henry, you're so kind.

748
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:43,564
You won't join us, will you?

749
01:21:44,447 --> 01:21:47,917
As a matter of fact,
I've... made other arrangements.

750
01:21:50,127 --> 01:21:52,118
Oh, I see.

751
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,644
- You're quite sure?
- Oh, yes.

752
01:21:56,087 --> 01:21:58,078
You carry on, Henry.

753
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:04,726
Miss Lawson.

754
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:07,879
- You're in capable hands.
- You're too kind.

755
01:22:07,967 --> 01:22:10,356
Not at all.

756
01:23:02,527 --> 01:23:05,280
Open up.

757
01:23:05,367 --> 01:23:07,358
Open up, damn you!

758
01:23:09,087 --> 01:23:10,725
Are you alive, then?

759
01:23:10,807 --> 01:23:13,116
Of course I am, you damnable flat.

760
01:23:13,207 --> 01:23:16,756
- Good God, he's alive!
- Open it! Hurry up. I must be quick.

761
01:23:20,127 --> 01:23:21,924
Lift up!

762
01:23:22,327 --> 01:23:24,318
Oh, mother of God.

763
01:23:25,127 --> 01:23:27,118
Oh, the smell!

764
01:23:28,407 --> 01:23:30,398
The things I must do.

765
01:23:34,567 --> 01:23:37,764
Do you have... many gentlemen friends?

766
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:43,562
Oh, why sure enough.
Gents are ever so friendly to me, they are.

767
01:23:43,647 --> 01:23:46,764
- Me mum said I was a heartbreaker.
- I'm certain you are.

768
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:52,160
Me mum was a heartbreaker herself.
Had many a caller, she did.

769
01:23:52,607 --> 01:23:54,518
Many a caller.

770
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:57,760
And always with some little token.

771
01:23:57,847 --> 01:24:01,078
Me mum says a man loves you,
he shows you proper.

772
01:24:01,167 --> 01:24:04,079
- With some little token.
- Quite so.

773
01:24:05,527 --> 01:24:09,361
If you will permit me, I should be
delighted to give you a ''token'' myself.

774
01:24:11,647 --> 01:24:15,401
- You're a bold gent!
- I'm most serious, I assure you.

775
01:24:15,487 --> 01:24:18,638
- What, here on the train?
- Why not?

776
01:24:18,727 --> 01:24:22,242
Have you not heard of
the 50-mile-an-hour club?

777
01:24:22,327 --> 01:24:25,558
I'm told it's beneficial to the circulation.

778
01:24:39,767 --> 01:24:42,725
- But the van's locked from outside.
- It's taken care of.

779
01:24:42,807 --> 01:24:45,321
- How?
- You'll see soon enough.

780
01:24:45,407 --> 01:24:49,320
My friend will come over the top of
the train between Redhill and Ashford.

781
01:24:49,407 --> 01:24:52,444
That's the fastest part of the run.

782
01:24:52,527 --> 01:24:54,518
I suppose it is.

783
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:58,682
What about all them bridges?
Your friend, mate, he's mad.

784
01:30:27,527 --> 01:30:29,722
- What's going on?
- Take the rope.

785
01:30:33,687 --> 01:30:35,882
- Is he up there now?
- He is.

786
01:30:35,967 --> 01:30:37,958
He's lucky to be alive.

787
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:41,443
- Hold on.
- All right.

788
01:30:49,087 --> 01:30:51,078
Now let it go easy.

789
01:30:51,607 --> 01:30:53,598
Go on.

790
01:31:27,247 --> 01:31:29,442
I can't get over the feeling...

791
01:31:30,367 --> 01:31:32,278
You look very familiar.

792
01:31:32,367 --> 01:31:36,121
- Are you sure we've never met?
- Oh, no, sir.

793
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:40,603
What does your mum do?

794
01:31:40,687 --> 01:31:42,882
Me mum?

795
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:45,358
She's a seamstress.

796
01:31:46,727 --> 01:31:48,718
An honourable trade.

797
01:31:49,727 --> 01:31:54,437
Me mum's made dresses for Lady
Eversham herself, I'll have you know.

798
01:31:57,007 --> 01:31:59,362
I'm acquainted with Lady Eversham.

799
01:32:36,687 --> 01:32:38,598
- All done?
- Done.

800
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:41,838
Good. We've got less than a minute.

801
01:32:51,287 --> 01:32:53,517
Bloody hell, you look a sight.

802
01:32:53,847 --> 01:32:55,724
I look a sight?

803
01:32:55,807 --> 01:32:58,275
No, but you're all covered in soot.

804
01:33:01,287 --> 01:33:03,164
It's the smoke.

805
01:33:03,247 --> 01:33:06,683
- I haven't brought a change of clothing.
- That's brilliant!

806
01:33:06,767 --> 01:33:10,840
What are you going to wear
coming off Folkestone station?

807
01:33:13,207 --> 01:33:14,720
Oh, no!

808
01:33:16,807 --> 01:33:22,404
Bloody hell! You paint me green,
make me lie in a coffin with a dead cat,

809
01:33:22,487 --> 01:33:24,762
and now you strip me bollock-naked. No!

810
01:33:24,847 --> 01:33:26,678
- Shut up.
- Bloody hell!

811
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,439
Let's go.

812
01:33:46,847 --> 01:33:50,522
He'll take the river road
and meet us in Folkestone.

813
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:04,561
Take hold of the rope.
We'll be through Ashford soon. Pull it.

814
01:34:08,487 --> 01:34:10,478
We'll pass Ashford soon.

815
01:36:18,567 --> 01:36:20,558
Best lock me up.

816
01:36:21,247 --> 01:36:24,956
- Sweet dreams.
- Not bloody likely.

817
01:36:41,887 --> 01:36:46,961
Me mum told me the best gents were the
ones to watch. Full of tricks, they are.

818
01:36:47,647 --> 01:36:54,120
I knew of one caller, wanted me to come
to a room he had, full of whips and such.

819
01:36:54,807 --> 01:36:56,479
Whips?

820
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:58,558
Can you imagine!

821
01:37:00,407 --> 01:37:04,400
- Well, me mum, she told me...
- My dear, my dear, my dearest!

822
01:37:06,527 --> 01:37:08,518
What a man you are!

823
01:37:10,207 --> 01:37:11,959
What do you take me for?

824
01:38:12,287 --> 01:38:14,721
lmpossible woman.

825
01:38:34,607 --> 01:38:37,644
Robbery indeed. The very idea!

826
01:39:56,767 --> 01:39:58,758
Arrest that man!

827
01:40:27,767 --> 01:40:31,396
The court thanks you for providing us
with so clear an explanation

828
01:40:31,487 --> 01:40:33,637
of your manner in committing the crime.

829
01:40:34,047 --> 01:40:37,596
I'm glad to be of help.
The police seemed to be confused.

830
01:40:37,687 --> 01:40:41,236
Do spare us your impoverished
witticisms, Mr Pierce.

831
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:44,478
Your presence here
attests to their efficiency.

832
01:40:44,567 --> 01:40:47,320
You know, you are a very unusual man.

833
01:40:47,407 --> 01:40:49,921
Mr Pierce, I put it to you directly.

834
01:40:50,607 --> 01:40:54,282
Did you never feel at any time
some sense of impropriety,

835
01:40:54,367 --> 01:40:56,835
some recognition of misconduct,

836
01:40:56,927 --> 01:41:02,126
some comprehension of unlawful
behaviour, some moral misgivings

837
01:41:02,567 --> 01:41:06,685
in the performance of these
various and sundry criminal acts?

838
01:41:06,767 --> 01:41:10,555
- I don't understand the question.
- Evidently not.

839
01:41:11,127 --> 01:41:14,836
Sir, it is a recognised truth
of jurisprudence

840
01:41:14,927 --> 01:41:17,202
that laws are created by men

841
01:41:17,567 --> 01:41:21,355
and that civilised men,
in a tradition of more than two millennia,

842
01:41:21,447 --> 01:41:26,077
agree to abide by these laws
for the common good of all society.

843
01:41:26,527 --> 01:41:28,358
For it is only by the rule of law

844
01:41:28,447 --> 01:41:34,636
that any civilisation holds itself above
the promiscuous squalor of barbarism.

845
01:41:34,967 --> 01:41:38,277
Now, on the matter of motive, we ask you:

846
01:41:38,367 --> 01:41:45,762
why did you conceive, plan and execute
this dastardly and scandalous crime?

847
01:41:51,167 --> 01:41:53,158
I wanted the money.

848
01:42:03,407 --> 01:42:05,398
He'll get 20 years for that.
