1
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:30,626
Any moment now.

2
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,959
- He could be late?
- But he isn't.

3
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:57,876
Held up at the lights.

4
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:00,334
He's going to turn left into
Cannon Street.

5
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:01,793
"They're moving away."

6
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,043
Crossing Holburn Viaduct.

7
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:09,293
Not too close, Frank.
Jack will tell us when.

8
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,626
Stand back there, now.
Stand back, please.

9
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,251
We'll have to break the window.

10
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:29,543
- Can I help?
- Leave it to us.

11
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:14,501
Looks like them.

12
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:15,751
Charlie Delta Two.

13
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:16,834
- Urgent message.
- Let's go!

14
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:19,543
Your all-car message regarding
stolen ambulance.

15
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:20,626
Suspect ambulance...

16
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:23,626
...being abandoned by three men
in Arbridge Avenue.

17
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:55,251
They're going along Delamere Terrace.

18
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:56,584
"Jaguar's index number..."

19
00:11:56,751 --> 00:12:00,668
"Bravo-Yankee-Romeo-
Five-Zero-Two-Bravo."

20
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:03,084
"He's turning left into Queensdale Road."

21
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:03,751
"Over."

22
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:06,459
Charlie Delta Two - you are
now car-to-car.

23
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:09,668
All cars Number One District
switch to channel five.

24
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:10,751
Charlie Delta Two is...

25
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,418
...pursuing suspect car concerned...

26
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,584
...in that all car-message,
One-One-Two-Six...

27
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,209
...along Queensdale Road.

28
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:24,001
They just turned right down the
bottom of Evans Grove.

29
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,501
We're turning left.

30
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:26,709
We-We're going round.

31
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,084
We're fifty yards behind.

32
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,168
All cars Foxtrot Delta.

33
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:51,918
Charlie Delta Two is pursuing
suspect car...

34
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,001
...towards Kilburn, against the traffic.

35
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:55,709
Any car in the vicinity?

36
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,459
Head them off towards
Lancaster Gate.

37
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,918
Silver-grey Jaguar.

38
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,251
Registration number...

39
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:02,251
- Bravo-Yankee-Roger-Five...
- Hello MP? Hello MP?

40
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,126
- ...Zero-Two-Bravo.
- Delta One Marble Arch.

41
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,793
"Heading towards Lancaster Gate."

42
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,084
"Delta One over."

43
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,334
"Oscar Two Three Two."

44
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:10,751
"Oscar Two Four One."

45
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,084
"Are you receiving?"

46
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,959
- "Oscar Two Three Two receiving."
- "Oscar Two Three Two, Oscar Two..."

47
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:17,834
"...Four One, join pursuit of Jaguar."

48
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:22,001
"Bravo-Yankee-Romeo-Five-Oh-Two-Bravo."

49
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:27,959
"Now being pursued by
Charlie Delta Two along Abercorn Place."

50
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,668
Turning right here.

51
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,459
He's trying to lose us on
these corners.

52
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:57,584
Turn left.

53
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:04,626
Now - right.

54
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:07,959
Bloody copper!

55
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:09,001
Keep going.

56
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,334
KEEP GOING!

57
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,376
He's really throwing his car round...

58
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:26,709
...these corners, now.

59
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:28,626
He's going absolutely mad, now!

60
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,709
We're right up behind him.

61
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:33,376
Frank?

62
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,334
Round the corner.

63
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,543
As soon as we've cleared
the tunnel - jump!

64
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,001
Right.

65
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:48,376
Freddy. You, as well - as soon as
I give you the word.

66
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:32,251
Jump as we round the
corner. NOW!

67
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,126
Now - hard right!

68
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:54,626
We didn't make the corner.

69
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,459
We're after him again!

70
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:58,418
Good boy.

71
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,001
Move it, move it!

72
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:15,334
All right.

73
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,001
Over you go.

74
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,084
Children - wait for it to stop!

75
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:40,376
Stay where you are!!!

76
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:47,459
We're gonna hit them!
We're gonna hit them!

77
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:48,876
NO!!!

78
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,501
Charlie Delta Two, what is
your position?

79
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:03,459
Charlie Delta Two,
do you read me?

80
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:07,168
- Is there anybody hurt?
- We're all right.

81
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,751
Did you see the driver?

82
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,376
Sshhh.

83
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,168
Contact lost with suspect.

84
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:14,001
Unable to continue pursuit.

85
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:16,168
We've crashed outside
the Quentin Pope...

86
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,043
...Junior School.

87
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:19,001
Would you recognise that driver?

88
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:19,834
What?

89
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:23,001
Would you recognise the driver?

90
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,126
Yes, of course I'd recognise
the bastard!

91
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,334
- Bye, Kate. I'll see you this evening.
- What time?

92
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,293
- Oh, I shouldn't be late.
- All right.

93
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,668
If anything crops up I'll phone you.

94
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:01,418
All right.

95
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:02,543
Bye bye.

96
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:54,084
- I'll be right with you.
- You'll never be right with me, Jack!

97
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,793
Hello, George.

98
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,876
What can I do for you?

99
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,376
I'd like a little chat about a car.

100
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,418
Oh?

101
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,334
Talk about cars all day,
if you like?

102
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:08,418
A silver Jag?

103
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:10,793
- Thinking of buying it?
- No.

104
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,876
No, I, er...

105
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:16,793
...I was just wondering who
was driving it.

106
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:19,793
Ah. Someone pulled a job, eh?

107
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:21,876
No.

108
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,126
No, not me, Inspector.

109
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,543
I jacked that lot in - it's a...

110
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,709
...it's a mug's game, isn't it?

111
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,626
Well, I mean, there's no point...

112
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:31,793
...now I've got the job...

113
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,626
- ...and the business.
- How is business?

114
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:35,751
Can't complain.

115
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:41,668
Is, er...

116
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,751
...is he with you..?

117
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,876
Never saw him in my life before.

118
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,418
Got a warrant, Inspector?

119
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,001
What? For a social call?

120
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,668
This bloke's a better actor
than Mickey Mouse.

121
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:06,751
Well, er...

122
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,543
...I'll be seein' yer, Jack.

123
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:35,918
Six-Oh-Three-Eight-Seven-Four-Two.

124
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,126
Scotland Yard here.

125
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:38,043
Sergeant!

126
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:40,376
- Your call on number three.
- Oh, thanks.

127
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,543
Right, she's already made three
insurance claims.

128
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,251
Get onto Bedford, see if they've
got anything on her.

129
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,501
Right you are, guv'nor.

130
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,168
George. Go carefully, eh?

131
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,668
Remember who her father is.

132
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,168
- Well?
- Nothing.

133
00:20:56,543 --> 00:20:59,334
- Still think Jack's the driver?
- That's my best guess.

134
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:00,751
This is the Squad, Inspector Langdon.

135
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,793
We deal in evidence and
arrests, not guesses.

136
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:05,251
I think you're right about him.

137
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:06,376
He's our man - but we've got to...

138
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:08,459
...get evidence and we've got
to make it stick.

139
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,084
You've got to make it stick!

140
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:11,459
Yes, sir.

141
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:35,501
That was a close one
yesterday, love.

142
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:36,459
Mmm.

143
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:38,001
Did you see the papers?

144
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:40,251
- Eighty-five thousand quid?
- Nah.

145
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,751
Not a penny over seventy-five...

146
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:43,668
...and that's trade valuation.
Not what we got.

147
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:45,668
Yeah... they're all at it.

148
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:48,501
- Where's Paul?
- He'll be here.

149
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:51,418
I've had the law round.

150
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:52,584
That was quick! Who was it?

151
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,626
Langdon.

152
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:30,084
Hi.

153
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,043
Evening.

154
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,001
Jack's had callers. The Squad.

155
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:35,626
Yeah. Langdon... a try-on.

156
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,543
Does he know anything?

157
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,543
- What? Him?
- Does he know anything?

158
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,043
Of course not!

159
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:45,918
Well, let's keep it that way.

160
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:48,834
Here's how it is, then.

161
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,876
We've got the capital now
for the investment.

162
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:53,626
We all agree to go ahead?

163
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:54,709
- Yep.
- Yeah.

164
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,501
Well, why don't we share out in
the usual way? I mean...

165
00:23:57,543 --> 00:23:59,251
...we're doing all right.

166
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,168
I want us to do better, Frank.

167
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,001
I dunno.

168
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:06,709
If there's one thing I know...

169
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,334
...money breeds money.

170
00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:10,584
Huh, mine must be on the pill.

171
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,126
All right, Frank - I'll pay you off.

172
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:17,918
I'll find another firm that's interested...

173
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,459
...in three or four million pounds.

174
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,959
Four million! Bloody hell!

175
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:32,709
Frank?

176
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:35,334
I'm interested.

177
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:35,793
Jack?

178
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,376
Yeah, yeah. Count me in.

179
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,918
The job, Paul?

180
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,418
It's a night mail train.

181
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,501
From Glasgow to London.

182
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,709
The Tuesday after the holiday.

183
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:47,709
What?

184
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:50,001
- Not till after the holiday?
- Exactly.

185
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:52,126
The banks will have been closed...

186
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:53,418
...from midday Saturday...

187
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,959
...till Tuesday morning.

188
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:57,876
There'll be that much more
money on the train.

189
00:24:58,126 --> 00:24:59,793
What happens to the money afterwards?

190
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,668
A friend of ours flies it out of the
country within the hour.

191
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:05,918
Ahh!

192
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,918
Where do we share out?

193
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:11,834
Switzerland?

194
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:14,501
Share's delivered wherever you like.

195
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:16,584
I know where I want mine delivered.

196
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:19,251
Okay?

197
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,501
There's just one more thing.

198
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:25,543
This is the big one - the biggest.

199
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:28,126
From now until we finish
the job, I want no...

200
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:29,334
...trouble with the law.

201
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,126
You understand, Jack?

202
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:34,626
Me?

203
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:36,709
I'll be as good as gold.

204
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,793
We've got nothing to worry
about then, have we?

205
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:13,084
Bloke askin' for you, Mr Aitken.

206
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:15,834
- What sort of bloke?
- A bloke!

207
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:32,293
How much you getting for these?

208
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:34,501
- Shopping, Inspector?
- Not today.

209
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:36,876
You know who I am, Aitken?

210
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:38,251
I'm making enquiries into a...

211
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,293
...robbery at Northumberland
Avenue - ten days ago.

212
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:42,376
I have reason to believe you
can be of assistance.

213
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:43,459
I must ask you if you're willing...

214
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,876
...to be put up for an identity parade.

215
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,418
We're very formal all of a sudden.

216
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:47,668
Is this an invitation?

217
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,751
Would you rather it were printed?

218
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,293
Uh, I've got to go out...

219
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:56,376
...but I'll be back before
you go to lunch.

220
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:25,626
- No, I don't recognise anyone.
- That will be all, thank you.

221
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:33,168
- Good morning, miss.
- Morning.

222
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,834
Now, all I want you to do is just
to go along the line...

223
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:37,584
...and if you recognise the
man you thought...

224
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,668
...you saw in the car, just
touch him.

225
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:40,418
All right?

226
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,543
- Okay.
- All right.

227
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:19,334
That's all right, miss - if you'll go
with the policewoman.

228
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:21,501
Gentlemen.

229
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:23,251
We're very grateful for your time.

230
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:25,001
That will be all, thank you.

231
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:29,418
Yeah, waste of time, this.

232
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:35,126
- Don't rate his ugly mug.
- No, neither do I.

233
00:28:38,293 --> 00:28:39,668
This way, please.

234
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,751
Now, I want you to go
along the line...

235
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:07,834
...and if you recognise the man...

236
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:39,001
Get him out of here.

237
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,251
- Take him off.
- I'm sorry, I---

238
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:43,168
- ...I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- Right, that'll be all. Thank you, gentlemen.

239
00:29:58,418 --> 00:30:00,168
I want a summons for assault.

240
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:07,584
- You're in trouble, Jack.
- Naahhh.

241
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:08,793
- Get---
- Jack!

242
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:11,376
Look...

243
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:14,126
...I'm just tryin' to help you.

244
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,376
Make a statement.

245
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:16,543
Tell us who else was in on it.

246
00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:18,251
I've got nothing to make a
statement about.

247
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:19,126
Ahhh...

248
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,209
...do yourself a favour.

249
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:23,459
What do you mean? You
saw what she did.

250
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:24,126
Who?

251
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:26,501
That bloody schoolteacher!

252
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,043
How did you know she was
a schoolteacher?

253
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,043
That stuff will kill you.

254
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:12,043
I thought you said you were
already in condition?

255
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:13,959
I thought I was!

256
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,168
How are things going?

257
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,251
Made a start on the drivers.

258
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:20,793
Like who?

259
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:22,126
So far, Mike...

260
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:23,126
...Pete...

261
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:25,209
...and those two we used
on the fur job.

262
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,001
Mike's good.

263
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:29,501
The other one talks too much.

264
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:30,751
You know that.

265
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,543
You want two drivers to
every car, right?

266
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,293
I want everybody doubled up...

267
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:37,376
...and no weak sisters.

268
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:38,876
So, I'll keep trying.

269
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:43,126
- How about the railway end?
- All fixed.

270
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,626
Four of our lads are now railwaymen.

271
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:46,834
Fully paid up.

272
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:50,501
- What about electricians?
- Not easy.

273
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,418
Ben's got one or two good lads...

274
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:53,293
...but he's not going to settle...

275
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:54,918
...for wages - he'll want a cut.

276
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:57,959
Talk to him.

277
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:02,793
How about your friend the banker?

278
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:03,626
Robinson?

279
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:05,751
He's in prison.

280
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:07,584
We'll have to get him out.

281
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:09,543
We'll need his knowledge
of bank security...

282
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:10,918
...and for the bank notes.

283
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,334
Only an expert can tell
the safe ones.

284
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,918
So we'll have to get him out.

285
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,876
- Just like that?
- Yeah.

286
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:18,376
You could have a problem there.

287
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:21,001
Ha, he's worth it. We'll split
here - see you, Dave.

288
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:24,876
Zero.

289
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:32,084
Seventy-three pieces, sir.
Thank you.

290
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:35,543
Fifty-two pieces for your spend.
You're straight up, sir. Thank you.

291
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:38,334
Three hundred thousand.

292
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:41,501
And a cut of the profits.

293
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:42,959
Straight.

294
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,043
How much you expect?

295
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:51,376
Somewhere in the low millions.

296
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:56,126
- I'll take a cut.
- Uh-uh.

297
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:57,501
Dave, darling...

298
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,001
...I've missed you, where
have you been?

299
00:32:59,084 --> 00:33:01,501
Go away, baby - I'm busy.
Ask me later.

300
00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:06,626
Percentage or forget it.

301
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:08,709
How much?

302
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,793
Twenty-five percent.

303
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:13,209
We'll work for you, Ben.

304
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:14,793
Take it or leave it.

305
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:19,001
I'll put it to the board.

306
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:20,626
Fine.

307
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:42,251
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty...

308
00:33:42,376 --> 00:33:44,959
...seventy, eighty, ninety -
a hundred pounds.

309
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,626
Place your bets, please.

310
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:49,834
All bets on?

311
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,043
Twenty-two.

312
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,168
You win, Mr Aitken.

313
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:09,251
Place your bets, please.

314
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:30,501
"On the day of the funeral
a general strike was declared and---"

315
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:33,501
Welcome to J Wing, Robinson.

316
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,251
What a pity you won't be
staying long.

317
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:38,501
W-what do you mean?
What are you talking about?

318
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,668
You're going over the wall, Robinson.

319
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:44,543
four-ten exercise, west wall.

320
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,293
I don't want any trouble.

321
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:51,043
Neither does your wife,
I should imagine.

322
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:52,751
Or the boy.

323
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,834
How old will he be now?

324
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:57,709
Why me?

325
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:59,084
I don't know, Robinson...

326
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,584
...and I don't care.

327
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:05,001
All I know is you go over
the wall tomorrow...

328
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:08,668
...even if I have to throw
you over myself.

329
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:38,751
Right.

330
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:39,918
Let's run through it.

331
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:42,293
Uh, four hundred yards on the left...

332
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:44,793
...bottom of the incline, there's
a road to the junction.

333
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:46,168
Half a mile beyond that...

334
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:47,876
...there's a sharp right-hander.

335
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,126
Then a crossing.

336
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:50,876
After the crossing...

337
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,376
...there's no turn-off till you get
to the main road.

338
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:54,751
Keep it at forty.

339
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:56,834
How many turnings off
the main road?

340
00:35:57,084 --> 00:35:58,043
Er, nine.

341
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:00,668
How many of those can we use
as alternative routes?

342
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:02,751
Fi... six, I think.

343
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:03,876
Five.

344
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:05,584
Five or six, what does it matter?

345
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:06,709
It matters.

346
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,293
Let's get back to the bridge
a different way.

347
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,168
You've got... six minutes.

348
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:12,668
What kind of recruiting?

349
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:13,793
Specialists?

350
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:15,668
All kinds, apparently.

351
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:16,709
Drivers.

352
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:18,793
- Electricians.
- Electricians?

353
00:36:18,918 --> 00:36:19,793
Any names?

354
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:22,793
You know I never can
remember names.

355
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:25,918
Who's "the money"?

356
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,418
The talk is it's from that
diamond job.

357
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:29,793
Any more on that?

358
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:32,084
Had to be the mob we
were talking about.

359
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:33,793
None of them's spending.

360
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:36,334
And that's interesting,
isn't it, Mr Langdon?

361
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:38,751
Very interesting.

362
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:40,918
Keep listening.

363
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:12,501
Three-sixteen. Two minutes late.

364
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:14,126
We can't have that, can we?

365
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:14,834
Hmm, no.

366
00:37:14,918 --> 00:37:15,959
What's the average?

367
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:17,709
It's never more than six minutes...

368
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:19,209
...over the past ten days.

369
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:54,001
That was my smoke you took.

370
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:55,418
Smoke? I never 'ad your smoke!

371
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:56,418
Why don't you shut your
mouth or I'll...

372
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:57,793
- ...put one on you!
- You'll do what?

373
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,501
Hey!

374
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,168
Hey! Break it up!

375
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,626
Break it up there!

376
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:27,084
How much do you think there
is tonight, Bob?

377
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:30,043
If you take three million
as an average...

378
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:31,751
...there could be four million tonight.

379
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:33,834
Judging by the number of sacks.

380
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,168
Is that high-value coach always
in second position?

381
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,126
Has been all week.

382
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:45,709
Have you found an engine
driver for me yet?

383
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,459
I've got one in mind.

384
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,876
Have we found out anything
about this, Jock?

385
00:40:02,084 --> 00:40:02,751
Yes, sir.

386
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:04,126
Kidderminster Laboratories...

387
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,209
...confirmed it WAS one of...

388
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:07,626
...those stolen at the time of
the break-in last year.

389
00:40:07,793 --> 00:40:09,293
The timing mechanism's
the kind of...

390
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:11,251
...thing you can buy
at most shops.

391
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,084
Any one of half a dozen specialists...

392
00:40:13,126 --> 00:40:14,376
...could have rigged the
two together.

393
00:40:14,793 --> 00:40:16,251
Which gets us nowhere.

394
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,418
Do you think the diamonds are
still in the country?

395
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:21,001
If Aitken's behind it? No.

396
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,084
- You've charged Jack?
- Yes.

397
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:25,168
- He's not speaking, of course?
- No!

398
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,251
I take it Number One District's...

399
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:28,543
...keeping an eye on the
Aitken mob?

400
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:29,709
Round the clock.

401
00:40:31,918 --> 00:40:33,501
Frankly, I would have
thought this job...

402
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:36,126
...far too sophisticated for
Aitken on his own.

403
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,543
I couldn't agree more.

404
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:38,959
Who's behind it?

405
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:40,501
Somebody with some brains.

406
00:40:40,793 --> 00:40:41,793
And not only that...

407
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,501
There's someone who's recruiting -
and only top specialists.

408
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,084
- Pretty strong rumours to that effect.
- Yes?

409
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:47,084
Information received?

410
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:48,251
- Yes, sir.
- It's positive?

411
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:50,043
Right, George - you keep on to this.
You'll get all the help...

412
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:52,168
- ...you need from Number One District.
- Yes, he's here now. I'll tell him.

413
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:53,543
Well done, David.

414
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:59,251
It's the Rosary Gardens strangling, sir.

415
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:02,251
Renshaw's at Harrow Road now and
he'll be charged tonight.

416
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,251
Water-tight?

417
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:04,501
Absolutely.

418
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:05,543
Well done, Mike.

419
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,584
Smart arrest by the young detective...

420
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:08,751
...in Paddington, I thought.

421
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:10,084
Good.

422
00:41:10,793 --> 00:41:11,418
Well, come on lads...

423
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:12,751
...let's get this over with.
I've got a meeting with the...

424
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:14,126
...Commissioner in ten minutes.

425
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:15,043
Now, then...

426
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:16,959
...anything fresh on the
Robinson escape?

427
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:18,751
Well, he had outside help,
of course...

428
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:19,876
...but I think we'll have him back...

429
00:41:19,918 --> 00:41:21,126
...inside in a matter of days.

430
00:41:21,168 --> 00:41:21,918
Reasons?

431
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:23,626
Well, he's an amateur, sir.

432
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,043
"Good conduct" man.

433
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:26,251
First-time loser.

434
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:27,501
No underworld connections.

435
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:29,043
Who helped him over
the wall, then?

436
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:30,793
Well, he probably made friends inside.

437
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:31,876
What? They sprung him for love?

438
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:33,293
Let's hear your thinking, George.

439
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:35,376
Well, I think somebody wanted
Robinson out, sir.

440
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:37,459
I've got his file here.
Listen to this.

441
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:41,418
It says: "...the accused was attached
to security department...

442
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:44,626
"...of his bank shortly after promotion
from chief cashier."

443
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:46,501
"He handled matters concerned with..."

444
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,668
"...safety and care of bank vaults..."

445
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:51,668
"...and safeguarding high-value currency."

446
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:53,001
The Case Officer added...

447
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:53,918
... that "...he made no use of this..."

448
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:55,751
"...knowledge but committed
straight-forward embezzlement."

449
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:56,376
So?

450
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:57,834
Well, that's why Robinson's out.

451
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:58,793
Somebody's planning a big job...

452
00:41:58,793 --> 00:42:00,043
...and they need his know-how!

453
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:01,209
Maybe.

454
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,334
Well, I'll get on to records...

455
00:42:02,376 --> 00:42:03,709
...sir, and get a rundown on
the jail friends...

456
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:05,668
...past and present. I think
it'll be useful.

457
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,751
Any idea what job they
could be planning?

458
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,251
Er, something special, and I, er...

459
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,793
...think I know when.

460
00:42:12,043 --> 00:42:13,709
More "information received"?

461
00:42:13,793 --> 00:42:15,001
No, sir. The calendar.

462
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:17,376
My guess is it's due over the
Bank Holiday when the...

463
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,043
...banks are closed for three days.

464
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:20,626
That will give them three
days and nights...

465
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,168
...to open up the bank vaults.

466
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,668
But I, er, know you dislike
guesswork, sir.

467
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,043
There's a time and place for it.

468
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,209
I think you might be right.

469
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:29,334
So, lads - you can tell your
delighted wives...

470
00:42:29,376 --> 00:42:31,959
...that Squad leave is restricted
over the Bank Holiday.

471
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:33,084
That's all.

472
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:52,084
I just want to speak to her!

473
00:42:52,126 --> 00:42:53,251
Just for a moment.

474
00:42:54,543 --> 00:42:55,584
She's not alone.

475
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:57,126
But of course she is!

476
00:42:57,751 --> 00:43:00,126
That woman sitting over there
is a policewoman.

477
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,751
How do you know?

478
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,834
It's a special brand of
perfume they wear.

479
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,251
Use your head, Robinson.

480
00:43:09,376 --> 00:43:10,626
Your wife's followed wherever
she goes.

481
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:11,751
What do you expect?

482
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:15,501
To think that I---

483
00:43:16,418 --> 00:43:18,168
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

484
00:43:24,126 --> 00:43:26,043
Well, now you know what
you're risking.

485
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,126
I wasn't feeling sorry for
myself, you know?

486
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,251
I've had time to think.

487
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:53,043
Night after night.

488
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:56,168
What did you think about?

489
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:58,001
About my family.

490
00:43:58,918 --> 00:44:01,168
How I can make it up to them
for what I've done.

491
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:05,459
Well, a hundred thousand pounds
would help, wouldn't it?

492
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:10,376
If I do what you want...

493
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:12,709
...what happens to them?

494
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:15,293
They'll be brought out to
Switzerland, to join you.

495
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:17,376
Passports provided.

496
00:44:18,126 --> 00:44:20,334
We'd never be able to
come home again.

497
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:23,001
Home is a Swiss bank account.

498
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:25,876
I'd be hunted for the rest
of my life.

499
00:44:26,543 --> 00:44:28,043
You will be anyway.

500
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:30,459
You're an escaped convict, remember?

501
00:44:31,751 --> 00:44:33,334
Switzerland's your best bet.

502
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:36,876
You'll have one hundred thousand
pounds in the bank...

503
00:44:37,793 --> 00:44:39,501
...and your boy will speak
three languages.

504
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:40,293
Huh.

505
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:44,584
It was your idea started the
whole thing, remember?

506
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,918
Something we talked
about in prison.

507
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:51,126
Passed the time.

508
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:52,626
Probably.

509
00:44:56,584 --> 00:44:57,793
I'm not sure.

510
00:44:58,126 --> 00:44:59,876
Robinson, you're in!

511
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:06,168
You were in the moment you
came over that wall.

512
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:41,001
That last rehearsal wasn't
good enough.

513
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:43,376
There were two men
without gloves on.

514
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:46,043
Your men, Ben.

515
00:46:47,668 --> 00:46:49,834
Frank, one of your drivers
jumped the gun.

516
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:52,418
Don't they know the order
they leave in?

517
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:54,834
He was nervous.

518
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:57,376
I'm paying for nerve...

519
00:46:57,543 --> 00:46:58,668
...not nerves.

520
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:04,209
What about the equipment, Don?

521
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:06,251
Three of the radio units
didn't work...

522
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:08,334
...and I couldn't read the signal
from the spotter.

523
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:10,959
I'd like doubles of everything,
including batteries.

524
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:13,043
- Frank?
- Sure.

525
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:15,793
How was the timing?

526
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:16,876
Too slow.

527
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:20,543
- Things will be easier on the night, we'll be---
- It was too slow!

528
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:23,043
We've got forty-five minutes
at the outside.

529
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:24,709
I want it done in twenty-five.

530
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:27,126
You fellas think you gonna bust...

531
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:30,334
...a high-value security van in
twenty-five minutes?

532
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:33,459
It won't be a high-value
security van.

533
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:36,334
The regular vans will be out
of action. Fixed.

534
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:39,668
The substitute one will be easy.

535
00:47:45,834 --> 00:47:48,459
- Do we provide the shooters?
- No guns!

536
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:51,501
What happens if things
get sticky?

537
00:47:51,793 --> 00:47:53,043
Turn on the charm, Ben.

538
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:54,959
- Now, look---
- No guns.

539
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:57,334
I want no violence, no accidents.

540
00:47:57,668 --> 00:47:59,751
They don't carry guns,
we don't need them.

541
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:03,543
Five million quid and no guns.

542
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:05,126
They don't carry guns.

543
00:48:05,584 --> 00:48:07,334
And they've never been done.

544
00:48:09,209 --> 00:48:10,501
Still think we should have 'em.

545
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,668
Why, in case someone should
disturb your hair?

546
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:13,626
I can handle myself, I just...

547
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:14,501
...don't reckon getting caught.

548
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:15,751
Nobody does.

549
00:48:16,418 --> 00:48:17,501
If you're caught with a shooter it's...

550
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:18,834
...three times the sentence.

551
00:48:20,543 --> 00:48:22,501
Okay, okay - no guns.

552
00:48:24,126 --> 00:48:25,876
Now, about the share-out.

553
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:29,168
What about the share-out?

554
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:31,043
I don't like the idea of the
money leaving...

555
00:48:31,043 --> 00:48:32,959
...the country before the payout.

556
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:35,626
I want mine before we split up.

557
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:42,084
We're talking about millions
of pounds, now.

558
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:44,584
We're talking about road blocks,
car searches...

559
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:46,418
...house raids, shake-downs.

560
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:48,459
They'll know who pulled the job.

561
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:50,543
Without the money they can't
prove anything.

562
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:53,293
You said the notes won't
be traceable.

563
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:54,668
You'll get the money...

564
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:57,001
...when it's safe.

565
00:48:58,126 --> 00:48:59,543
Okay. That's it, then.

566
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:02,334
My boys are out.

567
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:05,293
And mine.

568
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:15,168
We can't do it on our own.

569
00:49:16,126 --> 00:49:16,918
No.

570
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:21,209
We'll have to postpone it, then.

571
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:27,126
No.

572
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:28,584
Frank, get them back.

573
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,876
Cash on the nail -
right after the job.

574
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:15,126
It means we'll have to hide
out till we've counted it.

575
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:17,459
We'll be pinned down and the
law will be swarming.

576
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:18,751
So we need a hide-out.

577
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:19,876
Close by.

578
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:22,876
Inside the police cordon,
with all that money.

579
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,251
Could be the safest place.

580
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:26,043
I still like Switzerland.

581
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:27,584
Not for us.

582
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:31,293
That's that, then.

583
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:35,668
Means the boys will have
to be briefed again...

584
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:36,751
...and thoroughly.

585
00:50:36,918 --> 00:50:39,293
Dave will tell you when we've
got a hide-out.

586
00:50:40,043 --> 00:50:41,793
And the next time we meet...

587
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:44,501
...will be on the money train.

588
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:25,834
- Inspector Langdon?
- Ah, yes.

589
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:27,751
- One prisoner.
- Thank you.

590
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:37,001
- Much obliged to you.
- Thank you.

591
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:39,084
Sit down.

592
00:51:42,126 --> 00:51:43,251
Take off the cuffs.

593
00:51:46,751 --> 00:51:48,876
I thought we might have
another little chat.

594
00:51:56,668 --> 00:51:58,168
We're informal here.

595
00:52:05,293 --> 00:52:06,626
Left it a bit late, haven't you?

596
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:09,543
My mind seems to work better at night.

597
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:14,793
- Do you ever find that?
- No.

598
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,418
Tell me about the Robinson escape?

599
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:24,834
Is it a wall picture?

600
00:52:30,793 --> 00:52:32,168
What's this big job comin' up?

601
00:52:32,668 --> 00:52:34,251
I don't know anythin' about
any "big job".

602
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:35,126
Jack...

603
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,501
...come off it now. You know
me - I'm not talking.

604
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:40,834
Well, I've got all night.

605
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:48,834
Well, I don't know.

606
00:52:49,043 --> 00:52:49,876
What a mug.

607
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:51,918
You're in 'ere, they're out there.

608
00:52:51,959 --> 00:52:54,126
Do you think they're giving you
a thought right now?

609
00:52:58,043 --> 00:52:59,418
Do you know Paul Clifton?

610
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:15,251
Come back to bed, Kate.

611
00:53:16,168 --> 00:53:17,126
Why?

612
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:20,834
What's wrong?

613
00:53:21,209 --> 00:53:22,043
Tell me.

614
00:53:26,793 --> 00:53:28,126
"Never again."

615
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:29,501
"Never again."

616
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,043
"From now on..."

617
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,126
"...straight and narrow."

618
00:53:36,251 --> 00:53:38,793
"I'll never put you through
that again, Kate."

619
00:53:39,293 --> 00:53:40,876
You bloody hypocrite!

620
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,751
Oh, well - what's a little cheating,
here and there?

621
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:53,334
It's happening all over.

622
00:53:57,584 --> 00:53:59,001
You're imagining things.

623
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:02,959
Come on! Paul, I know you.

624
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:08,543
Kate.

625
00:54:20,293 --> 00:54:21,709
Have you ever been to three movies...

626
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:24,126
...in a day and had no idea
what you'd seen?

627
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:27,876
What are you talking about?

628
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,084
I'm talking about how...

629
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:32,168
...long a day is when you're alone.

630
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:35,876
Think I don't know about that?

631
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:36,834
Yes!

632
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:38,376
You were in prison, Paul.

633
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:39,751
I was alone.

634
00:54:43,168 --> 00:54:46,793
I wanted you to give us a home,
but you never will.

635
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:51,543
So what makes you so different...

636
00:54:51,584 --> 00:54:54,001
...from any other man I might
want to go to bed with?

637
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:55,543
And don't think I don't
want to go to...

638
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,376
...bed with a man when you're inside.

639
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:59,501
Don't think your friends don't offer.

640
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:06,876
I think you've had too
much to drink.

641
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:08,959
I don't care what you think.

642
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:11,709
I don't care if you don't think.

643
00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:19,626
But you do think.

644
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:23,168
You're the Last of the Big
Thinkers, aren't you?

645
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:28,459
Who's been talking to you?

646
00:55:29,418 --> 00:55:31,043
And there you are.

647
00:55:31,584 --> 00:55:33,293
You start cheating, Paul,
you end up...

648
00:55:33,334 --> 00:55:35,584
...thinking everyone else
is cheating, too.

649
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:40,209
This doesn't help.

650
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:49,293
It helps.

651
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:54,126
It helps a little.

652
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:00,251
How about that?

653
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:04,418
I'm at the stage where
I settle for a little.

654
00:56:05,668 --> 00:56:08,168
You wouldn't settle for a little,
would you, Paul?

655
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:09,418
You're big.

656
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,084
I'm going back to bed.

657
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:16,959
How big are you, Paul?

658
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:19,959
I'm talking about the gun...

659
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,668
...in the drawer, in the bedroom.

660
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:26,751
- What's the gun for, Paul?
- The gun is nothing.

661
00:56:27,459 --> 00:56:28,168
You don't need a gun...

662
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:28,876
...to go straight.

663
00:56:28,876 --> 00:56:30,543
- It's nothing.
- Don't lie, Paul!

664
00:56:30,626 --> 00:56:31,209
- Say it!
- Kate.

665
00:56:31,251 --> 00:56:32,876
You never used to need a gun.

666
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:35,293
- No, you used to---
- SHUT UP!

667
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:05,959
Darling.

668
00:57:07,043 --> 00:57:08,751
You tell me what the gun's for...

669
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:11,376
...and I'll come back to bed.

670
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:22,251
Oh, what's it for, Paul?

671
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:28,084
Because I'm not going back inside.

672
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:30,251
Not again.

673
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:12,168
Dave?

674
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:13,709
There's a grey car coming.

675
00:58:13,793 --> 00:58:14,626
An Austin.

676
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:16,209
SHUT UP!

677
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,459
Shout it from the bloody rooftops.

678
00:58:18,584 --> 00:58:20,543
Be glad when we've got the radios.

679
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,626
- Thanks, Ken.
- How's it going?

680
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:07,501
- I haven't seen those sleeping bags.
- They're in the back of the Austin.

681
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:13,251
KEEP YOUR BLOODY GLOVES ON!!!

682
00:59:32,418 --> 00:59:34,459
I've put the call through
on this line, sir.

683
00:59:35,168 --> 00:59:35,876
Thank you.

684
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:40,251
Hello.

685
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:42,834
Isabella's on her way.

686
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:44,918
And she's well up to weight.

687
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:46,418
Good.

688
01:00:15,168 --> 01:00:16,793
Keep your messages brief.

689
01:00:16,876 --> 01:00:17,501
Remember...

690
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:20,043
...while they're not in use they
can't be traced.

691
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:21,084
Any questions?

692
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:21,543
No.

693
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,168
Yeah, where's the rest
of the crew?

694
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:24,168
They'll be here.

695
01:00:24,251 --> 01:00:25,918
I hope they're not comin' by train!

696
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:28,501
If there are no more...

697
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,709
...serious questions, we'll get
into position.

698
01:01:14,043 --> 01:01:15,126
Is that you, Doctor?

699
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:17,876
"The baby arrived on time and is well up to weight."

700
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:31,918
Come on, come on.

701
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:34,709
We don't move till we get the word.

702
01:01:44,626 --> 01:01:45,626
Here he comes.

703
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:47,418
Hello, Number One. Are you
receiving me? Over.

704
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:49,584
Receiving you, Number Two.

705
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:51,876
I'm in position and clear.

706
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:28,709
Anything from the police?

707
01:04:28,793 --> 01:04:30,001
Just routine.

708
01:04:30,293 --> 01:04:31,543
Gimme the walkie-talkie.

709
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:12,376
Everything all right?

710
01:05:39,418 --> 01:05:42,126
The telephone lines to the houses
have been cut.

711
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:45,418
They should be here to fix the signal
phone any moment.

712
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:48,751
I telephoned our man in Ireland.

713
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:51,001
He'll fly in and pick up our share...

714
01:05:51,043 --> 01:05:52,709
...of the money as soon as
I let him know.

715
01:05:53,668 --> 01:05:55,584
Wish we were going out
with it tonight.

716
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:01,459
Is Kate joining you afterwards?

717
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:28,126
Ben's boys giving you any trouble?

718
01:06:28,668 --> 01:06:30,668
No. They seem to be good workers.

719
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:33,834
You left Robinson back
at the bunker.

720
01:06:34,168 --> 01:06:34,793
Yeah.

721
01:06:35,668 --> 01:06:38,626
He can chew his nails till we get
back with the money.

722
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:42,751
I'll get back to the bridge.

723
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:26,459
Out of sight, down the road.

724
01:08:14,918 --> 01:08:16,584
What do you make of this?

725
01:08:19,584 --> 01:08:21,126
- Bedford.
- Bedford, eh?

726
01:08:21,334 --> 01:08:23,126
What did you put in 'ere?

727
01:08:23,418 --> 01:08:25,709
- It's lovely.
- We all hate it.

728
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,084
It's horrible.

729
01:08:27,126 --> 01:08:28,001
Have some Settlers.

730
01:08:28,168 --> 01:08:30,293
Not me, gives me indigestion.

731
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:47,793
Operator, I've been trying to call
Monarch Oh-One-Oh-Eight...

732
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:49,459
...and it seems to be out of order.

733
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:50,418
Could, could you, um...

734
01:09:50,584 --> 01:09:53,001
...help me, please? It's very,
very important.

735
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:55,084
"Would you hang on a minute, please?"

736
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,168
"Scotland Yard? That Monarch number is..."

737
01:09:58,251 --> 01:09:59,793
"...being called. We are tracing it..."

738
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:02,209
"...but I thought you might be
interested in speaking to the caller."

739
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:03,543
Yes, we're very interested.

740
01:10:03,751 --> 01:10:05,251
Thank you for passing it on.

741
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:09,543
Hello. This is the Exchange Supervisor.

742
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:10,918
Uh, who are you calling?

743
01:10:11,043 --> 01:10:11,751
I'm...

744
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,418
...I've been trying to call
Mrs Robinson.

745
01:10:14,626 --> 01:10:16,501
Monarch Oh-One-Oh-Eight.

746
01:10:16,584 --> 01:10:18,126
And it seems to be out of order.

747
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:19,001
Could you have the line...

748
01:10:19,043 --> 01:10:20,751
...tested for me, please?
It's very urgent.

749
01:10:20,918 --> 01:10:21,918
Yes. Certainly, sir.

750
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:23,293
Uh, what is your number?

751
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:24,834
Well, I'm calling you from...

752
01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:27,251
Hello?

753
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:29,334
Hello, sir.

754
01:10:30,584 --> 01:10:32,209
What number are you speaking from?

755
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,668
She's comin'.

756
01:10:57,459 --> 01:10:58,376
She's comin'.

757
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:00,459
She's comin'.

758
01:11:51,209 --> 01:11:53,209
SHE'S PASSING ME NOW!

759
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,334
Better not be bloody late tonight.

760
01:13:45,293 --> 01:13:47,001
WHAT'S UP, MATE?

761
01:13:47,209 --> 01:13:49,584
HOW LONG YOU GONNA BE HERE?

762
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:51,834
WHAT?

763
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:50,709
What was that?

764
01:14:51,168 --> 01:14:52,209
What was what?

765
01:14:52,501 --> 01:14:54,126
Sounded like air escaping.

766
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,168
Where's our driver?

767
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:40,751
What's the matter?

768
01:15:41,793 --> 01:15:42,959
Different.

769
01:15:43,376 --> 01:15:45,501
It-It won't start.

770
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,709
You were paid to drive!

771
01:15:52,543 --> 01:15:53,584
Get out of it!

772
01:15:58,918 --> 01:16:01,418
Six minutes gone - nineteen
minutes to go.

773
01:16:02,751 --> 01:16:04,168
We're behind schedule.

774
01:16:33,668 --> 01:16:34,543
Start her up...

775
01:16:34,626 --> 01:16:36,376
...and keep going, but slowly.

776
01:17:33,043 --> 01:17:34,376
You can go a bit faster.

777
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:36,543
And keep your eyes out
for a marker.

778
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:38,834
A red marker, further
down the line.

779
01:17:45,376 --> 01:17:46,876
Keep your eyes down!

780
01:17:47,293 --> 01:17:48,751
And stop when I tell you.

781
01:17:48,793 --> 01:17:52,584
And when I say stop, you stop -
or you'll get some more.

782
01:19:45,626 --> 01:19:47,501
What's the chance of getting
some tea?

783
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:48,751
It's coming.

784
01:20:16,209 --> 01:20:17,084
GET DOWN!

785
01:20:17,293 --> 01:20:18,626
ON THE FLOOR!

786
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:21,001
- Get them down.
- ON THE FLOOR!

787
01:20:23,668 --> 01:20:25,209
ALL ON THE FLOOR!

788
01:20:58,793 --> 01:21:00,584
Come on! Outside - into line.

789
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:45,334
Dead on time.

790
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:47,043
How much longer have we got?

791
01:22:47,459 --> 01:22:48,918
About five minutes.

792
01:23:24,376 --> 01:23:25,626
Hold it!

793
01:23:42,668 --> 01:23:43,543
Right!

794
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,543
- Right, that's it. Out!
- There's only a few left!

795
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:02,918
Time's up! Out!

796
01:24:59,251 --> 01:25:00,793
Don't move for half an hour.

797
01:25:00,918 --> 01:25:02,543
We're leaving a man behind.

798
01:25:03,126 --> 01:25:05,001
Anybody moves will be killed.

799
01:25:10,668 --> 01:25:12,709
If you have any trouble - shoot!

800
01:25:51,834 --> 01:25:54,501
No, the mail train hasn't come
through here yet.

801
01:25:55,418 --> 01:25:58,043
Well, if your lights are at red,
it must still be in section.

802
01:25:58,209 --> 01:25:59,543
Mine are all at green.

803
01:26:01,168 --> 01:26:03,209
Yes, everything seems to
be all right here.

804
01:26:04,334 --> 01:26:05,751
All right, I'll check again.

805
01:26:41,543 --> 01:26:42,793
Come on, let's 'ave yer!

806
01:26:47,793 --> 01:26:49,418
Will you put them all in
one pile, please?

807
01:27:12,876 --> 01:27:13,751
Are there any more?

808
01:27:13,751 --> 01:27:15,626
No, only this one down 'ere.

809
01:27:15,709 --> 01:27:17,376
I want one... one at a
time over here...

810
01:27:17,418 --> 01:27:19,334
...and don't open more
than one at a time.

811
01:27:27,001 --> 01:27:29,418
- All right, come on, get in. Up, up.
- That's it.

812
01:27:29,959 --> 01:27:31,376
We'll be back in forty-five minutes.

813
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:33,709
Right, I'll set up something
to occupy the law.

814
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:36,918
You all know where to go.

815
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:39,001
Stick to your routes, and
no speeding.

816
01:27:58,876 --> 01:27:59,959
Hello. Langdon.

817
01:28:00,501 --> 01:28:01,251
Who?

818
01:28:02,668 --> 01:28:04,709
Oh, yeah, yeah. Have they
traced the call?

819
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:07,626
Is that the best they can do?

820
01:28:08,918 --> 01:28:10,709
Yes, I agree. It could be Robinson.

821
01:28:11,751 --> 01:28:13,334
Yeah, I'll get up there straight away.

822
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:17,501
Put them round the back!

823
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,043
Round the back!

824
01:28:46,293 --> 01:28:48,168
Seven thousand pounds,
in new notes.

825
01:28:48,293 --> 01:28:49,626
As agreed.

826
01:28:50,126 --> 01:28:52,334
This calls for a celebration.

827
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:55,168
There shouldn't be any fingerprints
on the vehicles...

828
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:56,876
...but someone may have
been careless.

829
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:01,501
Drink?

830
01:29:02,501 --> 01:29:03,584
No.

831
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,584
Don't worry, Paul...

832
01:29:05,668 --> 01:29:07,084
...I'll have them cleaned up.

833
01:29:07,418 --> 01:29:08,626
When do you want them?

834
01:29:09,709 --> 01:29:11,668
In about three days.
I'll phone you.

835
01:29:12,584 --> 01:29:15,584
It depends when you're pulling
the job, I suppose.

836
01:29:16,668 --> 01:29:18,334
The less you know, the better.

837
01:29:23,834 --> 01:29:25,584
"Hello, Central Four Three?"

838
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:27,668
"Hello, Central Four Three?"

839
01:29:28,043 --> 01:29:29,751
"Urgent message, MP."

840
01:29:30,043 --> 01:29:30,626
"Over."

841
01:29:30,876 --> 01:29:33,543
Central Four Three receiving you,
loud and clear.

842
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:35,626
"Central Four Three..."

843
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:38,001
"...message addressed, Inspector Langdon..."

844
01:29:38,043 --> 01:29:39,001
"...Squad Office"

845
01:29:39,626 --> 01:29:42,043
"Proceed, Partington
Bridge and meet with..."

846
01:29:42,084 --> 01:29:43,501
"...county CID."

847
01:29:43,876 --> 01:29:48,501
- Oh-Seven-Three-Five---"
- What's Langdon doin' up 'ere?

848
01:29:48,543 --> 01:29:49,793
Jack's talked.

849
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:52,293
Jack wouldn't tell a policeman the time.

850
01:29:52,376 --> 01:29:53,501
That's if they can remember it.

851
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:54,668
No one's talked!

852
01:29:55,876 --> 01:29:58,918
The local police called the Squad in.
They're out of their depth.

853
01:29:59,418 --> 01:30:01,626
Come on, Robinson.
Let's be 'avin' yer!

854
01:30:04,168 --> 01:30:05,376
I wanna take her to Paris.

855
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:07,501
- Bless her.
- Yeah.

856
01:30:18,168 --> 01:30:20,709
A hundred thousand pounds
of this is yours.

857
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:23,751
Something wrong with the notes?

858
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:25,751
Some of the fivers are
rejects, of course.

859
01:30:27,209 --> 01:30:28,876
Burn them yourself, along
with the wrappers.

860
01:30:28,918 --> 01:30:29,543
Yeah...

861
01:30:30,084 --> 01:30:31,876
...as soon as I'm through
with this batch.

862
01:30:38,543 --> 01:30:40,043
Still worried about your wife?

863
01:30:41,209 --> 01:30:43,293
Well... if only I could talk with her.

864
01:30:43,668 --> 01:30:46,084
Anyone calling Monarch Oh-One-Oh-Eight
will be traced.

865
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:48,001
They're bound to be tapping the line.

866
01:30:54,043 --> 01:30:55,751
You haven't called her, have you?

867
01:30:56,001 --> 01:30:57,793
I never even got through, Paul.

868
01:30:58,251 --> 01:30:59,876
I-I just wanted to hear her.

869
01:31:01,126 --> 01:31:02,376
Who'd he call?

870
01:31:03,293 --> 01:31:04,168
His wife.

871
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:06,251
Where'd you call her from?

872
01:31:06,376 --> 01:31:08,334
Telephone box, down the lane.

873
01:31:08,501 --> 01:31:09,959
It's a quarter of a mile from here.

874
01:31:10,251 --> 01:31:13,459
I never got through. They couldn't
have known it was me.

875
01:31:14,459 --> 01:31:15,501
What do we do with him?

876
01:31:16,209 --> 01:31:16,876
Leave it.

877
01:31:16,918 --> 01:31:18,626
Paul - listen, please.

878
01:31:19,876 --> 01:31:20,918
You go on checking.

879
01:32:05,918 --> 01:32:08,168
- Can I help you, sir?
- Good morning, yes.

880
01:32:11,043 --> 01:32:12,668
Beg pardon, sir.

881
01:32:12,959 --> 01:32:14,751
- Yes?
- A Mr Langdon.

882
01:32:14,876 --> 01:32:16,168
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

883
01:32:16,293 --> 01:32:17,168
Who are you?

884
01:32:17,251 --> 01:32:18,626
Uh, Inspector Langdon, sir...

885
01:32:18,959 --> 01:32:19,876
...Flying Squad.

886
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:20,751
I see.

887
01:32:20,793 --> 01:32:23,043
That was quick work. How did
you people get to know?

888
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:25,084
Oh, I didn't. I just happened to be
in the neighbourhood.

889
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:26,334
And I got a radio message.

890
01:32:26,376 --> 01:32:27,876
- You're after Robinson, aren't you?
- Ah, yeah.

891
01:32:27,918 --> 01:32:28,918
You're wasting your time.

892
01:32:29,084 --> 01:32:31,626
We traced the call, sent a car to
the box - but he'd gone.

893
01:32:31,793 --> 01:32:34,334
- Oh, well, could you direct me to the---
- Sorry, Inspector...

894
01:32:34,501 --> 01:32:35,959
...hate to appear uncooperative.

895
01:32:36,543 --> 01:32:38,543
Robinson's the least of our
worries right now.

896
01:32:38,584 --> 01:32:39,793
What's the approximate total?

897
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:41,126
Eight hundred thousand pounds.

898
01:32:41,126 --> 01:32:42,543
Now, has anyone informed the GPO?

899
01:32:42,543 --> 01:32:43,251
Yes, sir.

900
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:06,334
"Received, Tango Six. Thank you."

901
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:11,668
Check there's forty-three by
five hundred there.

902
01:33:11,709 --> 01:33:12,459
Right.

903
01:33:14,668 --> 01:33:17,293
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

904
01:33:17,376 --> 01:33:20,251
...one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

905
01:33:29,168 --> 01:33:30,293
Got my pen?

906
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:35,584
---four, five, six, seven. That's right.

907
01:33:48,959 --> 01:33:51,001
Sarge, it's gone up to a million.

908
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:52,334
Take the county apart - every road...

909
01:33:52,334 --> 01:33:53,293
...every deserted house.

910
01:33:53,293 --> 01:33:54,043
And don't forget...

911
01:33:54,043 --> 01:33:55,709
- ...the flying clubs.
- There are two old aerodromes...

912
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:56,751
...a disused watermill.

913
01:33:56,751 --> 01:33:58,626
- Get the mobiles going on that.
- Hello, Zulu Five.

914
01:33:58,626 --> 01:34:00,751
What about, er, what about
the RAF base?

915
01:34:01,793 --> 01:34:03,209
A helicopter might be useful.

916
01:34:03,584 --> 01:34:04,543
That's a good idea.

917
01:34:04,626 --> 01:34:05,626
Get on to the RAF.

918
01:34:16,418 --> 01:34:18,251
What's the matter, boy?
Lose the crown jewels?

919
01:34:18,293 --> 01:34:20,334
- What you carrying?
- Biscuits.

920
01:34:20,709 --> 01:34:21,834
Open up the back.

921
01:34:22,793 --> 01:34:23,918
Who's that?

922
01:34:25,668 --> 01:34:26,834
She's my niece.

923
01:34:27,084 --> 01:34:29,293
Okay, "uncle" - let's look inside.

924
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,459
- Morning, George.
- Morning, guv.

925
01:34:36,084 --> 01:34:37,543
Well, there's a turn-up for the books.

926
01:34:37,918 --> 01:34:38,959
What's the latest score?

927
01:34:39,001 --> 01:34:40,001
About two million.

928
01:34:40,043 --> 01:34:41,876
I told you it would go to
over two million.

929
01:34:42,084 --> 01:34:43,376
Oh, George - this is Mr Watley...

930
01:34:43,376 --> 01:34:44,501
...Post Office Security.

931
01:34:44,543 --> 01:34:46,126
Not the happiest man you'll
meet this morning.

932
01:34:46,376 --> 01:34:47,584
Detective Inspector Langdon.

933
01:34:47,668 --> 01:34:49,668
- You haven't seen Bulstrode, have you?
- Bulstrode?

934
01:34:49,709 --> 01:34:51,251
- Railway Security.
- No.

935
01:34:51,376 --> 01:34:53,834
I shouldn't imagine he's
very happy either.

936
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:55,168
Any luck with Robinson?

937
01:34:55,251 --> 01:34:58,084
I'm not sure. I think I'll go and have a look
around that phone box.

938
01:35:31,626 --> 01:35:33,251
There's a helicopter coming.

939
01:35:36,001 --> 01:35:37,293
I think it's them.

940
01:36:04,334 --> 01:36:05,709
Nail this down, Dave.

941
01:36:11,168 --> 01:36:11,959
Ben.

942
01:37:08,959 --> 01:37:09,959
KEEP CLEAR!

943
01:38:06,126 --> 01:38:07,584
You're right. It is them.

944
01:39:17,793 --> 01:39:19,793
Langdon's coming up here.

945
01:39:20,293 --> 01:39:22,001
Do you think they've fallen for it?

946
01:39:24,251 --> 01:39:25,293
We'll soon know.

947
01:39:46,918 --> 01:39:48,209
- Inspector Langdon?
- Yes.

948
01:39:48,293 --> 01:39:48,959
What have we got?

949
01:39:49,001 --> 01:39:50,126
Oh, they've been here, all right.

950
01:39:50,168 --> 01:39:50,751
We found evidence...

951
01:39:50,793 --> 01:39:52,043
...they spent the night in
one of the huts.

952
01:39:52,168 --> 01:39:53,793
You don't think they might
still be around?

953
01:39:53,918 --> 01:39:54,793
I shouldn't think so, we've...

954
01:39:54,834 --> 01:39:56,418
...covered everything pretty thoroughly.

955
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:57,918
Have you, er...

956
01:39:58,084 --> 01:39:59,543
...searched the rest of the airfield?

957
01:40:00,084 --> 01:40:01,084
Yes, of course.

958
01:40:01,584 --> 01:40:04,126
Will you excuse me, please? I must
get through to Control.

959
01:40:08,751 --> 01:40:10,126
Hello, Alpha Control?

960
01:40:10,293 --> 01:40:12,876
Hello, Alpha Control?
Come in, please. Over.

961
01:40:27,376 --> 01:40:29,209
He's asked for the fingerprint boys.

962
01:40:30,334 --> 01:40:31,834
But he thinks we're away.

963
01:40:32,668 --> 01:40:33,918
Quiet!

964
01:40:35,168 --> 01:40:36,626
There's somebody up there.

965
01:41:41,793 --> 01:41:43,001
May I see your passport, sir?

966
01:41:44,168 --> 01:41:45,001
Thank you.

967
01:41:48,668 --> 01:41:50,793
- Are you going abroad for long, sir?
- Fortnight.

968
01:41:51,626 --> 01:41:53,376
And how much currency are
you carrying?

969
01:41:53,626 --> 01:41:54,751
Ten pounds and...

970
01:41:55,251 --> 01:41:57,251
...hundred pounds in traveller's cheques.

971
01:41:57,876 --> 01:41:58,918
Delayed holiday.

972
01:42:00,584 --> 01:42:01,751
I see, sir.

973
01:42:03,751 --> 01:42:04,834
Thank you, sir.

974
01:42:05,543 --> 01:42:06,418
Thank you.

975
01:42:23,084 --> 01:42:23,668
Just shut up...

976
01:42:23,709 --> 01:42:25,126
...and put your money where your
mouth is. Now, come on.

977
01:42:25,168 --> 01:42:27,001
Actually, you have got a hand like a foot.

978
01:42:27,918 --> 01:42:29,459
It's always been the same.

979
01:42:30,209 --> 01:42:32,251
"And now, over to the news."

980
01:42:32,376 --> 01:42:34,709
"Here's the latest
news on the great train robbery."

981
01:42:34,834 --> 01:42:36,001
"In the two days since the..."

982
01:42:36,043 --> 01:42:37,168
"...train was robbed, police..."

983
01:42:37,251 --> 01:42:39,001
"...have mounted their biggest-ever hunt."

984
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:40,709
"The final total of money missing..."

985
01:42:40,751 --> 01:42:42,168
"...is stated to be at three million..."

986
01:42:42,209 --> 01:42:44,459
"...one hundred and
twenty-seven thousand pounds."

987
01:42:45,043 --> 01:42:47,001
"A police spokesman said earlier today..."

988
01:42:47,043 --> 01:42:48,501
"...that the authorities now believe..."

989
01:42:48,584 --> 01:42:50,668
"...that the gang is no
longer in the neighbourhood."

990
01:42:50,751 --> 01:42:52,418
"No longer in the neighbourhood."
Do you hear that?

991
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:55,043
- So what are we waiting for?
- Let's fetch the transport.

992
01:43:37,126 --> 01:43:39,793
"Pan American Jet Clipper flight two..."

993
01:43:39,918 --> 01:43:43,668
"...to Frankfurt, Vienna, Istanbul, Beirut..."

994
01:43:43,668 --> 01:43:48,293
"...Karachi, Calcutta, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Tokyo..."

995
01:43:48,376 --> 01:43:49,668
"...is now boarding."

996
01:43:49,751 --> 01:43:52,126
"Please have your ticket
envelopes ready for inspection."

997
01:43:52,168 --> 01:43:53,334
Excuse me, sir.

998
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:55,793
STOP THAT MAN!

999
01:44:27,334 --> 01:44:28,834
- Mrs Clifton?
- Yes.

1000
01:44:28,876 --> 01:44:31,168
- Mrs Katherine Mary Clifton?
- Yes.

1001
01:44:31,418 --> 01:44:33,376
I'm a police officer, I have
a warrant to search...

1002
01:44:33,418 --> 01:44:34,959
...these premises. May we come in?

1003
01:44:35,293 --> 01:44:36,251
I'm afraid I'm going to have to...

1004
01:44:36,251 --> 01:44:38,043
- ...call my solicitor.
- Uh, yes, please do.

1005
01:44:38,043 --> 01:44:40,126
But we do have to come in,
if you'll excuse me.

1006
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:48,668
Look I-I wish you'd talk to
my husband.

1007
01:44:48,709 --> 01:44:50,376
We'd like to. Do you know
where he is?

1008
01:44:50,834 --> 01:44:52,959
He left on a business trip,
earlier this morning.

1009
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:55,043
Have you got the keys to the
sideboard drawer?

1010
01:44:55,084 --> 01:44:56,043
My husband has them.

1011
01:44:56,209 --> 01:44:57,209
We'll have to break them open.

1012
01:44:57,209 --> 01:44:59,251
We'll pay for any damage,
of course.

1013
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:01,918
Mrs Clifton?

1014
01:45:03,668 --> 01:45:04,751
We've been watching this house...

1015
01:45:04,751 --> 01:45:06,334
...for the last thirty-six hours.

1016
01:45:06,626 --> 01:45:08,251
We know your husband
hasn't been here at...

1017
01:45:08,293 --> 01:45:10,334
...any time during that period.

1018
01:45:12,001 --> 01:45:13,501
I told you that he left...

1019
01:45:13,584 --> 01:45:14,876
...the house early this morning.

1020
01:45:14,918 --> 01:45:16,376
You probably didn't see him.

1021
01:45:17,418 --> 01:45:19,418
He's been in bed for two
days with a cold...

1022
01:45:19,418 --> 01:45:20,793
...he hasn't left the house.

1023
01:45:22,001 --> 01:45:25,459
Would you be prepared to swear
that on oath, in court?

1024
01:45:25,834 --> 01:45:26,501
Yes.

1025
01:45:38,543 --> 01:45:40,418
- We made it, then!
- Mind how you go.

1026
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:42,126
See you in Monte Carlo.

1027
01:46:37,084 --> 01:46:37,834
Hey!

1028
01:46:40,168 --> 01:46:41,418
Hey, wait a minute.

1029
01:47:05,043 --> 01:47:06,251
Transport's coming.

1030
01:47:09,834 --> 01:47:11,709
STAY OUT OF SIGHT TILL I GIVE
YOU THE CLEAR!

1031
01:47:14,751 --> 01:47:15,626
Let's go!

1032
01:47:15,959 --> 01:47:17,501
But Dave said we had to wait.

1033
01:47:17,543 --> 01:47:19,084
Dave can get stuffed!

1034
01:47:20,168 --> 01:47:22,001
Come on!

1035
01:47:38,418 --> 01:47:39,876
Keep down, wait for the signals!

1036
01:47:39,918 --> 01:47:42,209
Stop playing bloody soldiers.
Come on - out of the way.

1037
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:44,293
Come on, push it up.
Ah, that's it.

1038
01:47:47,001 --> 01:47:49,084
---all day, have we? We got
no time to waste.

1039
01:47:58,668 --> 01:48:00,501
Come on - they're turning off
the runway now.

1040
01:48:02,209 --> 01:48:03,834
Wait for the signal!

1041
01:48:04,334 --> 01:48:05,376
Bye, Dave.

1042
01:48:14,418 --> 01:48:15,668
IT'S THE LAW!

1043
01:49:33,918 --> 01:49:35,334
Money to burn, Dave?

1044
01:49:36,293 --> 01:49:36,876
Yep.

1045
01:49:43,084 --> 01:49:45,168
Central Four Three to all units...

1046
01:49:45,209 --> 01:49:47,001
...detain on sight Paul Clifton.

1047
01:49:47,001 --> 01:49:47,709
Born Birmingham...

1048
01:49:47,751 --> 01:49:49,709
...14th of March, 1929.

1049
01:49:49,834 --> 01:49:51,584
Height six foot, eyes brown...

1050
01:49:51,709 --> 01:49:52,584
...dark complexion.

1051
01:49:52,918 --> 01:49:55,376
CRO number Two-Seven-Two-
Three-Nine-Oh.

1052
01:49:55,418 --> 01:49:57,251
Wanted urgently for questioning...

1053
01:49:57,251 --> 01:49:58,793
...in connection with robbery.

1054
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,834
Approach with caution - this
man may be armed...

1055
01:50:00,834 --> 01:50:02,918
...and is dangerous. Over and out.

1056
01:51:00,084 --> 01:51:02,293
"The men who are alleged to
have robbed the Glasgow-London..."

1057
01:51:02,334 --> 01:51:04,251
"...mail train of a sum in excess of..."

1058
01:51:04,418 --> 01:51:05,501
"...three million pounds..."

1059
01:51:05,668 --> 01:51:07,584
"...made their first appearance in court today..."

1060
01:51:07,834 --> 01:51:09,001
"...charged with robbery."

1061
01:51:09,459 --> 01:51:11,834
"Large crowds had gathered to see the accused arrive..."

1062
01:51:11,959 --> 01:51:13,751
"...in a fleet of police cars..."

1063
01:51:13,918 --> 01:51:16,084
"...and an hour before
the hearing was due to start..."

1064
01:51:16,293 --> 01:51:18,959
"...a strong police guard ringed the court building."

1065
01:51:19,209 --> 01:51:21,126
"All the accused were under heavy escort..."

1066
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:23,251
"...and were only in court for a few minutes."

1067
01:51:23,793 --> 01:51:26,709
"Police objected to bail on
the grounds of the gravity of the case..."

1068
01:51:26,793 --> 01:51:29,584
"...and the fact that much
of the money has not been recovered."

1069
01:51:30,084 --> 01:51:32,793
"All the accused were
remanded in custody for seven days..."

1070
01:51:32,918 --> 01:51:34,459
"...and granted legal aid."

1071
