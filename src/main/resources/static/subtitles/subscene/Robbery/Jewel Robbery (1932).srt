1
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:14,973
Gentlemen, I have the honor
to present Professor Bauman

2
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,043
of the Vienna institute
of electric research.

3
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:19,443
Good morning, Professor!

4
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,446
Professor Bauman
is the inventor

5
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:24,416
of the invisible electric ray
burglar alarm system,

6
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,251
which we have
just installed.

7
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,754
We are going to make
some tests,

8
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,423
so please ignore any alarm
signals which you may hear.

9
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,057
- Thank you, Professor.
- Thank you. Thank you.

10
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:34,626
- You must know, gentlemen...
- Please.

11
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,395
...that our
burglar-proof system

12
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,729
is the most perfect
and unusual

13
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,532
that has yet been designed
by modern science.

14
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,735
Now, in here,
this little bulb --

15
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:45,836
- where?
- Where?

16
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:47,071
- Here. - Oh!
- Oh!

17
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,406
You see?

18
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,208
This little bulb

19
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,345
flashes an electric ray
through this tube,

20
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,648
right into a mirror,
which is hidden here.

21
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,315
- How interesting.
- Back there?

22
00:01:58,316 --> 00:02:02,187
From here, it is reflected
into a second mirror,

23
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,656
which is placed
over there.

24
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,692
There is nothing
to reveal its presence

25
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,533
even to the most skillful
professional burglar

26
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,963
because the electric ray
is invisible to the naked eye.

27
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,263
Uh, just a moment,
sir.

28
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:15,166
I do not wish
to be disturbed.

29
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,401
Anyone attempting to cross
the line would break the ray,

30
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:18,735
the police siren
would sound,

31
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:20,505
and the invisible
flash light

32
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,440
would illuminate
the entire store

33
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,681
with a flood
of piercing light.

34
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:26,376
I'm sorry, but this is
very important, sir!

35
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:28,280
<i>- It can wait.
- It can't wait!</i>

36
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,917
I'm terribly sorry,
Professor. Go ahead.

37
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:35,787
And so, before a thief could
even approach your vault,

38
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,454
the alarm would sound.

39
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,124
Phenomenal! Splendid!

40
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,292
Ah, yes, let us extinguish
the lights,

41
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:43,161
and I will demonstrate
the system.

42
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,430
- But it's too late!
- What's too late?

43
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,301
The store
has just been robbed!

44
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:12,890
Ohh!

45
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,896
Madame is awake.
Hurry. Hurry.

46
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,366
Come! Come!
Hurry! Hurry!

47
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:26,412
Come on. Go on.

48
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,250
Whoop! Whoop!

49
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,752
♪ Ooh, Dee Dee Dee ♪

50
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,087
♪ Dee Dee ♪

51
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,422
♪ Dee, boo ♪

52
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,625
Ohh! My soap!

53
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,925
Yoo-hoo!

54
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,394
Why, hello, Teri.

55
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,794
Good morning, Marianne.

56
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:53,430
Morning?
Afternoon is more like it.

57
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,632
What's the latest news?

58
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,203
Another one of those
sensational jewel robberies.

59
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,537
- Not Hollander’s?
- No -- Straussberger's.

60
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:02,573
"The fashionable
Straussberger's jewelry shop

61
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,409
"in Ringstrasse
was the scene this morning

62
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,911
"of the latest
jewel robbery.

63
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,446
"The thief, described
as a distinguished young man

64
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:09,913
"of fashionable appearance,

65
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,448
"works with a Polish
absolutely foreign

66
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:12,609
to usual
underworld methods."

67
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,953
Oh, my dear, don't give me
a shock like that again.

68
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,354
What is it, Teri?

69
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:17,756
Just as I had my finger
beautifully prepared

70
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,457
for the excelsior diamond,
I had visions

71
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,326
of it being carried away
by a band of criminals.

72
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,487
- The excelsior?
- Diamond --

73
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,761
the one that you and I went
into such raptures about.

74
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:26,364
- Franz is giving it to me.
- Oh, my dear!

75
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,499
He's meeting me
at Hollander’s at 5:00.

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,268
I want you
to come along.

77
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,403
- The famous excelsior diamond!
- Yes!

78
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:35,207
Imagine having a husband
like yours,

79
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:39,410
who would gladly spend a fortune
just to make you happy.

80
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,546
You are a lucky girl,
Teri.

81
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,715
<i>- Don't you think so?
- I did think so.</i>

82
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,083
For a month, marriage
was thrilling and exciting.

83
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:47,417
- Then it became dull.
- What?

84
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:48,753
Unbearably dull.

85
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:49,554
Good gracious!

86
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,790
Married to 8 millions?

87
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,458
Aged 55,
with chronic gout.

88
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:55,794
- Please.
- Turn over.

89
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,962
No, thank you.

90
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,465
But for your lovers,
you may have your choice --

91
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,633
cabinet ministers, diplomats,
men of affairs.

92
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:04,602
When a man achieves
the distinction

93
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,369
of a red sash
across his shirtfront,

94
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,240
his chest, my dear, is the most
important part of his anatomy.

95
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,647
But the young attachés
of the diplomatic corps,

96
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,316
the military cadets --

97
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,350
are all thinking
too much of their future

98
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,619
to risk making love to the wife
of a man of Franz's importance.

99
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,821
Oh, for a knight who will
come riding in full armor,

100
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:26,358
sweep me into his arms,
and carry me away!

101
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,994
A knight who would gaze
into my eyes

102
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,431
and whisper passionately
that they were green,

103
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,933
like priceless emeralds

104
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,600
that he would gladly give
his life to possess.

105
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,236
But they are
not green.

106
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,472
They are blue.
Not emeralds. Sapphires.

107
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,239
Sapphires --
my first love.

108
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,210
- And your latest?
- Diamonds. White, pure, cold.

109
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,511
Virginal. And men?

110
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,979
I haven't found one
to supplant my jewels.

111
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,481
But Andre will be here
at any moment

112
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,847
to take it
to Hollander’s.

113
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,248
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
Hurry, please.

114
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:57,055
The more haste,
the less speed, madame.

115
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,537
May I clear out
the window, Mr. Hollander?

116
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,537
Is it so late?

117
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:14,339
Almost closing time.

118
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:16,708
- But so light out.
- The long summer days.

119
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,576
The baroness
will soon be here

120
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,411
to take number 239.

121
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,583
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

122
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,116
Mr. Hollander?

123
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:27,552
Yes?

124
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,520
I have the honor
to present myself --

125
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,588
night watchman
Johan Christian Lenz

126
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:33,525
of the Vienna
protective agency.

127
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,193
I've never
seen you before.

128
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,962
That is why I'm presenting
my credentials.

129
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:40,597
I have been guarding
the national bank.

130
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:43,636
Hmm. That's not such
a fine recommendation.

131
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:47,304
My contract said I was
to watch out for burglars,

132
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:49,239
not directors.

133
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,708
Lenz is nobody's fool.

134
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:52,943
Mr. Hollander...

135
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:55,746
I don't like that aspersion
on my ability.

136
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,849
I am one of the agency's
best men.

137
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,217
So?

138
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,585
That is why I was sent here
to Ringstrasse.

139
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,787
There's been
too many robberies lately.

140
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,323
We must put a stop to it.

141
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,924
Good, good.

142
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:09,794
I shall breathe easier
now that you are here.

143
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:10,635
Thank you.
Thank you.

144
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:13,164
The window is ready
to be locked.

145
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,898
The door can wait.

146
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,602
I'll be here until 7:00 tonight,
on a special appointment.

147
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,806
Don't worry. I shall look in
every half-hour.

148
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:23,674
When Lenz guards a place,

149
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:25,510
the owners
can sleep peacefully.

150
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,177
So long.

151
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:28,979
I say thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

152
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,513
Ah, the great
baroness Horhenfels.

153
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:31,549
- I beg your pardon.
- And madame horn.

154
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,650
Good evening.

155
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,352
Good evening,
count Andre.

156
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,587
- Leopold, three, please.
- Yes, sir.

157
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,523
W-we've been expecting you,
baroness.

158
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,823
And how is the baron?

159
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,391
Oh, he's quite well,
thank you.

160
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,960
I only hope he doesn't keep us
waiting too long.

161
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,862
Oh, look -- all of the dear,
little jewels

162
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,864
going virtuously to bed
for papa.

163
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,633
Their papa prefers them
less virtuous.

164
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,734
There's no profit
in sleeping at home.

165
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:51,936
I must remember that.

166
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,470
Oh, come, madame.
Come.

167
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:54,972
- Mr. Hollander?
- Yes?

168
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:56,211
Oh!

169
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:02,612
Thank you, Leopold.
You may go. I'll lock up.

170
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:04,381
Thank you, sir.

171
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:05,850
Good night, baroness, madame,
your excellency.

172
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:07,518
Marianne,
I can hardly wait.

173
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,153
Oh, Teri,
compose yourself.

174
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:10,354
- The lights flare up.
- The ring appears.

175
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,388
There should be music.

176
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:12,189
Ah!

177
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,359
The famous
excelsior diamond.

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,493
Oh, it's ducky,
isn't it?

179
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,861
It's too beautiful.

180
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,129
The new setting
pleases you?

181
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,629
What perfection!

182
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,866
Such brilliancy,
such depth.

183
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,734
There's something
of the infinite in it.

184
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:25,737
I would think so, too,
if you'd only let me see it.

185
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,972
- There!
- I'm not going to steal it from you.

186
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,041
Just look at it.

187
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,076
Please, please,
please, please.

188
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:35,278
28 carats.

189
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,148
Really, Teri,
you must tell me your secret.

190
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,282
4 carats is the best
I've been able to do,

191
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:40,618
and that had
a flaw in it.

192
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,353
What wouldn't a woman do
for such a treasure?

193
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,724
Oh, anything. I'd deceive
my husband, with pleasure.

194
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,792
A woman would do
much more than that.

195
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,393
<i>She would tolerate her husband.</i>

196
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,863
One? A dozen.

197
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,134
Oh, take it away quickly,
or I'll swallow it!

198
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:58,836
- Oh, Mr. Hollander?
- Yes, madame?

199
00:08:58,837 --> 00:08:59,970
What is the price now?

200
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,138
- $50,000.
- Oh, $50,000.

201
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,175
Do you know
what I object to most?

202
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,676
No. What?

203
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:07,177
Her own husband
is buying it for her.

204
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,114
Imagine getting hold
of a prize like that

205
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,781
in such
a respectable fashion.

206
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:13,850
Oh, it's disgraceful.
Her own husband!

207
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:16,553
And here he is!

208
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,189
I'm sorry I'm late,

209
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,990
but I met our distinguished
undersecretary of state

210
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:22,927
walking along in distracted
fashion in front of Palheim's,

211
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,729
so I brought him
along with me.

212
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,797
Hardly the thing
for a cabinet officer.

213
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,300
Ah, my darling, I...

214
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,302
Ah, here it is.

215
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,423
- Very becoming, too.
- Yes.

216
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:35,806
Well, it's not as large
as I expected it to be.

217
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,508
Not as large?

218
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:38,942
28 carats.

219
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:40,612
What on earth
did you expect, Franz --

220
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,779
- the rock of Gibraltar?
- I don't know.

221
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,715
He won't buy it.

222
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:45,749
What are you asking
for it -- $30,000?

223
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,151
It's all over.

224
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,418
- $50,000.
- $50,000?

225
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,287
I was just about to say
it's hardly worth $20,000!

226
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,523
Oh, Andre, quickly, tell him
what a fine stone it is!

227
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:54,158
Yes.

228
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,094
- Oh, you've had a look at it, Andre?
- Oh, many times.

229
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,862
It's a friend
of 20-year standing.

230
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,062
Will you please
tell the baron

231
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,663
what a bargain
he's getting at $50,000?

232
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:01,904
$50,000 is out
of the question.

233
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,667
But I couldn't
let it go for less.

234
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,503
Well, you know your
own business best.

235
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,672
Teri?

236
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,707
Not going to buy it?

237
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,276
- Sorry, dear.
- But you promised.

238
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:14,778
Oh, you're missing
a great bargain.

239
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,846
Let me get you
the expert's appraisal.

240
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:19,019
In the original bill from
Louis Toone from Amsterdam,

241
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,485
you will see exactly
what it cost me.

242
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:25,558
I'll be back
in a moment.

243
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:31,561
Teri, I despair of ever making
a businesswoman of you.

244
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:33,966
You're going to buy it!

245
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,836
But not at his price.
He'll take less.

246
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:41,272
- Won't he, Andre?
- Well, the poor devil needs cash.

247
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,139
- Then we'll do even better.
- Ohh!

248
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,843
Now, it's silly
to be sentimental.

249
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,311
If our positions
were reversed,

250
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,112
he'd drive the hardest bargain
he could.

251
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:50,848
You use what weapons you can
to get money --

252
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,749
against a rich man,
a revolver...

253
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,219
Against a poor one,
his poverty.

254
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,585
Am I right, Paul?

255
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:56,386
Of course.

256
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,556
We diplomats, too,
are only effective

257
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,495
when we have power
and use it.

258
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:04,295
Franz?

259
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,196
Yes?

260
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,730
How much are you willing
to pay?

261
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:09,667
- $30,000.
- You'll get it.

262
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,835
Good night.

263
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,902
You going already?

264
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,271
I've served my purpose.

265
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,872
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye.

266
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:16,374
I hope this new acquisition
brings you

267
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,215
a woman's most cherished need --
a new thrill.

268
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,845
Oh, Andre. Goodbye.

269
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,947
Goodbye, Teri.

270
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,649
I had trouble
finding the bill.

271
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,284
Here it is,
in black and white.

272
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:28,987
From Louis Toone
in Amsterdam --

273
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,422
in black and white, yes, yes.
Let's go into the office.

274
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:32,755
Yes. Yes.

275
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:34,197
You stay.

276
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,497
Please.

277
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:42,700
Why didn't you meet me
at Palheim's for tea?

278
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,234
I forgot.

279
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,768
45 minutes I stood
in front of that restaurant.

280
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,845
I'm sorry. Ohh!

281
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,612
You're a coquette.

282
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,845
Sometimes.

283
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,815
But with you,
I've been strangely honest.

284
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,783
The moment I realized
that I'd made a mistake,

285
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,118
that you weren't
a dream hero --

286
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:02,920
I have 12 war medals
for bravery.

287
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,822
And haven't I seen them,
over and over?

288
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,624
I say,
as soon as I realized --

289
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,359
there was some disappointment
on my side, too.

290
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,263
Well, then, how easy it should
be for us to say goodbye.

291
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,624
I'm not a schoolboy that you can
throw over with a gesture.

292
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,234
<i>What is the right way
to throw you over?</i>

293
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,637
I'm not going to
be thrown over at all.

294
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,872
I'm going to marry you.

295
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,773
You know my husband,
I believe.

296
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:26,311
Of course, Teri, but when
as fine a woman as you --

297
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,978
I'm not a fine woman.

298
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,080
In my own eyes,
I'm shallow and weak.

299
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,282
Why?

300
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,149
Because I go on leading
a shallow and weak life.

301
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,153
Whereas with a little courage,
I could break away from it.

302
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,955
I have all the qualities
to make quite a decent person.

303
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,490
And what have I done
with them?

304
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:44,827
I fly about all day, pursuing
furs, jewels, excitement.

305
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:46,397
I don't love.

306
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,532
I don't even suffer -- that is,
anything except boredom.

307
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,969
In the morning, a cocktail,
in the afternoon, a man,

308
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,104
in the evening, veronal.

309
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:57,975
That, my dear minister of state,
is my picture of your Teri.

310
00:12:57,976 --> 00:12:59,343
Is it too high?

311
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,711
What on earth?

312
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,147
I took stock of myself when
I decided to break with you.

313
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:04,949
- This is the result.
- But, Teri --

314
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,484
oh, it won't be lasting --

315
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,152
just the passionate,
fleeting desire

316
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,988
that my life should be
clear, simple, and pure,

317
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,423
like that stone.

318
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,692
What you've just said
convinces me more than ever

319
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,695
that you need me
as a husband.

320
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,364
Oh, Paul.

321
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,066
Congratulations, madame.

322
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,566
- All settled?
- We compromised.

323
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:24,735
I accepted his offer.

324
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,737
And here it is.

325
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:27,905
Lambie!

326
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:30,249
Oh!

327
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,549
By all means.

328
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,119
Good evening.

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,887
Good evening.

330
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,287
Anything
I can do for you?

331
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,123
I'm sorry to intrude
at this late hour.

332
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:48,124
Oh, its perfectly
all right.

333
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,494
Well, then, will you kindly
put up your hands?

334
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,330
Ohh!

335
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,830
All of you.

336
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:57,567
I'll shoot
anyone who moves.

337
00:13:57,568 --> 00:14:00,706
Proceed, gentlemen.

338
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,081
Never mind the lady.

339
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,715
I think I'm going to faint.

340
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,783
There's no reason
why you should, madame.

341
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:15,519
You're really
very safe here.

342
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,192
Sorry.

343
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,692
Wha--

344
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:24,327
oh, wh-what are you
and your men doing?

345
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:25,330
With your permission,
Mr. Hollander,

346
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,763
we're robbing
your shop.

347
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,599
Ohh. Police!

348
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,167
Ohh.

349
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,848
Uh, gentlemen, will you
be seated, please?

350
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,437
I prefer to stand.
I won't attack you.

351
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:38,245
That's reassuring, but
I'd rather you were seated.

352
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,747
I don't like strangers
looking over my shoulder.

353
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,883
I wish they'd pass a rule
like that at my bridge club.

354
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,484
<i>- This is preposterous. Something should be done.
- You do it.</i>

355
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:50,186
I am unfamiliar
with the procedure

356
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:51,389
under the circumstances.

357
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,295
Henry.

358
00:14:58,296 --> 00:14:59,964
<i>Don't forget you're handling
our property now.</i>

359
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,405
That's right, sir!
I was forgetting!

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,702
Do be a bit careful,
won't you?

361
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:07,338
Don't bother to look
after the police.

362
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,675
My chauffeur will attend
to that for you.

363
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:15,245
Oh, by the way, Mr. Hollander,
are you insured?

364
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:16,180
Yes.

365
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,341
- For the whole value?
- Yes.

366
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,216
Well, then,
why look so tragic?

367
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:22,619
Be happy that, in these
unspeakably bad times,

368
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,888
I'm turning your merchandise
into cash for you.

369
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,623
But I have
so many old pieces.

370
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:28,624
I'll never be able to assemble
such a stock again.

371
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,327
Subtle bit of business.
That's old-fashioned.

372
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:35,098
Can't you do something
to liven up our little party,

373
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:36,735
baroness Horhenfels?

374
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:39,537
You know me?

375
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,571
<i>I know all the people
who own unusual jewelry --</i>

376
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,452
one of the elementary
requirements of my trade.

377
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,609
Won't you chat, please?

378
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,909
Chat?

379
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,150
Yes, chat --
uh, airy nothings.

380
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,513
Can't you smile a little?

381
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,954
You look so charming
when you smile.

382
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,618
This is a joke,
isn't it?

383
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,851
Joke?

384
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:56,186
You're
not really a thief.

385
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,888
"Thief"?
That's an ugly word.

386
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,791
Uh, let's say "robber."

387
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,191
What's the distinction?

388
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:03,826
Well, there's more flavor
to "robber."

389
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:06,227
We're in the most exclusive
jewelry shop in the Ringstrasse.

390
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,566
In robbing
a place of this sort,

391
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,802
one must have
a drawing-room technique.

392
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,235
And this, I find,
always helps

393
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:14,205
to make the atmosphere
more congenial.

394
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,173
And nothing like music
to keep people

395
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,441
from doing rash things
in a moment like this.

396
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:22,146
Now, may I disturb you
a moment?

397
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,747
Thank you.

398
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:26,418
Oh, isn't that beautiful?

399
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,821
South Africa
or Sumatra?

400
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:32,122
- Sumatra.
- Mm.

401
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:33,990
Cut by Schindhelm
in Amsterdam.

402
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,292
Yes.

403
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:36,594
You have exquisite taste,
Mr. Hollander.

404
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,628
Thank you.

405
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,109
That's why I'm paying you
this visit.

406
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:52,142
You're just
a common thief.

407
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,377
"Robber."

408
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:54,644
Your face
is vaguely familiar.

409
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,213
I've seen you
somewhere before.

410
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,386
Possibly.
What are your clubs?

411
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:03,287
- I'm beginning to place you.
- Oh?

412
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,288
It was
at some polo game.

413
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,556
Now, at what polo game
have I been

414
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:08,225
where there was
a robbery?

415
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,227
My dear minister,
if it was at a polo match,

416
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,063
I was playing.

417
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,103
Uh,
will please say, "ah"?

418
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:15,231
Mm.

419
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:18,805
No. Say, uh,
"ninety-nine."

420
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,637
Ninety-nine.

421
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:24,141
Thank you.

422
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:26,550
"From Teri."

423
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,252
Now, uh, may I
disturb you again?

424
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:37,654
Thank you.

425
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,124
That's a very becoming dress
you're wearing.

426
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,557
I'm not sure
I wouldn't like you better

427
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:44,161
in blue --
a deep, lovely blue.

428
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,096
It would just match
your eyes.

429
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:49,400
Has everyone ever told you that
your eyes are like sapphires?

430
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,535
Apparently, conversation doesn't
interfere with your work.

431
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:54,070
No, not at all.
On the contrary, it calms.

432
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:55,506
It dissipates all fear.

433
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,941
Notice how calm
you've all become.

434
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,942
Terror has vanished from
the scene of the robbery.

435
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,079
All quiet, sir.

436
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,614
The girls
are doing beautifully --

437
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,216
not a policeman
within 10 blocks.

438
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:07,617
Splendid, splendid.

439
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:09,452
Whenever we stage
an event of this kind,

440
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:12,092
we always place a very alluring
blonde on each corner.

441
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,304
So we never have to worry
about the police.

442
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,704
Effective,
don't you think?

443
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,239
This is becoming
delightful.

444
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,874
The lady is pleased?
I am glad.

445
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,976
He doesn't need
your encouragement.

446
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,377
But it helps.

447
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:36,146
Oh, you must admit
the situation's unusual.

448
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:38,781
And the operation
practically painless.

449
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:41,419
You see now the advantage of
suiting the method to the place?

450
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,320
The customary technique
of terrorism

451
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,988
would certainly
not have amused you.

452
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:47,290
As it is, the lady has smiled,
the gentlemen are at ease,

453
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,758
and we shall even have time

454
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,927
to take a lot of the gold
and silver.

455
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,329
That's very accommodating.

456
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,631
I'm learning a lot
from you.

457
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,232
Now,
that's a real tribute.

458
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,934
That's the first time
I've ever known my husband

459
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:00,772
to admit that he could learn
anything from anybody.

460
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:04,275
He's going to learn
something from me someday.

461
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,436
I wouldn't provoke him,
Paul.

462
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,278
He doesn't get a chance to shoot
a cabinet minister every day.

463
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,780
He's comparatively safe.

464
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:12,982
I do very little shooting
these days.

465
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,751
As a matter of fact,

466
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,854
I'm opposed to the American
school of banditry.

467
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,255
I studied in Paris.

468
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:19,588
You have to work harder,
but you do acquire

469
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,490
a certain finesse
that is missing

470
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,360
from the "stick 'em up
and shoot them down" school.

471
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,863
And note this, too --
no mess, no confusion.

472
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,164
A new stock can be moved in
tomorrow.

473
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:31,235
No bankruptcy lawyer ever
cleared out a place more tidily.

474
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,502
For which
I must thank you all.

475
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,238
You have cooperated
beautifully.

476
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:37,941
Protective agency
coming, sir.

477
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,110
Thank heavens.

478
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,778
Sit down.

479
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,779
- If you move --
- I-I'm not moving.

480
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,348
It's marvelous how you respond
to suggestion.

481
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:47,416
- Now, one last favor, yes?
- Yes.

482
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,719
When the watchman enters,

483
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,820
just talk to him calmly
and leisurely.

484
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,556
Tell him that you still have
half an hour's work to do.

485
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:54,725
- You understand?
- Yes.

486
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,460
- "I have some more work to do. Come
back in a half an hour." - Right.

487
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,828
And none of you should find it
difficult to be calm

488
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:00,364
with my revolver
pointed at you.

489
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,699
And now let's talk

490
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,435
so our good friend
won't be troubled.

491
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:07,304
Do you tango, madame?

492
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:08,873
There's nothing
like a tango

493
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,708
to bring people
closer together.

494
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,178
Well, here I am,
Mr. Hollander.

495
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,027
Time, tide, and Lenz
can always be depended upon.

496
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,193
A little too early.

497
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:33,864
I still have some work to do.

498
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,533
Come back in an hour.

499
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,814
Half an hour, Mr. Hollander.
Half an hour will be enough.

500
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,738
Oh, yes.
Half an hour.

501
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,538
As you say.

502
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,241
Huh.
All the goods put away.

503
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:49,813
Yes.
Every last piece.

504
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:51,847
That's fine.

505
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:54,416
Much better than to let things
lie around all night.

506
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,452
You might be my echo.

507
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,387
Always be suspicious.

508
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:00,923
Don't be fooled
by anybody.

509
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,425
Anything strange --

510
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,528
if it ain't more
than a mouse's whisker --

511
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,929
call the police.

512
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,565
There's a man for you.

513
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,399
From the Vienna protective
agency, aren't you?

514
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,834
That's right.

515
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:12,169
I could tell.

516
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,270
- May I ask a favor?
- Surely, sir.

517
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:16,940
You may have noticed my car
standing in front of the shop.

518
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:18,621
Would you mind
carrying out those two bags

519
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,177
and putting them in?

520
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,115
- With pleasure, sir.
- Thank you.

521
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,754
Say! They're not filled
with feathers, are they?

522
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,587
I should say not.
Gold.

523
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:34,423
Gold? Oh, I see.

524
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:36,294
Taking it away
to have it melted.

525
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,961
Yes, tomorrow,
the whole lot gets melted.

526
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:42,098
<i>Well, I'm glad to see somebody
in Vienna's doing business.</i>

527
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,099
Good night, Mr. Hollander.

528
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:45,702
Good night.

529
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:47,637
And you won't move
away from this car

530
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:49,306
until I come out,
will you?

531
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:52,476
When I watch, I watch.

532
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:56,446
Lenz is nobody's fool.

533
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:00,116
Please?

534
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,661
No, no,
no, no, no.

535
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,662
Well,
I must bow to that.

536
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,462
- Thank you.
- Delicious.

537
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:15,598
<i>Thank you, but
I've done even better.</i>

538
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,402
- Once in Paris --
- it's getting late, sir.

539
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,403
Oh, yes.

540
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:22,573
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

541
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,045
Mr. Hollander, do smoke
one of my cigarettes.

542
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,712
With pleasure.

543
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,914
Now, inhale deeply.

544
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,817
Thank you.

545
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,818
Yes, in Paris once,
as I started to tell you,

546
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,953
I carried away a case of gold
in broad daylight,

547
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,089
and 12 gendarmes
accompanied my motor.

548
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,159
Nothing like having
the help of the police.

549
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Mere bravado.

550
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,097
Not at all.

551
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:50,299
<i>I don't fancy your method
of buying the authorities.</i>

552
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,820
- That's a lie.
- Come on, now, baron.

553
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:54,238
We know that you bankers
keep governments

554
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,538
in your
waistcoat pockets.

555
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,673
- You're a communist.
- I'm not a communist.

556
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,875
Go right on smoking,
Mr. Hollander.

557
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:00,911
Never mind us.

558
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,912
Oh, the present order
of society

559
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:04,847
is entirely satisfactory
to me.

560
00:23:04,848 --> 00:23:07,182
You think I should do as well
for myself under communism?

561
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:10,087
What should I steal?
Power plants? Grain elevators?

562
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:17,194
International finance
takes brains.

563
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,299
<i>He's not laughing at you, baron.</i>

564
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,735
It's just life you're laughing
at, Mr. Hollander, isn't it?

565
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:27,537
If you're so clever,

566
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:29,573
why not come around to my office
someday, and I'll try you out?

567
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,708
I couldn't take that chance.
You're a banker.

568
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,211
You might not be honest
with me.

569
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:36,048
What's so funny?!

570
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:45,221
Drop him on the sofa,
then out the back.

571
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:48,424
What did you give him?

572
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:49,992
A pleasant,
harmless smoke.

573
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,894
He'll awake in the morning,
fresh and happy,

574
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:53,065
with a marvelous appetite.

575
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,533
<i>- Gentlemen.
- I am smoking. Thanks.</i>

576
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:58,036
I only smoke cigars.

577
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:01,237
Well, then, perhaps
you will be kind enough

578
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:02,739
to step into the safe.

579
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,707
No.

580
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,541
To my everlasting regret,

581
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,146
I am going to be forced
to lock you in.

582
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:19,323
Don't be depressed.
It isn't for life.

583
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,524
The cells are --
uh, the safes

584
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,962
are comfortable
and electrically lighted.

585
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,442
And now, madame,
with which gentleman

586
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,969
would you prefer
to share a safe?

587
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,170
I prefer not to be locked up
at all, with either of them.

588
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:35,838
Very diplomatic.

589
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,274
In that case, we lock
the gentlemen up together.

590
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,475
If you please,
gentlemen.

591
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,677
Let me tell you
something.

592
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,210
If you let us go now,
I'll try

593
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,712
and get you off
with a light sentence,

594
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,146
but if you lock us up,
that's legal assault,

595
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,816
and I'll see to it
that you get the limit.

596
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,550
I'm sorry
to have to interrupt.

597
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:48,550
You can finish your speech
in the safe.

598
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:49,618
Darling!

599
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:50,419
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

600
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:52,322
Don't let him
frighten you, Teri.

601
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,161
The evening paper, sir!

602
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,995
Now to dispose of you.

603
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:02,164
What are you
going to do to me?

604
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:04,173
No.

605
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,679
- Well, then, a cigarette.
- No!

606
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,147
Oh, but they're
harmless, really.

607
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:20,083
Two puffs, and you'll
be hearing soft music.

608
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,318
The world will begin
to revolve pleasantly.

609
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,453
No.

610
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:24,887
Three,
a beautiful dream.

611
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:26,556
How do you know
all this?

612
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:29,092
Experience. I assure you, all
the ladies fall asleep happily.

613
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:31,662
Oh. So you can steal their
jewels in peace, I suppose.

614
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,229
I'm sorry.
I won't take it.

615
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,364
I don't want to
have to force you.

616
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:36,732
I won't take it.

617
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,134
You're adamant?

618
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:42,072
I prefer to keep my wits
about me, thank you.

619
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,779
I had a feeling
you'd be stubborn.

620
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:59,722
I'm not trying to amuse you,
but to make a clean getaway.

621
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:01,258
Would you rather I gag you?

622
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,499
Why must you do
anything to me?

623
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,229
I have no particular desire
to see you arrested.

624
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,730
Thank you.

625
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:09,231
You've given me
a very exciting 10 minutes.

626
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:10,834
It will make me
the center of interest

627
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,469
at teas and dinners
for weeks to come.

628
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,737
But think how much more
interesting your story will be

629
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:15,939
if I brutally gag you.

630
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,574
It's a much better story
if I could say

631
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,855
that you locked the gentlemen
in the safe and dashed out.

632
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,778
Well, you don't actually
have to dash.

633
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,819
Then everyone will ask you
why you didn't call out.

634
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,949
That will make you an accomplice
after the fact.

635
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,522
Ooh!
That's even more thrilling.

636
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:37,326
I'm afraid we're losing sight
of the main object.

637
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:39,595
Oh, no, no, please.
Please don't hurt my lips.

638
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:40,764
Everyone says my lips --

639
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,699
are heavenly.

640
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,535
You're so lovely.

641
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,370
It's hard
to be brutal with you.

642
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,172
You do strike a fresh note.

643
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:52,415
<i>Up to now, men have always been
brutal because I am lovely.</i>

644
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:00,549
Please. The safe.

645
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,251
Certainly.

646
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:04,325
Thank heavens.

647
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,459
Please?

648
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,593
- With pleasure.
- Thank you.

649
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,193
If you'll come with me.

650
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,962
What?

651
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:14,864
What do you expect me
to do in there alone?

652
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:16,767
Madame,
this is business.

653
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,067
I refuse the safe.

654
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:19,435
Well,
then come with me.

655
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:22,137
I'll drop you somewhere
in the suburbs, untouched.

656
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:25,174
Untouched in the suburbs?
Oh, no.

657
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:27,110
No, that doesn't
intrigue me at all.

658
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:29,412
I'm afraid you'll just
have to let me go free here.

659
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,948
<i>- No, no, that's the last thing I can do.
- But why?</i>

660
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:34,785
I assure you I have no interest
in having you arrested.

661
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,487
The man in me
would like to believe you.

662
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,720
The robber
is more cynical.

663
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:39,422
I give you my word.

664
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:40,457
No.

665
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,258
I don't lie.
My hand on it.

666
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,429
Your hand.

667
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,169
Oh! Oh, my ring!

668
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:54,636
Ohh!

669
00:27:54,637 --> 00:27:56,715
Oh.

670
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:08,117
Oh, it would have been
a pity to miss this.

671
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:10,120
Now, don't bend your finger.
It may hurt.

672
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,256
You shouldn't put obstacles
in the way

673
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,289
of a man trying
to earn his living.

674
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,760
Oh. Marvelous.

675
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,332
How intimate.

676
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,333
You hurt me.

677
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,668
Aw, no, no.

678
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,068
Are you really going to
steal my ring?

679
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:28,738
Yes,
but only as a memento,

680
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:30,259
a souvenir of the lady
who was willing

681
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,342
to share a safe with me.

682
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,310
That's not true.
I didn't mean that.

683
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:37,314
No, but you did mean the slap,
didn't you?

684
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,283
You know, I'd have allowed
more time for this robbery

685
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:41,951
if I'd known you
to be here.

686
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:45,998
I'm almost tempted
to kiss you.

687
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:58,235
I-I'm afraid
you might scream.

688
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,273
And...

689
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:13,283
Ah. Here.
H-here you are, sir.

690
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,651
Ah, splendid.

691
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,220
With the compliments of the
Vienna protective agency --

692
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:20,190
not a loss to an investor
in 38 years.

693
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,225
Oh, no,
I couldn't, sir.

694
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:24,760
Come, an honest day's pay
for an honest day's work.

695
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,300
Thank you, sir.

696
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,467
Cigarette?

697
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:32,602
Thank you, sir.

698
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:33,769
Just keep the box.

699
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,372
Oh, thank you, sir!

700
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:38,426
I'll smoke them later.

701
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,267
What is the matter, sir?

702
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:05,969
- Another robbery!
- Where?

703
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,304
Out in the shops,
the Ringstrasse!

704
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:11,441
These robberies are becoming
increasingly daring!

705
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:14,443
It is essential that we leave
no stone unturned

706
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:17,614
to apprehend this criminal
and his possible accomplices!

707
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,784
A man comes out of
nowhere, flourishing a revolver.

708
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,819
To Teri, such a man
is not an enemy to society,

709
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,489
but a romantic figure.

710
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,223
I must work hard to acquire
wealth, devise shrewdly,

711
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,625
think clearly, outwit men.

712
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,326
But that doesn't
make me interesting,

713
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,195
- does it, my darling?
- No, dear.

714
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:34,797
No, but this man, perfectly safe
behind his revolver...

715
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:36,432
Safe? I'm glad I'm not
in his shoes.

716
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:38,101
Teri will soon
have a chance

717
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,970
to see how debonair he is
wearing handcuffs.

718
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,238
Yeah.

719
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,739
- Oh, here they are.
- Hello, Teri.

720
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,406
- What's the matter, Franz?
- Teri will tell you.

721
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:46,675
- I'm so glad you've come.
- Well, what's happened?

722
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:47,710
Something thrilling.

723
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:48,511
What is it, Paul?

724
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:50,212
There was a holdup
in the jewelry shop.

725
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:51,515
- What?!
- Just after you left.

726
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,615
Oh, how exciting!

727
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:53,696
We were locked
in the safe.

728
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:55,485
Teri was left alone
with the robber.

729
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,587
The police aren't satisfied
with her statement.

730
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:59,588
<i>Oh, they are silly to expect
a woman to tell the truth</i>

731
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:01,825
about what happened when
she was alone with a man.

732
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:02,991
Imagine!

733
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,361
That's the order
of the day --

734
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,894
be attracted
to a criminal!

735
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:08,998
Any man who doesn't bathe daily
and who has a police record

736
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,333
becomes a hero.

737
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,101
The courtrooms are crowded
with women.

738
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:13,502
A man that does
some shooting,

739
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:15,438
and half the women
forget their husbands.

740
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:17,140
And if he happens
to have married

741
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,308
a girl or two on the side,
he becomes a national hero.

742
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:20,809
You're quite right.

743
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,911
<i>What did happen, Teri?</i>

744
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,579
- I fainted.
- She didn't.

745
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,981
<i>You also believe that I let
the robber go free?</i>

746
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:28,518
You let him go because
you're incurably romantic.

747
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,385
He evidently extracted
a promise from you

748
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:33,456
to keep quiet if he didn't lock
you up in the other safe,

749
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,725
and you were so touched
by his consideration

750
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,326
that you kept your word.

751
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:39,162
I've noticed that women
keep their word

752
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,683
only with men
they'll never see again.

753
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:42,566
The president
is waiting, sir.

754
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,566
Excuse me.

755
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:45,735
Good evening.

756
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,537
- Ha!
- Miss, excuse me.

757
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,140
I am here because the police
ordered me to come.

758
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,307
Nevertheless,
I-I want to thank you

759
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:55,379
for explaining to the police
that even a Sherlock Holmes

760
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,713
would have carried out
the two bags.

761
00:31:57,714 --> 00:31:59,050
Yes, yes.

762
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,117
Did they say
which one of the robbers

763
00:32:02,118 --> 00:32:03,452
they think
they have caught?

764
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:05,389
- Caught?!
- One of the robbers?

765
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,658
- You didn't know?
- That's probably why they sent for Paul just now.

766
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,093
Oh, yes,
he would know.

767
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,661
He has made a personal issue
of this.

768
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,195
He is right.

769
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:14,764
What would happen
if they started

770
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:17,066
locking cabinet ministers
in vaults as a regular habit?

771
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:20,236
The country would probably
have some peace.

772
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:22,072
Whom have they arrested?

773
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,605
One of the robbers,
they think.

774
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:25,141
Did they find any of the jewels
on him?

775
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:26,809
If they had, there'd be
no need to identify him.

776
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,845
Yeah, more than likely,
they've caught someone

777
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,181
- who was Miles away from the scene of the robbery!
- I hope so.

778
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:34,651
Is that a fitting sentiment
for an ex-police officer?

779
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:38,254
I don't like this business
of identifying robbers.

780
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:40,089
The president is waiting
to question us again.

781
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,027
Very good.

782
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:46,443
He'll see you later.

783
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:02,546
Ah.

784
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,247
But nevertheless,
we still want to know

785
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,615
why you did not scream
when the robber left.

786
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,617
I told you.
I fainted.

787
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:10,553
Bring in the prisoner!

788
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,588
We have caught
one of the men.

789
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:14,458
I told you the police
would get them.

790
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,491
If it's the robber
and he isn't handsome,

791
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:19,634
I'll never
forgive you, Teri.

792
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:29,271
Will you be so good
as to identify him?

793
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:32,044
Baron Horhenfels, you
recognize this man, don't you?

794
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,512
I think so.

795
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,447
My eyes were focused
on the leader,

796
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,383
but I'm quite sure
this fellow

797
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:44,220
was one of the thieves,
quite sure.

798
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:47,457
And you, baroness?

799
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:50,393
Uh, I don't know.
I think not.

800
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,562
- You think not?
- I think not.

801
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,396
You haven't
half-looked at him.

802
00:33:54,397 --> 00:33:56,600
W--
I suppose he's one of them.

803
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,800
You'll swear to that?

804
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,469
Perhaps.

805
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,203
Send in
night watchman Lenz.

806
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:02,838
Hollander could identify him,
I'm certain.

807
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,075
That drugged cigarette will
keep him asleep for hours yet.

808
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,646
We'll question him
when he wakes up.

809
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:12,515
Lenz, this man was
one of them, wasn't he?

810
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:15,218
I-I simply put
the bags in the car.

811
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,587
But he was one of the thieves,
wasn't he?!

812
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,555
I simply put the bags
in the car.

813
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:23,259
I see nothing
to laugh at!

814
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,428
Neither do I.

815
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,796
But if you would
have tipped me off,

816
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:31,100
given me the high sign,
winked your other eye,

817
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:33,502
or wriggled your little finger
at the robber,

818
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:35,773
I'd have been
on my guard.

819
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:40,576
But there you all sat
as quiet-like --

820
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:44,747
as quiet...

821
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,951
As a man with a gun
pointed at him.

822
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:49,886
This is no joke, Lenz!

823
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,654
I'll talk to you later!

824
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,522
As for you ladies
and gentlemen,

825
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:56,125
there will be no need of further
questions for the present.

826
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:59,995
I thank you for your indulgence
and your cooperation.

827
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:01,797
You stay!

828
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:04,633
Good night, baron.
Good night, baroness.

829
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:07,404
It was very kind of you
to come down.

830
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,707
So...

831
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,375
Perhaps a little
solitary confinement

832
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,047
will improve
your eyesight.

833
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,047
Cigarettes.

834
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,681
- Polacheck!
- Yes, excellency?

835
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:21,551
- Some cigarettes.
- Yes, excellency.

836
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,785
Permit me,
your excellency.

837
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:26,221
And your memory --
possibly that'll improve

838
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:27,662
under the gentle care
of our police.

839
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:30,623
Quiet!

840
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,689
Andre, will you please
see Teri and Marianne home?

841
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,926
We're going with the president
to follow up some clues.

842
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,407
And console yourself
with the thought

843
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:06,796
that, in all probability, I
shall phone you in half an hour

844
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,830
and tell you that we have
captured the thief.

845
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:10,500
You are most generous.

846
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,334
The thought that you are placing
your life in jeopardy

847
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:14,203
in the defense of your honor
and mine

848
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:15,872
will enable me
to sleep soundly.

849
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:18,081
Good night.

850
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:30,085
H-hello!

851
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,254
H-hello?!

852
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:34,890
Hello! Hello! Hello!

853
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:38,962
Yes, this is Napoléon.

854
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,897
No! No!

855
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,433
<i>I am Napoléon!</i>

856
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,301
<i>No, no, this is Napoléon.</i>

857
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:47,535
<i>No, I am Napoléon.</i>

858
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,738
But you can't be Napoléon.

859
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:53,442
Why?
Now, why?

860
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:56,713
Why can't I be Napoléon?

861
00:36:58,047 --> 00:36:59,050
Because you look like --

862
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,050
what?

863
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:04,788
What do I look like?

864
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,955
- You look like the --
- president!

865
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:10,099
Quiet!

866
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:44,761
Ohh!

867
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,428
Where did these roses
come from?

868
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:47,930
They weren't here
when I left.

869
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,564
Someone sent them!

870
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:50,933
<i>Oh, you are brilliant.
But who?</i>

871
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,167
Berta will know.

872
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:53,468
Your husband.

873
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:54,971
You should know better
than that.

874
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,171
Paul.

875
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:57,652
He's the kind
who only sends orchids.

876
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,875
An unknown admirer?

877
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:01,810
I wonder.

878
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:03,279
There's no card.

879
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,546
Did you ring, madame?

880
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:06,181
Berta, Berta,
come here quickly.

881
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:07,783
When did these
flowers arrive?

882
00:38:07,784 --> 00:38:09,484
- They didn't.
- Who brought them?

883
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:10,653
No one, madame.

884
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:12,388
They weren't here
when I left.

885
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,189
No, madame.
But no one delivered them.

886
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,625
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes, madame.

887
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:18,261
I see.
That's all, Berta.

888
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,596
You won't need me to --

889
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,230
no, no, that's all, Berta.
Good night.

890
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:24,003
Good night, madame.

891
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,504
It might have been.

892
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:30,138
The robber wasn't really
short and fat, was he?

893
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:31,607
He was short and fat.

894
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:32,875
For the police, yes,
but between ourselves,

895
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:34,542
- what was he like?
- Marianne!

896
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:36,379
- What was he like?
- Marianne, no, no, no.

897
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,379
What was he like?
Oh, what was he like?

898
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,546
Charming.

899
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:40,082
Very attractive?

900
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,151
Beyond your dreams.

901
00:38:43,152 --> 00:38:45,288
Distinguished?

902
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,756
He robbed that shop

903
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,823
like an emperor bestowing
a cross of honor.

904
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:49,959
Marvelous!

905
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,694
And so gay,
so well poised.

906
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:53,729
As I watched him
go about his work so simply,

907
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,631
I realized
what a high civilization

908
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:57,133
we have
in Europe today.

909
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,768
What a shame to meet a man
like that in a shop.

910
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,236
Why a shame?

911
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:03,372
He's the sort of robber
one should meet in a Pullman.

912
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:04,874
What do you mean?

913
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,142
- Didn't you see it in the paper?
- No.

914
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,576
Last week, an American woman

915
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,412
was robbed
in the Simplon Express,

916
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,080
stripped right down
to her teddies.

917
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:12,881
No!

918
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:16,352
What would you do if you found
yourself in your teddies?

919
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,488
<i>What would you do?</i>

920
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,489
Let the train go on!

921
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,591
Lost soul!

922
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:24,928
When I'm traveling at the rate
of 80 Miles an hour,

923
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,328
I'm not responsible
for my actions.

924
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:29,098
Oh!

925
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,665
Shh. Listen.

926
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,801
What's the matter?

927
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:34,203
- Someone's walking in the garden.
- Nonsense.

928
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,305
Someone's walking in the garden,
I tell you.

929
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:37,586
I can hear
the gravel crunching.

930
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,375
I can hear it, too.

931
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,143
Oh, look quickly,
Marianne.

932
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:42,645
I'm afraid.

933
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,714
No, no. No, no, go.
Go on quickly, quickly.

934
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,516
Wait.

935
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,962
<i>Someone is walking
in the garden.</i>

936
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,098
Who is it?

937
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,299
A man!

938
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,634
A man?

939
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:08,203
Quickly, quickly!
Let me see!

940
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:09,538
Where?

941
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:10,939
- There.
- Where?

942
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,844
There, just stepping
into the light.

943
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:16,384
Oh, my heart.

944
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:23,384
Ohh.

945
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:24,921
My chauffeur.

946
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,221
How stupid.

947
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:29,500
Aah!

948
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,667
I'm going to
get out of here.

949
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:40,569
It's giving me
the creeps.

950
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,342
Marianne!

951
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:56,252
The balcony door's unlatched.

952
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,087
<i>Someone has been here.</i>

953
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,221
I knew it.

954
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:02,491
What is it?

955
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:05,261
My jewelry.
My jewelry's in this room.

956
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,696
Where?

957
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,135
In the safe, over there
behind that panel.

958
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,203
The safe is open.

959
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,937
This is the end.
He's taken everything.

960
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:17,839
Why are such men
allowed to live?

961
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,442
Oh, my poor darling.

962
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,377
I hope they catch him
and kill him!

963
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,413
- Making a fool of me, sending me flowers, flowers, flowers!
- Oh, Teri.

964
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:26,681
All my beautiful things!

965
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:29,588
My beautiful things.

966
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,520
What?

967
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:34,522
It's all here.

968
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:36,091
There's not a thing
missing.

969
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,959
Then, why in heaven
did he --

970
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,127
unless...

971
00:41:39,128 --> 00:41:40,663
What?

972
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,765
The ring! The ring
he stole from me today.

973
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,267
How could it be?

974
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:48,104
Oh, the sweet thing.
He's made me a gift of my ring.

975
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,205
<i>That would happen to you.</i>

976
00:41:50,206 --> 00:41:51,874
He's marvelous!

977
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,512
Teri, it's immoral.

978
00:41:55,419 --> 00:41:57,779
And now that I have the ring,
what am I going to do with it?

979
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,381
You must telephone the police
at once.

980
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:00,982
- And let them know that I have it?
- Of course.

981
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:02,685
Impossible. If they know
that I have the ring --

982
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,153
then it would come out
that there was something

983
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,953
- between you and the robber.
- Yes.

984
00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:07,922
Ah, you admit, then,
that you did let him get away.

985
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:08,957
Yes.

986
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:11,160
Even though
he's a robber to us,

987
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,428
he stormed that shop
like a hero.

988
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:16,098
Yes, I did let him go.

989
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:19,067
How will you ever
get out of this affair?

990
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:20,169
I wish I knew.

991
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,010
And the worst of it is,
I can't keep the ring.

992
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,172
- It's sure to be discovered.
- Of course.

993
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:25,942
I'll have to give it
back to him.

994
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,609
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe.

995
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,078
How will you
ever find him?

996
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,083
<i>He'll find me.</i>

997
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,884
Oh.

998
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,285
Please order the car
for me at once.

999
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,587
Marianne, you're not gonna
desert me in this crisis?

1000
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:40,089
Oh, I don't mind
a little flirtation,

1001
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,556
but this is
going too far.

1002
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:43,225
Oh, please, please.
Just stay the night.

1003
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,493
I should say not.

1004
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:46,294
There will be a scandal, and
I'm going to protect myself.

1005
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:49,900
How ashamed you'll be in the
morning for having deserted me.

1006
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,268
- Did you ring, madame?
- Yes, Berta.

1007
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:55,437
Tell the chauffeur that madame
horn is leaving immediately.

1008
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:57,805
- Yes, madame.
- I hope you're disgusted with yourself.

1009
00:42:57,806 --> 00:42:59,308
There, now.
You can go.

1010
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:01,044
Well, be displeased with me.
I can't help it.

1011
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,979
I'm a respectable woman,
and I'm afraid.

1012
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,480
<i>Don't you think I'm afraid?</i>

1013
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,281
I shan't close my eyes
all night.

1014
00:43:06,282 --> 00:43:07,750
Well, this is one night

1015
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,407
I shall be very glad
to be with my husband.

1016
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,852
What do you want?

1017
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:47,288
If it's possible,
a cup of tea.

1018
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:48,693
Oh.

1019
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:53,162
Oh, were you thinking
of going to bed?

1020
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,099
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1021
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,368
Why, then,
let's talk.

1022
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:01,870
- Talk?
- Yes.

1023
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:03,339
The conditions
are so perfect --

1024
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,339
no one at home,
the servants asleep,

1025
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:10,317
complete stillness outside,
and so much to talk about.

1026
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,851
Help.

1027
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,354
That's adorable.
Please do it again.

1028
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,189
- Oh, this is awful.
- Why?

1029
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,325
I'm having a very good time.
Won't you sit down?

1030
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:26,562
You behave exactly as though
you were paying a call.

1031
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,363
I am.

1032
00:44:28,063 --> 00:44:30,566
After a very brief
and informal introduction,

1033
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,500
I am now making
a formal call.

1034
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:34,203
Through the window.

1035
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,684
But only to preserve
your reputation.

1036
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:38,839
I came very discreetly,
by way of the drainpipe.

1037
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,109
That's not legal! Oh.

1038
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,081
Oh. Permit me.

1039
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:48,250
You know they've caught
one of your men?

1040
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:50,118
Oh, he'll go free.

1041
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:52,187
We shall produce
12 witnesses who will swear

1042
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,189
that he spent the entire
afternoon with them

1043
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,259
at his aunt's house,
15 Miles away.

1044
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,794
That's not true.

1045
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:00,997
Well, certainly not.

1046
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:04,834
Neither am I short and fat,
as you told the police.

1047
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,401
How do you know that?

1048
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:10,372
I, uh, overheard your
conversation in the bedroom.

1049
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:11,839
While I was undressing?

1050
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,483
You were everything
I anticipated.

1051
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:22,151
Cognac?

1052
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,384
Thank you.

1053
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:25,453
Well, I'm glad.

1054
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:27,355
Yes, I'm very glad
that you're here.

1055
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:29,158
- You excite me.
- If you hadn't come,

1056
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,926
I should have had to go
and look for you.

1057
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:32,595
You are making me
divinely happy.

1058
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,230
How dare do you present me
with this ring.

1059
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,832
Oh, forgive me, but the ring
was yours originally.

1060
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,001
Yes.
Yes, that's true.

1061
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:40,870
But don't you understand
that if I --

1062
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,837
the only way
that I can get the ring back

1063
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:44,705
is to have the police
return it to me,

1064
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:46,274
following your arrest.

1065
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:49,345
I'm sorry, but, uh, that method
of returning it to you

1066
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,779
doesn't intrigue me.

1067
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,881
Then take it back,
at once.

1068
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:54,884
No, I'm not in the habit
of taking back gifts.

1069
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,819
If you don't want it,
give it to the police.

1070
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,154
But that's just what I can't do.
Don't you see?

1071
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,223
No,
I won't take it back.

1072
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:03,558
If I keep the ring,
it makes me your accomplice.

1073
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,892
It binds me to you.

1074
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:07,230
A consummation devoutly
to be wished.

1075
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,497
Be careful.

1076
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:12,871
If you drive me too far,
I'll scream for help!

1077
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:17,085
I will not take back
the ring.

1078
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,285
So, you will not
take back the ring?

1079
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:31,087
No.

1080
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,690
Well, then, hands up.

1081
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,770
Are you sure
that's loaded?

1082
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,359
If you don't steal back
that ring immediately,

1083
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,229
I'll shoot you.

1084
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,598
You want to make a pool
of blood, huh?

1085
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,265
Yes.

1086
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:46,435
Well...

1087
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,610
If you insist.

1088
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:57,750
Ohh.

1089
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,422
Did I hurt you?

1090
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,790
D-do be a bit more careful,
won't you?

1091
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:12,593
Now...
Let's try it again.

1092
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:17,198
I don't know what to do.
Why did you come here tonight?

1093
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,801
A philanderer would say
because he loved you.

1094
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:21,535
So I can't say it.

1095
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:22,671
But I do.

1096
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:24,739
I can't believe that.

1097
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,241
Why?

1098
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:29,611
Because --
how old are you?

1099
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:30,946
- 15.
- Huh?

1100
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:34,582
Oh, I've lived 15 years.
The rest doesn't count.

1101
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:37,252
Your conscience?

1102
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:38,587
Uh,
beautifully clear.

1103
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:39,888
Your past?

1104
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:41,556
Fortunate.

1105
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:42,991
Your future?

1106
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:44,727
Doesn't exist.

1107
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:46,729
I live only
for the present.

1108
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,431
And the present is you.

1109
00:47:49,432 --> 00:47:50,399
I beg your pardon!

1110
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,167
No one knows
I'm in the house.

1111
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:56,138
Night is before us,
and, if you wish,

1112
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,739
at dawn we shall have
a secret behind us.

1113
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,378
That's not possible.

1114
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:05,113
A man like you
doesn't climb a drainpipe

1115
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:07,114
just to make love
to a woman.

1116
00:48:07,115 --> 00:48:08,484
- True, alas.
- Ah.

1117
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,518
I'm being sought in every
quarter of the city.

1118
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,587
An army of detectives
is searching for me.

1119
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:15,457
The last place anyone would
think of looking for me

1120
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:16,959
is your bedroom.

1121
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,993
Oh. So you expect to stay here
until morning?

1122
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:20,462
Oh, I'm forced to.

1123
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:23,397
Tomorrow the chase
starts all over again.

1124
00:48:23,398 --> 00:48:25,234
I must have
a peaceful night.

1125
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,102
A peaceful night
in my bedroom?

1126
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:30,538
Tomorrow I'll disappear
and take my loot with me.

1127
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:32,174
What loot?

1128
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,109
Forgive me.
I forgot to tell you.

1129
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,377
I've deposited
the stolen jewels with you.

1130
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:37,511
What?!

1131
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:39,480
In the rear compartment
of your safe.

1132
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:41,683
Uh, the police will never think
of looking for them there.

1133
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:44,352
You mean Hollander’s
whole shop's in there?

1134
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:47,522
No, uh,
only the diamonds.

1135
00:48:47,523 --> 00:48:50,926
Take it
right out of there!

1136
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:54,163
In that small, brown,
leather bag.

1137
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,696
Take it away at once.

1138
00:48:55,697 --> 00:48:57,500
But honestly,
it's the best place for them.

1139
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:58,835
I shall
go out of my mind.

1140
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,341
- Who's there?
- Berta!

1141
00:49:06,342 --> 00:49:09,078
There's a detective here
from police headquarters!

1142
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:10,444
A detective?

1143
00:49:10,445 --> 00:49:11,765
He wants to speak to you,
madame!

1144
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:13,716
What'll I say?

1145
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,557
We're already in bed.

1146
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,718
We're already --

1147
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:18,120
I'm already in bed.

1148
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,254
Tell him he'll have to wait
till I dress.

1149
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:22,723
- The drainpipe. The drainpipe.
- One moment.

1150
00:49:22,724 --> 00:49:24,993
I'll have a look first.

1151
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:28,532
They mustn't
find you here.

1152
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,569
No luck.
Two policemen below.

1153
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,538
Quickly, hide.

1154
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,705
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
not there --

1155
00:49:37,706 --> 00:49:40,577
my husband's bedroom.

1156
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:43,444
Oh, if he should
come back?

1157
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:45,580
The detective says he
can't wait any longer, madame!

1158
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:49,686
Don't be nervous. If there's
any danger, depend on me.

1159
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:53,555
Yes, yes! I'm coming!

1160
00:49:53,556 --> 00:49:57,526
Good evening, madame.
I am from the police department.

1161
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,261
Oh, please,
won't you sit down?

1162
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,096
I'm sorry to disturb you
so late,

1163
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:02,897
but I'm here
on an important matter

1164
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:05,799
in connection with the jewel
robbery of this evening.

1165
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,301
Yes?

1166
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:10,638
The examination has taken
a suspicious turn.

1167
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,841
It involves you
more than ever.

1168
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:14,142
Me?

1169
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,977
And in one
of our best hotels,

1170
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:18,781
we seem to have found
a valuable clue.

1171
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,281
Really?

1172
00:50:20,282 --> 00:50:22,651
A distinguished young man of
fashionable appearance.

1173
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,118
Yes?

1174
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,587
Two hours
after the robbery,

1175
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:28,256
this young man returned
to his hotel,

1176
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:31,125
and most significant,
he carried in his hand

1177
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:32,627
a small leather bag,

1178
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:37,434
an ordinary, harmless-looking,
brown, leather bag.

1179
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:41,102
Why should I be interested
in anything of this kind?

1180
00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:42,703
I beg your pardon.

1181
00:50:42,704 --> 00:50:45,741
I merely mentioned it that you
might have a complete picture.

1182
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,609
When the gentleman
left the hotel,

1183
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,812
he again carried with him
the brown, leather bag.

1184
00:50:51,813 --> 00:50:53,348
He climbed into a taxi,

1185
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:56,352
the detective
directly behind him.

1186
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,620
Must you go
into all these details?

1187
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:00,955
Wait a minute. The taxi
proceeded along the ring,

1188
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:03,725
past the Karls church, and turned
into the Argentinierstrasse.

1189
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:05,393
Into my street?

1190
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:07,328
And there it stopped.
The gentleman left the taxi

1191
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:08,897
and went the rest of the way
on foot.

1192
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:11,566
Presently, he stopped
in front of your house.

1193
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:12,734
Ohh!

1194
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:14,268
<i>Your house, madame.</i>

1195
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:15,703
And that is why
I permitted myself

1196
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:17,339
to disturb you
at so late an hour.

1197
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,408
Oh, but I-I still
don't understand why --

1198
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,076
it is my opinion
that this man

1199
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,977
has somehow managed to hide
himself in this house.

1200
00:51:22,978 --> 00:51:24,117
Impossible!

1201
00:51:29,117 --> 00:51:30,386
What are you
going to do?

1202
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,785
- Search the house.
- Search the house?!

1203
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:33,622
Why are you so frightened,
now that you are safe?

1204
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,556
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Search the house.

1205
00:51:35,557 --> 00:51:37,957
Search thoroughly, from roof to cellar.
Begin at the cellar.

1206
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,493
Perhaps
you will be so kind

1207
00:51:39,494 --> 00:51:42,763
as to leave the method
of search to me.

1208
00:51:42,764 --> 00:51:45,134
First of all, I should like
to look at your jewelry,

1209
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,502
to make sure
that nothing is missing.

1210
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,236
That won't be necessary.
I've just looked myself.

1211
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:49,437
It's all there.

1212
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,573
- And this ring?
- What?

1213
00:51:51,574 --> 00:51:54,509
There's a description
of this ring with the police.

1214
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,278
This is
the excelsior diamond.

1215
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,745
Oh, no.
No, you must be mistaken.

1216
00:51:57,746 --> 00:52:00,649
Madame, how did this ring
come into your possession?

1217
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,852
Well, this evening,
when I opened my safe,

1218
00:52:03,853 --> 00:52:05,187
I found it there.

1219
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,488
Really?

1220
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:08,524
That must be
a most interesting safe.

1221
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,558
We will examine it
a little more closely.

1222
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,694
Ohh!

1223
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,995
Oh. Oh. No.

1224
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,330
Well,
this is delightful --

1225
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:16,797
a leather bag,

1226
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:18,933
a harmless-looking,
brown, leather bag.

1227
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:20,502
I swear I'm innocent.

1228
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:22,638
And in it, the stolen jewels
from the Ringstrasse.

1229
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,672
Oh, surely, surely
you don't believe that --

1230
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:26,341
you may have
a plausible explanation

1231
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:27,782
for this terrible situation,
madame.

1232
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,310
But as a police official,

1233
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,846
I must unfortunately
do my duty.

1234
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,180
Oh, what are you doing?

1235
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:33,248
I'm ringing
for the maid.

1236
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:38,220
- Yes, madame?
- Madame's bag --

1237
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:40,522
- and pack what may be necessary for a night.
- A night?!

1238
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:42,122
It may not be necessary
after all,

1239
00:52:42,123 --> 00:52:43,591
with your
husband's influence,

1240
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:45,493
but first of all
we shall have to go

1241
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:46,727
- to the house of the police president...
- No.

1242
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:48,562
...and after,
if he thinks it's necessary,

1243
00:52:48,563 --> 00:52:50,366
- to the police station.
- No. No, it's incredible.

1244
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,167
I can't go.
I won't go, I tell you.

1245
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,602
Think of the scandal.

1246
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,136
The police aren't afraid
of scandals.

1247
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:56,638
Baroness Horhenfels
at a police station?

1248
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,707
It's unthinkable.
I won't stand for it.

1249
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,841
One moment.

1250
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:01,509
- Ohh.
- I need that bag.

1251
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,977
Adieu, dear lady.

1252
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:04,858
Forgive me if I've
inconvenienced you too much.

1253
00:53:06,181 --> 00:53:08,219
Beware of the law!

1254
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:13,955
What a pity.

1255
00:53:13,956 --> 00:53:16,924
I congratulate you, sir.
You've won the round.

1256
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:18,326
Take him away.

1257
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:19,395
You mean you're
going to arrest him?

1258
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,861
Help! Help!

1259
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:22,196
Yes, madame?

1260
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:23,866
<i>Now you're calling for help.</i>

1261
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,232
You should have done that
at the jewelry shop.

1262
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:26,468
- Oh, what shall I do?
- Come along.

1263
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,835
All right,
I'll go with you.

1264
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:29,504
But you'll see.
You'll be sorry.

1265
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:30,738
Wait till
my husband comes --

1266
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:32,107
oh. Oh.

1267
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,576
Don't you worry, madame!
I'll tell the baron about it!

1268
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:36,845
He'll take care
of those brutes!

1269
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,150
Oh, madame!

1270
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:43,121
Here we are.

1271
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,023
Get along, now.
Don't hang back.

1272
00:53:48,023 --> 00:53:49,691
Why not be a bit polite?

1273
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,725
We can move without
being growled at.

1274
00:53:51,726 --> 00:53:53,074
Shut up.

1275
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:06,875
I'm frightened.

1276
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,882
The president
will be here in a moment.

1277
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,750
Do they examine you
here in this room?

1278
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:17,752
Examine
and cross-examine.

1279
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:19,421
You get to like it
after a while.

1280
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,687
Like it?

1281
00:54:20,688 --> 00:54:23,792
The police president's
apartment?

1282
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,959
Oh, no.

1283
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,529
<i>My apartment.</i>

1284
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,163
Your apartment?

1285
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:32,368
Allow me to present Fritz,
an old associate of mine --

1286
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,468
very trustworthy
on these occasions.

1287
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:35,703
He's not a detective?

1288
00:54:35,704 --> 00:54:37,009
Oh, indeed, no,
madame.

1289
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:42,377
Oh, I never was so happy
to meet a robber.

1290
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:43,978
Forgive me, madame,
if I have caused you

1291
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,652
a few
unpleasant moments.

1292
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:53,221
So, this was all part of
an elaborate plot to kidnap me.

1293
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:54,823
What other means
were open to me?

1294
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:58,093
You wouldn't have accepted
an invitation, would you?

1295
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,063
I should hope not.

1296
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,230
You remember my offer?

1297
00:55:02,231 --> 00:55:03,564
Well, here we are --

1298
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:07,503
set down in the suburbs,
untouched.

1299
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:12,619
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Supper first.

1300
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:26,955
Oh, no. No, it isn't true,
any of it.

1301
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,057
I'm at home, dreaming.

1302
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:30,827
And I am with you.

1303
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:35,529
Good night,
and good appetite.

1304
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,668
Good night, Fritz.

1305
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,335
Alone with a robber
in his den.

1306
00:55:41,336 --> 00:55:42,971
Are you unhappy?

1307
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:44,439
I don't know.

1308
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,140
At the present moment,

1309
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:47,741
I'm in the grip of an
overwhelming passion.

1310
00:55:47,742 --> 00:55:48,477
Yes?

1311
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,745
Yes. I'm hungry.

1312
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:51,812
Oh.

1313
00:55:51,813 --> 00:55:53,781
That's because
you were frightened.

1314
00:55:53,782 --> 00:55:56,884
There's nothing like a little
fear to whet one's appetite.

1315
00:55:56,885 --> 00:56:01,256
Now, will you be so kind
as to introduce me to you?

1316
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:02,591
Which one of me?

1317
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,158
Oh.
Is there more than one?

1318
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,426
Oh, dozens.

1319
00:56:05,427 --> 00:56:07,696
That's another requirement
of my trade.

1320
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,964
Let me see, now --
which name to take?

1321
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:12,734
Usually it's so easy.

1322
00:56:12,735 --> 00:56:14,468
<i>You give me a name.</i>

1323
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:15,937
I don't want to,
really.

1324
00:56:15,938 --> 00:56:17,705
The nicest part
of this whole affair

1325
00:56:17,706 --> 00:56:19,941
is that
you're the unknown,

1326
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:21,609
a figure
out of a fairy tale,

1327
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:24,178
the robber
in seven-league boots.

1328
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:26,781
No, this isn't the time
for me to give you a name,

1329
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:28,485
but to forget my own.

1330
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:31,021
Much the better way.

1331
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,221
Merely man.

1332
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:34,555
Merely woman.

1333
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:37,929
And to whatever
joins them.

1334
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,296
You're not drinking.

1335
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,397
<i>You are my wine tonight.</i>

1336
00:56:43,398 --> 00:56:44,799
Oh, now, please.

1337
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,902
Can't you do better
than that?

1338
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:50,171
That was a bit shopworn,
I confess.

1339
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:52,674
But what would you have me do,
invite you immediately to --

1340
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,875
you can't invite me
to do anything.

1341
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:57,215
Whatever you do
must be done by force.

1342
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:02,021
Well, then...

1343
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,190
Ooh!

1344
00:57:09,858 --> 00:57:10,658
Ooh!

1345
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,028
What are you doing?

1346
00:57:13,028 --> 00:57:14,030
Using force.

1347
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,966
Oh, please, let's not be
in such a hurry.

1348
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:21,301
There are so many pleasant
intervening steps.

1349
00:57:21,302 --> 00:57:22,736
For instance?

1350
00:57:22,737 --> 00:57:25,941
Well, I think I should
know more about you.

1351
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,109
You don't want to hear
the story of my life.

1352
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,678
Why not?

1353
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:33,080
I'm curious to know
how you were led astray.

1354
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:35,984
Well, I began life
as a little boy.

1355
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,854
I'm glad to hear that you kept
to the same sex.

1356
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,421
Yes.
It's a family tradition.

1357
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:44,259
But very soon
I began to want things,

1358
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,893
beautiful things.

1359
00:57:45,894 --> 00:57:48,562
And one day in Paris,
I stopped to admire

1360
00:57:48,563 --> 00:57:51,399
a display of jewelry
in a shop window,

1361
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,801
miraculously
beautiful gems

1362
00:57:53,802 --> 00:57:55,937
behind a thin pane
of glass.

1363
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:57,939
Suddenly,
the glass was gone.

1364
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,209
I had broken it.
My career had begun.

1365
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,479
And you've broken windows
ever since?

1366
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,814
No.

1367
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:09,652
My technique improved
as my collection grew.

1368
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:13,187
Show me your jewels,
will you?

1369
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:15,427
Of course.

1370
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:20,895
There -- there must be some
gorgeous things among them.

1371
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:24,101
There are. Of course, I don't
keep everything right on tap.

1372
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:29,384
Even a robber has to
look out for burglars.

1373
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:44,718
Exhibit "a" --

1374
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,256
compliments of Mr. Hollander
and Teri Horhenfels.

1375
00:58:48,257 --> 00:58:49,758
Oh, no, not those.

1376
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:53,650
I want to see what you stole
in Paris, Rome, London.

1377
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,021
Paris, Rome, London.

1378
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:20,821
Oh!

1379
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:24,326
I want to play with these
the way a child plays with sand,

1380
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,662
try them all on...

1381
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,663
Pour them
all over me...

1382
00:59:28,664 --> 00:59:30,263
Bury myself in them.

1383
00:59:30,264 --> 00:59:32,133
Oh, they're too heavenly.

1384
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:34,768
This necklace --
where did you get it?

1385
00:59:34,769 --> 00:59:36,437
At a charity ball.

1386
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:37,939
What courage!

1387
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,941
No, merely
nimble fingers.

1388
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,576
The lady stood beside me.

1389
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:43,111
The prince of wales
was announced.

1390
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,846
I could have removed
her dress.

1391
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,647
And these emeralds?

1392
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:48,683
I owe to the invention
of the airship.

1393
00:59:48,684 --> 00:59:50,685
When a zeppelin arrives,
everybody looks up.

1394
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:52,419
<i>I look down.</i>

1395
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,691
This lovely stone with the
rose cast -- where's it from?

1396
00:59:56,692 --> 00:59:59,080
Somewhere between
Lyon and Marseilles.

1397
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:02,863
Was she pretty?

1398
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:04,299
Suppose she was.

1399
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,401
I'm jealous.

1400
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,868
Jealous?

1401
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:10,205
Does that mean
you love me?

1402
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,305
It must mean
something like that.

1403
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:14,447
It's my only excuse.

1404
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,846
Will you come away
with me?

1405
01:00:19,847 --> 01:00:21,917
I leave Vienna tonight.
We'll fly together.

1406
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:24,752
Flight? Oh, no.
Abduction, perhaps.

1407
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:25,919
Anything you like.

1408
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,388
Where do we go?

1409
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:28,622
To eternity.

1410
01:00:28,623 --> 01:00:30,191
Oh, that sounds far.
I'm afraid.

1411
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:32,326
Stay close to me,
and you won't be afraid.

1412
01:00:32,327 --> 01:00:35,763
Come with me to nice.
We'll be Miles from Vienna.

1413
01:00:35,764 --> 01:00:37,866
The season is on.
The casinos are gay.

1414
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,801
We'll bathe ourselves
in music,

1415
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,236
drown ourselves
in champagne.

1416
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,738
I'll make love to you as
I've dreamed of making love.

1417
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:46,374
That sounds divine.

1418
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,676
Perhaps there by the sea,
away from everything --

1419
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:50,745
don't say "perhaps."

1420
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:52,413
Dance with me in nice
on Thursday.

1421
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:53,848
Oh, wait.

1422
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:56,183
I feel now that
I don't dare go with you.

1423
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:57,685
How will I feel
tomorrow

1424
01:00:57,686 --> 01:01:00,921
when I've realized
that I've let you go?

1425
01:01:00,922 --> 01:01:03,226
I know how I'll feel.

1426
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:06,194
I'll dance with you
Thursday.

1427
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,730
- The hotel Negresco.
- For tea.

1428
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,000
Darling.

1429
01:01:11,974 --> 01:01:13,535
I'll follow on the first
possible train.

1430
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,215
Now I'll rush home
and pack.

1431
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,183
I warn you, if you fail me,
I'll be right back.

1432
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,118
Infant. I'm already
on my way to you.

1433
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,451
Goodbye till day
after tomorrow.

1434
01:01:31,452 --> 01:01:33,788
You promise you won't let
the police catch you.

1435
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:36,625
I promise.

1436
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,725
Charles? Charles.

1437
01:01:38,726 --> 01:01:40,162
- Yes, sir?
- I'm off.

1438
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,397
- I'm going to nice.
- But you can't do that.

1439
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,165
- Every railway station's being watched.
- Pooh to them.

1440
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:46,134
I'll be in nice
the day after tomorrow.

1441
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,334
Oh, what an adventure
this is going to be.

1442
01:01:47,335 --> 01:01:48,455
We'll start packing
at once.

1443
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:52,644
Bring me that jewel case
from the library table.

1444
01:01:56,644 --> 01:01:58,879
There's no jewel case
here!

1445
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,082
I left it there
on the library table.

1446
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,788
You couldn't have,
unless somebody's taken it.

1447
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:09,228
Don't be funny.

1448
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:15,699
Why, I...

1449
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:19,670
Did...

1450
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,470
Good heaven,
it isn't possible.

1451
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:24,337
What's that?

1452
01:02:24,338 --> 01:02:26,374
- That woman -- she got away with it.
- I don't believe it.

1453
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,243
A thing like that
couldn't happen to you.

1454
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,843
Couldn't it?
Well, it has.

1455
01:02:29,844 --> 01:02:32,080
I've always warned you
about those society women.

1456
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,816
This is ridiculous.
She won't get away with it.

1457
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:36,917
- Call the police at once.
- The police?!

1458
01:02:36,918 --> 01:02:39,287
Oh, of course
we can't do that.

1459
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,288
This is what I get for being
such a sentimentalist,

1460
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:43,457
for believing in the fundamental
honesty of people.

1461
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:45,635
Well, I'll be.

1462
01:02:53,635 --> 01:02:56,570
Oh, no.
No, I can't do it.

1463
01:03:03,244 --> 01:03:07,415
Police!

1464
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:11,452
Cover the rear! You take the right!
You take the left!

1465
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:16,991
One of the best jobs
we've ever pulled off,

1466
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:19,859
and not a stone
to show for it.

1467
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,363
Police! Police!

1468
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:24,866
The streets are swarming
with them.

1469
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,366
- Is everything set?
- Yes.

1470
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:27,647
- The doors all barred?
- Solid.

1471
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:29,636
Then clear out quickly.
I'll join you in half an hour.

1472
01:03:29,637 --> 01:03:32,473
Giddyap.

1473
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:34,107
You robbed me.

1474
01:03:34,108 --> 01:03:35,676
The jewelry
was safer with me.

1475
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:38,578
You told me so yourself when
you brought it to my house.

1476
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,415
Am I to believe that that
was the reason you took it?

1477
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,216
Oh, don't think about that now.
The police are here.

1478
01:03:42,217 --> 01:03:43,817
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll get away.

1479
01:03:44,052 --> 01:03:45,620
What are you
going to do?

1480
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:46,654
<i>What can I do?</i>

1481
01:03:46,655 --> 01:03:47,988
- Come with me.
- Where?

1482
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:49,624
- Over the roofs and away.
- I don't dare.

1483
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,905
Romance, adventure, gaiety,
excitement, a chance to live.

1484
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:53,667
No, no, I can't, I tell you.
It's insane.

1485
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,731
I must have time
to think.

1486
01:03:59,967 --> 01:04:01,637
Well, then...

1487
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:05,073
What are you doing?

1488
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:08,308
This is the only way
to return you to respectability

1489
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:10,612
and to give you
a chance to think.

1490
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:27,663
They'll know now that
you fought for virtue's sake.

1491
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,937
If you come to nice,
I'll be waiting.

1492
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:39,943
If not, this is goodbye.

1493
01:04:45,914 --> 01:04:47,915
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, dear.</i>

1494
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:50,418
I love you.

1495
01:05:20,615 --> 01:05:23,417
Help. Help. Help!

1496
01:05:23,418 --> 01:05:25,118
Here she is!

1497
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,687
Here she is!
Teri!

1498
01:05:26,688 --> 01:05:30,390
Oh, you poor thing,
trussed up like a chicken!

1499
01:05:30,391 --> 01:05:31,892
Get me out of here
quickly.

1500
01:05:31,893 --> 01:05:33,261
Which way did he go?

1501
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,962
- Through the window.
- Through the window!

1502
01:05:34,963 --> 01:05:36,730
Can you give me
a description?

1503
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,066
Yes. Yes, of course.

1504
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,567
He wore a brown,
leather coat,

1505
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:40,848
red scarf,
and green spectacles.

1506
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,303
- And short and fat!
- Yes.

1507
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:43,404
Thank you.
We'll have him in no time!

1508
01:05:43,405 --> 01:05:44,206
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

1509
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,841
Don't worry, baroness.
I'll get him!

1510
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,843
Leave it to Lenz.

1511
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,711
There he is!

1512
01:05:52,414 --> 01:05:55,150
I'll get him!

1513
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:05,346
There he is!
Now go ahead!

1514
01:06:24,346 --> 01:06:26,781
- They've got him!
- Where? Where?

1515
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,822
In the courtyard!

1516
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,676
Teri, he got away again.

1517
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:29,977
But we'll get him.

1518
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:31,578
I hope it's been
a lesson to you.

1519
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:32,846
Oh, it has been.

1520
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:35,283
My nerves are shattered,
simply shattered.

1521
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:38,054
I must get away
for a long rest at once.

1522
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:40,955
I think I'll go to nice.

1523
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,758
Yes, nice.

1524
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,000
Nice.
On the first possible train.
