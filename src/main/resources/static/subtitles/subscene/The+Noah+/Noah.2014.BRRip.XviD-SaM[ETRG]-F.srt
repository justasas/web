1
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,960
<i>From Adam to Seth, from Seth to Enosh,</i>

2
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,568
Enosh to Kenan, Kenan to Mahalalel,

3
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,804
to my father, Methuselah, then to me.

4
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,168
Today, that birthright passes to you,

5
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,366
Noah.

6
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,522
My son.

7
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,446
The Creator made Adam in His image,

8
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,364
and then placed the world in his care.

9
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,210
This is your work now.
Your responsibility.

10
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,329
May you walk
alongside The Creator in righteousness.

11
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,323
So I say to you...

12
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,851
The Shrine of Seth!

13
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,968
Men.

14
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,610
Hide.

15
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,408
We mine here.

16
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,490
The ground is rich with tzohar.

17
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,288
This is The Creator's land.
What are you doing?

18
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,684
The Creator?

19
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,928
My mines run dry.

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,810
My city withers and must be fed.

21
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,929
And what has He done?

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,449
He cursed us to struggle
by the sweat of our brow to survive!

23
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,605
Damned if I don't do everything it takes
to do just that.

24
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,123
Damned if I don't take what I want.

25
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,083
This relic belongs to
the descendants of Cain now.

26
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,962
The line of Seth ends here.

27
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,808
It is ours. Now dig!

28
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,641
Ham.

29
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,481
What are you doing?

30
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,447
It's pretty.

31
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,245
You see those other flowers?

32
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,730
How they're attached to the ground?

33
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,644
That's where they should be.

34
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,210
They have a purpose.

35
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,281
They sprout.

36
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,123
And they bloom.

37
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,050
The wind takes their seeds
and more flowers grow.

38
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,004
We only collect what we can use
and what we need.

39
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,566
Do you understand?

40
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,327
Shem.

41
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,887
Ham.

42
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,246
Let's go.

43
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,051
Men. Hide, hide.

44
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,043
Go.

45
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,124
You found our kill.

46
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,402
How fortunate.

47
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,807
But for you maybe not.

48
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,208
You know how long it is
since we ate meat?

49
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,650
Since we even saw an animal?

50
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,891
Easy.

51
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,042
Please. What do you want?

52
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
Jusfice.

53
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,360
Why did they kill it?

54
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,566
They eat them.

55
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,401
Why?

56
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,243
They think it makes them stronger.

57
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,485
Is it true?

58
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,010
They forget
strength comes from The Creator.

59
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,651
Mama!

60
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,326
Mommy!

61
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,411
See your brothers?

62
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,845
Ham saw men hunting today.

63
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,002
They are getting closer.

64
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,520
How was he?

65
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,008
A little too interested.

66
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,484
He had to see it sometime.

67
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,529
I saw something else.

68
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,530
A flower

69
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,482
bloom from nothing.

70
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,681
Rest.

71
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,081
Perhaps He will finally
make things right.

72
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,245
Methuselah.

73
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,446
Did He speak to you?

74
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,045
I think so.

75
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,010
Will He help us?

76
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,850
He's going to destroy the world.

77
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,689
It's a long and dangerous journey
for the boys.

78
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,200
How do you know
your grandfather's still alive?

79
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,281
I don't.

80
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,520
I saw his mountain.

81
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,888
We need to go and find out
if he knows what we're to do.

82
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,327
Shem. Can you help me with this?

83
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,370
We could take the boys
and find a place to hide.

84
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,649
There'll be no hiding.

85
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,451
We should have left already.

86
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,762
Ham, let me show you how to do that.

87
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,847
Push it in here.

88
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,331
Next time we come through,

89
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,767
we'll know
we've got certain things we might need.

90
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,368
There are cities ahead.

91
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,442
We will not get too close.

92
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,843
Is that a tzohar mine?

93
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,127
It was once. Before they dug it all up.

94
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,124
Should we go around?

95
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,761
No.

96
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,610
Do you think they're all dead?

97
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,961
It looks that way.

98
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,042
They must have been scavenging here.

99
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,122
And someone scavenged from them.

100
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,844
Dada!

101
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,323
Stay close.

102
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,166
Father!

103
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,321
Here!

104
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,366
May I see?

105
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,371
Let me see.

106
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,362
Tell me your name.

107
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,050
You have a name?

108
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,360
Ila.

109
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,408
My name is Ila.

110
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,527
Ila.

111
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,289
You're going to be all right, Ila.

112
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,404
This is Shem.

113
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,362
He's going to hold your hand tight
and he won't let go.

114
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,806
Up the hill! Hurry! Hurry!

115
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,844
We have to go. Now.

116
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,520
Up the hill. Run.

117
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,406
We can't go there.

118
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,409
We have no choice. Hurry!

119
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,725
Hold, men! Hold!

120
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,966
The giants!

121
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,721
They'll kill you!

122
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,811
Shem!

123
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,762
Protect your mother, first and last.

124
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,080
I love you.

125
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,801
Run!

126
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,640
Noah!

127
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,408
<i>Noah!</i>

128
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,325
Noah. Noah. Are you all right?

129
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,567
We are to see Methuselah.
My grandfather.

130
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,041
A child of the old one?

131
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,331
You should have killed them.

132
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,966
But, Samyaza...

133
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,690
This is a man, Og.

134
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,644
Do you forget how
they betrayed The Creator?

135
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,845
It is He who sends us!

136
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,606
It lies!

137
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,843
Leave them here to rot.

138
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,526
What are they?

139
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,210
The Watchers.

140
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,569
Dada?

141
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,401
Sleep now.

142
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,041
Sing to me.

143
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,888
I want my daddy to sing to me.

144
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,091
You know, I, too,
lost my father when I was very young.

145
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,285
There's a song
he used to sing me sometimes

146
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,930
when I couldn't sleep.

147
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,088
Would you like to hear it?

148
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,371
<i>The moon is high</i>

149
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,886
<i>The trees entwine</i>

150
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,806
<i>Your Father waits for thee</i>

151
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,610
<i>To wrap you in His sheltering wings</i>

152
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,921
<i>And whisper you to sleep</i>

153
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,122
<i>Your Father is</i>

154
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,527
<i>The healing wind</i>

155
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,322
<i>That whispers you to sleep</i>

156
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,804
<i>That whispers as you sleep</i>

157
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,444
It's an ugly wound.

158
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,930
She'll never have children.

159
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,687
If the fever doesn't take her,
I think she'll live.

160
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,171
Follow me.

161
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,207
I'm sorry I frightened you.

162
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,971
Watchers have learned to fear men.

163
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,327
Then why are you helping us?

164
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,725
The Creator formed us
on the second day.

165
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,848
The day He made the heavens.

166
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,251
We watched over Adam and Eve.

167
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,204
Saw their frailty and their love.

168
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,205
And then we saw their fall.
And we pitied them.

169
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,723
<i>We were not stone then, but light.</i>

170
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,644
<i>It was not our place to interfere.</i>

171
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,883
<i>Yet we chose to try and help mankind.</i>

172
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,201
<i>And when we disobeyed The Creator,</i>

173
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,769
<i>He punished us.</i>

174
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,401
<i>We were encrusted by your world.</i>

175
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,927
<i>Rock and mud shackled our fiery glow.</i>

176
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,042
<i>Still, we taught mankind
all we knew of Creation.</i>

177
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,889
<i>With our help,</i>

178
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,364
they rose from the dust,
became great and mighty.

179
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,570
But then
they turned our gifts to violence.

180
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,127
<i>Only one man protected us.
Your grandfather Methuselah.</i>

181
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,646
<i>We were hunted. Most of us killed.</i>

182
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,085
<i>Those who lived were left prisoners
in these stony shells,</i>

183
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,891
<i>marooned upon this barren land.</i>

184
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,043
<i>We begged The Creator
to take us home.</i>

185
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,481
<i>But He was always silent.</i>

186
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,324
And now you claim that
you have heard His call.

187
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,721
Samyaza cannot accept this.

188
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,164
A man?
When it is men who broke the world.

189
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,682
But I look at you

190
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,770
and I see a glimmer of Adam again.

191
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,842
The man I knew.

192
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,486
The man I came to help.

193
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,009
Why can't I come?

194
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,527
Because I need you to look after Mother.

195
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,286
Do you understand?

196
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,170
And you look after your father.

197
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,930
Watch over them.

198
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,048
They are in good hands.

199
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,284
Grandfather?

200
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,165
Noah.

201
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,806
This is your great-grandfather.

202
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,050
Show him respect.

203
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,565
Tell him your name.

204
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,361
I am Shem.

205
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,771
My eldest.

206
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,611
Come closer.

207
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,642
Let me see you. You're a lucky boy.

208
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,445
I think
you must have your mother's looks,

209
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,204
not your father's.

210
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,281
Come tell me about yourself.

211
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,769
So, what do you like most in the world?

212
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,886
Berries.

213
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,041
What?

214
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,246
Berries.

215
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,890
Berries, yes.

216
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,129
What can compete with
fresh, ripe berries? Nothing.

217
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,966
Yes, it's been so long I can barely
remember the taste of them.

218
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,201
Tell me, did you bring me any?

219
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,281
No?

220
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,202
I'm craving them now.

221
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,282
Well, perhaps one day.

222
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,727
You must be tired.
It's a long way up here.

223
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,801
Yeah.

224
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,285
Why not rest?

225
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,208
How perfect.

226
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,765
What we need to discuss
is not for boys.

227
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,806
You know why I've come?

228
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,086
Yes.

229
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,847
Before he walked on,
my father Enoch told me that one day,

230
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,487
if man continued in his ways,

231
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,086
The Creator would annihilate this world.

232
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,685
So what I saw is true?

233
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,406
All life blotted out
because of what man has done?

234
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,124
Can it not be averted?

235
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,171
Noah, you must trust that He speaks
in a way that you can understand.

236
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,009
So you tell me.

237
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,162
Can this destruction be averted?

238
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,681
No.

239
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,640
He sent me here.

240
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,651
Why send me
if there's nothing I can do to stop it?

241
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,409
Well, perhaps He simply sends you here
to share a cup of tea with an old man.

242
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,442
So, is that all you saw?

243
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,683
The fires of destruction on this place?

244
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,048
No, not fire.

245
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,407
- Water.
- Water?

246
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,128
My father said it would be fire.

247
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,885
I saw water. Death by water.

248
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,525
I saw death.

249
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,880
And I saw new life.

250
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,768
There's something more, Grandfather.

251
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,081
Something I'm to do. I know it.

252
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,083
I just didn't see what it was.

253
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,245
New life.

254
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,444
Well, perhaps
there is more for you to see.

255
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,281
Did He not send you here to
drink a cup of tea with an old man?

256
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,089
The medicine always tastes bad.

257
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,166
She was the only one moving.

258
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,401
Was she hurt badly?

259
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,562
She had a big cut on her belly.

260
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,325
Mother helped and I held her hand.

261
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,324
That must have made her feel safe.

262
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,441
Well?

263
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,370
Fire consumes all.

264
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,410
Water cleanses.

265
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,364
It separates the foul from the pure.
The wicked from the innocent.

266
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,288
And that which sinks
from that which rises.

267
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,365
He destroys all,

268
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,686
but only to start again.

269
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,966
You sure?

270
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,531
Yes.

271
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,083
The storm cannot be stopped.
But it can be survived.

272
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,201
Yeah.

273
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,049
You may need this.

274
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,610
It's a seed.

275
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,091
From the first Garden.

276
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,529
From Eden.

277
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,804
Remember, Noah,

278
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,565
He chose you for a reason.

279
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,725
You can't get me! You can't get me!

280
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,490
Dada!

281
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,329
My grandfather lives.

282
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,082
He's helped me see
what we're here to do.

283
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,684
Men are going to be punished
for what they've done to this world.

284
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,570
There will be destruction.

285
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,927
There will be tragedy.

286
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,080
And our family
has been chosen for a great task.

287
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,922
We've been chosen
to save the innocent.

288
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,331
The innocent?

289
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,126
The animals.

290
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,965
Why are they innocent?

291
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,286
Because they still live
as they did in the Garden.

292
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,601
Yes.

293
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,442
And we need to save enough of them
to start again.

294
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,050
But what of us?

295
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,122
I guess we get to start again, too.

296
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,403
We get to start again
in a new and better world.

297
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,605
But first

298
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,250
we have to build.

299
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,651
Build what?

300
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,489
A great flood is coming.

301
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,529
The waters of the heavens
will meet the waters of the earth.

302
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,641
We build a vessel to survive the storm.

303
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,162
We build an ark.

304
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,443
Take the traitor back.

305
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,251
He is a child of the old one!

306
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,041
Stop!

307
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,611
There is work to do. Help us.

308
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,648
Help you?

309
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,451
We tried to help your kind once.

310
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,524
And we lost everything because of you!

311
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,201
Not everything.

312
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,886
We can save what is left.
We can serve Him again.

313
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,648
You treacherous snake!

314
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,209
The Creator.

315
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,729
Children!

316
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,840
What is this?

317
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,051
This...

318
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,724
This is our ark.

319
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,002
We will help this man.

320
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,764
No!

321
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,486
Shem.

322
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,811
Wait.

323
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,967
Please.

324
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,121
It still hurts?

325
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,485
Ham!

326
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,483
Shem!

327
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,329
He doesn't have anyone.

328
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,047
Come.

329
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,160
Father, did you see them?

330
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,571
Father?

331
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,406
Yes, Japheth.

332
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,805
It begins.

333
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,160
Ready?

334
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,884
It sleeps.

335
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,085
Gently.

336
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,170
See, that's a boy one
and that's a girl one.

337
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,085
After the storm,
they'll become a mother and a father.

338
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,050
And the hatchlings will spread
right across the world.

339
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,489
We have to be gentle with them

340
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,369
and we have to be protective.

341
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,441
If something were to happen,

342
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,046
that would be
a small piece of Creation lost forever.

343
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,884
All of these innocent creatures
are now in our care.

344
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,042
It's ourjob to look after them.

345
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,882
Father?

346
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,724
All the birds are two.

347
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,930
You have Mother, Shem has Ila.

348
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,010
But what of me?

349
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,926
What of Japheth?

350
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,124
Who is there for us?

351
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,163
Did you see how He made the forest
to give us wood for the ark?

352
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,129
How He sent the birds?

353
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,646
So,

354
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,283
hasn't He sent everything we need?

355
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,206
Mother!

356
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,291
What is it? What?

357
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,771
Snakes!

358
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,848
- Snakes are coming, too?
- Yeah.

359
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,801
All that creeps, all that crawls,
all that slithers.

360
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,250
It's all right.

361
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,524
Father! Father!

362
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,526
Don't be afraid.

363
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,361
No one will hurt this boy.

364
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,401
What's your name?

365
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,206
- Ham.
- Ham?

366
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,523
I am Tubal-cain.

367
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,250
Do you know me?

368
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,924
You don't know your king?

369
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,045
My father says there can be no king
in The Creator's garden.

370
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,647
Ham, come here.

371
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,121
Do not take my best soldier.

372
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,724
He's nothing of yours.

373
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,202
Look at his hand on that weapon.
I believe he is something of mine.

374
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,121
Ham.

375
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,961
Leave it.

376
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,411
- No, he gave it to me.
- Do what I tell you.

377
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,685
When I heard talk of miracles,
I dismissed them.

378
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,124
But then I saw the birds
with my own eyes, flying here,

379
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,406
and I had to come.

380
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,406
There isn't anything for you here.

381
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,845
No?

382
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,400
This all belongs to me.

383
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,881
This land. This forest.

384
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,049
That stronghold of yours.

385
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,002
Did you really think you could
protect yourself from me in that?

386
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,407
It's not protection from you.

387
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,845
Then what is it?

388
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,606
An ark

389
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,842
to hold the innocent

390
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,440
when The Creator sends his deluge
to wipe out the wicked from this world.

391
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,648
The Creator does not care
what happens in this world.

392
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,883
Nobody has heard from Him
since He marked Cain.

393
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,161
We are alone.

394
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,402
Orphaned children,

395
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,401
cursed to struggle by
the sweat of our brow to survive.

396
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,888
Damned if I don't do everything
it takes to do just that.

397
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,571
Damned if I don't take what I want.

398
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,850
We have met?

399
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,411
I am the son of Lamech!

400
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,167
Eight generations descended from Seth!

401
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,242
Return to your cities of Cain!

402
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,529
Know we have all been judged!

403
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,924
I have men at my back,
and you stand alone and defy me?

404
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,371
I'm not alone.

405
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,250
Take the children!

406
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,970
Do not fear, my people!

407
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,447
Don't be afraid! Stand!

408
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,521
Hold your line, men.

409
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,646
His minions, they're with you?

410
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,202
Miracles? A deluge, you claim?

411
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,084
Well, perhaps you're right.

412
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,726
Perhaps casting us out of Paradise
was not enough.

413
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,964
Perhaps, He returns to finish us off.

414
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,243
Well, if He does,

415
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,369
I will ride the storm in that ship of yours.

416
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,081
There is no escape
for you and your kind.

417
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,804
Your time is done.

418
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,488
- The land is dying.
- Ham.

419
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,803
- The cities are dead.
- Don't listen to him.

420
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,684
My people follow me!

421
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,647
And more will follow them!

422
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,403
I'm not afraid of miracles,
son of Lamech!

423
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,482
If you refuse my dozens now,

424
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,729
I shall return with legions!

425
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,721
Move.

426
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,684
Father?

427
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,363
Will so many really come?

428
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,603
We need to finish as fast as we can.

429
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,251
The sooner He sends the rain,
the better.

430
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,530
Until then, we're safer inside.

431
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,085
We build.

432
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,921
First weapons, then men.

433
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,687
Feed only those that will fight.

434
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,844
Arm them, train them,

435
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,491
and there is nothing they can't do.

436
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,127
With an army,
we can crush those giants.

437
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,842
Please, we're hungry!

438
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,570
- Give us meat.
- Our children are starving.

439
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,880
Please help us!

440
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,765
Let us go!

441
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,804
We're starving!

442
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,250
Should I come back?

443
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,645
No.

444
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,882
Do you think
those men are going to attack us?

445
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,565
When the rain comes.

446
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,210
What do you think it'll be like?

447
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,808
I've imagined it.

448
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,922
Seeing that much death,

449
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,484
I'm not sure there are words.

450
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,291
The end of everything.

451
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,082
The beginning.
The beginning of everything.

452
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,561
So what is it?

453
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,321
Whatever he's done or said,
Shem is very fond of you.

454
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,322
Shem needs a woman.

455
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,924
A real woman.

456
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,490
He should have a family.

457
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,485
I can't give any of that to him.

458
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,890
And I'm not going to
deny him those things,

459
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,450
even if he wants me to.

460
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,043
I won't do it.

461
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,281
Besides,

462
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,807
why would The Creator
want a barren girl on His ark?

463
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,250
Ila. Ila.

464
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,123
When we first took you in,

465
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,647
I thought you were going to be a burden.

466
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,007
And I didn't want to see
anybody else ruined by this world.

467
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,850
But I was wrong.

468
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,006
You're a gift.

469
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,083
A precious, precious gift.

470
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,365
Just don't forget
how precious a gift you are.

471
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,087
I know you'll be going to find wives
for Ham and Japheth.

472
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,046
- You should find one for Shem, too.
-lla.

473
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,811
Where do you think you're going?

474
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,245
Please, please don't take my baby!

475
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,167
Let them go! Please!

476
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,129
Sorry, we have to eat!

477
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,726
Don't take my baby! No!

478
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,367
Don't take my baby!
No, no, please will you stop him?

479
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,204
Let them go!

480
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,241
No!

481
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,243
Quit struggling! It'll be easier.

482
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,048
Come with me! Stop struggling!

483
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,128
You! You!

484
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,246
I have two girls! I have two girls to trade!

485
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,249
Take the girls! Give me the meat!

486
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,447
Give it to me!

487
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,801
What happened?

488
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,166
All of this should be inside by now.

489
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,327
The storm is coming.

490
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,640
What about our wives? Where are they?

491
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,960
Did you not hear what I just said?

492
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,121
But when are they coming?

493
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,086
There will be no wives.

494
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,644
What? What? No!

495
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,848
You said that The Creator
would give us what we'll need.

496
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,922
- Help your brother.
- No.

497
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,764
Listen. Listen, you can't do this!

498
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,729
You can't.
How am I supposed to be a man?

499
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,086
I said help your brother.

500
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,930
You want me to stay a child!

501
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,525
No!

502
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,526
I'm asking you to be a man
and do what needs to be done.

503
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,601
Ham!

504
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,081
Ham!

505
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,730
What are you doing, Noah?

506
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,168
The wickedness is not just in them.

507
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,690
It's in all of us.

508
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,326
I saw it.

509
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,481
No.

510
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,921
Noah.

511
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,644
There's goodness in us.

512
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,404
Look at our boys.

513
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,324
Shem's loyalty. Japheth's kindness.

514
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,600
Ham's integrity.

515
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,446
Good men.

516
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,163
They'd be good fathers.

517
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,409
Shem is blinded by desire.

518
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,404
Ham is covetous.

519
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,727
And Japheth lives only to please.

520
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,001
I am no better.

521
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,770
And you?

522
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,085
Is there anything you would not do,
good or bad, for those three boys?

523
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,085
We would both choose to kill
in order to protect our children.

524
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,321
Yes.

525
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,011
We're no different.

526
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,764
We were weak and we were selfish
to think we could set ourselves apart.

527
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,206
We will work, complete the task,

528
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,851
and then we'll die.

529
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,922
The same as everyone else.

530
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,851
They are children!

531
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,207
They are our children, Noah!

532
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,805
Have you no mercy?

533
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,002
The time for mercy has passed.

534
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,203
Now our punishment begins.

535
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,165
Ham!

536
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,601
Ham!

537
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,165
Grandfather?

538
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,250
Grandfather?

539
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,610
Did you bring me something?

540
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,607
Did Noah plant the seed I gave him?

541
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,601
Yes.

542
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,004
And in all that forest
there were no berries?

543
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,762
Shem promised me berries.

544
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,121
I'm sorry.

545
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,241
I didn't know.

546
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,086
It's a pity.

547
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,690
Then why did you come here?

548
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,971
It's Noah.

549
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,526
He leaves our boys with no one.

550
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,722
Shem has Ila, but she's barren.

551
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,001
There'll be no other wives,
so no children.

552
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,521
Jusfice.

553
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,841
The Creator destroys this world
because we corrupted it.

554
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,091
So we ourselves must be destroyed.

555
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,171
No. I can't believe that's true.

556
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,482
Not when I look at my sons.

557
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,408
All they desire is love.

558
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,330
Isn't that all their hearts need
to be good?

559
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,161
Who is good? Who is wicked?

560
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,561
How am I supposed to know
what is right?

561
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,569
That choice is Noah's.
Nof mine. Not yours.

562
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,842
It sounds like he has made it.

563
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,843
So then you will not help me?

564
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,363
I don't know if I even could.

565
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,331
But if I tried, it could cause pain
and possibly tragedy.

566
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,447
And in the end,
it would just come back to Noah again.

567
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,651
Is that what you wish?

568
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,407
I want my sons to have children.
I want them to be happy.

569
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,721
I can't bear to think of them dying alone.

570
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,490
Out of the way! Coming through!

571
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,326
Please!

572
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,321
Get away!

573
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,611
No. No, no...

574
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,644
It's all right. It's all right. I'm not...
I'm not going to hurt you.

575
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,611
I have food.

576
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,281
Here.

577
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,445
What do you want?

578
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,205
Nothing.

579
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,450
Are you alone?

580
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,567
Yes.

581
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,640
And you?

582
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,729
I can help you get away.

583
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,881
No.

584
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,527
Well, then, I'll stay a little while.

585
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,568
If that is all right?

586
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,727
My name is Na'el.

587
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,087
Shem!

588
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,289
Go and find them and bring them back.

589
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,321
Be careful.

590
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,484
Ham?

591
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,921
Don't be afraid, granddaughter.

592
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,563
Don't be afraid.

593
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,886
Grandfather?

594
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,280
Yes.

595
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,765
What are you doing down here?

596
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,127
I'm looking for berries. I have a craving.

597
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,004
Come and help me look for them.

598
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,003
My eyes aren't
as good as they used to be.

599
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,281
I have to find Ham.

600
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,845
There's time enough for that.

601
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,251
Come here.

602
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,251
Come.

603
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,080
Come here and help me.

604
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,765
They're here somewhere.

605
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,842
They're here somewhere, berries.

606
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,650
I know there are berries.

607
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,768
There's nothing here, Grandfather.

608
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,442
- Let me take you to Noah.
- No.

609
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,483
No need for that. You go now.

610
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,449
You go.

611
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,562
Wait. Wait.

612
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,889
Ten years you've been with my own.
With my own family.

613
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,450
Ten years. And you love them?

614
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,966
Shem? And Noah?

615
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,210
He saved my life.

616
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,885
Raised me.

617
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,645
Yes, he did.

618
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,126
Yes.

619
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,687
And you are now as his own daughter.

620
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,644
My own great-granddaughter.

621
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,165
Ten years in the shadow of my home,

622
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,524
and yet
I have never given you my blessing.

623
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,321
<i>May n</i>

624
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,050
Ham! Ila!

625
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,642
You can go now. Go to him.

626
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,166
You go. Go now.

627
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,049
Ila!

628
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,051
Ila!

629
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,241
Ila!

630
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,443
We have to get back...

631
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,042
We have to go.

632
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,646
We have to go. Come on. Now!

633
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,486
I am a man. Made in Your image.

634
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,887
Why will You not converse with me?

635
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,244
I give life.

636
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,361
I take life away. As You do!

637
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,770
And I am like You, am I not?

638
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,045
Speak to me.

639
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,889
Speak to me!

640
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,724
It has begun!

641
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,128
Death comes from the heavens!

642
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,964
This rain

643
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,010
is meant to wash us off
the face of this world.

644
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,209
But we are men.

645
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,881
We decide if we live or die.

646
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,883
We are men!

647
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,049
And men united are invincible!

648
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,803
Do you want to live?

649
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,405
Yeah!

650
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,129
We kill the giants!

651
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,049
We kill Noah!

652
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,168
We take the ark!

653
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,480
Yeah!

654
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,965
Noah!

655
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,241
Where's Ham?

656
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,131
Get it off me, no!

657
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,689
No,no,no!

658
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,367
We have to get away!

659
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,522
I won't leave you. I won't!

660
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,561
Ham!

661
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,846
Father, help! Help!

662
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,888
- Help her!
- Help me, please!

663
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,566
Please, help me, please!

664
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,649
Please... Someone please help me!

665
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,165
Help me!

666
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,641
No!

667
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,242
Ham! Ham!

668
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,244
Ham!

669
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,361
Ham!

670
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,807
Ham!

671
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,244
Ham!

672
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,247
Samyaza!

673
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,567
Samyaza! Samyaza!

674
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,210
- Noah!
- Where is Ham?

675
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,362
Ham is through! Quickly!

676
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,610
Run!

677
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,166
Ham.

678
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,725
Ham!

679
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,604
Faster!

680
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,602
Forward!

681
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,447
Protect your mother. Protect them all.

682
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,921
Part!

683
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,168
My Creator,

684
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,049
forgive me.

685
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,444
The Creator brings him home.

686
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,881
Ham?

687
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,287
Ham?

688
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,281
Shem. Shem, go inside.

689
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,684
Go inside.

690
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,166
They are upon us. Go inside!

691
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,562
Good-bye, son of Adam.

692
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,884
Son, where are you?

693
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,251
Ham!

694
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,125
Ham?

695
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,606
Ham?

696
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,680
It's all right.

697
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,201
- Shem!
- Father!

698
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,890
Japheth, where are you?

699
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,007
- Ila, I'm here!
- Father!

700
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,242
Mother, where's Father?

701
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,889
Please, Noah,

702
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,248
there must be something we can do.

703
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,882
We can drag ropes.

704
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,491
They cannot all be soldiers, Father.

705
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,568
They are just people. And there's room.

706
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,928
There is no room for them.

707
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,281
Soon everything we knew will be gone.

708
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,964
All that is left of Creation
will lie within these walls.

709
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,646
Outside,

710
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,690
just the waters of chaos again.

711
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,971
You are angry.

712
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,650
You judge me.

713
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,645
Let me tell you a story.

714
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,611
The first story my father told me,
and the first story that I told each of you.

715
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,364
In the beginning,

716
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,971
there was nothing.

717
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,449
<i>Nothing but the silence
of an infinite darkness.</i>

718
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,288
<i>But the breath of The Creator
fluttered against</i>

719
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,489
<i>the face of the void, whispering,
"Let there be light."</i>

720
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,051
<i>And light was.</i>

721
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,846
<i>And it was good.</i>

722
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,731
<i>The first day.</i>

723
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:59,368
<i>And then the formless light
began to take on substance and shape.</i>

724
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,205
<i>A second day.</i>

725
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,204
<i>And our world was born.</i>

726
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,121
<i>Our beautiful, fragile home.</i>

727
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,371
<i>And a great,
warming light nurtured its days.</i>

728
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,281
<i>And a lesser light ruled the nights.</i>

729
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,764
<i>And there was evening. And morning.</i>

730
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,885
<i>Another day.</i>

731
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,046
<i>And the waters of the world
gathered together,</i>

732
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,768
<i>and in their midst emerged dry land.</i>

733
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,769
<i>Another day passed.</i>

734
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,886
<i>And the ground put forth
the growing things.</i>

735
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,129
<i>A thick blanket of green
stretching across all Creation.</i>

736
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,964
<i>And the waters, too, teemed with life.</i>

737
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,609
<i>Great creatures of the deep
that are no more.</i>

738
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,209
<i>Vast multitudes of fish,</i>

739
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,483
<i>some of which may still
swim beneath these seas.</i>

740
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,771
<i>And soon
the sky was streaming with birds.</i>

741
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,206
<i>And there was evening.</i>

742
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,125
<i>And there was morning. A fifth day.</i>

743
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,090
<i>Now the whole world
was full of living beings.</i>

744
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,800
<i>Everything that creeps,
everything that crawls,</i>

745
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,803
<i>and every beast
that walks upon the ground.</i>

746
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,242
<i>And it was good. It was all good.</i>

747
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,607
<i>There was light and air and water
and soil, all clean and unspoiled.</i>

748
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,127
<i>There were plants and fish
and fowl and beast,</i>

749
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,810
<i>each after their own kind.</i>

750
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,451
<i>All part of the greater whole.
All in their place.</i>

751
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,690
<i>And all was in balance. It was paradise.</i>

752
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,008
<i>A jewel in The Creator's palm.</i>

753
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,927
<i>Then The Creator made Man.
And by his side, Woman.</i>

754
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,288
<i>Father and mother of us all.</i>

755
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,641
<i>He gave them a choice.</i>

756
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,042
<i>Follow the temptation of darkness</i>

757
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,044
<i>or hold on to the blessing of light.</i>

758
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,720
<i>But they ate from the forbidden fruit.</i>

759
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,649
<i>Their innocence was extinguished.</i>

760
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,968
<i>And so for the ten generations
since Adam, sin has walked within us.</i>

761
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,321
<i>Brother against brother.</i>

762
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,768
<i>Nation against nation.</i>

763
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,248
<i>Man against Creation.</i>

764
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,925
<i>We murdered each other.</i>

765
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,246
<i>We broke the world. We did this.</i>

766
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,449
<i>Man did this.</i>

767
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,321
<i>Everything that was beautiful,</i>

768
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,444
<i>everything that was good,</i>

769
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,531
<i>we shattered.</i>

770
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,522
<i>Now, it begins again.</i>

771
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,002
Air, water, earth, plant,
fish, bird and beast.

772
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,844
Paradise returns.

773
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,845
But this time,

774
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,929
this time there will be no men.

775
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,241
If we were to enter the Garden again,

776
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,207
it would only be to destroy it once more.

777
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,361
No.

778
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,242
The Creator has judged us.

779
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,962
Mankind must end.

780
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,206
Shem and Ila,

781
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,768
you will bury your mother and I.

782
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,129
Ham, you will bury them.

783
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,771
Japheth will lay you to rest.

784
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,491
You, Japheth,

785
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,881
you will be the last man.

786
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:35,567
And in time you, too,
will return to the dust.

787
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:40,402
Creation will be left alone,
safe and beautiful.

788
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,008
I'm very sorry about that girl.

789
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,007
And I'm sorry for you.

790
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,730
But we have been entrusted with a task
much greater than our own desires.

791
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,290
Ham.

792
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,570
Noah...

793
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,328
Does he know I'm here?

794
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,524
- Does he know I'm here?
- No, no, no. No.

795
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,649
Why are you helping me?

796
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,885
There was a girl.

797
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,844
I tried to bring her.

798
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,602
But he just let her die.

799
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,920
And now you want revenge.

800
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,371
No.

801
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,005
Yes, you do.

802
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,129
Yes, you do.

803
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,410
There's no more land.

804
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,328
Everything out there must be dead.

805
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,604
It had to be what He wanted.

806
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,923
A world without man.

807
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,485
You see that, don't you?

808
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,651
VVhatlsee

809
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,922
is how hard this was for you to do

810
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,968
as a man who respects life,

811
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,809
a man who loves his children.

812
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,449
You've been strong.

813
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,891
But it's done.

814
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,450
It's done now.

815
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,848
And you can put that burden down.

816
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,130
Noah.

817
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,360
It's all right.

818
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,806
If your father found me,
he would kill me.

819
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,483
We must be ready, but I am too weak.

820
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,641
What are you doing?

821
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,241
I must get my strength back.

822
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,322
The beasts are precious.
There are only two of each.

823
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,046
And there is only one of me.

824
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:02,203
But the rain, all these miracles,
are for them.

825
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,001
Them?

826
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,164
Your father fills a ship with beasts
while children drown.

827
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,611
He belittles you
by telling you you must serve them.

828
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:12,886
No.

829
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,411
They serve us.

830
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,682
That is the greatness of men.

831
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,371
When The Creator
finished making the sky,

832
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,926
the ground, the sea, and this beast,

833
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,810
He wasn't satisfied.

834
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,043
He needed something greater.

835
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:37,284
Something to take dominion over it
and subdue it.

836
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,881
So He made us in His image.

837
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,206
Us.

838
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,889
This is your world, Ham.

839
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,440
Seize it.

840
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,765
Ila.

841
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,002
Grandfather.

842
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,846
What is it?

843
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,369
You're not sick.

844
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,089
But that's impossible.

845
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,643
What? What is it?

846
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,122
Noah.

847
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,970
It is his grandchild.

848
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,321
What's wrong?

849
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,684
- Father.
- Noah.

850
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,607
We've come to ask for your blessing.

851
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,525
I don't understand.

852
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,005
I am with Child.

853
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:10,921
It's not possible.

854
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,401
You're barren.

855
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,246
You can't conceive. How...

856
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,322
- How is that possible?
- Grandfather.

857
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,211
I asked Grandfather...

858
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,281
To what?

859
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,044
Undermine The Creator?

860
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,521
To give our children a future.

861
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,090
To give humanity a future.

862
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,124
Have you any idea what you've done?

863
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,807
All those lives! All those people!

864
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,120
For nothing!

865
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,321
Do you know what this forces me to do?

866
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,286
No!

867
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,691
Please! Please!

868
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,285
Please!

869
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:28,002
I cannot do this!
Tell me I don't need to do this!

870
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,411
Please.

871
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:34,600
Have I not done
everything that You asked of me?

872
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,649
Is that not enough?

873
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,442
Why do You not answer me?

874
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,009
Why?

875
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,444
I will not fail You.

876
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,648
I will not fail You.

877
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,484
I will not fail You.

878
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,410
It shall be done.

879
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,605
It shall be done.

880
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,761
Father?

881
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,085
The rains have stopped.

882
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,971
The Creator smiles on our child.

883
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,681
The rains have stopped
because of your child, yes,

884
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,728
but He does not smile.

885
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,800
If your child is a boy,

886
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,885
he will replace Japheth, last man.

887
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,050
Ir it is a girl,

888
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:39,561
who could mature into a mother,

889
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,090
she must die.

890
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,724
Are you mad?

891
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,085
That is my Child!

892
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,970
If you should bear a girl,

893
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,761
in the moment of her birth,
I will cut her down.

894
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:58,046
Mother!

895
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,130
Mother, my bird!

896
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,082
Nothing. No mud.

897
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,721
Nothing.

898
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,324
We still have to go.

899
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,847
Ila,

900
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,843
there's nothing.

901
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,887
There's nothing out there.

902
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,521
You have food and water for how long?
VVeeks?

903
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,682
- A month?
- A month.

904
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,441
Please wait.

905
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:00,160
Wait until the bird finds land. Please.

906
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,561
Japheth, send him again.

907
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,210
- He's too tired.
- Then wake another.

908
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:05,881
Here.

909
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:10,211
Please. One that can find us a home.

910
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,006
No.

911
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,610
We leave today.

912
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:54,089
They will die out there.

913
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,808
Not if they stay.

914
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,251
And let you kill their Child?

915
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,206
Noah.

916
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:09,921
Noah!

917
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,850
I did this.

918
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,049
I did this, Noah!

919
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,565
Please!

920
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:20,970
Punish me!

921
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,291
Punish me, Noah!

922
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:26,970
Not them.

923
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,124
Not the child.

924
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,811
Please.

925
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,048
The child is not being punished.

926
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,886
We are all being punished.

927
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,564
All of us.

928
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,682
It's not something I want to do.

929
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:51,962
It's something I have to do.

930
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,726
It is painful,

931
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,086
but it is just.

932
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:09,486
Just?

933
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,680
How?

934
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,211
How is this just?

935
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,322
It's a baby, Noah.

936
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:27,726
If you hold to this,

937
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:31,805
you will lose your sons, you will lose Ila,

938
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,209
you will lose me.

939
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,522
I love you, Noah.

940
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:47,010
And I have followed you everywhere.

941
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,809
Through everything.

942
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,962
I forgave you.

943
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,203
When everyone was dead, I forgave you.

944
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,045
I was ready to die with you.

945
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,564
But this

946
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:02,445
I will never forgive.

947
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,524
Boy or girl, I will never forgive!

948
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,922
And you will die alone!
Not just alone, but hated!

949
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,964
Hated by everyone you love!

950
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,244
That is just!

951
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,089
That is just.

952
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,441
It's time.

953
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,166
Bring him through there.

954
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,330
One blow will finish it.

955
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,450
Just in case, huh?

956
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,483
I don't know if I can.

957
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,005
He killed your woman.

958
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:42,401
And now
he plots to kill your brother's firstborn.

959
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,641
Is that what you want?

960
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:48,085
You want your sister to die on the seas?

961
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:52,086
A man isn't ruled by the heavens.

962
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,847
A man is ruled by his will.

963
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,843
So I ask you,

964
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,850
are you a man?

965
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:09,681
Good.

966
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:13,007
Because if you're a man,

967
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,091
you can kill.

968
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,843
But he won't follow me.

969
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,051
Thank you, Japheth.

970
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,282
You take care of that baby.

971
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,247
Don't be afraid, Mother.

972
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:49,725
We'll see each other in the new world.

973
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,087
Father.

974
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,805
No!

975
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,206
How could you?

976
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,442
I thought you were good!

977
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,931
I thought that's why He chose you.

978
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,085
He chose me because
He knew I would complete the task,

979
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,486
nothing more, son.

980
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,603
Mother.

981
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,131
Mother.

982
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,480
It's your time.

983
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,089
Come. Come with me.

984
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:51,967
You're all right.

985
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,690
Japheth, stand back.

986
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,888
Come now. Come inside.

987
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:05,209
That's right. That's right.

988
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:09,171
You're all right, Ila. You're safe here.

989
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,410
Please keep it inside.

990
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,881
Your baby's coming.

991
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,725
Your baby's coming, Ila.

992
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,484
Don't think about anything else.

993
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:00,931
Father! Father, they're awake!

994
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,604
They're awake!
They're eating each other!

995
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,682
- The beasts.
- What?

996
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,290
Come.

997
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,885
Come!

998
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:13,961
It's not possible for them
to have woken up without our help.

999
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,326
Which way, son?

1000
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,649
That's right. That's right.

1001
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,811
The line of Cain.

1002
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,126
I told you,

1003
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,844
I'm not afraid of miracles.

1004
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:30,291
That's right.

1005
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:32,606
A bit more.

1006
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,001
Boy or girl?

1007
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,806
What's happening?

1008
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,651
There's another.

1009
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,484
Two?

1010
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:11,161
Twins.

1011
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,363
Mother, so?

1012
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,011
I'm sorry.

1013
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,769
I'm so sorry.

1014
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,441
Sisters.

1015
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,443
No.

1016
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:56,241
No!

1017
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,001
No!

1018
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:01,686
He will not touch our daughters.

1019
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,807
No! Shem!

1020
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,124
Shem!

1021
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,282
I should have killed you
when I killed your father.

1022
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:18,726
Well, now we finish it. Now!

1023
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:06,926
The evils of mankind
will not live in this new Eden.

1024
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,483
Leave us! Leave us alone!

1025
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,329
He's mine!

1026
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:31,330
The ark, the beasts,
and all of your women are now mine.

1027
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:35,525
I will build a new world in my image!

1028
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,330
Now you are a man.

1029
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,888
The Creator has not forgotten us.

1030
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,850
Her name was Na'el.

1031
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,524
She was innocent.

1032
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,004
She was good.

1033
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:05,289
It's a boy. It's a boy.

1034
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:07,124
- It's a boy.
- Move away.

1035
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,565
It's a boy.

1036
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,769
Where is she?

1037
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,611
Where is she?

1038
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:28,003
No. No. No.

1039
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,407
You can't.

1040
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:34,288
They're beautiful.

1041
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,325
They?

1042
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:39,771
You can't kill two.

1043
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,842
He sent us what we need.

1044
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:45,006
No.No.No!

1045
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,205
You can't!

1046
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:49,930
No!

1047
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:51,690
Noah!

1048
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:53,250
Ila!

1049
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:00,601
Noah.

1050
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:01,886
Please.

1051
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,528
These are my children!

1052
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:06,931
Your grandchildren!

1053
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,530
I will not be stopped.

1054
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:10,523
I know I cannot stop you,
but they're crying!

1055
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,841
Please don't let them die crying.

1056
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:16,042
Let me calm them.

1057
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:20,286
Please, just let them be at peace.

1058
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:33,286
<i>The moon is high</i>

1059
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,886
<i>The leaves entwine</i>

1060
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:40,967
<i>Your Father waits for thee</i>

1061
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:49,250
<i>To wrap you in His sheltering wings</i>

1062
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:53,801
<i>To whisper you to sleep</i>

1063
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,571
<i>To wrap you in</i>

1064
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,688
<i>His welcoming arms</i>

1065
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,050
<i>Till the night sky breaks</i>

1066
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:12,251
<i>Your Father is the healing wind</i>

1067
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:16,887
<i>That whispers you to sleep</i>

1068
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,365
<i>That whispers as</i>

1069
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,011
<i>You sleep</i>

1070
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:34,330
You do not need to see this.

1071
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,880
I will hold them.

1072
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,008
Do it quickly.

1073
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,890
Do it quickly!

1074
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,250
I cannot do this.

1075
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,370
It's all right.

1076
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:00,244
Hide your eyes, Japheth.

1077
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:29,807
- Ham?
- He's here.

1078
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:15,405
You don't have to go.

1079
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:20,523
I don't belong here.

1080
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,050
For what it's worth,

1081
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:27,565
I'm glad that it begins again with you.

1082
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,884
Maybe we'll learn to be kind.

1083
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,451
Will he come back?

1084
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:27,121
Some things cannot be unbroken.

1085
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:37,290
I have to know...

1086
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:41,442
Why did you spare them?

1087
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:46,323
I looked down at those two little girls,

1088
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,562
and all I had in my heart was love.

1089
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,650
Then why are you alone, Noah?

1090
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:57,681
Why are you separated
from your family?

1091
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,011
Because I failed Him.

1092
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,651
And I failed all of you.

1093
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:09,521
Did you?

1094
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:18,367
He chose you for a reason, Noah.

1095
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:24,251
He showed you the wickedness of man
and knew you would not look away.

1096
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:28,006
But then you saw goodness, too.

1097
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:33,564
The choice was put in your hands
because He put it there.

1098
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:37,446
He asked you to decide
if we were worth saving.

1099
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,930
And you chose mercy.

1100
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:47,890
You chose love.

1101
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:55,250
He has given us a second chance.

1102
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,721
Be a father.

1103
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,002
<i>Be a grandfather.</i>

1104
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,367
<i>Help us to do better this time.</i>

1105
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:11,129
<i>Help us start again.</i>

1106
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:25,047
The Creator made Adam in His image,

1107
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:29,050
and placed the world in his care.

1108
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:30,571
That birthright

1109
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:34,364
was passed down to us.

1110
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:42,603
To my father, then to me,
and to my sons,

1111
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:45,201
Shem,

1112
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,361
Japheth,

1113
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,048
and Ham.

1114
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:05,521
That birthright is now passed to you,

1115
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,046
our grandchildren.

1116
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:15,369
This will be your work,

1117
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,088
and your responsibility.

1118
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:22,850
So I say to you,

1119
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:27,442
be fruitful and multiply

1120
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:31,482
and replenish the earth.
