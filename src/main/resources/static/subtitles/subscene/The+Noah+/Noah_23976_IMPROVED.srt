1
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,960
From Adam to Seth, from Seth
to Enosh...

2
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,568
Enosh to Kenan, Kenan to
Mahalalel...

3
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,804
to my father, Methuselah, then
to me.

4
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,168
Today, that birthright passes
to you...

5
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,366
Noah.

6
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,522
My son.

7
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,446
The Creator made Adam in
His image...

8
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,364
and then placed the world
in his care.

9
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,210
This is your work now.
Your responsibility.

10
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,329
May you walk alongside The
Creator in righteousness.

11
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,323
So I say to you...

12
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,851
The Shrine of Seth!

13
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,968
Men.

14
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,610
Hide.

15
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,408
We mine here.

16
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,490
The ground is rich with tzohar.

17
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,288
This is The Creator's land.
What are you doing?

18
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,684
The Creator?

19
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,928
My mines run dry.

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,810
My city withers and must be fed.

21
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,929
And what has He done?

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,449
He cursed us to struggle by the
sweat of our brow to survive!

23
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,605
Damned if I don't do everything
it takes to do just that.

24
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,123
Damned if I don't take
what I want.

25
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,083
This relic belongs to the
descendants of Cain now.

26
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,962
The line of Seth ends here.

27
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,808
It is ours.
Now, dig!

28
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,641
Ham.

29
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,481
What are you doing?

30
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,447
It's pretty.

31
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,245
You see those other flowers?

32
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,730
How they're attached to
the ground?

33
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,644
That's where they should be.

34
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,210
They have a purpose.

35
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,281
They sprout.

36
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,123
And they bloom.

37
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,050
The wind takes their seeds,
and more flowers grow.

38
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,004
We only collect what we can use,
and what we need.

39
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,566
Do you understand?

40
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,327
Shem.

41
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,887
Ham.

42
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,246
Let's go.

43
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,051
Men.
Hide, hide.

44
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,043
Go.

45
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,124
You found our kill.

46
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,402
How fortunate.

47
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,807
But for you maybe not.

48
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,208
You know how long it is since
we ate meat?

49
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,650
Since we even saw an animal?

50
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,891
Easy.

51
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,042
Please.
What do you want?

52
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
Justice.

53
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,360
Why did they kill it?

54
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,566
They eat them.

55
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,401
Why?

56
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,243
They think it makes them stronger.

57
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,485
Is it true?

58
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,010
They forget strength comes
from The Creator.

59
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,651
Mama!

60
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,326
Mommy!

61
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,411
See your brothers?

62
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,845
Ham saw men hunting today.

63
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,002
They are getting closer.

64
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,520
How was he?

65
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,008
A little too interested.

66
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,484
He had to see it sometime.

67
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,529
I saw something else.

68
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,530
A flower...

69
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,482
bloom from nothing.

70
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,681
Rest.

71
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,081
Perhaps He will finally make
things right.

72
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,245
Methuselah.

73
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,446
Did He speak to you?

74
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,045
I think so.

75
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,010
Will He help us?

76
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,850
He's going to destroy the world.

77
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,689
It's a long and dangerous journey
for the boys.

78
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,200
How do you know your grandfather's
still alive?

79
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,281
I don't.

80
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,520
I saw his mountain.

81
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,888
We need to go and find out if
he knows what we're to do.

82
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,327
Shem.
Can you help me with this?

83
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,370
We could take the boys and
find a place to hide.

84
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,649
There'll be no hiding.

85
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,451
We should have left already.

86
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,762
Ham, let me show you how to
do that.

87
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,847
Push it in here.

88
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,331
Next time we come through...

89
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,767
we'll know we've got certain
things we might need.

90
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,368
There are cities ahead.

91
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,442
We will not get too close.

92
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,843
Is that a Tzohar mine?

93
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,127
It was once.
Before they dug it all up.

94
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,124
Should we go around?

95
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,761
No.

96
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,610
Do you think they're all dead?

97
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,961
It looks that way.

98
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,042
They must have been scavenging
here.

99
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,122
And someone scavenged from them.

100
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,844
Dada!

101
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,323
Stay close.

102
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,166
Father!

103
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,321
Here!

104
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,366
May I see?

105
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,371
Let me see.

106
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,362
Tell me your name.

107
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,050
You have a name?

108
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,360
Ila.

109
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,408
My name is Ila.

110
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,527
Ila.

111
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,289
You're going to be all right,
Ila.

112
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,404
This is Shem.

113
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,362
He's going to hold your hand
tight, and he won't let go.

114
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,806
Up the hill!
Hurry! Hurry!

115
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,844
We have to go.
Now.

116
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,520
Up the hill.
Run.

117
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,406
We can't go there.

118
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,409
We have no choice.
Hurry!

119
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,725
Hold, men!
Hold!

120
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,966
The giants!

121
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,721
They'll kill you!

122
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,811
Shem!

123
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,762
Protect your mother, first
and last.

124
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,080
I love you.

125
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,801
Run!

126
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,640
Noah!

127
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,408
Noah!

128
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,325
Noah. Noah.
Are you all right?

129
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,567
We are to see Methuselah.
My grandfather.

130
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,041
A child of the old one?

131
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,331
You should have killed them.

132
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,966
But, Samyaza...

133
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,690
This is a man, Og.

134
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,644
Do you forget how they betrayed
The Creator?

135
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,845
It is He who sends us!

136
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,606
It lies!

137
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,843
Leave them here to rot.

138
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,526
What are they?

139
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,210
The Watchers.

140
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,569
Dada?

141
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,401
Sleep now.

142
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,041
Sing to me.

143
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,888
I want my daddy to sing to me.

144
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,091
You know, I, too, lost my father
when I was very young.

145
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,285
There's a song he used to
sing me sometimes...

146
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,930
when I couldn't sleep.

147
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,088
Would you like to hear it?

148
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,371
The moon is high.

149
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,886
The trees entwine.

150
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,806
Your Father waits for thee...

151
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,610
to wrap you in His sheltering
wings...

152
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,921
and whisper you to sleep.

153
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,122
Your Father is...

154
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,527
the healing wind...

155
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,322
that whispers you to sleep.

156
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,804
That whispers as you sleep.

157
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,444
It's an ugly wound.

158
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,930
She'll never have children.

159
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,687
If the fever doesn't take her,
I think she'll live.

160
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,171
Follow me.

161
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,207
I'm sorry I frightened you.

162
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,971
Watchers have learned to
fear men.

163
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,327
Then why are you helping us?

164
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,725
The Creator formed us on the
second day.

165
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,848
The day He made the heavens.

166
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,251
We watched over Adam and Eve.

167
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,204
Saw their frailty and their
love.

168
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,205
And then we saw their fall.
And we pitied them.

169
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,723
We were not stone then, but
light.

170
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,644
It was not our place to interfere.

171
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,883
Yet we chose to try and help
mankind.

172
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,201
And when we disobeyed The
Creator...

173
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,769
He punished us.

174
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,401
We were encrusted by your world.

175
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,927
Rock and mud shackled our fiery
glow.

176
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,042
Still, we taught mankind all
we knew of Creation.

177
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,889
With our help...

178
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,364
they rose from the dust, became
great and mighty.

179
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,570
But then they turned our gifts
to violence.

180
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,127
Only one man protected us.
Your grandfather Methuselah.

181
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,646
We were hunted.
Most of us killed.

182
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,173
Those who lived...

183
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:26,184
were left prisoners in these
stony shells...

184
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,891
marooned upon this barren land.

185
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,043
We begged The Creator to take
us home.

186
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,481
But He was always silent.

187
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,324
And now you claim that you have
heard His call.

188
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,721
Samyaza cannot accept this.

189
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,164
A man? When it is men who
broke the world.

190
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,682
But I look at you...

191
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,770
and I see a glimmer of Adam,
again.

192
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,842
The man I knew.

193
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,486
The man I came to help.

194
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,009
Why can't I come?

195
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,527
Because I need you to look
after Mother.

196
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,286
Do you understand?

197
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,170
And you look after your father.

198
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,930
Watch over them.

199
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,048
They are in good hands.

200
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,284
Grandfather?

201
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,165
Noah.

202
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,806
This is your great-grandfather.

203
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,050
Show him respect.

204
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,565
Tell him your name.

205
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,361
I am Shem.

206
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,771
My eldest.

207
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,611
Come closer.

208
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,642
Let me see you.
You're a lucky boy.

209
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,445
I think you must have your
mother's looks...

210
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,204
not your father's.

211
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,281
Come tell me about yourself.

212
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,769
So, what do you like most, in
the world?

213
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,886
Berries.

214
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,041
What?

215
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,246
Berries.

216
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,890
Berries, yes.

217
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,129
What can compete with fresh,
ripe berries? Nothing.

218
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,331
Yes, it's been so long...

219
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:32,259
I can barely remember the taste
of them.

220
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,201
Tell me, did you bring me any?

221
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,281
No?

222
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,202
I'm craving them now.

223
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,282
Well, perhaps one day.

224
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,727
You must be tired.
It's a long way, up here.

225
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,801
Yeah.

226
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,285
Why not rest?

227
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,208
How perfect.

228
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,765
What we need to discuss is not
for boys.

229
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,806
You know why I've come?

230
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,086
Yes.

231
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,847
Before he walked on, my father
Enoch told me that one day...

232
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,487
if man continued in his ways...

233
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,086
The Creator would annihilate
this world.

234
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,685
So what I saw is true?

235
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,406
All life blotted out because
of what man has done?

236
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,124
Can it not be averted?

237
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,827
Noah, you must trust that He
speaks in a way...

238
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:34,357
that you can understand.
So, you tell me.

239
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:36,162
Can this destruction be averted?

240
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,681
No.

241
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,640
He sent me here.

242
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,651
Why send me if there's nothing
I can do to stop it?

243
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,395
Well, perhaps He simply sends
you here...

244
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:56,140
to share a cup of tea with
an old man.

245
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,442
So, is that all you saw?

246
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,683
The fires of destruction on
this place?

247
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,048
No, not fire.

248
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,407
Water.
Water?

249
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,128
My father said it would be fire.

250
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,885
I saw water.
Death by water.

251
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,525
I saw death.

252
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,880
And I saw new life.

253
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,768
There's something more,
Grandfather.

254
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,081
Something I'm to do.
I know it.

255
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,083
I just didn't see what it was.

256
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,245
New life.

257
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,444
Well, perhaps there is more
for you to see.

258
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,281
Did He not send you here to drink
a cup of tea with an old man?

259
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,089
The medicine always tastes bad.

260
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,166
She was the only one moving.

261
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,401
Was she hurt badly?

262
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,562
She had a big cut on her belly.

263
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,325
Mother helped and I held her
hand.

264
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,324
That must have made her feel
safe.

265
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,441
Well?

266
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,370
Fire consumes all.

267
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,410
Water cleanses.

268
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,374
It separates the foul from the
pure.

269
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:15,681
The wicked from the innocent.

270
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,288
And that which sinks from that
which rises.

271
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,365
He destroys all...

272
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,686
but only to start again.

273
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,966
You sure?

274
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,531
Yes.

275
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,083
The storm cannot be stopped.
But it can be survived.

276
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,201
Yeah.

277
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,049
You may need this.

278
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,610
It's a seed.

279
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,091
From the first Garden.

280
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,529
From Eden.

281
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,804
Remember, Noah...

282
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,565
He chose you for a reason.

283
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,725
You can't get me!
You can't get me!

284
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,490
Dada!

285
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,329
My grandfather lives.

286
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,082
He's helped me see what we're
here to do.

287
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,684
Men are going to be punished for
what they've done to this world.

288
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,570
There will be destruction.

289
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,927
There will be tragedy.

290
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,080
And our family has been chosen
for a great task.

291
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,922
We've been chosen to save
the innocent.

292
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,331
The innocent?

293
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,126
The animals.

294
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,965
Why are they innocent?

295
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,286
Because they still live as
they did in the Garden.

296
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,601
Yes.

297
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,442
And we need to save enough of
them to start again.

298
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,050
But what of us?

299
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,122
I guess we get to start
again, too.

300
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,403
We get to start again in a new
and better world.

301
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,605
But first...

302
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,250
we have to build.

303
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,651
Build what?

304
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,489
A great flood is coming.

305
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,529
The waters of the heavens will
meet the waters of the earth.

306
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,641
We build a vessel to survive
the storm.

307
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,162
We build an ark.

308
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,443
Take the traitor back.

309
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,251
He is a child of the old one!

310
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,041
Stop!

311
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,611
There is work to do.
Help us.

312
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,648
Help you?

313
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,451
We tried to help your kind once.

314
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,524
And we lost everything because
of you!

315
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,201
Not everything.

316
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,886
We can save what is left.
We can serve Him again.

317
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,648
You treacherous snake!

318
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,209
The Creator.

319
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,729
Children!

320
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,840
What is this?

321
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,051
This...

322
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,724
This is our ark.

323
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,002
We will help this man.

324
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,764
No!

325
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,486
Shem.

326
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,811
Wait.

327
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,967
Please.

328
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,121
It still hurts?

329
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,485
Ham!

330
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,483
Shem!

331
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,329
He doesn't have anyone.

332
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,047
Come.

333
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,160
Father, did you see them?

334
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,571
Father?

335
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,406
Yes, Japheth.

336
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,805
It begins.

337
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,160
Ready?

338
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,884
It sleeps.

339
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,085
Gently.

340
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,170
See, that's a boy one, and
that's a girl one.

341
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,085
After the storm, they'll become
a mother and a father.

342
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,050
And the hatchlings will spread
right across the world.

343
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,489
We have to be gentle with
them...

344
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,369
and we have to be protective.

345
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,441
If something were to happen...

346
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,046
that would be a small piece
of Creation lost forever.

347
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,884
All of these innocent creatures
are now in our care.

348
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,042
It's our job to look after them.

349
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,882
Father?

350
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,724
All the birds are two.

351
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,930
You have Mother, Shem has Ila.

352
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,010
But what of me?

353
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,926
What of Japheth?

354
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,124
Who is there for us?

355
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,546
Did you see how He made the
forest...

356
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:26,142
to give us wood for the ark?

357
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,129
How He sent the birds?

358
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,646
So...

359
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,283
hasn't He sent everything
we need?

360
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,206
Mother!

361
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,291
What is it?
What?

362
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,771
Snakes!

363
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,848
Snakes are coming, too?
Yeah.

364
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,801
All that creeps, all that crawls,
all that slithers.

365
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,250
It's all right.

366
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,524
Father!
Father!

367
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,526
Don't be afraid.

368
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,361
No one will hurt this boy.

369
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,401
What's your name?

370
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,206
Ham.
Ham?

371
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,523
I am Tubal-Cain.

372
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,250
Do you know me?

373
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,924
You don't know your king?

374
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,045
My father says there can be no
king in The Creator's garden.

375
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,647
Ham, come here.

376
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,121
Do not take my best soldier.

377
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,601
He's nothing of yours.

378
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:07,639
Look at his hand on that weapon.

379
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:10,210
I believe he is something of
mine.

380
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:11,421
Ham?

381
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,961
Leave it.

382
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,411
No, he gave it to me.
Do what I tell you.

383
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,685
When I heard talk of miracles,
I dismissed them.

384
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,124
But then I saw the birds with
my own eyes, flying here...

385
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,406
and I had to come.

386
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,406
There isn't anything for you,
here.

387
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,845
No?

388
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,400
This all belongs to me.

389
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,881
This land.
This forest.

390
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,049
That stronghold of yours.

391
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,002
Did you really think you could
protect yourself from me, in that?

392
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,407
It's not protection from you.

393
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,845
Then, what is it?

394
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,606
An ark...

395
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,573
to hold the innocent...

396
00:46:05,673 --> 00:46:06,990
when The Creator sends his
deluge...

397
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,938
to wipe out the wicked from
this world.

398
00:46:09,073 --> 00:46:10,648
The Creator does not care what
happens in this world.

399
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,883
Nobody has heard from Him since
He marked Cain.

400
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,161
We are alone.

401
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,402
Orphaned children...

402
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,401
cursed to struggle by the sweat
of our brow to survive.

403
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,888
Damned if I don't do everything
it takes to do just that.

404
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,571
Damned if I don't take what
I want.

405
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,850
We have met?

406
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,411
I am the son of Lamech!

407
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,167
Eight generations descended
from Seth!

408
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,242
Return to your cities of Cain!

409
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,429
Know we have all been judged!

410
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,924
I have men at my back, and you
stand alone and defy me?

411
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,371
I'm not alone.

412
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,250
Take the children!

413
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,970
Do not fear, my people!

414
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,447
Don't be afraid!
Stand!

415
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,521
Hold your line, men.

416
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,646
His minions, they're with you?

417
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,202
Miracles?
A deluge, you claim?

418
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,084
Well, perhaps you're right.

419
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,726
Perhaps casting us out of
Paradise was not enough.

420
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,964
Perhaps, He returns to finish
us off.

421
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,243
Well, if He does...

422
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,369
I will ride the storm in that
ship of yours.

423
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,081
There is no escape for you
and your kind.

424
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,804
Your time is done.

425
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,488
The land is dying.
Ham.

426
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,803
The cities are dead.
Don't listen to him.

427
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,684
My people follow me!

428
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,647
And more will follow them!

429
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,403
I'm not afraid of miracles,
son of Lamech!

430
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,482
If you refuse my dozens now...

431
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,729
I shall return with legions!

432
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,721
Move.

433
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,684
Father?

434
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,363
Will so many really come?

435
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,603
We need to finish as fast
as we can.

436
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,251
The sooner He sends the rain,
the better.

437
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,530
Until then, we're safer inside.

438
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,085
We build.

439
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,921
First weapons, then men.

440
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,687
Feed only those that will fight.

441
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,844
Arm them, train them...

442
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,491
and there is nothing they
can't do.

443
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,127
With an army, we can crush
those giants.

444
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,842
Please, we're hungry!

445
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,570
Give us meat.
Our children are starving.

446
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,880
Please help us!

447
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,765
Let us go!

448
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,804
We're starving!

449
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,250
Should I come back?

450
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,645
No.

451
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,882
Do you think those men are
going to attack us?

452
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,565
When the rain comes.

453
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,210
What do you think it'll be like?

454
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,808
I've imagined it.

455
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,922
Seeing that much death...

456
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,484
I'm not sure there are words.

457
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,291
The end of everything.

458
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,082
The beginning.
The beginning of everything.

459
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,561
So what is it?

460
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,321
Whatever he's done or said,
Shem is very fond of you.

461
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,322
Shem needs a woman.

462
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,924
A real woman.

463
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,490
He should have a family.

464
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,485
I can't give any of that to him.

465
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,890
And I'm not going to deny him
those things...

466
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,450
even if he wants me to.

467
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,043
I won't do it.

468
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,281
Besides...

469
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,807
why would The Creator want
a barren girl on His ark?

470
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,250
Ila... Ila.

471
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,123
When we first took you in...

472
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,647
I thought you were going to
be a burden.

473
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,007
And I didn't want to see anybody
else ruined by this world.

474
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,850
But I was wrong.

475
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,006
You're a gift.

476
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,083
A precious, precious gift.

477
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,365
Just don't forget how precious
a gift you are.

478
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,087
I know you'll be going to find
wives for Ham and Japheth.

479
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,046
You should find one for Shem, too.
Ila.

480
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,811
Where do you think you're going?

481
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,245
Please, please don't take my
baby!

482
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,167
Let them go!
Please!

483
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,129
Sorry, we have to eat!

484
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,726
Don't take my baby!
No!

485
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,367
Don't take my baby! No, no,
please, will you stop him?

486
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,204
Let them go!

487
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,241
No!

488
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,243
Quit struggling!
It'll be easier.

489
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,048
Come with me!
Stop struggling!

490
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,128
You! You!

491
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,246
I have two girls!
I have two girls to trade!

492
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,249
Take the girls!
Give me the meat!

493
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,447
Give it to me!

494
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,801
What happened?

495
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,166
All of this should be inside
by now.

496
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,327
The storm is coming.

497
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,640
What about our wives?
Where are they?

498
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,960
Did you not hear what I just
said?

499
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,121
But when are they coming?

500
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,086
There will be no wives.

501
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,644
What? What?
No!

502
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,848
You said that The Creator would
give us what we'll need.

503
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,922
Help your brother.
No.

504
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,764
Listen.
Listen, you can't do this!

505
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,729
You can't.
How am I supposed to be a man?

506
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,086
I said, help your brother.

507
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,930
You want me to stay a child!

508
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,525
No!

509
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,526
I'm asking you to be a man
and do what needs to be done.

510
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,601
Ham!

511
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,081
Ham!

512
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,730
What are you doing, Noah?

513
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,168
The wickedness is not just
in them.

514
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,690
It's in all of us.

515
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,326
I saw it.

516
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,481
No.

517
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,921
Noah.

518
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,644
There's goodness in us.

519
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,404
Look at our boys.

520
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,324
Shem's loyalty.
Japheth's kindness.

521
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,600
Ham's integrity.

522
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,446
Good men.

523
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,163
They'd be good fathers.

524
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,409
Shem is blinded by desire.

525
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,404
Ham is covetous.

526
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,727
And Japheth lives only to
please.

527
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,001
I am no better.

528
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,770
And you?

529
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,850
Is there anything you would
not do, good or bad...

530
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:44,045
for those three boys?

531
00:59:44,245 --> 00:59:48,085
We would both choose to kill,
in order to protect our children.

532
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,321
Yes.

533
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,011
We're no different.

534
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,254
We were weak, and we were
selfish...

535
00:59:55,354 --> 00:59:57,499
to think we could set ourselves
apart.

536
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,206
We will work, complete the
task...

537
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,851
and then we'll die.

538
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,922
The same as everyone else.

539
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,851
They are children!

540
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,207
They are our children, Noah!

541
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,805
Have you no mercy?

542
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,002
The time for mercy has passed.

543
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,203
Now our punishment begins.

544
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,165
Ham!

545
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,601
Ham!

546
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,165
Grandfather?

547
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,250
Grandfather?

548
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,610
Did you bring me something?

549
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,607
Did Noah plant the seed I gave
him?

550
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,601
Yes.

551
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,004
And in all that forest there
were no berries?

552
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,762
Shem promised me berries.

553
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,121
I'm sorry.

554
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,241
I didn't know.

555
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,086
It's a pity.

556
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,690
Then why did you come here?

557
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,971
It's Noah.

558
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,526
He leaves our boys with no one.

559
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,722
Shem has Ila, but she's barren.

560
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,001
There'll be no other wives,
so no children.

561
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,521
Jusfice.

562
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,841
The Creator destroys this world
because we corrupted it.

563
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,091
So, we ourselves must be
destroyed.

564
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,171
No.
I can't believe that's true.

565
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,482
Not when I look at my sons.

566
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,408
All they desire is love.

567
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,330
Isn't that all their hearts
need to be good?

568
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,161
Who is good?
Who is wicked?

569
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,561
How am I supposed to know what
is right?

570
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,569
That choice is Noah's.
Nof mine. Not yours.

571
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,842
It sounds like he has made it.

572
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,843
So then you will not help me?

573
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,363
I don't know if I even could.

574
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,331
But if I tried, it could cause
pain and possibly tragedy.

575
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,447
And in the end, it would just
come back to Noah again.

576
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,651
Is that what you wish?

577
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,407
I want my sons to have children.
I want them to be happy.

578
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,721
I can't bear to think of them
dying alone.

579
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,490
Out of the way!
Coming through!

580
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,326
Please!

581
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,321
Get away!

582
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,611
No.
No, no...

583
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,389
It's all right... it's all right.
I'm not...

584
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,678
I'm not going to hurt you.

585
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,611
I have food.

586
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,281
Here.

587
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,445
What do you want?

588
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,205
Nothing.

589
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,450
Are you alone?

590
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,567
Yes.

591
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,640
And you?

592
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,729
I can help you get away.

593
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,881
No.

594
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,527
Well, then, I'll stay a little
while.

595
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,568
If that is all right?

596
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,727
My name is Na'el.

597
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,087
Shem!

598
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,289
Go and find them and bring
them back.

599
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,321
Be careful.

600
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,484
Ham?

601
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,921
Don't be afraid, granddaughter.

602
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,563
Don't be afraid.

603
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,886
Grandfather?

604
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,280
Yes.

605
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,765
What are you doing down here?

606
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,127
I'm looking for berries.
I have a craving.

607
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,004
Come and help me look for them.

608
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,003
My eyes aren't as good as they
used to be.

609
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,281
I have to find Ham.

610
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,845
There's time enough for that.

611
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,251
Come here.

612
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,251
Come.

613
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,080
Come here and help me.

614
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,765
They're here somewhere.

615
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,842
They're here somewhere, berries.

616
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,650
I know there are berries.

617
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,768
There's nothing here, Grandfather.

618
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,442
Let me take you to Noah.
No.

619
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,483
No need for that.
You go now.

620
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,449
You go.

621
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,562
Wait.
Wait.

622
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,889
Ten years you've been with my
own. With my own family.

623
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,450
Ten years.
Do you love them?

624
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,966
Shem?
And Noah?

625
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,210
He saved my life.

626
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,885
Raised me.

627
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,645
Yes, he did.

628
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,126
Yes.

629
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,687
And you are now as his own
daughter.

630
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,644
My own great-granddaughter.

631
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,165
Ten years in the shadow of
my home...

632
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,524
and yet I have never given you
my blessing.

633
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,321
May I?

634
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,050
Ham!
Ila!

635
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,642
You can go now.
Go to him.

636
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,166
You go.
Go now.

637
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,049
Ila!

638
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,051
Ila!

639
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,241
Ila!

640
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,443
We have to get back...

641
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,042
We have to go.

642
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,646
We have to go.
Come on. Now!

643
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,486
I am a man.
Made in Your image.

644
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,887
Why will You not converse
with me?

645
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,244
I give life.

646
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,361
I take life away.
As You do!

647
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,770
And I am like You, am I not?

648
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,045
Speak to me.

649
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,889
Speak to me!

650
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,724
It has begun!

651
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,128
Death comes from the heavens!

652
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,964
This rain...

653
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,010
is meant to wash us off the
face of this world.

654
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,209
But we are men.

655
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,881
We decide if we live, or die.

656
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,883
We are men!

657
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,049
And men united are invincible!

658
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,803
Do you want to live?

659
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,405
Yeah!

660
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,129
We kill the giants!

661
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,049
We kill Noah!

662
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,168
We take the ark!

663
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,480
Yeah!

664
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,965
Noah!

665
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,241
Where's Ham?

666
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,131
Get it off me, no!

667
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,689
No, no, no!

668
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,367
We have to get away!

669
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,522
I won't leave you.
I won't!

670
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,561
Ham!

671
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,846
Father, help!
Help!

672
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,888
Help her!
Help me, please!

673
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,566
Please, help me, please!

674
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,649
Please... someone please
help me!

675
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,165
Help me!

676
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,641
No!

677
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,242
Ham!
Ham!

678
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,244
Ham!

679
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,361
Ham!

680
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,807
Ham!

681
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,244
Ham!

682
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,247
Samyaza!

683
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,567
Samyaza!
Samyaza!

684
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,210
Noah!
Where is Ham?

685
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,362
Ham is through!
Quickly!

686
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,610
Run!

687
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,166
Ham.

688
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,725
Ham!

689
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,604
Faster!

690
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,602
Forward!

691
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,447
Protect your mother.
Protect them all.

692
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,921
Part!

693
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,168
My Creator...

694
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,049
forgive me.

695
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,444
The Creator brings him home.

696
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,881
Ham?

697
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,287
Ham?

698
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,281
Shem.
Shem, go inside.

699
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,684
Go inside.

700
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,166
They are upon us.
Go inside!

701
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,562
Good-bye, son of Adam.

702
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,884
Son, where are you?

703
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,251
Ham!

704
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,125
Ham?

705
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,606
Ham?

706
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,680
It's all right.

707
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,201
Shem!
Father!

708
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,890
Japheth, where are you?

709
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,007
Ila, I'm here!
Father!

710
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,242
Mother, where's Father?

711
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,889
Please, Noah...

712
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,248
there must be something we
can do.

713
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,882
We can drag ropes.

714
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,491
They cannot all be soldiers,
Father.

715
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,568
They are just people.
And there's room.

716
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,928
There is no room for them.

717
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,281
Soon everything we knew will
be gone.

718
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,964
All that is left of Creation
will lie within these walls.

719
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,646
Outside...

720
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,690
just the waters of chaos again.

721
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,971
You are angry.

722
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,650
You judge me.

723
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,645
Let me tell you a story.

724
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,252
The first story my father
told me...

725
01:24:21,454 --> 01:24:24,761
and the first story that I told
each of you.

726
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,764
In the beginning...

727
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,371
there was nothing.

728
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,849
Nothing but the silence of an
infinite darkness.

729
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,688
But the breath of The Creator
fluttered against...

730
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,889
the face of the void, whispering,
"Let there be light."

731
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,451
And light was.

732
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,246
And it was good.

733
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,131
The first day.

734
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,970
And then the formless light...

735
01:24:57,133 --> 01:24:59,710
began to take on substance and
shape.

736
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,605
A second day.

737
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,604
And our world was born.

738
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,521
Our beautiful, fragile home.

739
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,771
And a great, warming light
nurtured its days.

740
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,681
And a lesser light ruled
the nights.

741
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,164
And there was evening.
And morning.

742
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,285
Another day.

743
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,446
And the waters of the world
gathered together...

744
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,168
and in their midst emerged
dry land.

745
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,169
Another day passed.

746
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,286
And the ground put forth the
growing things.

747
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,529
A thick blanket of green stretching
across all Creation.

748
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,364
And the waters, too, teemed
with life.

749
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,009
Great creatures of the deep
that are no more.

750
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,609
Vast multitudes of fish...

751
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,883
some of which may still swim
beneath these seas.

752
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:54,171
And soon the sky was streaming
with birds.

753
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,606
And there was evening.

754
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,525
And there was morning.
A fifth day.

755
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,490
Now the whole world was full
of living beings.

756
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,200
Everything that creeps, everything
that crawls...

757
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,203
and every beast that walks upon
the ground.

758
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,642
And it was good.
It was all good.

759
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,845
There was light and air and
water and soil...

760
01:26:11,945 --> 01:26:13,847
all clean and unspoiled.

761
01:26:13,946 --> 01:26:16,527
There were plants and fish and
fowl and beast...

762
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,210
each after their own kind.

763
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,851
All part of the greater whole.
All in their place.

764
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,090
And all was in balance.
It was paradise.

765
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,408
A jewel in The Creator's palm.

766
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:32,327
Then The Creator made Man.
And by his side, Woman.

767
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,688
Father and mother of us all.

768
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,041
He gave them a choice.

769
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,442
Follow the temptation of
darkness...

770
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,444
or hold on to the blessing
of light.

771
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,120
But they ate from the forbidden
fruit.

772
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,049
Their innocence was extinguished.

773
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,605
And so, for the ten generations
since Adam...

774
01:27:05,705 --> 01:27:09,439
sin... has walked within us.

775
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,721
Brother against brother.

776
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,168
Nation against nation.

777
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,648
Man against Creation.

778
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,325
We murdered each other.

779
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,646
We broke the world.
We did this.

780
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,849
Man did this.

781
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:32,721
Everything that was beautiful...

782
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,844
everything that was good...

783
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,931
we shattered.

784
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,922
Now, it begins again.

785
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:48,402
Air, water, earth, plant, fish,
bird and beast.

786
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,244
Paradise returns.

787
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,245
But this time...

788
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,329
this time there will be no men.

789
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,641
If we were to enter the Garden
again...

790
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,607
it would only be to destroy it
once more.

791
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:04,761
No.

792
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,642
The Creator has judged us.

793
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,362
Mankind must end.

794
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,606
Shem and Ila...

795
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,168
you will bury your mother and I.

796
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,529
Ham, you will bury them.

797
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,171
Japheth will lay you to rest.

798
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,891
You, Japheth...

799
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,281
you will be the last man.

800
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,967
And in time you, too, will
return to the dust.

801
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,802
Creation will be left alone,
safe and beautiful.

802
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,408
I'm very sorry about that girl.

803
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,407
And I'm sorry for you.

804
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,699
But we have been entrusted with
a task...

805
01:28:52,799 --> 01:28:55,358
much greater than our own desires.

806
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,690
Ham.

807
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,970
Noah...

808
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,728
Does he know I'm here?

809
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,924
Does he know I'm here?
No, no, no. No.

810
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,049
Why are you helping me?

811
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,285
There was a girl.

812
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,244
I tried to bring her.

813
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,002
But he just let her die.

814
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,320
And now you want revenge.

815
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,771
No.

816
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,405
Yes, you do.

817
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,529
Yes, you do.

818
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,810
There's no more land.

819
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,728
Everything out there must be
dead.

820
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,004
It had to be what He wanted.

821
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,323
A world without man.

822
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,885
You see that, don't you?

823
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,051
What I see...

824
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,322
is how hard this was for you
to do...

825
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,368
as a man who respects life...

826
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,209
a man who loves his children.

827
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,849
You've been strong.

828
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,291
But it's done.

829
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,850
It's done now.

830
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,248
And you can put that burden
down.

831
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,530
Noah.

832
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,760
It's all right.

833
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,206
If your father found me, he
would kill me.

834
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:36,883
We must be ready, but I am
too weak.

835
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,041
What are you doing?

836
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,641
I must get my strength back.

837
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,722
The beasts are precious.
There are only two of each.

838
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,446
And there is only one of me.

839
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,603
But the rain, all these miracles,
are for them.

840
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,401
Them?

841
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:08,564
Your father fills a ship with
beasts while children drown.

842
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,011
He belittles you by telling
you you must serve them.

843
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,286
No.

844
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,811
They serve us.

845
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,082
That is the greatness of men.

846
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,771
When The Creator finished
making the sky...

847
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,326
the ground, the sea, and this
beast...

848
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,210
He wasn't satisfied.

849
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,443
He needed something greater.

850
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,684
Something to take dominion over
it and subdue it.

851
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,281
So He made us in His image.

852
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,606
Us.

853
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,289
This is your world, Ham.

854
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,840
Seize it.

855
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,165
Ila.

856
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,402
Grandfather.

857
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,246
What is it?

858
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,769
You're not sick.

859
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,489
But that's impossible.

860
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,043
What?
What is it?

861
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,522
Noah.

862
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,370
It is his grandchild.

863
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:48,721
What's wrong?

864
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,084
Father.
Noah.

865
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:57,007
We've come to ask for your
blessing.

866
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,925
I don't understand.

867
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,405
I am with Child.

868
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,321
It's not possible.

869
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:14,801
You're barren.

870
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,646
You can't conceive.
How...

871
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,722
How is that possible?
Grandfather.

872
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,611
I asked Grandfather...

873
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,681
To what?

874
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,444
Undermine The Creator?

875
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,921
To give our children a future.

876
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,490
To give humanity a future.

877
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,524
Have you any idea what you've
done?

878
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:38,207
All those lives!
All those people!

879
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,520
For nothing!

880
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,721
Do you know what this forces
me to do?

881
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,686
No!

882
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,091
Please!
Please!

883
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,685
Please!

884
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,402
I cannot do this! Tell me I
don't need to do this!

885
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,811
Please.

886
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:35,000
Have I not done everything that
You asked of me?

887
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,049
Is that not enough?

888
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,842
Why do You not answer me?

889
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,409
Why?

890
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,844
I will not fail You.

891
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,048
I will not fail You.

892
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,884
I will not fail You.

893
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,810
It shall be done.

894
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,005
It shall be done.

895
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,161
Father?

896
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,485
The rains have stopped.

897
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:14,371
The Creator smiles on our child.

898
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,081
The rains have stopped because
of your child, yes...

899
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,128
but He does not smile.

900
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:26,200
If your child is a boy...

901
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:30,285
he will replace Japheth,
last man.

902
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,450
If it is a girl...

903
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,961
who could mature into a mother...

904
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,490
she must die.

905
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,124
Are you mad?

906
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,485
That is my Child!

907
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,370
If you should bear a girl...

908
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:09,161
in the moment of her birth,
I will cut her down.

909
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,446
Mother!

910
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,530
Mother, my bird!

911
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,482
Nothing.
No mud.

912
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,121
Nothing.

913
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,724
We still have to go.

914
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,247
Ila...

915
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,243
there's nothing.

916
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,287
There's nothing out there.

917
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:46,921
You have food and water for
how long? Weeks?

918
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,082
A month?
A month.

919
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:56,841
Please wait.

920
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,560
Wait until the bird finds land.
Please.

921
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,961
Japheth, send him again.

922
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,610
He's too tired.
Then wake another.

923
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,281
Here.

924
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,611
Please.
One that can find us a home.

925
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,406
No.

926
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,010
We leave today.

927
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,489
They will die out there.

928
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,208
Not if they stay.

929
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,651
And let you kill their Child?

930
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,606
Noah.

931
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,321
Noah!

932
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,250
I did this.

933
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,449
I did this, Noah!

934
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,965
Please!

935
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,370
Punish me!

936
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:24,691
Punish me, Noah!

937
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:27,370
Not them.

938
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,524
Not the child.

939
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,211
Please.

940
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,448
The child is not being punished.

941
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:40,286
We are all being punished.

942
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,964
All of us.

943
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,082
It's not something I want
to do.

944
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,362
It's something I have to do.

945
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,126
It is painful...

946
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,486
but it is just.

947
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:09,886
Just?

948
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,080
How?

949
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,611
How is this just?

950
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,722
It's a baby, Noah.

951
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,126
If you hold to this...

952
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:32,205
you will lose your sons, you
will lose Ila...

953
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,609
you will lose me.

954
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,922
I love you, Noah.

955
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:47,410
And I have followed you
everywhere.

956
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,209
Through everything.

957
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,362
I forgave you.

958
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,603
When everyone was dead,
I forgave you.

959
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,445
I was ready to die with you.

960
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:59,964
But this...

961
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,845
I will never forgive.

962
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,924
Boy or girl, I will never
forgive!

963
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,322
And you will die alone!
Not just alone, but hated!

964
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,364
Hated by everyone you love!

965
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,644
That is just!

966
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,489
That is just.

967
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,841
It's time.

968
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,566
Bring him through there.

969
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,730
One blow will finish it.

970
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,850
Just in case, huh?

971
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,883
I don't know if I can.

972
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,405
He killed your woman.

973
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,801
And now he plots to kill your
brother's first-born.

974
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,041
Is that what you want?

975
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,485
You want your sister to die
on the seas?

976
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,486
A man isn't ruled by the heavens.

977
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,247
A man is ruled by his will.

978
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,243
So I ask you...

979
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,250
are you a man?

980
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:10,081
Good.

981
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,407
Because if you're a man...

982
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:15,491
you can kill.

983
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,243
But he won't follow me.

984
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,451
Thank you, Japheth.

985
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,682
You take care of that baby.

986
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,647
Don't be afraid, Mother.

987
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:50,125
We'll see each other in the
new world.

988
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,487
Father.

989
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:17,205
No!

990
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:18,606
How could you?

991
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,842
I thought you were good!

992
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,331
I thought that's why He
chose you.

993
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,485
He chose me because He knew
I would complete the task...

994
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,886
nothing more, son.

995
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,003
Mother.

996
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:39,531
Mother.

997
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:40,880
It's your time.

998
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,489
Come.
Come with me.

999
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:52,367
You're all right.

1000
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,090
Japheth, stand back.

1001
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,288
Come now.
Come inside.

1002
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,609
That's right.
That's right.

1003
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:09,571
You're all right, Ila.
You're safe here.

1004
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,810
Please keep it inside.

1005
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,281
Your baby's coming.

1006
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:20,125
Your baby's coming, Ila.

1007
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:21,884
Don't think about anything
else.

1008
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:01,331
Father!
Father, they're awake!

1009
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,004
They're awake!
They're eating each other!

1010
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,082
The beasts.
What?

1011
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,690
Come.

1012
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,285
Come!

1013
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,361
It's not possible for them to
have woken up without our help.

1014
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,726
Which way, son?

1015
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,049
That's right.
That's right.

1016
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,211
The line of Cain.

1017
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,526
I told you...

1018
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,244
I'm not afraid of miracles.

1019
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,691
That's right.

1020
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,006
A bit more.

1021
01:51:58,400 --> 01:51:59,401
Boy or girl?

1022
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,206
What's happening?

1023
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,051
There's another.

1024
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,884
Two?

1025
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:11,561
Twins.

1026
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,763
Mother, so?

1027
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,411
I'm sorry.

1028
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,169
I'm so sorry.

1029
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:50,841
Sisters.

1030
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,843
No.

1031
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:56,641
No!

1032
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:59,401
No!

1033
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,086
He will not touch our daughters.

1034
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:07,207
No!
Shem!

1035
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,524
Shem!

1036
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,682
I should have killed you when
I killed your father.

1037
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:19,126
Well, now we finish it.
Now!

1038
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:07,326
The evils of mankind will not
live in this new Eden.

1039
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,883
Leave us!
Leave us alone!

1040
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,729
He's mine!

1041
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:31,730
The ark, the beasts, and all
of your women are now mine.

1042
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,925
I will build a new world in
my image!

1043
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:57,730
Now you are a man.

1044
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:28,288
The Creator has not forgotten us.

1045
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,250
Her name was Na'el.

1046
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:41,924
She was innocent.

1047
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,404
She was good.

1048
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:05,689
It's a boy.
It's a boy.

1049
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,524
It's a boy.
Move away.

1050
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:08,965
It's a boy.

1051
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:18,169
Where is she?

1052
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,011
Where is she?

1053
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,403
No... no... no.

1054
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,807
You can't.

1055
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,688
They're beautiful.

1056
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,725
They?

1057
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:40,171
You can't kill two.

1058
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,242
He sent us what we need.

1059
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:45,406
No... no.
No!

1060
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,605
You can't!

1061
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:50,330
No!

1062
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:52,090
Noah!

1063
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:53,650
Ila!

1064
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,001
Noah.

1065
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:02,286
Please.

1066
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,928
These are my children!

1067
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,331
Your grandchildren!

1068
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,930
I will not be stopped.

1069
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,923
I know I cannot stop you, but
they're crying!

1070
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,241
Please don't let them die
crying.

1071
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:16,442
Let me calm them.

1072
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,686
Please, just let them be at
peace.

1073
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,686
The moon is high.

1074
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,286
The leaves entwine.

1075
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:41,367
Your Father waits for thee...

1076
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:49,650
to wrap you in His sheltering
wings...

1077
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:54,201
to whisper you to sleep.

1078
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,971
To wrap you in...

1079
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,088
His welcoming arms...

1080
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:06,450
till the night sky breaks.

1081
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:12,651
Your Father is the healing
wind...

1082
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:17,287
that whispers you to sleep.

1083
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:22,765
That whispers as...

1084
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,411
you sleep.

1085
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,730
You do not need to see this.

1086
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,280
I will hold them.

1087
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,408
Do it quickly.

1088
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:59,290
Do it quickly!

1089
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:48,650
I cannot do this.

1090
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:06,770
It's all right.

1091
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,644
Hide your eyes, Japheth.

1092
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,207
Ham?
He's here.

1093
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,805
You don't have to go.

1094
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:20,923
I don't belong here.

1095
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,450
For what it's worth...

1096
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,965
I'm glad that it begins again
with you.

1097
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:36,284
Maybe we'll learn to be kind.

1098
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:20,851
Will he come back?

1099
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,521
Some things cannot be unbroken.

1100
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:37,690
I have to know...

1101
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:41,842
Why did you spare them?

1102
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:46,723
I looked down at those two
little girls...

1103
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,962
and all I had in my heart
was love.

1104
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:54,050
Then why are you alone, Noah?

1105
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:58,081
Why are you separated from
your family?

1106
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,411
Because I failed Him.

1107
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:06,051
And I failed all of you.

1108
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:09,921
Did you?

1109
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,767
He chose you for a reason, Noah.

1110
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:22,043
He showed you the wickedness
of man...

1111
02:06:22,143 --> 02:06:24,628
and knew you would not look
away.

1112
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:28,406
But then you saw goodness, too.

1113
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:33,964
The choice was put in your hands
because He put it there.

1114
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:37,846
He asked you to decide if we
were worth saving.

1115
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:43,330
And you chose mercy.

1116
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:48,290
You chose love.

1117
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:55,650
He has given us a second chance.

1118
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,121
Be a father.

1119
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:02,402
Be a grandfather.

1120
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,767
Help us to do better this time.

1121
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:11,529
Help us start again.

1122
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:25,447
The Creator made Adam in His
image...

1123
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,450
and placed the world in his
care.

1124
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:30,971
That birthright...

1125
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:34,764
was passed down to us.

1126
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:43,003
To my father, then to me, and
to my sons...

1127
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:45,601
Shem...

1128
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:50,761
Japheth...

1129
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:56,448
and Ham.

1130
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:05,921
That birthright is now passed
to you...

1131
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:09,446
our grandchildren.

1132
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:15,769
This will be your work...

1133
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:21,488
and your responsibility.

1134
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:23,250
So I say to you...

1135
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:27,842
be fruitful and multiply...

1136
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:31,882
and replenish the earth.
