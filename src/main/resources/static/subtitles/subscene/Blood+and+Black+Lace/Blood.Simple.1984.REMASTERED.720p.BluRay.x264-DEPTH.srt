1
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:35,307
<i>The world is full of complainers.</i>

2
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:40,146
<i>The fact is,
nothing comes with a guarantee.</i>

3
00:00:41,648 --> 00:00:44,567
<i>And I don't care
if you're the Pope of Rome,</i>

4
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:48,404
<i>President of the United States,
or Man of the Year.</i>

5
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,031
<i>Something can all go wrong.</i>

6
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:55,786
<i>Go on ahead, you know, complain,
tell your problems to your neighbor,</i>

7
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:58,539
<i>ask for help and watch him fly.</i>

8
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,294
<i>Now, in Russia, they got it mapped out</i>

9
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:06,046
<i>so that everyone pulls for everyone else.</i>

10
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:09,091
<i>That's the theory, anyway.</i>

11
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:13,012
<i>But what I know about is Texas.</i>

12
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:17,099
<i>And down here, you're on your own.</i>

13
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:32,072
Gave me a little pearl-handled .38
for our first anniversary.

14
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:33,365
Uh-huh.

15
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:37,828
Figure I better leave
before I use it on him.

16
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,336
I just don't know how you can stand him.

17
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:46,837
I'm only an employee.

18
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:48,214
I ain't married to him.

19
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:49,590
Yeah.

20
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:54,678
It's just...

21
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,306
I don't know.

22
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:01,852
Sometimes I think maybe
there's something wrong with him,

23
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,522
like maybe he's sick, mentally.

24
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:10,569
Or is it maybe me, do you think?

25
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:13,197
Listen, I...

26
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:16,492
I ain't a marriage counselor.

27
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,994
I don't know what goes on.

28
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:23,207
I don't wanna know.

29
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,336
But I like you.

30
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,340
I always liked you.

31
00:02:39,683 --> 00:02:42,142
What are you gonna do in Houston?

32
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:45,688
Oh, I'll figure something out.

33
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:50,067
How come you offered
to drive me in this mess?

34
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:53,654
I told you, I like you.

35
00:02:57,158 --> 00:02:58,826
I never knew that.

36
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,246
Well, now you do.

37
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:07,835
Hell.

38
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:14,383
Stop the car, Ray!

39
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,753
You know that car?

40
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:53,964
No.

41
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,927
What's the matter?

42
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:01,180
I don't know.

43
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:06,769
I just think maybe I'm making a mistake.

44
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,983
What was that back there?

45
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,194
Back where?

46
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,488
That sign.

47
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:21,075
I don't know.

48
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:23,786
Motel.

49
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:26,997
- Abby...
- Ray.

50
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,043
Do you remember what you said before?

51
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,962
Were you just being a gentleman?

52
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,881
Abby, I like you.

53
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:42,012
But it's no point starting anything now.

54
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,764
Yeah.

55
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,643
- I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor.
- Yeah.

56
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:56,485
What do you wanna do?

57
00:04:58,196 --> 00:04:59,738
What do you wanna do?

58
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,190
Hello.

59
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:37,151
<i>Having a good time?</i>

60
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:40,279
Who is this?

61
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:41,822
<i>I don't know. Who's this?</i>

62
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:49,371
<i>You still there?</i>

63
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:50,956
Yeah, I'm still here.

64
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,014
Ray?

65
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,308
Yeah.

66
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:11,768
Who was it?

67
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,565
Your husband.

68
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,997
<i>Put your sweet lips</i>

69
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:38,504
<i>A little closer to the phone</i>

70
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:46,053
<i>And let's pretend that we're together...</i>

71
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:02,027
I know where you can get those framed.

72
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:05,989
Why'd you take these?

73
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:09,618
What do you mean? Just doing my job.

74
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:13,705
You called me. I knew they were there.
Why'd you take them?

75
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,791
Well, I don't know.

76
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,335
Call it a fringe benefit.

77
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,005
How long you watch them?

78
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,300
Most the night.

79
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,056
They'd rest every few minutes,
then they'd get started again.

80
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:33,475
Hmm.

81
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,816
Quite something.

82
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:42,442
Hmm.

83
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:48,865
You know, in Greece,

84
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:56,164
they would cut off the head of the messenger
that brought the bad news.

85
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,382
Now that don't make much sense.

86
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:07,175
No.

87
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:10,971
Made them feel better.

88
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:15,851
Well, first off, Julian,

89
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,563
I don't know what the story is in Greece,

90
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:23,817
but in this state we got
very definite laws about that.

91
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:27,529
Second, I'm not a messenger.

92
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,699
I'm a private investigator.

93
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:36,622
And third and most important,
it ain't such bad news.

94
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:40,125
I mean, you thought he was colored.

95
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,046
You're always assuming the worst.

96
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:46,548
Anything else?

97
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:47,883
Mmm-hmm.

98
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:50,636
Don't come around here anymore.

99
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,847
If I need you,
I'll know what rock to turn over.

100
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:03,106
That's good, yeah.

101
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:04,191
Yeah.

102
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:08,820
"What rock to turn over."
That's very, very good.

103
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,704
You give me a call whenever
you want to cut off my head.

104
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,710
I can always crawl around without it.

105
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,357
<i>Jeannie and the boys...</i>

106
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:50,862
<i>They'll be back after a spell.</i>

107
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:52,614
<i>Hopefully you will be, too.</i>

108
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:55,617
<i>Darn right.</i>

109
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:07,629
Hold it, hold it.

110
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:22,519
<i>You're sweet as a honey bee</i>

111
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:24,604
<i>But like a honey bee stings...</i>

112
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:26,231
Where was I?

113
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,900
You were telling me
about the Ring of Fire.

114
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:31,111
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right. Right, right.

115
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:33,947
Now, look, you've got
all these volcanoes, right?

116
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:37,868
And every time one goes pop,
you got the equivalent of what,

117
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:39,661
20, 30 megatons of TNT.

118
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:41,329
Meurice.

119
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:44,750
Yeah, I know, Marty. Pour them short.

120
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,335
Did Ray come in yet?

121
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,754
No, it's his night off.

122
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:50,130
Where was he last night?

123
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,466
How do I know where he was last night?

124
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:55,093
I don't know. Didn't he call?

125
00:10:58,014 --> 00:11:01,850
Marty, this is an old friend of mine.
This is Debra.

126
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:04,519
Debra, this is Julian Marty.

127
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,190
There's a deuce in the corner needs help.

128
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,608
Right.

129
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,696
How long you know Meurice?

130
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:17,115
About ten years.

131
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,366
Ten years, huh?

132
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:20,911
What are you doing tonight?

133
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:23,789
Going out with Meurice.

134
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:29,795
Tell him you have a headache.

135
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:32,214
It'll pass.

136
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:37,594
We don't seem to be communicating...

137
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:39,721
Look, you wanna hustle me.

138
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,431
I don't wanna be hustled.

139
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:42,516
Oh, you don't?

140
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,975
It's as simple as that.

141
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,310
Oh, it's as simple as that.

142
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:46,645
Meurice,

143
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:49,147
I'm not here if Ray calls, okay?

144
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:50,273
Right.

145
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:51,358
Right.

146
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:55,320
Nice guy.

147
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:56,780
Not really.

148
00:11:58,074 --> 00:11:59,574
What did you say your last name was?

149
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,912
There, Opal.

150
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:32,792
<i>Ray?</i>

151
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:38,340
Yeah.

152
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:39,799
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

153
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:42,260
You get what you wanted?

154
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,929
<i>Yeah. Let's get out of here.</i>

155
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:47,182
Drive me to a motel?

156
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,767
You can stay at my place.

157
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:51,436
Drop you there.

158
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,771
Where are you going?

159
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:54,189
See a guy.

160
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:56,691
Ray, don't go to the bar.

161
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,861
I know him. It ain't a good idea.

162
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,572
I just gotta see a guy.

163
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:14,125
<i>Sweet dreams of you</i>

164
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,961
So it's a deal.

165
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:19,631
You and your colleagues find a way
to harness this vast, volcanic energy,

166
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:23,134
and I'll just sit back and watch
these shitkickers go broke.

167
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:24,219
Howdy, stranger.

168
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:25,303
Meurice.

169
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,972
Sorry about last night.

170
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:28,807
No sweat. Wasn't too busy.

171
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:30,725
You missed a good one, though.

172
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:35,397
This white guy walks in about 1:00 and
asks if we have a discount for alcoholics.

173
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:38,316
Well, I tell him to get lost,
but now Marty's sitting here,

174
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:41,277
and I can tell he's thinking that
maybe that ain't such a bad idea.

175
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:57,252
Marty.

176
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,199
Well, what?

177
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,020
What, what?

178
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:18,857
Am I fired? You wanna hit me, what?

179
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:22,819
I don't particularly wanna talk to you.

180
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:26,364
Well.

181
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,202
You're not gonna fire me,
I might as well quit.

182
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:32,454
Fine.

183
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:35,248
Suit yourself.

184
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:41,337
Having a good time?

185
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,008
I don't like this kind of talk.

186
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:46,801
What'd you come here for?

187
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:50,263
You owe me for two weeks.

188
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:53,933
No.

189
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,814
She's an expensive piece of ass,

190
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:04,569
but you get a refund if you tell me
who else she's been sluicing.

191
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,538
I want that money.
You got something to tell me, fine.

192
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:09,324
What are you,
a fucking marriage counselor?

193
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:11,367
What are you smiling at?

194
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:14,329
I'm funny, right? I'm an asshole?

195
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:16,623
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

196
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:18,374
That's not what's funny.

197
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:20,919
What's funny is her.

198
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,172
What's funny is that
I had you two followed.

199
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,550
Because if it's not you
she's sleeping with, it's someone else.

200
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,761
And what's really gonna be funny

201
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,306
is when she gives you
that innocent look and says,

202
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:36,434
"I don't know
what you're talking about, Ray.

203
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,020
"I ain't done anything funny."

204
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:43,316
But the funniest thing to me right now

205
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:47,737
is that you think that
she came back here for you.

206
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:50,731
That's what's fucking funny!

207
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:12,220
Come on this property again,
I'll be forced to shoot you.

208
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:20,812
Fair notice.

209
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,402
Hey, Marty.

210
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,870
Marty, I thought you were dead.

211
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,080
You going home?

212
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:40,665
No.

213
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,254
I'm staying right here in hell.

214
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:51,259
That's kind of a bleak point
of view there, isn't it, Marty?

215
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:54,387
Meurice...

216
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,808
I don't want the asshole near my money.

217
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:02,896
And I don't want him in the bar.

218
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,733
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.

219
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:25,335
Hello?

220
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:40,399
Marty?

221
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:45,063
Who was it?

222
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:46,481
What?

223
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:49,108
- On the phone. Was it...
- Um...

224
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,279
Was it for you?

225
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:54,822
I don't know.

226
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:56,658
He didn't say anything.

227
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:58,701
How'd you know it was a he?

228
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:01,913
You got a girl?

229
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:06,209
Am I screwing something up by being here?

230
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:07,335
No.

231
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:09,671
Am I?

232
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:17,845
I can find a place tomorrow,
and I'll be out of your hair.

233
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,057
Well, if that's what you wanna do,
then you ought to do it.

234
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:38,324
You...

235
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:42,537
You want the bed or the couch?

236
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:44,872
Well...

237
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,084
Couch will be all right.

238
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:50,712
You can sleep on the bed if you want.

239
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:56,801
I'm not gonna put you out of your bed.

240
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:58,886
You wouldn't be putting me out.

241
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:03,224
I'll be all right here.

242
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:07,312
Okay.

243
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:58,566
Opal?

244
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:06,073
Lover boy better lock his door.

245
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:10,411
A lot of nuts out there.

246
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:25,426
Let's do it outside in nature, hmm?

247
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:02,147
Like to have seen his face
when he found the dead end.

248
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,614
<i>Louie, Louie</i>

249
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:12,283
<i>Oh, my baby</i>

250
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:16,078
<i>Me gotta go, yeah</i>

251
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:20,082
<i>Louie, Louie</i>

252
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:23,336
Hey, mister, how'd you break
your pussy finger?

253
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:27,548
I love it! I love it!

254
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,635
You come up here a lot?

255
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:31,802
Yeah?

256
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:35,473
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart,
my date is here.

257
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:40,353
She saw me rolling a cigarette,
thought it was marijuana.

258
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:42,938
Thought I was a swinger, I guess.

259
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,531
<i>Louie, Louie</i>

260
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:12,426
Isn't that wild?

261
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,686
Stick your finger
up the wrong person's ass?

262
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:25,314
You know,

263
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:29,944
a friend of mine a while back
broke his hand and put it in a cast.

264
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:31,987
The very next day, he falls,

265
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:35,449
protects his bad hand
and he breaks his good one.

266
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,868
So he breaks that, too, you know.

267
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:40,287
So now he's got two busted flippers.

268
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:41,372
You know?

269
00:26:41,456 --> 00:26:43,958
So I says to him, I said, "Creighton,"

270
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:47,002
I says, "I hope your wife
really loves you,

271
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:49,046
"'cause for the next five weeks,

272
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:52,425
"you can't even wipe
your own goddamn ass."

273
00:26:58,098 --> 00:27:01,100
That's a test, ain't it?
A test of true love.

274
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:02,977
I got a job for you.

275
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,441
Well,

276
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:11,944
if the pay is right and it's legal,
I'll do it.

277
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:14,989
It's not strictly legal.

278
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,744
Well, if the pay's right,

279
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,579
I'll do it.

280
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:27,501
It's in reference
to that gentleman and my wife.

281
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,506
The more I think about it,
the more irritated I get.

282
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,594
Yeah? Well, could you tell me what it is

283
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:39,388
you want me to do, or is it a secret?

284
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:42,016
This is no joke.

285
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:52,276
You want me to kill them.

286
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:00,743
Well?

287
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:02,578
Well, what?

288
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,457
What do you think?

289
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:08,918
You're an idiot.

290
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:12,880
So this won't interest you, huh?

291
00:28:12,964 --> 00:28:14,632
I didn't say that.

292
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,468
All I said was, "You're an idiot."

293
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,765
Hell, you been thinking about it
for so much, it's driving you simple.

294
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:24,725
I'll give you $10,000.

295
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:32,525
I'm supposed to do a murder,

296
00:28:33,318 --> 00:28:34,944
no, two murders,

297
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:39,573
trust you not to go simple on me
and do something stupid.

298
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,576
I mean, really stupid.

299
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:46,664
Now, why should I trust you?

300
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:48,666
For the money.

301
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:51,168
Money.

302
00:28:52,254 --> 00:28:53,379
Yeah.

303
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:57,633
That's a righteous amount of money.

304
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:04,056
In Russia,

305
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:07,977
they make only 50 cent a day.

306
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:24,827
I want you

307
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:28,122
to go fishing.

308
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:29,373
What?

309
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:31,834
Go down to Corpus for a few days,

310
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:34,420
get yourself noticed.

311
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:37,047
I'll give you a call when it's done.

312
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:40,634
You just find a way to cover that money.

313
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:09,580
I'll take care of the money.
You make sure those bodies aren't found.

314
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,254
There's a big incinerator behind my place.

315
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:31,168
So you want, like, a townhouse,
your own apartment.

316
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:40,194
Come. I show you around.

317
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:42,613
You sure this apartment
is vacant, Mrs. Estevez?

318
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:44,323
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

319
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,743
I was just explaining to him
that he moved out yesterday.

320
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,453
Don't mind Mr. Garcia.

321
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:52,046
He used to be my brother-in-law.

322
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,543
Looks like the state legislature's
already in session.

323
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:59,380
Yeah, I thought this was where they met.

324
00:30:59,464 --> 00:31:01,340
Listen, you're gonna help me
with a problem.

325
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:02,466
I am?

326
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,344
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty
and Ray, make sure nothing happens.

327
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:06,428
<i>How about it, gentlemen?</i>

328
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:08,806
<i>Let's show our appreciation
for Lorraine up there,</i>

329
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,141
<i>a registered nurse from Bolton, Texas.</i>

330
00:31:11,226 --> 00:31:13,352
<i>How about it, gentlemen? Yeah.</i>

331
00:31:14,396 --> 00:31:15,354
Thanks, Meurice.

332
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:16,563
Anytime.

333
00:31:17,065 --> 00:31:19,233
Hey, you don't have to worry
about a thing for a while.

334
00:31:19,317 --> 00:31:21,068
Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.

335
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:26,115
He's in the house.

336
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:30,244
He's in the house.

337
00:31:30,328 --> 00:31:31,829
What's the matter?

338
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:34,456
Could have sworn I heard something.

339
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,626
Door's locked. There's nothing there.

340
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:44,425
Well, I guess we wouldn't have heard
anything if it had been him.

341
00:31:44,926 --> 00:31:46,593
He's real careful.

342
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,433
Fact is, he's anal, Ray.

343
00:31:54,394 --> 00:31:55,519
Oh?

344
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:58,272
Uh-huh. He told me once himself.
He said to me,

345
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:05,738
"In here, Abby. In here, I'm anal."

346
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:12,953
Well, I'll be damned.

347
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:14,913
I couldn't believe it myself.

348
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:22,254
Me, on the other hand,
I got lots of personality.

349
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,132
Marty always said I had too much.

350
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,968
'Course, he was never big on personality.

351
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:32,222
He sent me to a psychiatrist once,
to see if he could calm me down some.

352
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:35,893
Yeah? And what happened?

353
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:40,355
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest
person he ever met, so Marty fired him.

354
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:43,150
I don't think you can fire
a psychiatrist, exactly.

355
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:45,027
Well, I never saw him again,
I can tell you that much.

356
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:46,070
Mmm-hmm.

357
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:50,074
I said, "Marty, how come you're anal

358
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:52,993
"and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?"

359
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:54,453
What did he say?

360
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:56,288
Nothing.

361
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:59,458
He's like you. He doesn't say much.

362
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,751
Well, thanks.

363
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:03,253
Except when he doesn't say things,
they're usually nasty.

364
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:04,296
Mmm-hmm.

365
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,591
And when you don't, they're usually nice.

366
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:12,471
Do you ever get tired?

367
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:13,555
Hmm?

368
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:15,724
Oh, yeah. I guess.

369
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:17,017
Uh-huh.

370
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:29,626
<i>Hello?</i>

371
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:30,711
Marty?

372
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:32,129
<i>Yeah.</i>

373
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:33,880
Catch any fish?

374
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:36,508
<i>What?</i>

375
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:38,802
Did you catch any fish?

376
00:36:38,886 --> 00:36:40,345
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

377
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,972
What kind of fish?

378
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:44,016
<i>Listen, is it done?</i>

379
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,311
Yes, sir. You owe me some money.

380
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:49,813
<i>If you're fucking with me,
you'll regret it.</i>

381
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,742
They look good.

382
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:05,495
Why, you want a couple?

383
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,748
Just the 10,000 will be fine.

384
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:16,340
You got something to show me first?

385
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:58,340
Dead?

386
00:37:58,424 --> 00:38:00,050
So it would seem.

387
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:09,059
What did you do with the bodies?

388
00:38:09,143 --> 00:38:10,811
It's taken care of.

389
00:38:10,895 --> 00:38:13,688
Less you know about it, the better.

390
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:20,695
Jesus.

391
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:23,657
I don't believe it.

392
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:27,994
Oh...

393
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:30,580
I'm gonna be sick.

394
00:38:36,629 --> 00:38:39,005
I'm gonna want that picture back.

395
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:16,084
You did say something about the money.

396
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:17,544
Yeah, money.

397
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,548
Something I gotta ask you, Marty.

398
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:24,509
I been very, very careful.

399
00:39:25,678 --> 00:39:28,054
Have you been very, very careful?

400
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,890
Of course.

401
00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:32,017
Nobody knows you hired me?

402
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:34,478
Don't be stupid.

403
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,939
I'm not about to tell anyone.

404
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:44,237
We have to learn to be discreet.

405
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:48,408
Trust each other.

406
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:01,546
For richer or poorer.

407
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:03,757
Don't say that.

408
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:06,718
Your marriages don't turn out so hot.

409
00:40:08,554 --> 00:40:10,722
How did you cover the money?

410
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:15,227
It's been taken care of,
and the less you know about it, the better.

411
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:19,397
I made a call.

412
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:21,858
It'll be all right.

413
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:24,194
I must have gone mighty simple.

414
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:28,156
A murder like this, too risky.

415
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:32,452
Then you shouldn't have done it.

416
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:35,789
Can't have it both ways.

417
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,556
Count it...

418
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:55,475
And go.

419
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:59,929
No, I trust you.

420
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:20,727
Who looks stupid now?

421
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,174
Damn.

422
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:36,588
Marty.

423
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:51,419
What's the matter? You deaf?

424
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,682
Come on.

425
00:47:11,936 --> 00:47:13,686
Marty, you home?

426
00:47:22,529 --> 00:47:24,080
Marty?

427
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:28,242
What night is tonight, Diane?

428
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:29,452
What night is it?

429
00:47:29,536 --> 00:47:30,578
Tuesday?

430
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:32,872
Tuesday night is ladies' night.

431
00:47:32,957 --> 00:47:34,290
What?

432
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,042
Tuesday night is ladies' night.

433
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,519
All your drinks are free.

434
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:49,138
<i>You're sweet as a honey bee</i>

435
00:47:49,223 --> 00:47:51,224
<i>But like a honey bee stings</i>

436
00:47:51,308 --> 00:47:53,559
<i>You've gone and left my heart in pain</i>

437
00:47:53,644 --> 00:47:57,355
<i>All you left is our favorite song</i>

438
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,858
<i>The one we danced to all night long</i>

439
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:04,654
<i>It used to bring sweet memories</i>

440
00:48:04,738 --> 00:48:08,533
<i>Of a tender love that used to be</i>

441
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:11,953
<i>Now it's the same old song</i>

442
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:16,624
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

443
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:19,836
<i>It's the same, same old song</i>

444
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,007
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

445
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:27,385
<i>I, oh, I</i>

446
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:31,472
<i>Sentimental fool am I</i>

447
00:48:32,808 --> 00:48:35,601
<i>To hear an old love song and wanna cry</i>

448
00:48:35,686 --> 00:48:39,522
<i>But the melody keeps haunting me</i>

449
00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:43,234
<i>Reminding me how in love we used to be</i>

450
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:46,863
<i>I keep hearing the part
that used to touch our hearts</i>

451
00:48:46,947 --> 00:48:51,200
<i>Saying together forever
Darling, breaking up never</i>

452
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:53,870
<i>It's the same old song</i>

453
00:48:53,954 --> 00:48:54,912
<i>Ain't glad to hear it</i>

454
00:48:54,997 --> 00:48:58,791
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

455
00:48:58,876 --> 00:49:01,794
<i>It's the same old song</i>

456
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:06,632
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

457
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:13,473
<i>We used to dance to the music...</i>

458
00:49:45,631 --> 00:49:50,468
<i>...has increased over 80%
in the last three years.</i>

459
00:49:51,512 --> 00:49:53,971
<i>And what's more, in two years' time,</i>

460
00:49:54,056 --> 00:49:58,518
<i>we'll be experiencing
what's known as the Jupiter effect,</i>

461
00:49:58,852 --> 00:50:02,772
<i>wherein all the planets
of the known universe will be lined up,</i>

462
00:50:02,856 --> 00:50:07,235
<i>causing an incredible wave
of destructive power...</i>

463
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:13,116
<i>...in John 6:18,</i>

464
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:18,663
<i>the Lord out and tells us
that these are the signs</i>

465
00:50:18,747 --> 00:50:22,208
<i>by which we shall know
that he is among us.</i>

466
00:50:24,711 --> 00:50:27,880
<i>There are many good people
who disagree with me,</i>

467
00:50:27,965 --> 00:50:34,428
<i>but it is my belief that
this Antichrist is alive today</i>

468
00:50:35,347 --> 00:50:39,392
<i>and living in that ten-nation alliance
I spoke of earlier.</i>

469
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:46,031
<i>This is WKLJ through the night.</i>

470
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:49,235
<i>And I'm John Lievsay.</i>

471
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:52,738
<i>I'll be here with you
till 6:00 this morning,</i>

472
00:50:52,823 --> 00:50:55,858
<i>when Mike Miller will be stepping in.</i>

473
00:50:58,203 --> 00:51:00,913
<i>Here's a request we really had to dig for.</i>

474
00:51:00,998 --> 00:51:03,833
<i>It's another song
from south of the border.</i>

475
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,294
<i>Yeah?</i>

476
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:52,379
Abby, you all right?

477
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:55,549
<i>Ray? What time is it?</i>

478
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:57,092
I don't know.

479
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:58,886
It's early.

480
01:01:00,805 --> 01:01:02,181
I love you.

481
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:06,643
<i>You all right?</i>

482
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:08,812
I don't know.

483
01:01:09,522 --> 01:01:11,190
I better get off now.

484
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:13,567
<i>Well, I'll see you.</i>

485
01:01:14,694 --> 01:01:16,320
<i>And thanks, Ray.</i>

486
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,805
Abby...

487
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,411
Hey, Ray.

488
01:04:21,714 --> 01:04:24,091
Why didn't you get into bed?

489
01:04:24,175 --> 01:04:26,385
I didn't think I could sleep.

490
01:04:27,845 --> 01:04:29,805
Surprised you could.

491
01:04:31,307 --> 01:04:33,475
You called me this morning.

492
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,394
Yeah.

493
01:04:37,605 --> 01:04:40,440
I just wanted to let you know
that everything is all right.

494
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,651
I took care of everything.

495
01:04:43,695 --> 01:04:46,363
Now all we have to do is keep our heads.

496
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:47,948
What do you mean?

497
01:04:48,032 --> 01:04:49,408
I know about it, Abby.

498
01:04:51,786 --> 01:04:53,495
I went to the bar last night.

499
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:54,663
What happened?

500
01:04:54,747 --> 01:04:55,956
Was Meurice there?

501
01:04:56,082 --> 01:04:57,290
Yeah.

502
01:04:59,085 --> 01:05:01,086
He didn't see me, though.

503
01:05:03,131 --> 01:05:04,631
Nobody saw me.

504
01:05:06,092 --> 01:05:07,843
Is it cold in here?

505
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,262
Well, what happened?

506
01:05:14,434 --> 01:05:17,519
I cleaned it all up.
But that ain't important.

507
01:05:18,438 --> 01:05:20,188
What's important is what we do now.

508
01:05:20,273 --> 01:05:22,524
I mean, we can't go around half-cocked.

509
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:29,322
What we need is time to think about this,

510
01:05:30,116 --> 01:05:31,408
figure it out.

511
01:05:31,617 --> 01:05:33,785
Anyway, we got some time now.

512
01:05:34,704 --> 01:05:36,663
We gotta be smart.

513
01:05:36,748 --> 01:05:37,748
Ray...

514
01:05:37,832 --> 01:05:40,876
Abby, you should never point a gun
at anyone unless you mean to shoot him,

515
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,712
and if you shoot him,
you better make sure he's dead.

516
01:05:43,796 --> 01:05:46,131
'Cause if he ain't dead,
he's gonna get up and try and kill you.

517
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:50,385
The only thing they taught us in
the service that's worth a God damn.

518
01:05:54,348 --> 01:05:56,266
Where in the hell's my windbreaker?

519
01:05:58,770 --> 01:05:59,936
Ray...

520
01:06:01,814 --> 01:06:03,899
Just tell me what happened.

521
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:08,403
That ain't important.

522
01:06:09,781 --> 01:06:13,408
What's important is that we did it.
That's the only thing that matters.

523
01:06:13,493 --> 01:06:15,744
We both did it for each other.

524
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,412
That's what's important.

525
01:06:17,497 --> 01:06:20,123
I don't know what you're talking about.

526
01:06:23,586 --> 01:06:26,338
I mean, what are you talking about?

527
01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:30,342
I haven't done anything funny.

528
01:06:32,929 --> 01:06:34,179
What was that?

529
01:06:34,263 --> 01:06:36,389
Ray, you're not even acting like yourself.

530
01:06:36,474 --> 01:06:40,268
First you call me at 5:00 in the a.m.,
saying all kind of nice things on the phone,

531
01:06:40,353 --> 01:06:42,437
and then you come charging in here,
scaring me half to death,

532
01:06:42,522 --> 01:06:46,191
without even telling me
what I'm supposed to be scared of.

533
01:06:48,027 --> 01:06:51,780
I mean, if you two had a fight
or something, I don't care.

534
01:06:54,492 --> 01:06:56,551
Just as long as...

535
01:07:03,626 --> 01:07:05,001
Pick it up.

536
01:07:16,722 --> 01:07:18,106
What?

537
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:35,824
Well, that's him.

538
01:07:38,035 --> 01:07:39,077
Who?

539
01:07:39,912 --> 01:07:41,079
Marty.

540
01:07:55,219 --> 01:07:57,429
What's going on with you two?

541
01:08:12,111 --> 01:08:13,445
All right.

542
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:21,119
You can call him back, whoever it was.

543
01:08:23,789 --> 01:08:25,790
I'll get out of your way.

544
01:08:35,426 --> 01:08:37,552
You left your weapon behind.

545
01:08:55,288 --> 01:08:58,073
<i>Hi, Meurice, this is Helene,
Helene Trend, you know?</i>

546
01:08:58,157 --> 01:09:00,242
<i>And I'm calling 'cause I wanna know
just what the hell that remark</i>

547
01:09:00,326 --> 01:09:01,743
<i>you made about Sylvia is supposed to mean.</i>

548
01:09:01,827 --> 01:09:03,912
<i>She said you're full of shit,
and frankly, I believe her.</i>

549
01:09:03,996 --> 01:09:05,497
<i>And, hey, I love you, too, sure.</i>

550
01:09:05,581 --> 01:09:06,790
<i>Anyway, you better call me soon,</i>

551
01:09:06,874 --> 01:09:10,072
<i>'cause I'm going to South America
tonight, you know, Uruguay.</i>

552
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:13,505
<i>Listen, asshole, it's Marty.
I just got back from Corpus Christi,</i>

553
01:09:13,589 --> 01:09:16,883
<i>and there's a lot of money missing
from the safe. A lot of money.</i>

554
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:20,637
<i>I'm not saying you took it, but the place
was your responsibility, Meurice,</i>

555
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:23,556
<i>and I told you to keep an eye
on your asshole friend.</i>

556
01:09:23,641 --> 01:09:26,291
<i>Don't come to the bar tonight.
I got some...</i>

557
01:09:26,377 --> 01:09:28,436
<i>Damn machine. What is this?</i>

558
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:30,230
<i>The bar is still gonna be closed tonight.</i>

559
01:09:30,314 --> 01:09:31,940
<i>I got some other business to take care of,</i>

560
01:09:32,024 --> 01:09:35,694
<i>but tomorrow I wanna have
a word with you and with Ray,</i>

561
01:09:35,778 --> 01:09:36,861
<i>if you can find him.</i>

562
01:10:12,064 --> 01:10:14,399
I hope you're planning on leaving town.

563
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:15,900
You got a problem, Meurice?

564
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:17,485
No, but you do, cowboy.

565
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:19,154
Have you been to the bar?

566
01:10:20,656 --> 01:10:21,656
Why?

567
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:23,616
You shouldn't have taken
the fucking money!

568
01:10:23,701 --> 01:10:26,119
Look at me, man. Now, I'm serious.

569
01:10:26,203 --> 01:10:28,747
You broke in the bar,
and you ripped off the fucking safe.

570
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:30,373
Abby warned me about you.

571
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:31,833
You know what your problem is?

572
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:33,501
You're too fucking obvious.

573
01:10:33,586 --> 01:10:37,297
The only two people with the combination
are you and me, and Abby, maybe.

574
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:40,592
These fucking things
are nothing but coffin nails.

575
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:45,472
Hey, look, Ray, personally
I don't give a shit, you know.

576
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:48,350
Look, man, I know Marty's a hard-on,
but you gotta do something.

577
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:52,729
Say you're sorry, give the money back,
get the fuck out of here, or something.

578
01:10:55,107 --> 01:10:56,107
Shit.

579
01:10:58,402 --> 01:11:02,280
Hey, look, man, this is very humiliating,
preaching about this bullshit.

580
01:11:04,825 --> 01:11:08,453
But I'm not laughing, Ray Bob,
so you know it's no fucking joke.

581
01:11:32,269 --> 01:11:33,269
Damn.

582
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:48,733
Ray?

583
01:16:26,897 --> 01:16:29,273
Lover boy ought to lock the door.

584
01:16:31,443 --> 01:16:32,777
I love you.

585
01:16:35,447 --> 01:16:37,949
That's a stupid thing to say, right?

586
01:16:40,703 --> 01:16:42,286
I love you, too.

587
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,122
No.

588
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:49,168
You're just saying that
because you're scared.

589
01:16:55,134 --> 01:16:57,427
You left your weapon behind.

590
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:02,481
He'll kill you, too.

591
01:17:44,016 --> 01:17:45,057
Ray?

592
01:17:56,987 --> 01:17:58,738
Where is everything?

593
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:03,868
In the trunk.

594
01:18:07,206 --> 01:18:08,581
In the car.

595
01:18:13,754 --> 01:18:15,171
You leaving?

596
01:18:15,672 --> 01:18:17,673
Isn't that what you want?

597
01:18:21,094 --> 01:18:23,012
You wanna come with me?

598
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:26,057
I gotta know what happened first.

599
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:42,240
What you wanna know?

600
01:18:44,243 --> 01:18:47,328
You broke into the bar
and you wanted to get your money.

601
01:18:47,412 --> 01:18:50,055
And you and Marty
had a fight or something.

602
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:54,252
Well, I don't know. Wasn't it you?

603
01:18:57,422 --> 01:19:00,007
- Maybe a burglar broke in and then...
- With your gun.

604
01:19:01,802 --> 01:19:03,678
Nobody broke in, Abby.

605
01:19:06,348 --> 01:19:08,307
I'll tell you the truth.

606
01:19:15,274 --> 01:19:17,024
Truth is that...

607
01:19:19,903 --> 01:19:22,780
I been feeling sick
the last couple of days.

608
01:19:26,285 --> 01:19:27,785
I can't sleep.

609
01:19:29,955 --> 01:19:31,289
Can't eat.

610
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:35,751
When I try...

611
01:19:44,595 --> 01:19:45,720
Ab.

612
01:19:51,977 --> 01:19:53,311
Truth is...

613
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,733
He was alive when I buried him.

614
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,786
Yeah, yeah. Just a second.

615
01:20:24,009 --> 01:20:25,551
Abby, what's the matter?

616
01:20:25,636 --> 01:20:28,012
I think Marty's dead. Can I come in?

617
01:20:30,766 --> 01:20:34,143
That's bullshit.
Marty called me after he was jacked up.

618
01:20:57,167 --> 01:21:00,252
I don't know where Marty is,
but he's not dead.

619
01:21:00,754 --> 01:21:03,172
Now, you relax, and I'll go find him.

620
01:21:03,256 --> 01:21:06,362
And stay away from Ray.
The guy's gone nuts.

621
01:22:49,654 --> 01:22:51,030
Turn it off.

622
01:22:55,243 --> 01:22:56,410
Ray.

623
01:23:00,749 --> 01:23:02,374
Just turn it off!

624
01:23:05,212 --> 01:23:06,295
Why?

625
01:23:08,882 --> 01:23:10,800
No curtains on the windows.

626
01:23:12,302 --> 01:23:13,344
So?

627
01:23:16,139 --> 01:23:17,431
I think someone's watching.

628
01:23:17,516 --> 01:23:18,849
So what'll they see?

629
01:23:19,101 --> 01:23:21,519
Just leave it off. He can see in.

630
01:23:22,771 --> 01:23:25,564
You do anything, the neighbors will hear.

631
01:23:32,697 --> 01:23:34,115
You...

632
01:23:36,201 --> 01:23:37,868
Abby, I meant it.

633
01:23:39,538 --> 01:23:41,038
When I called.

634
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:45,042
I love you, too.

635
01:23:45,836 --> 01:23:47,336
But you're scared.

636
01:25:45,497 --> 01:25:46,914
All right.

637
01:25:47,374 --> 01:25:50,459
Now, you've got some
personal property of mine.

638
01:26:02,514 --> 01:26:04,139
What did you do?

639
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:18,362
Now, I don't know what the hell
you two thought you was gonna pull off.

640
01:32:23,227 --> 01:32:25,437
I'm not afraid of you, Marty.

641
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:48,752
Well, ma'am, if I see him,

642
01:32:49,587 --> 01:32:51,880
I'll sure give him the message.

643
01:33:18,908 --> 01:33:22,369
<i>You're sweet as a honey bee</i>

644
01:33:22,453 --> 01:33:26,540
<i>But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain</i>

645
01:33:26,624 --> 01:33:30,711
<i>All you left is our favorite song</i>

646
01:33:30,795 --> 01:33:34,005
<i>The one we danced to all night long</i>

647
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:37,968
<i>It used to bring sweet memories</i>

648
01:33:38,136 --> 01:33:41,680
<i>Of a tender love that used to be</i>

649
01:33:41,764 --> 01:33:45,475
<i>Now it's the same old song</i>

650
01:33:45,601 --> 01:33:49,563
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

651
01:33:49,647 --> 01:33:52,816
<i>It's the same, same old song</i>

652
01:33:53,276 --> 01:33:55,193
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

653
01:33:55,278 --> 01:33:57,571
<i>And it breaks me up to hear it</i>

654
01:33:57,655 --> 01:34:00,490
<i>I, oh, I</i>

655
01:34:00,575 --> 01:34:04,119
<i>Sentimental fool am I</i>

656
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:08,874
<i>To hear an old love song and wanna cry</i>

657
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:12,586
<i>But the melody keeps haunting me</i>

658
01:34:13,087 --> 01:34:16,548
<i>Reminding me how in love we used to be</i>

659
01:34:16,632 --> 01:34:20,177
<i>I keep hearing the part
that used to touch our hearts</i>

660
01:34:20,261 --> 01:34:24,097
<i>Saying together forever
Darling, breaking up never</i>

661
01:34:24,182 --> 01:34:27,976
<i>It's the same old song
Ain't glad to hear it</i>

662
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:32,022
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

663
01:34:32,106 --> 01:34:35,025
<i>It's the same old song</i>

664
01:34:35,485 --> 01:34:39,529
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

665
01:34:58,633 --> 01:35:02,260
<i>We used to dance to the music
We used to dance to the music</i>

666
01:35:02,345 --> 01:35:06,640
<i>Make romance to the music
Make romance to the music</i>

667
01:35:06,724 --> 01:35:09,392
<i>It's the same old song</i>

668
01:35:10,102 --> 01:35:13,897
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

669
01:35:13,981 --> 01:35:17,108
<i>Now it's the same old song</i>

670
01:35:17,735 --> 01:35:21,696
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

671
01:35:22,073 --> 01:35:25,534
<i>I, oh, I can't bear to hear it</i>

672
01:35:25,618 --> 01:35:28,703
<i>It's the same old song</i>

673
01:35:29,163 --> 01:35:33,166
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

674
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:36,419
<i>It's the same old song</i>

675
01:35:36,879 --> 01:35:40,590
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>
