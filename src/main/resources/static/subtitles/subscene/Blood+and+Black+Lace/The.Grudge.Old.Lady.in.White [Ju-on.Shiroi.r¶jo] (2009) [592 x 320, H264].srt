Ju-On is the curse of a person who died with a deep grudge. This grudge is accumulated in the place where that person lived and becomes its "Karma". Whoever gets in contact with this curse loses his life and a new curse is being born.

I'm from the Nicola pastry shop.

Don't you really want that I bring you to school?

32
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,040
No, it looks strange if an elementary school student comes to school by taxi.

33

228
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,800
Maybe I should go...

229

238
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,480
Why not?

239
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,200
I can't tell her, even though we're living in the same house.

240
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,680

She was working overtime...

314
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,200

325
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
You mean, because she listened to that cassette?

326
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,600
Why did she kill herself?

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,520
There are still so many things I want to do.

382
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,000
Then have an abortion.

383
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,200
I would, but...

384
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,480
<i>120.2.2.</i>

385
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,880
<i>I'll come.</i>

386
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,480
<i>I'll come soon.</i>

387
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,000
<i>I'll come soon.</i>

388
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,080
<i>Hurry.</i>

389
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,760
<i>I'm scared.</i>

390
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,000
<i>Come here.</i>

391
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,720
<i>Come here.</i>

392
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,840
Miho.

393
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,840
I think, granny called.

394
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,760
Yes.

395
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,480
I'm busy right now, but I'll come soon.

396
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,280
Are you hungry?

397
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,480
Shall I make you something?

398
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,400
Yes?

399
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,520
Miho.

400
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,400
What?

401
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,600
No!

402
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,600
Ah! That hurts!

403
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,080
No!

404
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,840
Ouch!

405
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:34,400
That hurts! That hurts! That hurts!

406
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,920
Stop it!

407
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,800
No!

408
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,680
I don't want that!

409
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,720
No!

410
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,240
No!

411
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,440
Dear passenger.

412
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,160
Do you have any plans for Christmas?

413
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,200
I'll spend Christmas together with my daughter.

414
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,720
She's in the fourth class.

415
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,000
But I still don't have a present for her...

416
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,480
Do you know what children of that age like?

417
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,320
I'll come.

418
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,360
I'll come soon.

419
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,520
I'll come soon.

420
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,440
Hurry.

421
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,040
I'm scared.

422
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,040
Come here.

423
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Sorry.

424
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,560
Sorry.

425
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,200
Sorry.

426
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,160
I'm home.

427
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,360
[I'll be late from work today. Please eat without me. - Mom]

428
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,360
Welcome home!

429
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,040
Mom?

430
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,560
Akane.

431
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,240
Akane...

432
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,840
I'm sorry.

433
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,200
I'm sorry.

434
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,560
I'm sorry.

435
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,160
I'm sorry.

436
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,640
I'm sorry.

437
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,520
I'm sorry.

438
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,240
I'm sorry.

439
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,280
I'm sorry.
