1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,199
The world is full
of complainers.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,000
The fact is,
nothing comes with a guarantee.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,680
I don't care if you're
the Pope of Rome,

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,520
President of the United States
or Man of the Year.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,520
Something can always go wrong.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,439
Go ahead, you know, complain,
tell your problems
to your neighbor,

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,880
ask for help and watch him fly.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
Now, in Russia,
they got it mapped out..

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,080
so that everyone pulls
for everyone else.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,560
That's the theory anyway.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,600
What I know about is Texas.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,440
Down here, you're on your own.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,240
He gave me a little
pearl-handled.38
for our first anniversary.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,120
Uh..huh.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,920
Figured I'd better leave
before I used it on him.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,080
I just don't know how
you can stand him.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,880
I'm only an employee.
I ain't married to him.
Yeah.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,879
It's just..

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,039
I don't know.

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,120
Sometimes I think
maybe there's something
wrong with him.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,480
Like maybe he's sick..
mentally.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,320
Or is it maybe me,
do you think?

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,120
Listen, I..

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,420
I ain't a marriage counselor.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,880
I don't know what goes on.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't wanna know.

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,040
But I like you.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,800
I always liked you.

29
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,980
What are you gonna do
in Houston?

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,640
I'll figure something out.

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,340
How come you offered
to drive me in this mess?

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,680
I told you.
I like you.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,180
I never knew that.

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,420
Well, now you do.

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,580
Hell!

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
Stop the car, Ray!

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,940
You know that car?

38
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,700
No.

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
What's the matter?

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,320
I don't know.

41
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,820
I just think maybe
I'm making a mistake.

42
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,000
What was that back there?

43
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,680
Back where?

44
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,740
That sign.

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
I don't know.

46
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,040
Motel.

47
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,600
Abby..
Ray?

48
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,220
Did you mean
what you said before?

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Or were you just being
a gentleman?

50
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,980
Abby, I like you.

51
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,880
But it's no point
in starting anything now.

52
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,400
Yeah.

53
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,080
- I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,920
What do you wanna do?

55
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,080
What do you wanna do?

56
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,200
Hello.
Having a good time?

57
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,560
Who is this?
I don't know.

58
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,880
Who's this?

59
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,440
You still there?
Yeah, I'm still here.

60
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Ray?

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,400
Yeah?
Who was it?

62
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,000
Your husband.

63
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,640
I know where you
can get those framed.

64
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
Why'd you take these?

65
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,600
What do you mean?
Just doin' my job.

66
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
You called me.
I knew they were there.
Why'd you take 'em?

67
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,160
I don't know.

68
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,840
Call it a fringe benefit.

69
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,040
How long you watch 'em?

70
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,240
Most of the night.

71
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,040
They'd rest
every few minutes, then..
they'd get started again.

72
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,720
Hmm.

73
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,520
Quite somethin'.

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,880
Hmm. You know in Greece..

75
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,520
they would cut off the head
of the messenger
that brought the bad news.

76
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,119
That don't make much sense.

77
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,520
No.

78
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,640
Made them feel better.

79
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,040
Well, first off,

80
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,600
Julian,

81
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,920
I don't know what
the story is in Greece,

82
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,240
but in this state
we got very definite laws
about that.

83
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,480
Second, I'm not a messenger.

84
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm a private investigator.

85
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,360
And third and most important,

86
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
it ain't such bad news.

87
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,760
I mean, you thought
he was colored.

88
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,960
You're always
assumin' the worst.

89
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Anything else?

90
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,800
Mm..hmm.
Don't come around here
anymore.

91
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,840
If I need ya,
I'll know what rock
to turn over.

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
That's good!

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
"What rock to turn over."

94
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,280
Very, very good!

95
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,180
Give me a call whenever
you wanna cut off my head.

96
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,680
I can always crawl around
without it.

97
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,360
We'll be back after a spell.
Hope you will be too.

98
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,640
Hold it, hold it.

99
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,160
Where was I?

100
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,560
You were telling me
about the Ring of Fire.
Oh, yeah, right. Look.

101
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,840
You got all these volcanoes,
right?

102
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,680
And every time one goes "pop",
you got the equivalent of what?

103
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,360
- Twenty, thirty megatons of T.N.T.
- Meurice.

104
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,360
Yeah, I know, Marty,
pour 'em short.

105
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,159
Did Ray come in yet?
You know
it's his night off.

106
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,880
Where was he last night?
How would I know
where he was last night?

107
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,280
I don't know.
Didn't he call?

108
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,200
Marty, this is, um..

109
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,800
an old friend of mine,
this is Debra.

110
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,940
Debra, this is Julian Marty.

111
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,600
- Deuce in the corner needs help.
- Right.

112
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,700
How long
you known Meurice?
About ten years.

113
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,480
Ten years.

114
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,580
What are you doin'
tonight?
Goin' out
with Meurice.

115
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,280
Tell him you have a headache.

116
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,640
I'll pass.

117
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
We don't seem to be..
communicating..

118
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,640
Look, you wanna hustle me?
I don't wanna be hustled.
You don't?

119
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,639
It's as simple as that.
Oh, it's as simple
as that.

120
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,080
Meurice, I'm not here
if Ray comes, okay?

121
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,760
- Right.
- Right.

122
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,760
Nice guy.
Not really.

123
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,160
What'd you say
your last name was?

124
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,360
Opal.

125
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,960
Ray?

126
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,640
Yeah?
Let's get outta here.

127
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,160
You get what you wanted?
Yeah.
Let's get outta here.

128
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,439
Drive me to a motel?

129
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,280
You can stay at my place.
I'll drop you there.

130
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,119
Where are you going?
See a guy.

131
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Ray, don't go to the bar.

132
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,999
I know him.
It ain't a good idea.

133
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I've just gotta see a guy.

134
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,879
So, it's a deal.

135
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,320
You and your colleagues
find a way to harness this
vast volcanic energy,

136
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,679
and I just sit back and watch
these shit kickers go broke.

137
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,400
Howdy, stranger.
Meurice, sorry about
last night.

138
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,119
No sweat. Wasn't too busy.
You missed a good one though.

139
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,159
This white guy walks in
about 1:00 and asks if we have
a discount for alcoholics.

140
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,200
I tell him to get lost.

141
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,400
Now, Marty's here and I can tell
he's thinking that maybe
that ain't such a bad idea.

142
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,840
Marty?

143
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,320
Well, what?

144
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,600
What "what"?
Am I fired?

145
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,200
You wanna hit me, what?

146
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,640
I don't particularly
want to talk to you.

147
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,680
Well,

148
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,280
you're not gonna fire me,
I might as well quit.

149
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,080
Fine.

150
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,200
Suit yourself.

151
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
Having a good time?

152
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,320
I don't like this kind of talk.

153
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,399
What'd you come here for?

154
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,600
You owe me for two weeks.

155
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,720
No.

156
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,160
She's an expensive piece
of ass.

157
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,240
But you get a refund
if you tell me who else
she's been sluicing.

158
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,840
I want that money.
You got somethin' to tell me, fine.

159
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,840
You a fucking
marriage counselor?

160
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,760
What are you smilin' at?

161
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,119
I'm funny, right?
I'm an asshole?

162
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,719
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

163
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,800
That's not what's funny.

164
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,319
What's funny is her.

165
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,240
What's funny is that
I had you two followed..

166
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,880
because if it's not you
she's sleeping with, it's someone else.

167
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,480
And what's
really gonna be funny..

168
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,360
is when she gives you
that innocent look and says,

169
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,799
"I don't know what
you're talkin' about, Ray."

170
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,120
"I ain't done anything funny."

171
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,879
But the funniest thing
to me right now..

172
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,520
is that you think
that she came back here
for you.

173
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,120
That's what's fucking funny!

174
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,060
Come on this property again,
I'll be forced to shoot you.

175
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,880
Fair notice.

176
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,480
Hey, Marty?

177
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,560
Marty, thought you were dead.
You goin' home?

178
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,480
No.

179
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,960
I'm staying right here in hell.

180
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,520
It's kind of a bleak
point of view,
isn't it, Marty?

181
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,560
Meurice,

182
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,420
I don't want the asshole
near my money.

183
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,220
And I don't want him
in the bar.

184
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,740
We get a lot of assholes
in here, Marty.

185
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,100
Hello?

186
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,300
Marty?

187
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,100
- Who was it?
- What?

188
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,120
On the phone.

189
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,319
Was it for you?

190
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,039
I don't know.
He didn't say anything.

191
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,960
How'd you know it was a he?

192
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,600
You got a girl?

193
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,520
Am I screwing something up
by being here?
No.

194
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Am I?

195
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,200
I can find a place tomorrow,
and I'll be out of your hair.

196
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,160
If that's what you wanna do
then you oughta do it.

197
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,240
You, uh..

198
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,800
You want the bed or the couch?

199
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,720
Well,

200
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,860
couch will be all right.

201
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,120
You can sleep on the bed
if you want.

202
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,800
I'm not gonna put you
outta your bed.

203
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Wouldn't be puttin' me out.

204
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I'll be all right here.

205
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,500
Okay.

206
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,160
Opal?

207
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,680
Lover-boy oughta lock
his door.

208
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,840
Lotta nuts out there.

209
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,520
Let's do it outside..
in nature, hmm?

210
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,880
I'd like to have seen his face
when he found the dead end.

211
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,400
Hey, mister,
how'd you break
your pussy finger?

212
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,160
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
my date is here.

213
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,320
She saw me rolling a cigarette,
thought it was marijuana.

214
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Thought I was a swinger.

215
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,480
Isn't that wild?

216
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,400
Stick your finger
up the wrong person's ass?

217
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
You know, you know,

218
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,800
a friend of mine
a while back broke his hand,
put in a cast.

219
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,160
The very next day he falls,
protects his bad hand
and he breaks his good one.

220
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,880
He breaks that too, you know?

221
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,560
Now he's got
two busted flippers.
So I says to him..

222
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,080
I said, "Creighton,
I hope your wife
really loves you".

223
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,840
'Cause for the next
five weeks, you can't even
wipe your own goddamn ass.

224
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,240
That's a test.
Test of true love.

225
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,200
- I got a job for you.

226
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,800
Well, if the pay's right
and it's legal,
I'll do it.

227
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,360
It's not strictly legal.

228
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,360
Well, if the pay's right,
I'll do it.

229
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,440
It's in reference
to that gentleman and my wife.

230
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,439
The more I think about it,

231
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,880
the more irritated I get.

232
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,520
Could you tell me what it is
you want me to do,

233
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,760
or is it a secret?

234
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
It's no joke.

235
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,240
You want me to kill 'em.

236
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,479
Well..

237
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,560
Well what?

238
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,999
What do you think?

239
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,880
You're an idiot.

240
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,880
So this wouldn't..
wouldn't interest you, huh?

241
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I didn't say that.
All I said was
you're an idiot.

242
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,400
Hell, you've been thinkin'
about it for so much,
it's driving you simple.

243
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,680
I'll give you $10,000.

244
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,960
I'm supposed to..
do a murder..

245
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,240
two murders..

246
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,560
trust you not to go simple
on me..

247
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,440
and do something stupid.

248
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,600
I mean really stupid.

249
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,880
Now why should I trust you?

250
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,760
For the money.
The money.

251
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,839
Yeah,

252
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,920
that's a right smart of money.

253
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,960
In Russia,

254
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,600
they make only 50 cent a day.

255
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,999
I want you, uh, to go fishing.

256
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,320
What?
Go down to Corpus
for a few days.

257
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,240
Get yourself noticed.

258
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,840
I'll give you a call
when it's done.

259
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,540
You just find a way
to cover that money.

260
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,200
I'll take care of the money.
You make sure those bodies
aren't found.

261
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,360
There's a big incinerator
behind my place.

262
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,640
So you want
like a town house?
Your own apartment?

263
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,119
I show you around.

264
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,440
You sure this apartment
is vacant, Mrs. Esteves?
Oh, yes.

265
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,000
I was just explaining to him..

266
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,040
that he moved out yesterday.

267
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,800
Don't mind Mr. Garcia.
He used to be my brother-in-law.

268
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,480
Looks like the state legislature
is out of session.

269
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,160
Yeah, I thought
this was where they met.

270
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,039
Listen, you're gonna help me
with a problem.
I am?

271
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,200
You're gonna keep an eye
on Marty and Ray.
Make sure nothing happens.

272
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,880
Gentlemen,
let's show our appreciation
for Lorraine up there,

273
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,480
a registered nurse
from Bolton, Texas.

274
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,080
How 'bout it, gentlemen?

275
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,640
Thanks, Meurice.
Any time.

276
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,080
Hey, you don't have to worry
'bout a thing for a while.
Marty went to Corpus yesterday.

277
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,040
He's in the house.

278
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,000
He's in the house!

279
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,120
What's the matter?
Could've sworn
I heard somethin'.

280
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,480
Door's locked.
There's nothing there.

281
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,320
Well,

282
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,700
I guess we wouldn't
have heard anything
if it had been him.

283
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,080
He's real careful.

284
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,039
Fact is..

285
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,879
he's anal, Ray.
Huh?

286
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,600
Mm..hmm.
He told me once himself.
He said to me..

287
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,600
"In here.."

288
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,040
"Abby, in here I'm anal."

289
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,360
Well, I'll be damned.

290
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,080
I couldn't believe it myself.

291
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,020
Me, on the other hand,
I got lots of personality.

292
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,920
Marty said I had too much.
But he was never big
on personality.

293
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,559
He sent me to
a psychiatrist once to see
if he could calm me down some.

294
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,520
Yeah?
And what happened?

295
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,640
Psychiatrist said I was
the healthiest person
he ever met so Marty fired him.

296
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,640
I don't think you can fire
a psychiatrist, exactly.

297
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,800
I never saw him again.
I can tell you that much.
Mm..hmm.

298
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,959
I said, "Marty,"

299
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,200
"how come you're anal
and I gotta go
to the psychiatrist?"

300
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,560
What did he say?
Nothing.

301
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,840
Just like you.
He doesn't say much.

302
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,760
Thanks.

303
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,640
Except when he doesn't say
things, they're usually nasty.
Mm..hmm.

304
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,680
And when you don't,
they're usually nice.

305
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,159
You ever get tired?
Hmm?

306
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Oh, yeah, I guess.

307
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,480
Uh..huh.

308
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,900
Hello?
Marty?

309
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,120
Yeah.
Catch any fish?

310
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,560
What?
Catch any fish?

311
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,599
Yeah, yeah.
What kind of fish?

312
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:53,000
Listen, is it done?
Yes, sir.
You owe me some money.

313
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,600
If you're fucking with me,
you'll regret it.

314
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,160
They look good.

315
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,200
Why?
You want a couple?

316
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,000
Just the 10,000 will be fine.

317
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,280
Got something to show me first?

318
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,500
Dead?

319
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,380
So it would seem.

320
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,920
What'd you do
with the bodies?
It's taken care of.

321
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,100
The less you know about it,
the better.

322
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,940
Jesus.

323
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,400
I don't believe it.

324
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,960
I'm gonna be sick.

325
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,500
I'm gonna want
that picture back.

326
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,880
- You did say somethin'
about the money.
- Yeah, the money.

327
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,140
Somethin' I gotta ask you,
Marty.

328
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,959
I've been very, very careful.

329
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,120
Have you been very,
very careful?

330
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,020
Of course.
Nobody knows
you hired me?

331
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,820
Don't be stupid.

332
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,580
I'm not about to tell anyone.

333
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,140
We have to learn
to be discreet.

334
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,080
Trust each other.

335
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,240
For richer..
for poorer.

336
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,440
Don't say that.

337
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,680
Your marriages
don't turn out so hot.

338
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,040
How did you cover
the money?
It's been taken care of.

339
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,800
The less you know about it,
the better.

340
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,380
I made a call.

341
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,420
It'll be all right.

342
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,420
You must've gone money simple.

343
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,740
A murder like this,
it's too risky.

344
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,680
Then you shouldn't
have done it.

345
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,640
Can't have it both ways.

346
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,360
Count it..
and go.

347
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,360
Nah.

348
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,760
I trust ya.

349
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,600
Who looks stupid now?

350
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Damn.

351
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,360
Marty?

352
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,180
What's the matter, you deaf?

353
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,040
Marty?

354
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,600
Marty, ya home?

355
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,679
Marty?

356
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,760
What night is tonight?

357
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,840
What night is tonight?
Tuesday.

358
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,400
Tuesday night is Ladies' Night.

359
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,640
What?
Tuesday night is Ladies' Night.

360
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,160
All your drinks are free.

361
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,100
Eighty percent
in the last three years.

362
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,280
What's more,
in two years' time,

363
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,000
we'll be experiencing
what's known as
The Jupiter Effect..

364
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,520
when all the planets
of the known universe
will align up..

365
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,600
causin' an incredible buildup
of destructive gravitational
force.

366
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,080
Now in Matthew, Chapter Six,
Verse 18,

367
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,759
the Lord out and tells us..

368
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,680
that these are the signs..

369
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,040
by which we shall know
that He is at our door.

370
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,200
There are many good people
who disagree with me,

371
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,799
but it's my belief
that this Antichrist..

372
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,879
is alive today..

373
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,160
and livin' in
the ten-nation alliance
I spoke of..

374
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,960
This is WKLJ midnight.

375
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm John Mucee.

376
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,360
These are requests here
we had to dig for.

377
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,880
Hello.
Abby, you all right?

378
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,400
Ray? What time is it?

379
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,360
I don't know.
It's early.

380
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,120
I love you.

381
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,200
You all right?

382
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,399
I don't know.

383
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,320
I better get off now.

384
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,599
Well, I'll see ya.

385
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,480
And thanks, Ray.
Abby..

386
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,400
Hey, Ray.

387
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,080
- Why didn't you get into bed?
- I didn't think I could sleep.

388
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,600
I'm surprised you could.

389
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,720
You called me this morning.

390
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,880
Yeah.

391
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,880
I just wanted to let you know
that everything is all right.

392
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,960
Took care of everything.

393
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,960
Now all we have to do
is keep our heads.

394
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,720
What do you mean?
I know about it,
Abby.

395
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,400
- I went to the bar last night.
- What happened?

396
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,080
Was Meurice there?
Yeah.

397
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,800
He didn't see me, though.

398
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,540
Nobody saw me.

399
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:04,880
- Is it cold in here?
- Well, what happened?

400
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,920
I cleaned it all up.

401
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,760
But that ain't important.
What's important
is what we do now.

402
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,880
We can't go around half-cocked.

403
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:26,079
What we need is, uh,
time to think about this..
figure it out.

404
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,480
We got some time now.
But we gotta be smart.

405
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,680
- Ray..
- Never point a gun at anyone
unless you mean to shoot him.

406
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,679
And if you shoot him,
you better make sure he's dead.

407
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,879
'Cause if he ain't dead,
he's gonna try and kill you.

408
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,760
The only thing
they taught us in the service
that's worth a goddamn.

409
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,360
Where in the hell's
my windbreaker?

410
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,960
Ray,

411
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,640
just tell me what happened.

412
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,920
That ain't important.

413
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,480
What's important is that
we did it. That's
the only thing that matters.

414
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:10,559
We both did it for each other.
That's what's important.

415
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,760
I don't know
what you're talking about.

416
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,920
I mean,
what are you talking about?

417
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,000
I haven't done anything funny.

418
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,600
What was that?
You ain't even acting
like yourself.

419
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,760
First you call me 5 in the a.m.
saying all kinds of nice things
on the phone.

420
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,959
And then you come
charging in here
scaring me half to death..

421
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,640
without even telling me
what I'm supposed
to be scared of.

422
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,280
If you two had a fight
or something, I don't care.

423
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,160
Just as long as..

424
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,760
Pick it up.

425
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,680
What?

426
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,080
Well, that was him.

427
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,280
- Who?
- Marty.

428
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,600
What's going on with you two?

429
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,240
All right.

430
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,320
You can call him back,
whoever it was.

431
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,760
I'll get out of your way.

432
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,280
You left your weapon behind.

433
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,280
Hi, Meurice.

434
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,000
This is Helene.
Helene Trend, you know?

435
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,560
I'm calling 'cause I wanna
know what the remark about
Sylvia is supposed to mean.

436
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,680
She says you're full of shit,
and, frankly, I believe her.

437
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,360
And, hey, I love you too.
You better call me soon..

438
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,040
'cause I'm going to
South America tonight..
Uruguay.

439
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,080
Listen, asshole.
It's Marty.

440
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,160
I just got back
from Corpus Christi,

441
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,960
and a lot of money's
missing from the safe..
a lot of money.

442
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,520
I'm not saying you took it,
but the place was
your responsibility.

443
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,399
And I told you to keep
an eye on your asshole friend.

444
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,079
Don't come to the bar tonight.
I got some busi..

445
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,600
Damn. What is this?
The bar's still
gonna be closed tonight.

446
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,520
I've got some other business
to take care of.

447
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,199
But tomorrow I wanna
have a word with you..

448
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,240
and with Ray,
if you can find him.

449
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,559
I hope you're planning
on leaving town.

450
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,839
- You got a problem, Meurice?
- No, but you do, cowboy.

451
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,319
Have you been to the bar?

452
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,920
Why?
You shouldn't have
taken the fuckin' money!

453
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,240
Look at me, man.
I'm serious.

454
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,840
You broke in the bar
and you ripped off
the fuckin' safe.

455
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,400
Abby warned me about you.
You know what your problem is?
You're too fuckin' obvious.

456
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,060
The only two people
with the combination
are you and me and Abby, maybe.

457
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,500
These fucking things
are nothing but coffin nails.

458
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,320
Hey, look, Ray.

459
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,840
Personally,
I don't give a shit, you know?

460
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,719
I know Marty's a hard-on,
but you gotta do something..

461
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,640
say you're sorry,
give the money back,

462
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,560
get the fuck
out of here or something.

463
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,280
Shit!

464
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,040
It's very humiliating,
preaching about this bullshit.

465
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,280
But I'm not laughing,
Ray Bob, so you know
it's no fucking joke.

466
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,320
Damn.

467
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,820
Ray?

468
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,780
Lover-boy oughta
lock the door.

469
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,080
I love you.

470
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,520
That's a stupid thing
to say, right?

471
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,559
I love you too.

472
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,800
No.

473
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,540
You're just saying that
because you're scared.

474
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,360
You left your weapon behind.

475
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,000
He'll kill you too.

476
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,240
Ray?

477
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,480
Where is everything?

478
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:28,060
In the trunk.

479
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,860
In the car.

480
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,320
- You leavin'?
- Isn't that what you want?

481
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:48,840
- Wanna come with me?
- I gotta know
what happened first.

482
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,820
What you wanna know?

483
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,040
You broke into the bar.
You wanted to get your money,
and you and Marty had a fight,

484
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,040
and somethin' hap..

485
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,660
I don't know.
Wasn't it you?

486
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:22,520
- Maybe a burglar broke in..
- With your gun?

487
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,160
Nobody broke in, Abby.

488
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,120
I'll tell you the truth.

489
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,880
The truth is..

490
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,840
I've been feeling sick
the last couple of days.

491
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,120
Can't sleep.

492
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,840
Can't eat.

493
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,880
When I try..

494
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,760
Abb..

495
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,960
The truth is..

496
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,780
he was alive when I buried him.

497
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,240
Yeah, just a second!

498
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,000
Abby,
what's the matter?
I think Marty's dead.

499
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,920
Can I come in?

500
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,880
That's bullshit.
Marty called me
after he was jacked up.

501
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,920
I don't know where Marty is,
but he's not dead.

502
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,440
Now, you relax,
and I'll go find him.

503
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,600
And stay away from Ray.
The guy's gone nuts.

504
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,480
Turn it off.

505
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,380
R..Ray..

506
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,560
Just turn it off.

507
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:17,760
Why?

508
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,400
- No curtains
on the windows.
- So?

509
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,039
- I think someone's watching.
- So what'll they see?

510
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,279
Just leave it off.
He can see in.

511
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,960
If you do anything,
the neighbors will hear.

512
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,200
You think..

513
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,980
Abby, I meant it..

514
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,640
when I called.

515
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,360
I love you too.

516
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,680
You're scared.

517
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,960
All right.

518
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,960
You got some
