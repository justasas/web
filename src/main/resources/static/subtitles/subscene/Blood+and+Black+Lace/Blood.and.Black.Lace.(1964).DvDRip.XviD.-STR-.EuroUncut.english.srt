1
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,993
Are you mad?
Why did you come here?

2
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,991
Isabella might see us...

3
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,996
- Do you have any?
- No

4
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,999
I can't stand it
I can't stand it any more

5
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,992
Don't be like that, Franco.
Have you asked Isabella?

6
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,991
I had a fight with her

7
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,992
Damn her, she even stole the bit I had.

8
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,999
Try to hold out.
We'll find some when I finish work.

9
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,996
Trust me, I'll help you.

10
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,989
Go now.

11
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,991
I'm counting on you.
Thanks. I'll be waiting.

12
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,797
Isabella, your scarf!

13
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,991
Thank you -Bye!

14
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,989
What's wrong?

15
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,992
The sign's come off again.

16
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,996
Do you want me to fix it tonight?

17
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,993
No, not tonight.
Do it tomorrow.

18
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,992
As usual,
Isabella's late again.

19
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,998
What's wrong with her?
It's the third time.

20
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,999
No need to get upset.
Just hit her with a fine.

21
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,995
I certainly will, and I'll fire
her if she's as late as yesterday.

22
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,992
- Good night, Madam.
- Good night.

23
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,991
Nicole!
Look at this dress!

24
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,429
Take more care.

25
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,391
We have another show tomorrow.

26
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,759
Okay, I'll be more careful.

27
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,995
Always in a hurry to leave.

28
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,999
You girls think of nothing else.

29
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,395
What does she want?

30
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,995
Being a widow is hard for her.

31
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,989
Isabella!

32
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,996
No thanks

33
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,471
How long where the lights out?

34
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,591
Ten minutes.

35
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,992
How long had she
worked for you?

36
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,996
About 2 years.

37
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,958
What was she like?

38
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,391
She was very lively.

39
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,956
Rather undisciplined,

40
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,958
but I can't criticize her.

41
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,992
Do you know if she had
many friends?

42
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,392
I can't help you much,
Inspector. I'm the administrator.

43
00:09:49,480 --> 00:10:01,950
Ask the two girls
who lived with her.

44
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,991
Unbelievable! It's awful.
It still hasn't sunk in.

45
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,949
Inspector Silvestri,
Countess Cristina, the owner.

46
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,991
Good morning.

47
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,791
Haven't we met before, Madam?

48
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,991
Or am I mistaken?

49
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,391
Yes, actually we have met.

50
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,991
After my husband's accident.

51
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,391
Precisely...

52
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,431
It was a car accident.

53
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,958
I imagine you can help.

54
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,956
You'll know all about your girls.

55
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,434
This isn't a boarding school!

56
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,473
I don't know or care
what they do after they leave.

57
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,991
Well... I'll go into the studio.

58
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,991
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

59
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,391
Come now, Peggy.
Stop crying.

60
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,553
What time was it when you

61
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,353
went out to fix the sign?

62
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,960
About seven. The banging
bothered Ms. Cristina.

63
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,355
So I went out to fix it,
but it was a patch-up job.

64
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,958
I protest! Mr. Morlachi,
I demand an explanation.

65
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,355
As soon as I entered
the villa,

66
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,358
these men grabbed me.
- Ask the Inspector.

67
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,358
- Inspector? - Calm down.
Why are you here?

68
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,439
- I'm Marquis Riccardo...
- Yes, but answer my question.

69
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,948
He came to get me.
He's my fiance.

70
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,989
Fiance!

71
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,356
What's so funny?

72
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,356
We live together.

73
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,958
You knew Isabella?

74
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,989
Isabella?

75
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,436
You introduced us once, didn't you?

76
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,950
Yes, let's say I knew her,
but only by sight.

77
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,991
I see.

78
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,991
Come on, Peggy...

79
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,991
Be brave.

80
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,958
She's the only one
who seems distressed.

81
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,956
They were good friends.

82
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,958
- You lived together?
- Yes.

83
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,958
Who did your friend
go out with?

84
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,956
I don't know.

85
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,959
Leave her alone. Everyone
knows who Isabella's lover was.

86
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,356
- Who are you?
- Cesare Lazzarini, designer.

87
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,356
Will you give me the name?

88
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,393
- The lover's name. - Franco Scalo,
the famous antique dealer.

89
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,991
- Police. Is the Inspector here?
- In there.

90
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,359
I assure you, I know nothing.

91
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,991
Excuse me for a moment.

92
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,391
It's be confirmed.

93
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,993
- So, shall I go?
- Yes, go.

94
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,956
So...

95
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,993
What sort of relationship did
you have with Isabella?

96
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,471
We were friends.

97
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,391
Or lovers?

98
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,436
I have a confession,
but don't be shocked.

99
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,948
I don't believe in everlasting
relationships.

100
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,958
I understand.

101
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,991
Do know know what this is?

102
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,993
No, I don't.
What is it?

103
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,471
Cocaine.

104
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,959
It was found in the house
of your friend Isabella.

105
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,956
At Isabella's?

106
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,956
So you didn't know?

107
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,956
No.

108
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,991
Never mind.

109
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,393
But I must ask you
to remain at my disposal.

110
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,991
I'll see you again.

111
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,991
Autumn evening

112
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,991
Turn around

113
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,991
All right, you can go.
Quickly, now!

114
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,956
What's wrong?

115
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,958
This was for poor Isabella.

116
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,958
- Yes...
- Now who'll wear it?

117
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,958
- Let me see. Peggy...
- No, please, I can't.

118
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,956
Don't cry
or your make-up will run.

119
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,956
- Greta, you wear it.

120
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,956
Sorry, but I can't.

121
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,956
- Don't be silly.
- It'll be bad luck.

122
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,958
- Someone has to.
- I will, Madam.

123
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,956
Hurry up.

124
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,991
That's no surprise.
She's such a cynic.

125
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,991
Ok, you may go.

126
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,471
Hurry up. Good. Now walk.

127
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,356
Just a minute!
Something's missing.

128
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,960
The green brooch.

129
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,434
No problem
Where is it?

130
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,436
Isabella brought her own.

131
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,473
She kept it in a box there.

132
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,991
Here it is.

133
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,993
Look what I found!
Isabella kept a diary.

134
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,991
It sounds interesting.

135
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,949
""He's a man who"
"stirs deep feeling in me.""

136
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,993
"-"I would die for him.""
- Show me.

137
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,958
- We don't have the right...
- Are you all mad?

138
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,356
This isn't the time.
Go on, get ready!

139
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,958
We should give this
to the police.

140
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,993
I found it and I'd like to hand it in
myself, if you don't mind.

141
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,991
As you wish.

142
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,479
Hello?

143
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,959
Hello Franco!
Why didn't you come?

144
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,958
I didn't feel well.
You know why.

145
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,993
Yes, but try to come right away.
I got some.

146
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,991
And listen, Franco.
I found a diary.

147
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,992
- Isabella's diary.
- Isabella's? Who else knows?

148
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,991
Everyone, unfortunately.

149
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,950
I realized too late it might
be compromising you.

150
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,436
I kept it and said
I'd take it to the police.

151
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,473
Good, then we'll have time to
take a look at it.

152
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,438
- I'll come straight over.
- You sound very sick, Franco.

153
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,471
Franco!
Franco? Can you hear me?

154
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,434
Yes, Nicole.

155
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,789
Sorry, I can't breathe. But you
have some, so I'll be better soon.

156
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,991
I'll be waiting.

157
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,991
Hurry girls!
Greta, you're next.

158
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,391
- Everything okay, Marco?
- Yes, Madam.

159
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,956
Where were you?

160
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,956
I'm here.

161
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,991
I have to do everything myself
around here.

162
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,799
Nicole!

163
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,956
Nicole! You're wanted on the phone.

164
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,991
- Me?
- Yes, you.

165
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,471
- Hello?
- Is that you, Nicole?

166
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,356
- Yes, who's this?
- It's Franco.

167
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
I can't come there.
I'm too sick.

168
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,958
Please come now!

169
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,956
I'm suffocating.

170
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,956
I can't get away right now.

171
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,958
All right, I'll do my best.

172
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,991
I'll try to come right away.

173
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,956
That's fine.

174
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,958
Peggy, Franco's sick. I have to
go to him immediately.

175
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,436
Lend me your car.

176
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,436
But the show isn't over.

177
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,438
So? Give me the keys

178
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,471
but don't let anyone see you.

179
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,991
Peggy!

180
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,393
- What are you doing?
- Just getting my hanky.

181
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,473
The alarm's
in the glove box

182
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,991
Ok! Thanks

183
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,991
Franco?

184
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,991
Franco?

185
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,991
Franco?

186
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,991
Franco?

187
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,991
Franco?

188
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,996
- Have fun but don't be too late
- Don't worry

189
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,956
Marco!

190
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,956
I want to stay and keep you

191
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,959
company till Nicole gets back.

192
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,991
Aren't you scared of
being home alone?

193
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,948
I'm very tired and I'd like

194
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,956
to go straight to bed.

195
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,993
But you'll have to stay up till
Nicole returns your car.

196
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,194
Please.

197
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,471
All right. As you wish.
Come on.

198
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,956
Thank you.
I couldn't leave you.

199
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,993
I'd have to worry about you,
alone in that house.

200
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,991
Clarice, you're still here?

201
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,993
Good evening, Miss.
Yes, I've just finished.

202
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,956
Isn't Miss Tao Li with you?

203
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,434
No, she'll be back later.

204
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,950
Clarice is our guardian.

205
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,993
Well, I'll be going. The dinner
is warming in the oven.

206
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,436
And Miss Tao Li's concotion
is ready for her to warm up.

207
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,471
Thank you, Clarice.
See you tomorrow.

208
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,956
Peggy...

209
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,958
- You never listen to me.
- I do listen!

210
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,959
You don't. And I'm tired of
telling you the same thing.

211
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,959
I've told you a thousand times.

212
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,436
I'm afraid I've fallen in love
with you.

213
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,471
But you don't care, why?

214
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,991
Calm down and come over here.

215
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,956
You see...

216
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,956
I'm not well.

217
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,991
I know you think I'm nuts,

218
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,991
and that drives me crazy.

219
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,956
I'm sick, unhappy...

220
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,958
Don't be like that.
I'm your friend.

221
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,991
Cheer up.

222
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,991
I'll take a cigarette.

223
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,950
- No, stop! Don't!
- I just wanted a cigarette.

224
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,991
What have I done?

225
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,993
I'll get it
or you'll mess up my bag.

226
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,991
Here.

227
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,991
Hello?

228
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,956
Hello, it's Inspector Silvestri.

229
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,956
Sorry to bother you.
I'm calling about your car.

230
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,956
We found it abandoned.

231
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,956
Has it been stolen?

232
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,958
No, I lent it to my friend Nicole.

233
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,993
Yes, she had to visit a sick friend.

234
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,956
Is something wrong?

235
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,993
I'd prefer not to do it over
the phone. May I come over?

236
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,956
Very well, I'll be there.

237
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,955
What's up?

238
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,958
They have my car but no Nicole.
God, what's happened?

239
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,958
The inspector is coming?

240
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,991
Yes, to see me.

241
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,993
Then I'll leave. I don't want the
police to find me with you.

242
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,958
Yes, it's better if no one knows
you were here.

243
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,993
Yes, it's better.
Especially for you.

244
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,999
- I'm sorry. See you tomorrow.
- Till tomorrow.

245
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,391
""I caught Peggy"
"stealing 100,000 lira from my bag.""

246
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,958
""She cried"
"and said she needed it.""

247
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,959
""She's pregnant"
"but can't handle the scandal.""

248
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,993
""I felt sorry for her, so I loaned"
"it to her""

249
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,993
""Tomorrow I'll ask the bastard"
"for 200,000 liras.""

250
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,993
""Where is the diary?""
I burned it!

251
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,956
Miss Peggy...

252
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,993
Good evening.
I know it's late to be visiting,

253
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,996
but it's urgent.

254
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,350
Don't worry. Do sit down.

255
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,960
What's this about?

256
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,991
Charles, you may go.

257
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,993
I just got back and found
Nicole in my shop...

258
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,991
- Murdered!
- My God!

259
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,959
I went to pick up Nicole...

260
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,958
You remember...
we bumped into each other.

261
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,959
I looked everywhere
but I couldn't find her.

262
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,991
So I went back home.

263
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,958
Believe me, I'll never
forget what I found.

264
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,958
Excuse me...

265
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,355
...but why did you come here
instead of the police?

266
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,358
Nicole was my friend.

267
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,960
She was killed in my shop.

268
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,958
The police are sure to blame me.

269
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,958
I need an alibi.
You must help me!

270
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,991
Me? Why do you ask me?

271
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,959
Because you're in
as much trouble as I am.

272
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,959
We must say we were together
till we left the fashion house.

273
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,436
I'll vouch for you
if you vouch for me.

274
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,436
It's in both our interests.

275
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,436
You're mad!

276
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,471
There's no reason
they'd suspect me.

277
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,513
You're the one in the fix.
Maybe you really did kill her.

278
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,993
No, call the police right
now or I will.

279
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,437
Fine, but tell them
about the IOUs too.

280
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,471
Which IOUs?

281
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,958
The collateral for Isabella's
7 million lira loan...

282
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,956
That you couldn't pay.

283
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,473
Is that true?
Riccardo, you didn't tell me!

284
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,956
Oh my God...

285
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,958
My dear Marquis,
you're flat broke.

286
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,959
You're ruined,
and scared of the scandal.

287
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,436
That's an excellent reason
to kill Isabella.

288
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,471
And maybe Nicole,

289
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,956
to make sure
the police didn't get the diary.

290
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,956
Who knows...

291
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,991
maybe it contained all the due dates.

292
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,434
Don't lie, Riccardo.
I told you

293
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,959
Nicole found Isabella's diary.

294
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,993
As you can see,
we're tied to each other.

295
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,956
If you don't want the police
to snoop into your affairs

296
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,434
you'd better do as I say.

297
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,473
Now I'll go to my shop
and ring the Inspector.

298
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,992
I'll tell him we were together.
Agreed?

299
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,991
Good night.

300
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,959
Why don't you believe me?
I burned that diary.

301
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,958
It contained things about me
that I didn't want made public.

302
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,993
I burned it!

303
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,993
I swear I burned it.

304
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,991
Believe me!

305
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,991
No, no!

306
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,959
How did that girl
get in here?

307
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,993
- She had a key.
- And why is that?

308
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,992
I gave her one. She visited me one time...

309
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,958
- Her too?
- Don't think...

310
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,993
- I left Isabella for Nicole.
- Who else had the keys?

311
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,992
- No one. Except me, of course.
- Of course.

312
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,991
Did you take drugs with her too?

313
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,993
- What Inspector?
- Come on, Scalo!

314
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,391
Who are you fooling?

315
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,993
You have a habit.
It's written all over your face.

316
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,958
I could even tell you
where you get your drugs.

317
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,991
And...

318
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,958
and as for the girls who,
shall we say, keep you company,

319
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,958
or who try to fight
your habit, like Isabella,

320
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,959
or who take drugs,
like this one, for instance...

321
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,994
That may well be,
but it doesn't make me a murderer.

322
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,151
Besides, I have an alibi.
I was...

323
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,431
I haven't asked you...
for the moment.

324
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,471
We'll discuss it later.

325
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,992
- When?
- Right away, in my office.

326
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,991
- Do you recognize this?
- Yes, that's it.

327
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,956
- You're sure?
- Yes.

328
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,989
Wait, I took down the first numbers.
Here, 4,5,3. What did I tell you?

329
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Did you see whether the driver was a man or a woman?

330
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,959
A man, I'm sure. He wore black
and seemed to have no face.

331
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,958
He could have been wearing a mask.

332
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,958
No idea. I looked
when I heard the horn.

333
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,958
- What horn?
- The car horn, Inspector.

334
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,958
It didn't go for long though.

335
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,991
All of a sudden, it stopped.

336
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,993
Could the alarm
be connected to the horn?

337
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,991
Wait, I'll check.

338
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,959
Yes, it's at the back
of the glove box.

339
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,956
- How long did it sound?
- I don't know.

340
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,958
- Not long, like I said.
- Tell me how long.

341
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,956
More or less that long.

342
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,991
Stop, not longer then that.

343
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,958
If you don't know where it is,
it takes a while to find.

344
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,956
Yes.

345
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,993
But if you know where it is hidden
it just takes a few seconds.

346
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,991
Come in.

347
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,436
Did you ever see any of these men

348
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,438
in Miss peggy's car?

349
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,948
- Hello, Mr. Morlachi
- Hello, Clarice.

350
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,958
- You saw him in the car?
- Of course, Inspector.

351
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,959
In the car and on foot.
Nothing strange about that.

352
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,991
I didn't say there was.

353
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,959
- I saw him in the car.
- What a revelation!

354
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,958
So what?
This is all a farce.

355
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,958
Be quiet.

356
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,915
I'm not the only one you saw.
Open your eyes, you fool.

357
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,959
You saw him too, for instance,
didn't you?

358
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,958
You only want to know
who's been in her car?

359
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,991
Why?

360
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,953
Because that gentleman
came home last night.

361
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,956
He came with Miss Peggy.

362
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,991
We're getting somewhere
at last!

363
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,959
You bastard! What's your point?
Do you want to ruin me?

364
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,956
I kill you!

365
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,958
Damned murderer!

366
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,993
Damn you!
Confess, you're the murderer!

367
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,958
Inspector, get him examined.
He's impotent.

368
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,959
That's why he hates women.
He can't have them!

369
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,993
Go on, tell the Inspector
that's why your wife left you.

370
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,993
Oh my God.
Oh my God, I'm suffocating.

371
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,958
Take him to the infirmary.

372
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,993
Let me go!

373
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,959
Let me go!

374
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,993
- Anyone know he had epilepsy?
- I didn't.

375
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,991
You may go.

376
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,991
Goodbye, Clarice.

377
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,956
I'm very sorry,

378
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,958
but I'll have to hold you,
Mr. Morlachi

379
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,956
and also you, Mr. Lazzarini.

380
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,434
What does that mean?

381
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,471
I'm legally detaining you.

382
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,556
But to do that Inspector,

383
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,593
you must have a reason.

384
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,949
Miss Nicole's murderer
had been in Peggy's car

385
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,993
since he knew where
the car alarm was hidden.

386
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,996
- May I go? - May I?
- No, you two will stay here too.

387
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,949
That's absurd.
I've supplied an alibi.

388
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,958
- The Marquis confirmed it.
- Yes, we were together.

389
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,434
Don't worry gentlemen,
I haven't forgotten.

390
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,950
You were together till after 11,
Miss Nicole was killed after 10.

391
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,959
- So why do you need us?
- Well...

392
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,993
When I called Miss Peggy
to tell her we'd found her car

393
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,436
it was about 11:30.

394
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,948
I arrived at her place
15 minutes later,

395
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,956
but she was gone
and the house was a mess.

396
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,356
Maybe she was killed too
and hidden who knows where.

397
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,359
With respect to this last event,

398
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,960
I'd say your alibi is worthless.

399
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,991
9:00

400
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,993
Why must we be in the dark?
As if we're not scared enough

401
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,434
Just try to stay calm.

402
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,948
How can we stay calm?

403
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,956
Don't you think enough has happened.

404
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,959
I'm scared too.
I'm not hiding that fact.

405
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,959
But it's no use panicing

406
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,956
If only the men would come back.

407
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,993
We're the only ones left here.

408
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,959
Hello...

409
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,992
Mr. Moriachi, at last,
what happend?

410
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,991
What?

411
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,991
But...

412
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,993
That's aburd. But why?
What right do they have?

413
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,991
Oh, yes...

414
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,991
I see.

415
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,991
Very well... of course...

416
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,473
All right.

417
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,991
Yes, don't worry.

418
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,992
- They've detained all five.
- But why?

419
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,959
It's clear the police believe
one of them is the murderer.

420
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,991
I expected that.

421
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,956
Madam...

422
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,991
May we go now?

423
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,992
Yes, you may go.

424
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,992
- Be brave.
- Good night.

425
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,958
I envy them, they live together.

426
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,956
They have each other.

427
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,991
- I'll go too Madam.
- Yes, of course.

428
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,991
Wait...

429
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,434
Why don't you sleep over
at my place tonight?

430
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,948
What? I live close by,

431
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,434
you live out in the country.

432
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,471
Then I could come to your place.

433
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,958
No, I'm sorry,
but I'd rather be alone.

434
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,958
Besides, you'd feel more afraid
at my house.

435
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,994
Aren't you scared? Isabella's been
murdered, and Peggy...

436
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,956
I know.

437
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,959
But I'm sure
nothing will happen tonight.

438
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,956
All the men
have been detained

439
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,993
and I'm sure
one is the murderer.

440
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,991
Good night, Madam.

441
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,956
Madam, I want to sleep here.

442
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,956
I don't want to go home.

443
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,958
No my dear, leave like the others.

444
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,958
But I'm scared. I live alone
in an isolated house.

445
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,956
Don't be childish, Greta.

446
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,959
Tomorrow's a heavy day.
The work must go on.

447
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,958
Listen to me, Isabella and Nicole
were involved in something

448
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,436
which doesn't concern us.

449
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,439
Therefore, we have
nothing to fear.

450
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,471
Go now, and don't worry.

451
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,991
- Good night, Madam
- Good night.

452
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,991
Miss...

453
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,958
The Marquis asked me
to tell you

454
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,958
he's stuck in town on business.

455
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,355
I know.
Make me a tea, please.

456
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,391
Right away, Miss.

457
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,991
Hello? Hello?

458
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,993
Your tea, Miss.

459
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,991
Just a minute please.

460
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,991
Come in.

461
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,958
Leave it there, Charles.
I'll help myself.

462
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,991
Good night, Miss.

463
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,958
See how he butchered
that poor girl?

464
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,958
Maybe with a hot iron.
He must be a madman.

465
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,958
Or a homicidal sex maniac.

466
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,991
- Who kills only beautiful girls.
- Absolutely.

467
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,958
Perhaps it's the female beauty

468
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,991
that makes him kill.

469
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,358
Now we'll have to start
from scratch.

470
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,358
Inspector, Forensics
are outside by the footprints.

471
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,959
The prints start there.
The murderer came by car

472
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,959
and walked down the slope
to the house.

473
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,958
They match those
outside the fashion house.

474
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,993
- Are you sure?
- Yes, we took casts of them.

475
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,356
I could have sworn the culprit
was one of the five men.

476
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,358
- We'll have to release them.
- Of course.

477
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,995
This time they all have
cast iron alibis.

478
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,434
And I supplied them with it.

479
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,357
Riccardo Morelli.

480
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,393
- Check that it's all there.
- Of course, I do.

481
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,991
Massimo Morlachi.

482
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,991
Come in.

483
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,958
Mr. Morlachi, could I talk to you
for a moment?

484
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,991
Yes dear, come in.

485
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,356
Mr. Morlachi, I'm a calm woman,
not at all nervous.

486
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,956
But the thought of a sex maniac
inside our fashion house...

487
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,993
It doesn't please me at all.

488
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,956
So I've decided
to take some leave.

489
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,958
I'm booked on
tomorrow's Paris flight.

490
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,956
Paris?

491
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,991
All right, Tao Li.

492
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,956
By the way, do you
still live with the Countessa?

493
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,959
- Yes, why?
- Nothing, just memories.

494
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,956
When the Count was still alive

495
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,991
I visited them a lot.
It's a beautiful home.

496
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,356
You can see all of Rome
from the terrace.

497
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,358
Yes, but now
I'd rather see Paris rooftops.

498
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,393
- I don't doubt that. Have fun.
- Goodbye.

499
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,956
Look as much as you like.

500
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,357
I burned everything compromising.

501
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,949
When I heard about your arrest
I got rid of Peggy's body.

502
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,956
They could have found it.

503
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,959
And I killed Greta
to give you an alibi.

504
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,956
Perfect!

505
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,956
Perfect, but horrible.

506
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,956
I don't know how I did it.

507
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,993
I never thought I had it in me
to kill.

508
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,956
I did it for you...

509
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,356
I can imagine what it cost you.

510
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,356
But tell me,

511
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,949
how did you get
Peggy's body to Morelli's house?

512
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,991
I didn't take it there.

513
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,991
I just put her into the trunk.

514
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,956
And Greta did the rest.

515
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,959
Why did you use Greta?

516
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,959
Because I knew she
would be alone in the house.

517
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,991
- That would make it easier.
- Well done.

518
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,993
The police are certain they're
dealing with a sex maniac.

519
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,991
Isabella, Nicole...

520
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,991
Peggy...

521
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,956
and now Greta...

522
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,991
That makes four.

523
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,991
Stop it.

524
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,991
What's wrong my darling?

525
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,991
Kiss me.

526
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,991
Are you worried, my dear?

527
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,991
What a mess.

528
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,959
All because of that fool,
that idiot Isabella.

529
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,959
Her blackmail was intolerable.

530
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,956
Money, money and more money.

531
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,959
It was precisely because
she unfortunaly found out.

532
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,993
That my husbands death
was no accident...

533
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,436
she should have realized it

534
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,438
was dangerous to push it.

535
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,436
But no... no...

536
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:29,473
The more we gave her,
the more she wanted.

537
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,958
She asked for it.

538
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,956
She thought she had us.

539
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,993
She felt she was the only
witness to a perfect crime.

540
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,991
Her death would have
been perfect too,

541
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,993
if only that damn diary
hadn't surfaced.

542
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,436
But now it's all over.

543
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,948
We have nothing more to worry
about, my darling.

544
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,959
Nothing.

545
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,956
No, you are very wrong.

546
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,991
We'll never have any peace

547
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,992
until we give the police the culprit.

548
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,991
Listen to me, we'll never
get off scot-free

549
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,991
unless we put a face to
their sex maniac.

550
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,959
They'll watch us until
they catch him.

551
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,958
Every victim was at the
fashion house.

552
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,958
They have nothing on us, but the
case is well known now.

553
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,958
It's in all the papers

554
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,956
and the
scandal is raging.

555
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,991
We must find a solution.

556
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,991
So what do you want to do?

557
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,993
I know, darling!
We should leave for the moon.

558
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,958
We must kill again one last time.

559
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,991
And you'll be the one to do it.

560
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,152
- Oh no!
- Yes!

561
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,953
Yes, they are sure
to be watching me.

562
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,958
Don't worry, dear, I'll
give you the perfect alibi.

563
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,958
Relax.

564
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,958
No Massimo,
you can't ask me to do that.

565
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,436
I refuse. I can't do it.

566
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,471
You've done it before.

567
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,958
Yes, I've done it before,

568
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,958
but with very different motives.

569
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,956
I had to
because you were in danger.

570
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,958
I knew that if I didn't do it
I'd have lost you forever.

571
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,993
Only my love for you gave me strength.

572
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,959
But it was horrible,
horrible...

573
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,991
Don't cry. Listen to me.

574
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,956
You must do as I say.
You must kill Tao Li.

575
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,993
You must make it look like suicide.

576
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,991
Is that clear?

577
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,993
They will find the mask beside her
and think she was the culprit.

578
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,992
Otherwise, everything
will have been pointless.

579
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,949
Surprised to see me alive,
aren't you, Massimo?

580
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,956
Yes, you had a
very ingenious paln.

581
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,991
It was all going to be perfect,

582
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,949
just the way you like it.

583
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,991
But you didn't reckon on

584
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,991
a shop awning

585
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,991
which broke my fall.

586
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,991
- Please...
- Shut up.

587
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,391
I know what you want to say.

588
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,958
You want to deny it.
You organized everything.

589
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,958
Only you knew I'd use the ledge
in case of danger, remember?

590
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,958
You suggested it to me.

591
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,993
It was your idea!

592
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,358
Cristina, I swear it was
an accident.

593
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,960
Do you still think you
can fool me?

594
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,991
Yes, it was a very clever plan...

595
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,949
Finding me in those clothes would
have made it all clear

596
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,959
and you would have been free.

597
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,958
Now I understand why
you married me in secret

598
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,356
and so quickly.

599
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:44,996
You were so in love with me.
So in love!

600
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,956
Yes, but with my villa, the house,

601
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,959
the fashion house, my money...

602
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,991
You wanted to take
all I own by killing me.

603
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,991
Cristina, I beg you...

604
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,993
You are mistaken, my dear.
It isn't true.

605
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,991
I love you.

606
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:15,473
It's all in your imagination,
darling, believe me.

607
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,991
I swear Christina...

608
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,959
It was just an accident.
I didn't plan it.

609
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,991
How could you think that?

610
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,948
I love you very much, darling.

611
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,993
We'll go away.
We'll always be together.

612
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,956
Police...

613
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,991
Get me Inspector Silvestri...
