What is this about?

16
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,750
What do you mean?

17
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,920
Why do you have these?

18
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,930
Are these also what
our late father wrote?

19
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,040
- Yes.
- Really?

20
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,510
Then why is Eun Ha Soo's name
written on there, too?

21
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,400
Why are you going through
my room without asking?

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,040
- Get out.
- About the seaweed soup...

23
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,180
I heard you made it yourself.

24
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,330
Was it for me? Or...

25
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,810
Was it on behalf of our late father?

26
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,060
I just tried it for fun.

27
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,730
- It was your birthday and all...
- Is that right?

28
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,020
I'm so grateful that I might cry.

29
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,280
But I just can't figure out
what those notes mean.

30
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,880
If they were written by our late father,
why was Eun Ha Soo on there?

31
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,960
I got the feeling that
the notes weren't finished.

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,890
Also that the notes
have yet to be fulfilled.

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,050
Stop your nonsense,
and go to bed.

00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,170

42
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,990
Try to get up.

43
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,610
<i>Wait, why is the soup so bland?</i>

44
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,900
<i>It's like water.</i>

45
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,760
<i>Why are these eggs so over-cooked?</i>

46
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,400
<i>Don't you have any soft-boiled eggs?</i>

47
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,680
<i>Oh my, what kind of vegetable dish
has this much water in it?</i>

48
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,640
You should take the water out
before putting it on a plate.

49
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,480
- Okay.
- When it comes to vegetable dishes...

50
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,260
These go better with soy sauce.

51
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,750
Why aren't you eating?

52
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,410
Huh? I'm eating.

53
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,380
By the way, I heard you were invited
to a birthday party at his house.

54
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,390
Ha Soo, shouldn't I have bought you
a nice outfit before you went over?

55
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,530
How was his house? Was it nice?

56
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,600
Of course. It must be real nice and
bright since two rich men live there.

57
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,340
It must have been
a different world there, right?

58
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,890
You met his family, too?

59
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,520
Kind of.

60
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,770
Actually, my future son-in-law
was an illegitimate son, so...

61
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,420
it must not have been comfortable.

62
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,600
Did his family seem to like you?

63
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,980
It doesn't matter...

64
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,360
You should still be
on good terms with them.

65
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,110
Eun Ha, shall I go meet them?

66
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,700
What are you talking about?

67
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,830
It definitely won't happen,
so stop dreaming.

68
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,520
Why wouldn't it happen?

69
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,460
It seems soon enough to talk
about the wedding about now.

70
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,840
- Do I need to go, too?
- You should go.

71
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,210
In any case, it's not true.

72
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,780
It won't happen.

73
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,160
What's going on with her?

74
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,820
- Did something happen?
- They must have had a fight.

75
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,040
It's only natural.

76
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,360
<i>What's taking you so long?</i>

77
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,980
- Do you want some tea?
- No, thanks.

78
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,460
You don't seem well today...

79
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,980
What should we do
about Seohae Hotel?

80
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,200
If we don't do anything

81
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,960
the premium outlets preparations
will go underway.

82
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,870
According to 'The Art of War'

83
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,180
there is something called
'Sang Ok Chu Jae.'

84
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,230
We lure the enemy to the roof and...

85
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,290
we get rid of the ladder.

86
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,760
If we do that

87
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
The businesses that signed the contract
to move into the outlets will face damage.

88
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,220
When they want to
come down from the roof

89
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,360
we can give them the ladder.

90
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,790
- That means...
- Tell them we will support the decision.

91
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,980
Pardon?

92
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,910
Are you saying you'll support
the idea of the premium outlets?

93
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,910
Then what's going to happen
to Seohae Hotel?

94
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,910
You didn't have breakfast yet, right?

95
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,600
Have this.

96
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,340
I delivered the current financial
statements of Daehan Resort...

97
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,630
and the sales figures of all departments.

98
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,800
Terms for a buyout stay the same.

99
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,180
We really need a business plan
for Cruise Hotel.

100
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,090
We should get a hold of that
as soon as possible.

101
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,810
Without that

102
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,820
they won't try to push forward
with the buyout.

103
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,170
Will Choi Shin Hyung
hand it over easily?

104
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,380
We have to find a way.

105
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,770
Engagement?

106
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,030
If you aren't comfortable marrying me
due to the situation at work

107
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,820
let's get engaged first.

108
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,100
And resign from your position.

109
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,120
You come work with me
in the planning department.

110
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,220
- Yi Gun.
- Didn't you expect this?

111
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,600
I'll stay at my current position
and help you then.

112
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,310
Hong Ji Yoon, that's not how it should be.

113
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,120
What I want is for you to
stay away from Choi Dae Han.

114
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,210
Then does it mean that
we can get Seohae Hotel back?

115
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,100
Yes.

116
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,320
If you make up your mind

117
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,810
we can overturn the decision.

118
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,400
Without me, the deal won't go through.

119
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,940
Fine. Then let me be reassigned first.

120
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,900
About the engagement

121
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,380
A little bit later when
things calm down at work

122
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,530
Hello there.

123
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,070
- Are you busy?
- No.

124
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,830
How may I help you?

125
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,490
Well, on Dae Han's birthday

126
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,580
I'm sorry about the way I acted.

127
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,440
It won't take long, so have a seat.

128
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,260
By the way...

129
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,870
when did you and Dae Han
start seeing each other?

130
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,710
There seems to be some misunderstanding.

131
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,090
President Choi and I
aren't seeing each other.

132
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,510
You're not?

133
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,710
Then is it Choi Shin Hyung
you're seeing then?

134
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,430
- That is...
- It was Choi Shin Hyung, wasn't it?

135
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,480
Oh my.

136
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,340
Either way, you're involved
with men in my family.

137
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,980
So I wanted to apologize for
that night and make you an offer.

138
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,580
You said your mother
owns a tailor shop, right?

139
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,700
Yes.

140
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,460
I wonder if she'd consider
opening a store in our resort here.

141
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,970
I can arrange that.

142
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,900
I'm sorry, but we can't afford
that at the moment.

143
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm saying that I can
arrange that for you.

144
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,240
You just tailor suits for our guests.

145
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,990
I'll cut the rent in half, too.

146
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,720
By the way, why are you
making us a special offer like this?

147
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,190
You'll eventually find out...

148
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,940
All you have to do is to meet
with me from time to time

149
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,730
and keep me in the loop
about Shin Hyung or Dae Han.

150
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,540
We can discuss things, too.
It's all good, you know.

151
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,700
No, I have no reason to
receive that kind of favor

152
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,390
and don't want it, either.

153
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,070
I appreciate your offer,
but I'll politely decline.

154
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,540
Wait.

155
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,400
Oh my, did she just say no?

156
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,960
Oh my, unbelievable.

157
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,980
What kind of woman is
that unyielding, huh?

158
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,210
Whoever decorated it
did an excellent job.

159
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,450
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,080
I invited you over for my birthday,
and you had to leave like that.

161
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,610
My family went too far, didn't they?

162
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,950
I shouldn't have acted that way
with Choi Shin Hyung in front of you.

163
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,120
I won't come between
you two from now on.

164
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,210
What do you mean?

165
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,480
What's going on?

166
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,440
I have to get back to work, so...

167
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,550
Did something happen?

168
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,690
I'm asking what happened.

169
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,160
Do you still go climbing?

170
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm talking about rock climbing.

171
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,600
Oh my.

172
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,940
If you try what an expert does,
you'll end up hurting yourself.

173
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,180
Just go where beginners hang.

174
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,740
I've been doing this for ten years.

175
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,820
- I know that.
- You heard that from our father, too?

176
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,490
- Of course.
- You two were close, huh?

177
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,100
- You're quite opposite from me then.
- By the way...

178
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,810
do you have to do
something this dangerous?

179
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,220
If you fall off a cliff

180
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,010
your bone will shatter.

181
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,400
That's why I started this.

182
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,310
Whenever I went
rock climbing or sky diving

183
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,070
it was worth seeing
how my father's face changed.

184
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,700
I started it to add raise
my father's blood pressure.

185
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,590
You're so immature.

186
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,400
No matter how much
you hated your father

187
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,480
how could you rebel
risking your own life?

188
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,340
I found it fun once
I started to get into it.

189
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,240
At first, it was too difficult
to know what it was...

190
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,400
but I realized after falling
numerous times...

191
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,860
how and where to hold on and step on.

192
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,970
It works the same way in life, doesn't it?

193
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,620
The more you fall and get knocked down,
the easier you find a way up.

194
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,380
Shin Hyung!

195
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,320
It's okay.

196
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,760
If you need a coach,
I can help you out.

197
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,760
Thanks for the offer...

198
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,160
but I may not have enough time.

199
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,130
Why not?

200
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,430
That's that...

201
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,000
About our father...

202
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,820
whether you jumped off from a plane
or climbed the Himalayas

203
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,690
he would have been just fine
if it had been someone else's child.

204
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,600
But it's different when
it comes to your own.

205
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,250
Whether you're twenty or thirty years old

206
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,970
'Don't skip meals,'
'Watch out for cars.'

207
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,330
Your parents will nag you regardless.

208
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,670
That's what a parent's heart is like

209
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,590
I'm saying that's how
our father might have felt.

210
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,210
Gosh, it's too bad.

211
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,070
If he had seen
his two sons doing this

212
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,730
his blood pressure would
have shot up again.

213
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,820
He could have said it looked great.

214
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,920
By the way, did you guys fight?

215
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,420
Something didn't seem right
about you two.

216
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,080
I'm talking about Eun Ha Soo.

217
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,610
It's true that you two
are seeing each other, isn't?

218
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,920
We won't see each other again.

219
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,610
Why not? What happened?

220
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,130
Why did you call me over
here all of a sudden?

221
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,520
- I didn't get to buy you a birthday gift.
- What?

222
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,710
It's already passed.

223
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,450
Come on. If your brother
wants to buy you something

224
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,020
say thank you and accept it.

225
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,540
We want to buy some dress shoes.

226
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,020
Are there any specific items
you are looking for?

227
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,360
Is there anything
you especially want?

228
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,110
He's the one who is
going to wear them.

229
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,300
He'll have to run around a lot, so...

230
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,390
we want soft calf skin.

231
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,830
The color should be...

232
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,950
a dark brown that will go well
with business meetings.

233
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,810
And we'd want the round toes that
are most comfortable for his feet.

234
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,910
He will be doing something great.

235
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,580
I want you to pay special
attention, please.

236
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,860
Of course.

237
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
I'll measure his feet first.
Excuse me.

238
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,030
Why don't you get one for yourself, too?
I'll buy it for you.

239
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,410
- Get this bag.
- I'm okay.

240
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,330
Excuse me.

241
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,440
For him, I'll order
the latest design, please.

242
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,970
- Sure.
- Please measure him, too.

243
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,930
Come over here.

244
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,850
Try them on. Try.

245
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,430
Try this one. They're pretty.

246
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,960
Oh, they look good on you.

247
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,270
How about this one?

248
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,160
Try them both.

249
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,400
What do you think?

250
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,710
- You try this on, too.
- This?

251
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,230
Oh my, they fit so well.

252
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,290
- Do they look good?
- They look good.

253
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,780
See you.

254
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,510
Listen carefully to what
I'm about to say.

255
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,090
When it comes to business

256
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,700
First, persuasion,
and second, persuasion.

257
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,560
- Third, it's persuasion again.
- What are you saying?

258
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,270
In order to persuade someone

259
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,200
one needs to be certain first.

260
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,970
Once you're certain

261
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,410
guts, patience, sometimes you'll need
a desire to win, too.

262
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,250
- Follow me.
- Where are we going?

263
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,260
To persuade someone.

264
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,180
What is this?

265
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
It's five times your contract money.

266
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,290
Are you asking me
to take this money...

267
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,460
and convince the other investors
to pull out of their investment?

268
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,130
Yes, that's correct.

269
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,540
Does that make sense?

270
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,480
You shouldn't invest in
the Seohae Hotel location.

271
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,170
It won't last more than three years.

272
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,110
You think I haven't done my research?

273
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,490
You've only done your research,
but haven't checked it out yourself.

274
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,580
How can you sound so confident about this?

275
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,990
Why do you think
I brought this much money?

276
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,590
I'm sorry to say this, but it was pushed
through by certain people at Daehan.

277
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,650
So if it fails, it will be our loss, too.

278
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,210
If you, our major investor,
pulls out of your investment now

279
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,370
others will follow suit,
and pull their investments, too.

280
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,440
Instead, you can invest that money

281
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,460
when we're converting
Seohae Hotel to Meditel.

282
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,630
Don't bother.

283
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,020
Whether it's Seohae Hotel
or the premium outlets

284
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,980
- I can't trust either, now.
- Why's that?

285
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,830
Considering you brought
five times the contract price

286
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,110
isn't that obvious?

287
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,300
But it's still a lot of money.

288
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,380
- Would you reconsider?
- No need to.

289
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
Who knows what could happen
after taking this money?

290
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,860
I'm pulling out of
my investment immediately.

291
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,410
Oh no, you shouldn't do this to us...

292
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,830
How much is in here?

293
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,620
What is this? It's empty.

294
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,910
Carry it.

295
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,260
Not bad.

296
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,500
<i>I have a very strange boyfriend.</i>

297
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,420
Women are supposed
to behave with dignity.

298
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,030
<i>He's a very special person.</i>

299
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,320
Nonsense!

300
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,510
A woman who grew up well
was fooled by a bad man's lies.

301
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,870
It's clear who the bad person is!

302
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,210
How can I just sit back and watch?

303
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,720
<i>His way of speech is a bit strange.</i>

304
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,260
<i>What are you doing, Eun Ha Soo?</i>

305
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>He doesn't even know how to text.</i>

306
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,850
<i>He likes Mung Bean pancakes,
boiled eggs...</i>

307
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,530
<i>and herbal tea with egg drops.</i>

308
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,980
<i>He's old-fashioned
and unfriendly, but...</i>

309
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,290
The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

310
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:00,120
<i>He encourages and acknowledges me.</i>

311
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,800
<i>He supports my dreams.</i>

312
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,140
<i>Most importantly...</i>

313
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,210
<i>he's always on my side
and wishes for my true happiness.</i>

314
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,220
<i>Choi Shin Hyung.</i>

315
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,710
<i>Whenever I see him...</i>

316
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,810
<i>I grow excited...</i>

317
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,420
<i>and I can trust him.</i>

318
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,760
About Choi Shin Hyung...

319
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,520
I saw some notes in his room.

320
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,600
They definitely looked like they were
written by my father before he passed.

321
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,010
But Eun Ha Soo's name
was written on there, too.

322
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,970
- Eun Ha Soo?
- Yes.

323
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,560
My other family members
and your name were there, too.

324
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Why was Eun Ha Soo there?

325
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,980
- My name was there, too?
- Yes.

326
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,160
Then...

327
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,150
Choi Shin Hyung must have
only added her name there then.

328
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,640
And your late father
wrote all the others.

329
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,300
The handwriting was exactly the same.

330
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,160
How could my father
possibly know about her?

331
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,370
Why couldn't your father know her?

332
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,080
They were in the accident together.

333
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,390
Ah, that's right.

334
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,100
But still...

335
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,560
Before he passed away

336
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,570
he may have wanted to do something
for the ones he knew.

337
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,760
Was that it?

338
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,800
That's why he saw it and
made you the seaweed soup.

339
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,080
One of the things
your father didn't get to do...

340
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,050
Choi Shin Hyung confuses me so much.

341
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,910
Why did he break up with Eun Ha Soo?

342
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,240
I don't know. He didn't say.

343
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,100
Anyway, if he collapses again,
we have a problem.

344
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,780
Funny thing is whenever he got sick...

345
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,540
he got better if Eun Ha Soo was nearby.

346
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,860
What is he going to do
without her nearby?

347
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,260
He got better whenever
Eun Ha Soo was nearby?

348
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,650
True.

349
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,300
How could it be even possible?

350
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,030
I don't know if it's the power
of love or something.

351
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm really worried now that
they're not together anymore.

352
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,340
What if something awful happens?

353
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,400
Have the surgery.

354
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,350
Why wouldn't you want to get it done?

355
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,900
What if you really die?

356
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,280
As for those notes...

357
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,660
you wrote them out
yourself, didn't you?

358
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,480
That's right.

359
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,890
Now that I came here...

360
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,620
and have met my family.

361
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,950
I understood how our father
would have felt.

362
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,670
While I was thinking about what
I could do instead of my father...

363
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,620
I got to write them down.

364
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,710
I had to go through a lot
to be able to meet my family.

365
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,120
We should get along
and live in harmony, right?

366
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,340
What does that even mean?

367
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:39,510
Not living our lives hiding
our thoughts from each other...

368
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,880
but being able to open
ourselves up to one another.

369
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,840
It's been a long time.

370
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,800
My wife in Canada
wants a divorce again.

371
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,540
Again?

372
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,200
Go over there.

373
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,640
How can I possibly go now?

374
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
We don't know what could happen.

375
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,930
As if I would die in that time.

376
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,000
When I went to the fortune teller's place
that your sister went to...

377
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,530
I heard something.

378
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,270
The rock that's in there, the meteor...

379
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,090
If you remove it surgically

380
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,520
you can go back to your original state.

381
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,020
Are you telling me to go back
to the way I was?

382
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,680
If you go back,
you can live longer at least.

383
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,880
If you stay this way, it's good
being young and all...

384
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,910
but you're destined to die
when the time comes.

385
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,100
You don't have many days left.

386
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,490
You have to make a decision
between those choices soon.

387
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,040
What would you do
if you were in my shoes?

388
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,940
I would go back and live longer.

389
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,280
It's an era for living up
to 100 years old.

390
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,690
If you take good care of yourself

391
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,000
you can live for another
thirty years at least.

392
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,230
Only Heaven decides
what to do with our lives.

393
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:47,110
What happened to me
must be my destiny, too.

394
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,490
I'm okay.

395
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,980
What do you mean, you're okay?

396
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,870
Go see Eun Ha Soo.

397
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,280
I heard you wouldn't get sick
if you're with her.

398
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,860
I lost my father not too long ago.

399
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,500
Would you be happy if I lose you, too?

400
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,000
Why are you being so stubborn?

401
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,430
What if you get sick again?

402
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,130
What would you do then?

403
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,030
Sir, please get up and have this.

404
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,330
You have to have some
to regain your strength.

405
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,450
Please.

406
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,050
Leave it there.

407
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,680
You may go.

408
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,760
Make sure you have some, okay?

409
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,970
<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have 17 days
to return on your payment.]</i>

410
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,290
What kind of bastard are you?

411
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,980
Answer me.

412
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,150
Who is this?

413
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,040
<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have 17 days
to return on your payment.]</i>

414
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,780
What happened?

415
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,780
You broke up with Choi Shin Hyung?

416
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,260
You said you liked him.

417
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,260
I ended it because I liked him.

418
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,350
I didn't want him to become
unhappy because of me.

419
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,590
Why would he become unhappy?

420
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,800
I want him to get along with his family.

421
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,880
His family...

422
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,360
It was hard for him
to reunite his family.

423
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,380
It's all my fault then.

424
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:30,130
Choi Shin Hyung can't eat anything...

425
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,510
and he's very sick now.

426
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,990
I'm worried he might
collapse again, at this rate.

427
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,310
When he disappeared from the hospital

428
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,340
I know that you were
truly worried about him.

429
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,830
And this time...

430
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:54,180
I've felt... that he sincerely likes you.

431
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,760
Eun Ha Soo.

432
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,660
I like you, too.

433
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,790
But I know that you don't
feel the same way.

434
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,320
When you two like each other this much

435
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,730
you shouldn't do this
just because of me.

436
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,020
What am I?

437
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,930
Should I make you
a promise or something?

438
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:22,150
I'll get along with Choi Shin Hyung.

439
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:29,580
I want you...
to continue to see my brother.

440
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,010
Please.

441
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,250
<i>Get well.</i>

442
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,100
I'm okay.

443
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,660
Don't worry about me.

444
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,590
Do you think I've done anything
like this for anyone before?

445
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,100
You don't listen to me
about going to see a doctor.

446
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,860
You're so stubborn.

447
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,830
It looks like it's from Eun Ha Soo,
so check it.

448
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,850
Just leave it.

449
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,810
I'll get over her.

450
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,150
Eun Ha Soo is hiding her feelings
for you because of us.

451
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,470
I'll call her and tell her
to come over.

452
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,730
I said leave it.

453
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,070
You said you'd get better
if she's with you.

454
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,840
If that's true...

455
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,460
there won't be any place for me.

456
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,980
Not next to you nor Eun Ha Soo.

457
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,690
I don't want to lose you.

458
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,680
Call her now.

459
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,240
Hello? What are you talking about?

460
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,390
Why can't you tell me why
you changed your mind?

461
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,780
Hello? Hello?

462
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,240
How did this happen?

463
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,130
I have no idea.

464
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,860
Why are the manufacturers pulling out?

465
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,960
It looks like the premium outlets deal
isn't going to pull through.

466
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,720
We can't go forward anymore.

467
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,190
The construction is scheduled
to start the day after tomorrow.

468
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,030
How could everybody
do this all of a sudden?

469
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,540
Please stall them for a little bit.

470
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,140
I'll go meet with them
to change their mind.

471
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,450
No, no.

472
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,110
It seems that they've
already been persuaded.

473
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,260
Who do you think did that?

474
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Who in the world pulled off
a stunt like this?

475
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,260
Choi Shin Hyung.

476
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,150
That's what my gut is telling me.

477
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,760
- Choi Shin Hyung?
- Are you sure?

478
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,670
- Choi Shin Hyung did this?
- Unbelievable.

479
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,500
What a bastard.

480
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,370
How could he do something
like this behind our backs?

481
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,620
How could he mess up
what was almost complete?

482
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,310
- Oh my god...
- Honey!

483
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,000
What are you doing?

484
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,290
How can you reassign her
without my approval?

485
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,000
I believe my report came to you.

486
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,400
- I submitted the report.
- What?

487
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,970
I'd like to work at the planning
department from now on.

488
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,310
What did you say?

489
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,320
Ah, now I understand.

490
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,450
You've been sticking
by my side long enough.

491
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,150
I didn't realize that.

492
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,790
Let him be.

493
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,140
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,090
I should have consulted you first.

495
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,010
Consult me?

496
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,410
Hong Ji Yoon.

497
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,720
Do you want to advance
in your career that badly?

498
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,980
That's why I told you to stick
with Jung Yi Gun a long time ago.

499
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,310
Yes, I plan to do that now.

500
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,390
Please let me do that.

501
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,740
I'm disappointed.

502
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,960
I was mistaken about you.

503
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,380
<i>[The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo]</i>

504
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,760
<i>Please don't be sick.</i>

505
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,990
<i>[I miss you, Eun Ha Soo.]</i>

506
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:29,310
<i>I miss you, Eun Ha Soo.</i>

507
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,520
Choi Shin Hyung!

508
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,960
- Did you eat yet?
- No.

509
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,910
I saw you two coming in,
so I'm leaving.

510
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,730
I'm so glad to hear that
you're able to run Seohae Hotel again.

511
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,440
Thank you.

512
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,640
But why do I get the feeling

513
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,460
that you were behind the
premium outlets deal?

514
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,710
Even if I deny it, there's nothing
I can do if you think that way.

515
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,360
You may have thought so
since I was often opposed your plans.

516
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,250
Now that you took Manager Hong,
I hope for the best.

517
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,030
You've given even more power now.

518
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,750
Then enjoy your dinner.

519
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,100
Let's go in.

520
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,580
Hong Ji Yoon.

521
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,140
I can't figure you out.

522
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,830
How have you been?

523
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,860
Same old.

524
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,640
I heard you were very sick.

525
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,270
I'm okay now.

526
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,040
After I asked to stop seeing each other...

527
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,100
I'm sorry I texted you.

528
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,350
It's okay.

529
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,710
I was so glad to see it.

530
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,010
After I told you that we should
stay together forever...

531
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,920
I'm sorry.

532
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,100
I only thought about myself...

533
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,090
I thought I shouldn't see you
because of my own selfishness.

534
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,770
But when we were suddenly apart...

535
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,290
it became harder to bear.

536
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,040
The time we spent together
wasn't even that long...

537
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,290
but I thought I was going crazy.

538
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,480
I'm sorry.

539
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,260
I haven't done much for you.

540
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,390
But you care about me this much.

541
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:22,420
Will you tell me what
the third assignment is?

542
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,880
<i>The third assignment out of five is...</i>

543
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,410
<i>- to make matching bracelets.
- Matching bracelets?</i>

544
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,970
- Oh, you're here.
- Here I am.

545
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,350
Let's go over there to see some.

546
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,840
Wow.

547
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,980
Are these all meteors?

548
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,120
Yes, aren't they pretty?

549
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,280
What do you want to make with these?

550
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,470
Just pick the one you like.

551
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,040
I like this one.

552
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,800
Wow, it's pretty.

553
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,100
Then I'll pick...

554
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,660
What do you think about this one?

555
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,640
It's unique and pretty.

556
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,000
Like somebody I know.

557
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,810
I wonder who. It's me, isn't it?

558
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:46,400
Thank you.

559
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,780
I didn't do anything.
It was all you.

560
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,820
It was. It was all me, wasn't it?

561
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,650
That's right. So stop bragging.

562
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,380
Honestly, you know how hard
I was working, right?

563
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,380
Trying the investors
to change their minds.

564
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,930
I had to run around
the entire country on my own.

565
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,240
Okay. You did a good job, okay?

566
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,730
Father.

567
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,060
Are you watching?

568
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,070
It's not much...

569
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:50,250
But if you knew, you would be happy.

570
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,240
You wouldn't praise me...

571
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,340
but you would be proud,
wouldn't you?

572
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,470
This must be why
you sent my brother here.

573
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,070
Sometimes, he's exactly like you...

574
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,160
so I can't help but hate him.

575
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:15,010
But in a way, I feel bad for him.

576
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,310
To you, who left your sons behind...

577
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,170
Honestly, I'm a bit sad.

578
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,800
I also get angry, too.

579
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:30,770
So even if I'm not that nice
to my older brother

580
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,960
don't scold me much.

581
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,820
How could he reverse our plan overnight
and stab us in the backs like this?

582
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,660
How?

583
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,740
Get out of there now!

584
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,440
Honey, calm down.

585
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,520
If you collapse for real, it's our loss.

586
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,150
How much more could we possibly lose?

587
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,920
I won't back down like this.

588
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,480
Seriously.

589
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,190
Honey!

590
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,540
Why did I marry you, huh?

591
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,550
Did I marry you to live my life
as number two?

592
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,690
Seriously. What do you want me to do, huh?

593
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,660
I did everything you told me to do!

594
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,570
Did I make you the number two person?

595
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:33,200
When it's your own destiny,
what am I supposed to do about it?

596
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,260
Because of you, I'm also living
my life as number two!

597
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,770
Oh my, listen to yourself!

598
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,110
Are you done?

599
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,670
Just because I've been patient with you

600
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,860
do you think I'm someone
you can just boss around?

601
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,140
Choi Young Dal.

602
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,510
Let's get a divorce.

603
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,350
Divorce? Fine. Let's do it.

604
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,350
You thought I wouldn't go for it?

605
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,990
Just sign the papers now!

606
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,010
Honey. Honey.

607
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,360
Honey. Honey!

608
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,630
<i>The fourth assignment out of five is...</i>

609
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,760
<i>to go to a unique festival.</i>

610
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,630
What kind of place is this?

611
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,520
- Cosplay.
- What?

612
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,180
- What is it again?
- It's a cosplay.

613
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,080
People express themselves
by wearing a costume and have fun.

614
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,770
Why wouldn't they just have fun
with the way they normally dress?

615
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,980
It's fun to be somebody else sometimes.

616
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,870
- You punk!
- Oh my!

617
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,460
Choi Shin Hyung.

618
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,100
- Don't!
- You punk!

619
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,500
Wow, are you the Beast
from Beauty and the Beast?

620
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,070
Wow.

621
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,330
What do you think about me?

622
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,890
If I leave you alone,
someone may steal you away.

623
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:24,920
That's not true. Let's go.

624
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,120
It's like the end of the world.

625
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,700
Isn't it time to get used to this?

626
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,960
What is it? Do you go to events
like this one often?

627
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,770
No, this is my first time here, too.

628
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,850
I couldn't because
I didn't have a boyfriend.

629
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,850
You haven't had a boyfriend
all this time?

630
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,700
What have you been doing
if you weren't dating?

631
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,420
I've been working hard to be able
to meet a beast like you.

632
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,950
- I'm glad.
- Pardon?

633
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,160
I'm glad that you met me.

634
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,240
Otherwise, you would only focus
on work, and become a grandma

635
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,450
You'd be full of regret as a grandma.

636
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,590
My looks aren't that bad.

637
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,930
True. You're not that bad.

638
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,550
Shall we go dance?

639
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,590
What do you mean a dance?
It's embarrassing.

640
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:42,790
When we did the folk dance last time,
I wanted to dance with you.

641
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,740
Did you?

642
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:34,210
<i>I'm so grateful that I've made
such precious memories with you.</i>

643
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:44,300
<i>I will remember your beautiful heart
and pretty face forever.</i>

644
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:51,660
<i>You made me know what love is.</i>

645
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:57,280
<i>I will have you in my heart forever.</i>

646
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,510
<i>The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.</i>

647
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:07,560
<i>I'm sorry that I cannot
spend forever with you. </i>

648
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,770
Still, Choi Dae Han's made it
this far, thanks to you.

649
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,130
You've done enough.

650
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,030
Seriously.

651
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,260
Do you want me to bring you a new one?

652
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,250
- Have a seat.
- Why?

653
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,380
Did you just choose me
because you like me?

654
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,760
No, you were chosen
because I didn't like you.

655
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:52,450
I'm Hong Ji Yoon, who will assist
Chairman Choi starting today.

656
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,220
So what?

657
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,150
You go assist my father then.
Why bother me here?

658
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,380
Chairman Choi put in a
special request with me

659
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,930
because you're rebellious,
spoiled, and audacious.

660
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,530
So he wants you to go out with me?

661
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,240
You're pretty.

662
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,490
Can you take off my clothes?

663
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,900
I hate this outfit.

664
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,900
This tie suffocates me.

665
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,740
Anyway, can you let me
get out of this outfit, huh?

666
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,530
Then I'll listen to you.

667
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,770
It's raining.

668
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,030
Can you drop me off over there?

669
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,550
<i>- Are you not done?
- I'm done.</i>

670
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,180
Oh my.

671
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,160
My cell phone...

672
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,470
- Where...
- Look carefully.

673
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,770
Oh, it's the wish he wrote last time.

674
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,360
Gosh.

675
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,840
Did you find it?

676
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,100
- Let's go.
- Sure.

677
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,230
Why didn't you buy a good one?

678
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,220
Why did you pick this?

679
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,630
Don't you like hearing the raindrops?

680
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,190
I wanted to hear this sound.

681
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,860
What's wrong? Choi Shin Hyung!

682
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,700
Choi Shin Hyung!

683
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,880
It was in my room.

684
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,470
What are you going to do with it?

685
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,190
It's a keepsake from my father.

686
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,650
I want to hold onto it.

687
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,540
<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have 14 days
to return on your  payment.]</i>

688
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,920
Choi Shin Hyung.

689
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,650
Are you really going to die?

690
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:38,500
<i>I wish I could leave
without hurting anybody...</i>

691
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:53,810
