00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mr. Back

00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,090
<i>[Episode 13]</i>

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,030
Gosh, I momentarily fell asleep.

4
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,680
I had a good time, thanks to you.

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,630
What is it? Are you tired?

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,180
No, I had a good time, too.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,360
You don't look like you did...

8
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,350
It's just that...

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,820
you're not planning on going somewhere
without telling me, are you?

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,900
Ah, no.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,000
Why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,700
If you're not, that's fine.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,510
I hope you don't keep secrets from me.

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,410
Because the time I spend with you
makes me happy

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,070
I might be worried for no reason.

16
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,630
I want him to get a thorough
medical examination.

17
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,340
He just won't want to
come to the hospital.

18
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,370
You said he had a heart attack
before the surgery, right?

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,570
Yes, when it was impossible
to breathe on his own

20
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,870
- it was like a miracle.
- Really?

21
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,790
And there was something strange.

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,050
There was something different about him.

23
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,420
- Like what?
- Well...

24
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,570
the blood was pumping
backwards into his heart.

25
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,420
And then it caused
the heart to stop.

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,110
It was my first time seeing this happen
at such an accelerated pace...

27
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,270
Oh my...

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,540
What is it?

29
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,600
You're not feeling well?

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,060
Let's go see a doctor today.

31
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,500
- What?
- Let's get a medical exam done.

32
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,080
No, thanks.

33
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,120
I'm fine.

34
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,420
I don't want you to collapse again like
last time and make things hard for me.

35
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,780
I won't make things hard
for you again.

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,410
Are you keeping something from me?

37
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,250
What if you are suffering
from a terminal illness?

38
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,050
Hi, Aunt.

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,190
T-the hospital?

40
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,520
Uncle is?

41
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,390
Oh, honey.

42
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,890
Enough is enough.

43
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,940
Were you trying to kill him
or something?

44
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,450
They said his blood pressure
is stabilizing.

45
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,460
I also collapsed because of him.

46
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,940
So this is your revenge?

47
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,600
How could you do this to him?

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,420
That's enough.

49
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,260
- Brother.
- Honey.

50
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,490
Why did you bring him here?

51
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,730
Shouldn't I be here?

52
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,120
I heard my uncle was about to die.

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,170
- I'm not about to die.
- Are you all right?

54
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,540
Can't you see?

55
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,830
Can you imagine how much
she tortured him

56
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,920
to make his blood pressure
shoot up like that?

57
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,250
He ignored all the warnings
and his liver shut down.

58
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,980
Why is that all my fault?

59
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,260
- He's just old now.
- Shut it.

60
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,120
Did Director Jung stop by yet?

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
If he shows up here

62
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,970
that would make him
a human being.

63
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,660
All he did was make us
fight amongst one another.

64
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,600
It was a fight between you two.

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,430
Why are you blaming Director Jung?
That's ridiculous.

66
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,640
Jung Yi Gun is the one who betrayed us.

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,300
Acting like he helped
revive Seohae Hotel

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,090
he was bragging about that
to the board of directors.

69
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,990
- As expected, he's a smart man.
- What did you say?

70
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,600
He took care of things
without getting himself involved.

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,970
He's responsible for a couple's quarrel
and caused trouble within our family.

72
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,650
- You want to live a long life, don't you?
- Yes.

73
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,180
It's not too late yet.

74
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,430
You'll live long only if
your organs are healthy.

75
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,910
Your liver is all swollen, and...

76
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,680
you have a dark mind.

77
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
How can you possibly live long?

78
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
How much longer do you think
you can live at this rate?

79
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,510
- What... what are you doing?
- What did I tell you?

80
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,830
'Too much is as bad as too little.'
This happens when you're too greedy.

81
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,170
Will you come to your senses
if you know when you will die?

82
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,450
- How arrogant...
- Honey.

83
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,380
- Send him out.
- Get out. Get out!

84
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,120
- Get out now!
- Why?

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,060
Wasn't it enough to damage
my father's reputation?

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,490
Why are you still living like this?

87
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,930
My father is watching us
from the afterlife!

88
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,570
Oh my, brother.

89
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,640
Why in the world did you
have to send him?

90
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,750
Honey, honey.

91
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,930
Yi Hye, get him out of here,
or your brother will die.

92
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,140
Get out! I said get out!

93
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,350
Get out. Get out!

94
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,220
<i>Oh, my brother...</i>

95
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,480
<i>He's gone too far, seriously.</i>

96
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,160
<i>Oh, my brother...</i>

97
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,010
<i>- My brother.
- Shut it. You scared me.</i>

98
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,480
<i>Won Jung Hyoi Go.</i>

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,690
<i>The pain of facing things you hate.</i>

100
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,980
<i>- Shut up!
- Quiet!</i>

101
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,780
Eun Ha Soo.

102
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,940
Hello.

103
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,000
- Well...
- Well...

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,140
- About my brother...
- About Shin Hyung...

105
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,400
- What is it?
- What is it?

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,580
- Go ahead.
- Well...

107
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,220
I was just asking you
to be nice to my brother.

108
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,320
By the way, what about my brother?

109
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,050
Is he going somewhere, by any chance?

110
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,590
Why? Did he say something?

111
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,780
No, that's not it, but...

112
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,910
I just got this sense he might be.

113
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,650
He's not sick or anything like that, is he?

114
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,450
- Well, about that...
- What is it?

115
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,010
Is he really sick?

116
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,870
No.

117
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,600
I'm looking into it,
so don't worry too much.

118
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,120
Okay.

119
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,900
He's handsome.

120
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,020
Why didn't I see it all this time?

121
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,130
What is it?

122
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,400
- How do you like this ring?
- It's pretty.

123
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,470
- What is this?
- What do you mean?

124
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,830
These are matching
couple rings, you know.

125
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,570
A couple?

126
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,300
I didn't realize it before
because we worked so closely.

127
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,490
But you're like oxygen to me.

128
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,860
I hope we start to notice
each other from now on.

129
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,020
I was thinking we could
start as a couple today...

130
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,430
Gosh, seriously!

131
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,900
Don't take it off!
I'll get my heart broken.

132
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,310
It's pretty.

133
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,580
<i>How come you're not
sending me the final assignment?</i>

134
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,190
<i>Because that's not something
we can do right now.</i>

135
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,860
<i>Then when can we do it?</i>

136
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,500
<i>Wait and you'll find out.</i>

137
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,910
<i>Don't keep me waiting for too long.</i>

138
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,990
<i>Why not?</i>

139
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,320
<i>Well... no reason.</i>

140
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,010
<i>You're not going to leave me...</i>

141
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,520
<i>after you grant my final wish, are you?</i>

142
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,370
<i>Can we go see that movie
we missed last time tonight?</i>

143
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,190
<i>Really? Sure.</i>

144
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,400
It shows another deficit
for this quarter.

145
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,280
If this continues, we won't even
have enough for maintenance.

146
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,640
Resorts three and four are
in danger of immediate closure.

147
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,490
President Choi should be
responsible for this crisis.

148
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,580
If we don't do anything right now

149
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,500
it will get even worse next year.

150
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,850
It's not impossible.

151
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,110
The late Chairman Choi's final project,
Cruise Hotel...

152
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,090
- About that...
- As long as we have the business plan

153
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,920
we can handle
the current financial crisis.

154
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,120
There are a good number of foreign
investors lined up for Cruise Hotel.

155
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,740
Then are you saying we should
bring in foreign funds?

156
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,700
There's no other way.

157
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,860
The offer will be gone
in a few days' time, too.

158
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,110
What's going on?

159
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,170
- We need the Cruise Hotel business plan.
- Why?

160
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,850
Did Director Jung ask you
to sneak that out, too?

161
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,190
- President Choi.
- What's your real objective?

162
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,070
- Ask Choi Shin Hyung to help you.
- What?

163
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,690
If you two work together

164
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,370
you may be able to overcome the crisis.

165
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,760
What is this?

166
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,370
<i>[Buyout Offer]</i>

167
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,010
Before Director Jung sells this resort
to the foreign corporations listed there

168
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,050
please hurry.

<i>[Business report]</i>

170

Why are you going through
all this trouble?

171
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,760
I misunderstood you
without knowing this.

172
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,290
Just focus on your work for now.

173
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,100
<i>I'm here and just got the tickets.</i>

Director Jung?

175
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,300
Hello, speaking.

176
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,320
Sure.

177
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,590
Why did you want to see me
on such short notice?

178
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,380
<i>[Search and seizure warrant]</i>

179
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,850
It's a search and seizure warrant
for Daehan Resort.

180
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,500
Before the police barge in with
the warrant tomorrow morning

181
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,890
I'm letting you know ahead of time.

182
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,930
For what?

183
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,890
Including Choi Dae Han, Choi Young Dal,
Lee In Ja, and Choi Yi Hye

184
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,420
asked for investments for Cruise Hotel,
the project the late Chairman Choi worked on.

185
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,600
The police have a reason to believe
they used the money for a private fund.

186
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,200
That's why they are trying
to investigate the matter.

187
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,220
You...

188
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,640
how long do you plan on
deceiving me for?

189
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,400
What do you mean by that?

190
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,260
I already know about
your ambition...

191
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,950
but there are plenty of other things
you can do on your own.

192
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,150
If you came this far
by your own strength

193
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,600
you should finish it on your own!

194
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,880
- Don't you think so?
- I appreciate your advice.

195
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,030
But I don't want to hear
anything like that anymore.

196
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,660
<i>Redirecting your call to voicemail...</i>

197
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,090
<i>I'm here. Where are you?</i>

198
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,890
<i>Why can't I get a hold of you?</i>

199
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,980
He's not reading it.
What's going on?

200
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,820
Is everything okay?

201
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,340
The late Chairman Choi Go Bong
once said this.

202
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,090
'When it comes to business,
it's all about profits or deficits.'

203
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,810
'It's not about right or wrong.'

204
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,690
What is it that you want?

205
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,090
Truth usually doesn't matter
in cases like these.

206
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,490
It will just weaken
the current management.

207
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:05,480
The late Chairman Choi
raised you to become a monster.

208
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,780
Then I will wait to hear from you.

209
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,380
Eun Ha Soo!

210
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,080
You fool!

211
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,040
Why are you out here?

212
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,760
Why didn't you just go home?

213
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,810
Why are you getting mad at me?
I'm the one who should be mad.

214
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,340
Ha Soo...

215
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,430
When it's this cold, you should have
been waiting inside where it's warm.

216
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,340
I thought you disappeared on me.

217
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,930
Your cell phone was turned off.

218
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,880
You said you'd wait for me here.

219
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,580
I'm sorry.

220
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,780
A sudden work meeting came up,
so I had to go...

221
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,330
How could you just go like that?

222
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,860
I was worried that you were sick again.

223
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,600
I was worried that
you disappeared again.

224
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,690
Koong, koong da.

225
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,970
Koong, koong da.

226
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,930
Koong, koong da.

227
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,280
Koong, koong da.

228
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,930
You're feeling better now, right?

229
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,720
Yes.

230
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,650
Don't just disappear again
without telling me first, okay?

231
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,190
<i>I'm here. Where are you?</i>

232
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,300
<i>Why can't I get a hold of you?</i>

233
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,760
<i>Are you sick again, by any chance?</i>

234
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,700
<i>Are you really sick?</i>

235
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,330
<i>I'm going crazy here.
Why did you switch off your phone?</i>

236
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,400
<i>Choi Shin Hyung, call me back.</i>

237
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,490
<i>Just don't be sick, okay?</i>

238
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,510
<i>Please.</i>

239
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,230
<i>You didn't go far away, did you?</i>

240
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,490
<i>Choi Shin Hyung, if you don't
call me back before I count to ten</i>

241
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,000
<i>I'll really leave!</i>

242
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,380
<i>Where on earth did you go?</i>

243
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,440
- Please, after you.
- Yes, President Choi.

244
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,060
- You seem busy these days, huh?
- Of course.

245
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,420
I just couldn't stand the wrong person
acting like the owner anymore.

246
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,230
Let's go.

247
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,420
Hong Ji Yoon.

248
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,650
Don't stay with him anymore.

249
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
Take your hand off of her.

250
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,580
Isn't it enough to make her work to
the bone since your late father passed?

251
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,620
How long does she have to babysit you?

252
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,620
Gosh, you seriously!

253
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,950
President Choi.

254
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,970
All right.

255
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,050
You should have reacted
like this sooner.

256
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,610
<i>[Choi Shin Hyung]</i>

257
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,870
Don't you know that it was Jung Yi Gun
who started the premium outlets?

258
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,490
I know that.

259
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,830
We're the ones that
protected Seohae Hotel.

260
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,210
Then why are you sucking up to him?

261
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,190
Is that because
you think I'll fail again?

262
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,200
- No, it's not.
- Then stop working with him.

263
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,540
Don't do this because of me.

264
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,950
It's not entirely because of you.

265
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,610
I think it means Director Jung
gave me a chance.

266
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,520
What do you mean?

267
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,790
So I can let go of you from my heart...

268
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,160
I think he's given me a chance
to get you out of my mind.

269
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,400
I feel better.

270
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,990
I'm much better.

271
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,570
So please don't jump to conclusions again.

272
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,070
I'm sorry.

273
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,090
For making things hard for you.

274
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,110
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,270
That I couldn't like...

276
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,340
a nice woman like
Hong Ji Yoon like yourself...

277
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
I'm sorry again.

278
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,090
That I'm still trying to
hold onto you now.

279
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,540
I'm going to try really hard.

280
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,470
Trust me just this once.

281
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,160
So are you really going to
hand it over to Director Jung?

282
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,590
You worked on it with
Manager Hong for three years.

283
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,820
Take this opportunity
to kick your family out.

284
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,300
They're the ones who are just
taking your money any chance they get.

285
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,180
- You once said that my family was better.
- Did I?

286
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,400
It was a different situation back then.

287
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,840
You have some sort of plan, right?

288
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,690
Verify it.

289
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,620
You sure knew what I meant.

290
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,110
Like you said...

291
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,990
it's not about whether it's true or not.

292
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,170
I should put an end to it
before it gets out of control.

293
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,870
- This should be authentic this time, right?
- Instead...

294
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,850
don't try to use Choi Yi Hye anymore.

295
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,050
Don't break her heart.

296
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,450
That will be Choi Yi Hye's choice.

297
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,890
Don't worry about the resort.

298
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,120
Like you told me last time

299
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,060
it's a good idea that foreign companies
buy out the resort.

300
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,760
In exchange, in regards to
the terms for the buyout

301
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,040
keep the clause that
the employees keep their jobs.

302
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,070
I will. By the way, why did you
make this decision?

303
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,680
Because they're still my family...

304
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,960
What? Am I weird?

305
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,010
I hope you will understand one day.

306
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:54,030
Jung Yi Gun, this will come back
to bite you from now on.

307
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,240
I feel bad for you.

308
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,630
<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have eight days
to return on your payment.]</i>

309
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,540
Please don't try to fool me anymore.

310
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,800
I know everything.

311
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,230
Manager Sung.

312
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,510
As expected, you can't fool family.

313
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,640
You knew, didn't you?

314
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,100
Is he really going to die?

315
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,180
He's going to die on this day?

316
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,980
I don't know.
We'll only know when time comes.

317
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,360
How can a mere human
understand God's plan?

318
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,820
There has to be a way.

319
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,150
There has to be a way for him to live.

320
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,690
Meteor...

321
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,780
If we take out the meteor

322
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,220
he might be able to live longer.

323
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,780
These are the books
our late father read.

324
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,140
They will help you with
your work in the future.

325
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,060
There are books about management...

326
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,690
- and some about humanities.
- Why are you doing this?

327
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,210
What do you mean?

328
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,800
When someone's about to die...

329
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,090
I hear they do unusual things.

330
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,590
You won't see a doctor.

331
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,310
You won't have surgery, either.

332
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,090
Why would you make me
seaweed soup and buy me shoes?

333
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,250
Why did you go rock climbing with me?

334
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,680
Now you're even giving me
the books that our father read?

335
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,850
You want me to read them?

336
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,300
If you don't want to,
you don't have to.

337
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,280
I don't want to have surgery.
That's why I won't do it.

338
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,100
You don't have much time left.

339
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,480
<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have eight days
to return on your payment.]</i>

340
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,180
Look.

341
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,880
It's the text sent to our father.

342
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,650
Then why are you the one who's dying?

343
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,990
Nonsense.

344
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,690
This means nothing.

345
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,340
Some crazy punk keeps sending
these to our father as a prank!

346
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,270
So you stop worrying about it.

347
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,230
Please...

348
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,700
I wish I could do that.

349
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,580
<i>I appreciate that...</i>

350
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,390
But I don't think I'll have enough time.

351
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,940
Is Choi Shin Hyung going
somewhere, by any chance?

352
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,050
I don't want to have surgery.
That's why I won't do it.

353
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,730
Father...

354
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,790
Where are we going all of a sudden?

355
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,590
You should at least tell me, huh?

356
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,880
What is this?

357
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,780
Who is this? Manager Hong!

358
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,640
Good to see you.
I was waiting for you.

359
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,830
Are we going to go work somewhere?

360
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,440
- Just get in.
- Where are we going?

361
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,500
- Stop talking. Let's get him in.
- You should tell me where.

362
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,390
I said tell me where.

363
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,800
Get in.

364
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,070
What do you mean
a business trip on my day off?

365
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,070
Just follow me.

366
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,150
Manager Hong, how are you?

367
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,110
Good to see you, Eun Ha Soo.

368
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,440
- What is this about?
- I don't know.

369
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,330
It seems that he wants
to take us somewhere...

370
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,960
Get in. Just get in.

371
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,070
<i>[Go on a trip with my son.]</i>

372
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,220
Hold that side tightly.

373
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,270
Can you hurry up?

374
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,110
Gosh, I said to hold it properly!

375
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm doing it right.
You worry about yourself.

376
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,580
- Eun Ha Soo. Eun Ha Soo!
- Are you okay?

377
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,840
Are you okay?

378
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,650
How can two men have trouble with this?

379
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,510
That's what I was saying.
He can't even do this right.

380
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,480
Who are you blaming
when it was your fault?

381
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,940
You should've held it straight.

382
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,170
- How could you suddenly let go?
- How crazy.

383
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,660
You've never done this before, have you?

384
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,790
You two stop fighting.
It'll get dark soon.

385
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,300
Why did I come along with you?

386
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,540
- Move. I'll try.
- It's okay.

387
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,400
I'll do it by myself.
What could I possibly do with him?

388
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,380
Two people have to click
in order to do this.

389
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,400
Leave it then. I'll do it myself.

390
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,440
Good then. You do it all yourself.

391
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,930
Gosh, hold it there again.

392
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,410
Make it straight.

393
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,170
Oh my, it's too heavy to hold by myself.

394
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,750
How did you end up coming here?

395
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,550
He wanted to surprise me, so here I am.

396
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,370
He didn't tell me.

397
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:10,170
- I was kidnapped.
- Then was I kidnapped too?

398
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,850
Gosh, those two are making me
into a kidnapper now, huh?

399
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,190
Oh my, I'm hungry.

400
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,130
Is it not ready yet?

401
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,610
- Here it is.
- What is it?

402
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,570
- You want me to do it?
- Of course.

403
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,380
Men are supposed to do this
when we're outdoors.

404
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,810
Okay!

405
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,480
I'm going to grill it to perfection!

406
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,720
Don't even lift a finger
and stay right here.

407
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,640
- Got it?
- Sure.

408
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,680
Please let me do that.

409
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,990
Let me see.

410
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,790
Try. Say 'ah.'

411
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,730
It's good.

412
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,780
Manager Hong, say 'ah.'

413
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,860
I'm okay. Give it to Manager Hong.

414
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,990
Dae Han is taking good care of her.

415
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,840
What are you doing?
Why are you eating mine?

416
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,330
Eat yours.

417
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,270
Why are you acting like a child?

418
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,830
- Let me. I'll grill it.
- It's okay.

419
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,480
I'll grill it again and
let's not share with them.

420
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,660
Try.

421
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,150
Manager Hong, can you
get the shrimp ready?

422
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,190
You'll do a good job.

423
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,190
<i>There are people
who shine more...</i>

424
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,980
<i>when they're in each other's company.</i>

425
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,640
<i>While they live the rest of their lives</i>

426
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,940
<i>I hope they become great friends
who can help one and another.</i>

427
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,360
Why would you take pictures?

428
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:35,820
<i>No one would replace me...</i>

429
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,380
<i>but it's very fortunate thathe has such
a wonderful person like her by his side.</i>

430
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,910
<i>he has such a wonderful person
like her by his side.</i>

431
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,160
Men are supposed to get this
for the ladies, okay?

432
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,170
Manager Hong, put this on.

433
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,150
Isn't he insensitive and rude?

434
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,210
Yes, he's like that in a way.

435
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,690
That's my charm.

436
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,780
I agree. When I'm with Choi Shin Hyung

437
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,310
I feel as if I'm with
the late Chairman Choi.

438
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,390
The late Chairman Choi
was like that, too.

439
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,960
Do you remember that time?

440
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,110
He misunderstood us and yelled at us.

441
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,100
He fired me right away that day.

442
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,070
That's how he was.

443
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,300
He would never hear me out.

444
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,830
But later on, he asked
Manager Sung to call you.

445
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,810
He was worried and
gave you your job back.

446
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,670
Did he?

447
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,290
He did...

448
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,700
I don't know much about my father.

449
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,850
But he was very good at his work.

450
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,830
Now that I'm in his shoes, I see it.

451
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,040
Of course.
There was no one else like him.

452
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,550
I still have deep respect for him.

453
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,660
Of course.

454
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,210
He was such a great man.

455
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,210
It's a good thing
that you guys know that.

456
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,430
Shall we try the sweet potatoes?

457
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,640
How done are they?
Let's play the Tact Game. One!

458
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
- Two!
- Three.

459
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
Four!

460
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,130
What do you mean four?

461
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,090
- No?
- Drink.

462
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,090
Isn't it right?
One, two, three, four?

463
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,670
Drink.

464
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,300
- Just drink.
- One, two, three, four...

465
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,340
- I said drink.
- Drink the coffee!

466
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,570
- Why?
- Drink up. Drink up.

467
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,200
What is it? Four comes after three.

468
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
Then is it five?

469
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,830
I'm so glad that you're by his side.

470
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,140
Please don't mention it.

471
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,460
You'll face a lot of difficulties
at work in the future.

472
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:20,280
I hope you can teach him and lead him
in the right direction when that happens.

473
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,560
He's already doing a good job.

474
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,820
Since Chairman Choi passed away...

475
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,730
and he met you,
he's changed quite a lot.

476
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,650
He gave up his dream.

477
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,610
Seeing him choose to follow
in his late father's footsteps..

478
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,060
I sometimes feel bad for him.

479
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,070
While you worked for
the finicky late Chairman Choi

480
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,360
you had to take care of Dae Han, too.

481
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,300
It was hard for you, wasn't it?

482
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,120
No, every moment of it
was very meaningful.

483
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,930
I have a lot of good memories, too.

484
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,380
If you still have feelings
for Dae Han...

485
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,580
wait for him a little longer.

486
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,190
He's still just immature.

487
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,490
But he's thoughtful...

488
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,820
and he's a warm-hearted person.

489
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,230
Shin Hyung, take this.

490
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,250
What is this?

491
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,810
You want me to sleep in the tent?

492
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,280
It's so nice in here.

493
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,160
You should try sleeping in
one of these. Come here.

494
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,860
- Will you be okay?
- Of course!

495
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,420
I'm a tough man, you know.

496
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,150
Hurry, go in. It's cold.

497
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,630
- We'll go inside then.
- Good night.

498
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,240
Good night.

499
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,440
Good night.

500
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,210
You'll see her in the morning, gosh.

501
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,990
- Come over here.
- Go in.

502
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,740
What are you doing now?

503
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,500
Did you have to go this far?

504
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,640
Because of the case involving
five billion won last time...

505
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,980
Wasn't it enough that my brother's
reputation was ruined when he died?

506
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,720
Will you be happy that you take
every member of my family to the police?

507
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,100
Are you choosing your family
over money now?

508
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,300
What?

509
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,780
I'll make sure it doesn't
harm you, so don't worry.

510
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,910
How can I believe that?

511
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,970
Just hold onto the department store
in New York that's left for you.

512
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,110
Why are we suddenly
having wine, Manager Hong?

513
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,630
I hid it so that we could
enjoy it by ourselves.

514
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,650
If I get drunk, I might snore...

515
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,100
- I grind my teeth, too.
- Lies.

516
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,880
- I'm not lying.
- It doesn't suit you.

517
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,680
You're so graceful and stylish...

518
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,960
Please go around and tell people.

519
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,100
Don't keep it to yourself.

520
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,430
It's enough that
ne person knows, isn't it?

521
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,180
When it comes to sneeze and love

522
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,960
they say no one can hide those.

523
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,590
The problem is what happens next.

524
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,370
I can't find a way out.

525
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,490
I fell in love with him.

526
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,720
But I have this unsettling feeling.

527
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,330
Do you know what I'm talking about?

528
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,210
I think I know.

529
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,910
I sometimes hate him. too.

530
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,500
You hate him so much
and get mad at him, too.

531
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,730
You know it well.

532
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,040
Is Choi Shin Hyung like that?

533
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,650
No.

534
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,490
I think you've just sneezed.

535
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,470
By the way, will the men be okay?

536
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,830
It's supposed to fall below
zero Celsius tonight.

537
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,260
That's right.

538
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,570
Gosh, it's cold.
I might become a frozen fish.

539
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,980
Do you want a couple
more hot packs in there?

540
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,890
Aren't you cold?

541
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,830
I went rock climbing in bad weather.

542
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,010
This is like spring weather.

543
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,900
You are one heck of an Eskimo then.

544
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,680
Can you turn that off?

545
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,920
What are you doing with it?

546
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,680
I didn't get to tell my father about this.

547
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,880
In my second year of high school...

548
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:43,750
I had to get psychiatric treatment
after my mother passed away.

549
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,090
Psychiatric treatment?

550
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,920
I was about to go crazy at that time.

551
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,140
When my mother collapsed

552
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,920
if only I had found her
five minutes earlier

553
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
No...

554
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,240
if only Father had shown up
at the hospital in time

555
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,230
then my mother wouldn't
have died like that.

556
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,430
Our father must have had a reason.

557
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,520
I know.

558
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,000
I could understand him
in my head...

559
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,290
but my heart couldn't let that go.

560
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,370
The psychiatrist told me backen then...

561
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,970
imagine that my father
was behind this light.

562
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,820
And say everything
I'd been keeping in my heart.

563
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,400
- Father.
- Yes? What?

564
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,060
What are you talking about?

565
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,620
Why did you leave me all alone?

566
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,800
More than your son and your wife

567
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,800
was money more important to you?

568
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:57,000
There were so many things
I wanted to do with you.

569
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,010
I wanted to go camping
with you like this.

570
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,350
At least, I wanted to toss around
a baseball with you.

571
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,040
On my birthdays, I wanted
to go out to eat together.

572
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,780
Was it that hard for you?

573
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,650
<i>Dae Han...</i>

574
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,180
Father, to me...

575
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,330
do you know what a large part
of my life you were?

576
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:36,540
What kind of son was I to you?

577
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,770
'I love you.'

578
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,700
'I trust you.'

579
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,900
You could've just told me that.

580
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,950
I... I mean...

581
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,580
Our late father may be...

582
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,560
It's too late now.

583
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:38,900
Father...

584
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,990
Mom...

585
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,950
I know that, too.

586
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,460
Even if I wanted to turn the clocks back

587
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,710
that it's too late now.

588
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,920
So...

589
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:38,820
even if your father leaves
for a far away place...

590
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:43,500
Remember this one thing.

591
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,620
You're my pride.

592
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,280
My one and only child.

593
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:00,620
Choi Dae Han.

594
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,050
No matter what others
say about you...

595
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,140
you're Choi Go Bong's son.

596
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,720
Be careful. There you go.

597
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,270
- Oh my!
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?

598
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,800
- What do we do?
- Gosh.

599
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,050
You're so impatient.

600
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,630
You can keep your balance
even if you ride at a slow pace.

601
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,910
- Aren't you going to believe me?
- I believe you.

602
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,220
If I don't believe you

603
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,650
who else would I believe?
Don't you think so?

604
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,630
Then rather than steering to go straight

605
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,090
let your body do the work.

606
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,530
It wasn't working because you wanted
to the keep your balance.

607
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,410
If you go straight, you will
keep the balance naturally.

608
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,800
- Good luck.
- Man...

609
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,150
My teacher is scary.
She's scary.

610
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,410
Get set.

611
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:54,850
Go!

612
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,990
Be careful.

613
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,870
There you go.

614
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:04,150
That's right.

615
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,140
There you go.

616
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,900
All right.

617
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,800
- Am I doing it now?
- Yes.

618
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,160
That's right.

619
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,300
Hold my bike!

620
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,860
Hold on!

621
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,260
- Oh my.
- Are you okay? You're hurt?

622
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,890
- What do I do?
- Oh my.

623
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,930
- Oh my, I'm dying.
- Are you hurt?

624
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,600
It hurts.

625
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,730
Where?

626
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,590
- It hurts here, and...
- Your knee?

627
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,750
- It hurts here, too.
- Here?

628
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,560
It hurts here, too.

629
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,630
How could you just
let go of me like that?

630
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,070
Stop kidding around. Get up.

631
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,760
See? I'm good, huh?

632
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,150
Gosh, be careful.

633
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,430
Slow down.

634
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,440
Wow, this is nice!

635
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,000
- Hold on tight.
- I will.

636
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,640
This is great!

637
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,310
- I'll go faster.
- No.

638
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,310
- Hold on tight!
- No!

639
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,790
Why did you want to
go camping, by the way?

640
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:03,000
Maybe...

641
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,630
I thought this could be
our last trip together.

642
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,240
There doesn't seem to be
much time left for Choi Shin Hyung.

643
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,620
How was it? Was it fun?

644
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,260
Yes.

645
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,420
But why did you stay for two days?

646
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,370
- Were you two alone?
- No.

647
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,350
Five assignments? What is this?

648
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:56,490
Hey, don't look. No.

649
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:59,320
- Don't look.
- What is it?

650
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,680
He said he'll grant me five wishes,
so I wrote them down.

651
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,680
How could you ask a rich man
to do things like these for you?

652
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,520
If he asks about your five wishes

653
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,030
House, car, purse, shoes, and coat...

654
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,820
- Is that five already?
- By the way...

655
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:19,400
Talking about the end and that
there's no such thing as forever...

656
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,560
He's not well.

657
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,930
He's thinking about leaving.

658
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,570
Then what comes to mind?

659
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,860
He might be suffering from
a terminal illness?

660
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,060
- What?
- He's going to die.

661
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,130
He's terminally ill.

662
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,970
What is it? Who is suffering
from a terminal illness?

663
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,680
No.

664
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,890
No way.

665
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,740
What is this about?

666
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,870
Because of the illegal investments
for Cruise Hotel

667
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,030
we're investigating the matter.

668
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,170
<i>[Search and seizure warrant]</i>

669
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,080
Search the place.

670
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,910
You said something last time.

671
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:25,860
When Choi Shin Hyung is sick,
that I must be there for him.

672
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,830
What did you mean by that?

673
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,120
Why must I be there for him?

674
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,310
I don't know the reason, either.

675
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:39,080
Choi Shin Hyung told me that
he'd get better when you were nearby.

676
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,710
When you were involved in
the sinkhole accident

677
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,450
the late Chairman Choi Go Bong
was there, too.

678
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,960
It might have something
to do with that accident.

679
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,290
- Pardon?
- At the time...

680
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,030
you two almost died together.

681
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,640
That's probably why Choi Shin Hyung
needs you nearby...

682
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,100
to be able to get better.

683
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,580
I don't understand what you're saying.

684
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,660
Well, since they're family

685
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,870
there must be some effect.

686
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,590
How sick is he now?

687
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,600
It's about the same as the last time.

688
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,990
We don't know when he'll collapse...

689
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,470
When he had a rock in his heart

690
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:23,300
why didn't he want it
surgically removed?

691
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,790
It's just that surgery won't
promise a happy ending...

692
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,550
so he seems conflicted
over it right now.

693
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,990
I've just been to the doctor's office.

694
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:42,010
What's happening to your body, huh?

695
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,290
What's this?

696
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,820
Answer me!

697
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,760
I don't know.
I don't know what's happening.

698
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,570
Are you in pain?
Does it hurt?

699
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,540
I'm not in pain.

700
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,870
