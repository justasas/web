1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mr. Back

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,290
Why did Chairman Choi Young Dal
step down from his position?

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,170
- Who will be in charge now?
- Will you vote for a new chairman?

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,760
- Will you take over yourself?
- Look this way, please.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,820
- Look this way, please.
- Make a comment, please.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,200
I will be in charge
from now on.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,950
I will lead Daehan as chairman
and move it forward.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,440
- Hold on.
- Can we ask a question?

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,040
The sum will be substantial
this time around.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Don't worry.

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,180
I'll be well worth the money.

12
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,400
What did you want to talk about?

13
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,580
Remember how you asked me
something yesterday...

14
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,100
at Silver Town.

15
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,620
I... wanted to give you an answer.

16
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,300
I see.

17
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,610
I...

18
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,530
To be honest...

19
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,110
How I feel is...

20
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,790
Look. Look over there.

21
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
<i>[Director Choi Dae Han
demands sex from lady named A]</i>

22
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,190
Director Cho. Wake up, sir.

23
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,770
What is it?
What's the matter?

24
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,930
Who's that?

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,840
What is this?

26
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,000
- Get out.
- Pardon?

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,610
- I said get out!
- Okay.

28
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,700
Manager Sung, check the CCTV.

29
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,710
Fine out what time it was
and the room number.

30
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,640
Who was that woman and
why was he in that room?

31
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,910
Call me back after you find out.

32
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,930
Manager Hong, where are you?

33
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,060
How do you know her?
Did that take place?

34
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
Did you really demand sex?

35
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,510
- Make a comment, please.
- Please give us statement.

36
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,100
The man in the picture...

37
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,730
Is me!

38
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,170
It wasn't Choi Dae Han!

39
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,150
But me, Choi Shin Hyung!

40
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,530
Are you saying that you are
the man in the picture?

41
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,110
<i>[Episode 8]</i>

42
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,180
That's me! Me, Choi Shin Hyung.

43
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,560
Just look at it.
It's clearly me, isn't it?

44
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,590
I have a habit of sleeping on my stomach.

45
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,950
Want me to show you my back?
Want to see?

46
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,650
I'm the one that was subpoenaed.
Why are you interfering?

47
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,440
Look, there must be
some kind of mistake here.

48
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,990
I'm the one who
slept in Room 3017.

49
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,850
Don't come forward, okay?
Never, don't do it.

50
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,270
It's you who shouldn't be interfering.

51
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,040
You're not going to listen to me?

52
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,430
Jeez, what are you doing?

53
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,570
- Choi Dae Han.
- Yes?

54
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,750
Where were you that night?

55
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,080
Listen carefully.

56
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,320
You slept at home that night.

57
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,010
All the CCTV tapes have been erased.

58
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,320
We have an alibi and eyewitness ready.

59
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,190
Don't worry, and just do as I say.

60
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,590
<i>The one in the picture
will be Choi Shin Hyung.</i>

61
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,920
At the resort. In Room 3017.

62
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,810
That's where I slept.

63
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,720
That woman is more than capable
of doing things like that for money.

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,200
I was drinking alone
in that room that night.

65
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,040
I got so drunk that...

66
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,500
I don't really remember who
came in or out of the room.

67
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,660
I said that's not true!

68
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,850
Why do you keep lying?

69
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,610
I'm saying that
I slept in that room.

70
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,920
Then did we sleep together, huh?

71
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,340
Why are you doing this?

72
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,010
That's our late father's resort.

73
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,010
Manager Hong charged my credit card.

74
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,150
But what does this woman want? Money?

75
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,370
Can I have your name and
identification number?

76
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,870
451105...

77
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm a Canadian citizen...

78
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,060
and my name is Choi Shin Hyung.

79
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,790
When did you come to Korea
from Canada?

80
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,470
November 5.

81
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,340
On my late father's birthday...

82
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,360
Where in Canada are you from?
Vancouver? Montreal?

83
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,090
You remember your address there, right?

84
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,340
Are you pleading the fifth here?

85
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,690
If you keep this up, you could
end up in jail after questioning.

86
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,080
Got that?

87
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,930
What's your deal?

88
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,510
Why didn't you do as
you were told by Manager Hong?

89
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,400
Why are you doing this?

90
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,040
You're finally trying to do some work
after coming to your senses

91
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,230
you fell into a trap.

92
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,690
Am I wrong?

93
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,980
- Just listen to me.
- The truth will eventually reveal itself.

94
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,500
Listen carefully.

95
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,930
The truth doesn't matter when
it comes to cases like these.

96
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,220
Once this gets out,
people will talk.

97
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,280
And that will be your end.

98
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,350
Plus, you haven't been on
your best behavior all these years.

99
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,050
Who are you to tell me all this?

100
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
Who the hell are you?

101
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,770
How rude of you to speak to
your older brother that way.

102
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,930
Go on. I don't want
to see your face.

103
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,090
Seriously.

104
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,360
Gosh, I didn't think Choi Shin Hyung
would do something like that.

105
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,820
What could she possibly want
from Choi Shin Hyung?

106
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,760
He already cut ties with the family.

107
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,250
Is his current position
what's important right now?

108
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,510
Even if it was brief,
he was our previous chairman.

109
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,800
Even if he is illegitimate,
he's still late Chairman Choi's son.

110
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,700
It's obvious she planned this
to go after his money.

111
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,240
Whether it was Choi Dae Han
or Choi Shin Hyung

112
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,740
all she needs to do is get her money.

113
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,950
Don't you think?

114
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,070
Do you know why on earth
he's acting that way?

115
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,700
Did you go knowingly
go along with his plan?

116
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,740
It's more important to keep you safe

117
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,100
than to focus on
Choi Shin Hyung's intentions.

118
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,880
Please do as I say.

119
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,520
If you get wrangled into this issue
in such a crucial time

120
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,410
it won't be easy to recover.

121
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,500
Manager Hong, by the way...

122
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,780
aren't you curious as to
what really happened that night?

123
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,880
I don't want to know the truth.

124
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,080
What matters to me is that
you won't be charged.

125
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,460
You saw the CCTV, didn't you?

126
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,240
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

127
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,630
But were you really
the one in that picture?

128
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,220
I'm saying it is.

129
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,050
If you're lying, you could be charged
with perjury and obstruction of justice.

130
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,950
Don't interfere with the investigation.

131
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,950
Tell the truth.

132
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,470
Why do you think it's not the truth?

133
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,300
<i>Probably because you planned it,
so you know better than anyone.</i>

134
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,310
Director Choi has gotten himself
involved in such cases in the past.

135
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,170
Gosh, that punk...

136
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,940
<i>You're getting aggravated, aren't you?</i>

137
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,050
<i>Handle this on your own.</i>

138
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,080
Then I'll go meet with the prosecutor.

139
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,730
I will see if the charges
can be dropped.

140
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,260
Sure. Do that.

141
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,920
Why did you get yourself into this mess
and go through all this trouble?

142
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,160
Are you jealous of scandals now
just because you're young again?

143
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,410
What did you say?

144
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,280
I'm nervous enough as it is that
your cover might be blown wide open.

145
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,720
- What if it does?
- Then what?

146
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,130
How are they going to find me?

147
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,130
You really have no idea, do you?

148
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,410
Don't worry.

149
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,320
I won't trouble your nephew in Canada.

150
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,900
Don't do that.

151
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,970
Just throw a couple of
gold bars at her as a settlement.

152
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,530
What's the point of keeping them?
Not like you're going to give them to me.

153
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,410
Why would I want to settle?
I did nothing wrong, you punk.

154
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,820
What if something really happened
between Dae Han and her?

155
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,380
What would you do then?

156
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,550
I told you not to call me
before I called first.

157
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,190
Didn't I?

158
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,990
How could you handle matters like this?

159
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,630
The picture. The picture!

160
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,230
It was done thirty minutes ago.

161
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,750
The man in the picture is me!

162
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,880
Don't come forward, okay?
Never, don't do it.

163
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,100
How rude of you to speak to
your older brother that way.

164
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,320
Go!

165
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,100
Older brother?

166
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,490
Manager Hong.
Go look into the CCTV...

167
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,220
and find out when she came
in and out of the room.

168
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,920
and how long she stayed
in the room.

169
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,490
See if there were any eyewitnesses, too.

170
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,870
No matter how hard I try

171
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,840
I can't figure out what the deal
is with Choi Shin Hyung.

172
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,910
Why is he protecting Dae Han?

173
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,950
I agree.

174
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,140
They were going at each other's
throats not too long ago.

175
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,960
Hold on. Could Dae Han have
handed over his shares

176
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,670
and had Choi Shin Hyung
take the blame instead?

177
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,920
No way.

178
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,130
Even if that were the case,
he'd never do that.

179
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,680
Did they plot something behind
our backs, by any chance?

180
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,250
Excuse me.

181
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,170
Did something happen between
the two of them while we were gone?

182
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,960
What is it?

183
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,550
Tell me what happened.

184
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,190
They were in the heat of
the moment, and on fire...

185
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,200
- Fire?
- That fire couldn't be put out

186
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,540
even if the firefighters
were to come.

187
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,700
Isn't that right?

188
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,200
- What do you mean?
- They were on fire?

189
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,700
Then... by any chance?

190
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,930
- Those two?
- What is it? What?

191
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,800
- In love?
- Oh, shit.

192
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,120
<i>Is that why he brought the guy back
after we kicked him out?</i>

193
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,870
<i>Oh my, they were bickering so often...</i>

194
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,030
<i>and became close in the end.</i>

195
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,940
<i>That's a perfect romantic comedy.</i>

196
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,490
What are you all imagining?

197
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,180
No way.

198
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,440
Dae Han, that's not right.

199
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,280
Excuse me, Director Jung.

200
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,900
Choi Shin Hyung.

201
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,150
What is this?

202
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,030
Who sent her in here?

203
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,290
Your salary comes out
of my tax dollars!

204
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,500
Aren't you going to
do your job properly?

205
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,350
Don't do that.
I'll leave soon.

206
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,140
- Gosh.
- Aren't you cold in there?

207
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,620
Jail facilities are quite nice nowadays.

208
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,340
It's like a hotel.

209
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,530
I was going to bring some clothes,
but they wouldn't allow it.

210
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,620
When you are released,
I'll make sure to feed you.

211
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,780
They feed me well in here, too.

212
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,400
It's like a feast.

213
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,240
You're not sick, are you?

214
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,650
I was worried that you might
suddenly get sick like last time.

215
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,710
I'm glad I got to see you
even if it was for a moment.

216
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,350
I'll go now.

217
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,040
Hey.

218
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,280
The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

219
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,510
I'm a despicable man.

220
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,500
I talked a model trainee into
coming with me to a hotel room.

221
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,090
Anyway, I'm far worse
than you can imagine.

222
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,770
So don't worry about me.

223
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,360
I'm not sure about you being despicable,
but you're a terrible liar.

224
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,190
What?

225
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,400
You were surprised
by the news in the car.

226
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,130
You had no idea
what it was about.

227
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,810
That's because I was shocked
that it was on that big screen...

228
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,770
What was it that
you wanted to tell me then?

229
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,800
What do you mean?

230
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,690
You were trying to say something
right before the news.

231
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,460
You said you would
answer my question.

232
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,940
Ah, that...

233
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,710
It was about...

234
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,950
You said you would
make me some side dishes.

235
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,070
Hey, we're done here.
Can you show her out?

236
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,020
I believe you, Choi Shin Hyung.

237
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,430
As far as I know, you aren't
someone who would do that.

238
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,520
Gosh, you're such a frustrating woman.

239
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,120
You're not supposed to
trust people that easily.

240
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,170
I don't trust people easily.

241
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,040
I only trust those who can be trusted.

242
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,120
So why don't you try
believing in yourself, too?

243
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,990
I'm leaving.

244
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,510
Thank you.

245
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,530
For trusting someone like me...

246
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,840
This is the image of the woman
captured on the CCTV.

247
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,490
From the time she appeared in the lobby

248
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,000
to the time she came down
the elevator and exited the lobby

249
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,170
was exactly four minutes and 27 seconds.

250
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,660
How long was she in the room then?

251
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,230
As a reference, I tried walking through
the lobby and getting on the elevator.

252
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,730
I opened the door to the resort
and came back down to the lobby.

253
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,370
It took me three minutes
and 35 seconds in total.

254
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,440
If that's the case, she stayed in
the room for a mere 55 seconds.

255
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,890
It's enough time to sneak inside
and take a few pictures.

256
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,300
You can't do anything
within 50 seconds, you know.

257
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,810
You would know that as a man.

258
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,310
You walk in, set the mood,
take off this piece...

259
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,920
and take off this one,
and this one after that.

260
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,710
50 seconds just flies by that way.

261
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,890
Don't you think so, Prosecutor Yang?

262
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,610
And this is the document that proves
Choi Shin Hyung's Canadian citizenship.

263
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,600
That woman is lying.

264
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,340
That's right.

265
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,500
Someone I didn't even know
sneaked into my room...

266
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,540
took some pictures,
and then sneaked back out.

267
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,970
Since both parties' testimonies don't agree

268
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,950
we're looking into the victim as well.

269
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,950
Who are you calling the victim?

270
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,870
We're the victims!
Don't you think?

271
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,200
Manager Hong, good work.

272
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,300
No. I only did what I had to.

273
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,990
Choi Shin Hyung.

274
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,090
- Don't get involved in my business again.
- What?

275
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,750
- What? You punk.
- Let's go now.

276
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,700
- Don't even respond.
- Gosh.

277
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,680
Stop acting like my brother
and tell me the truth.

278
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,010
Why did you do it?

279
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,040
Everybody thinks that you sacrificed
yourself for your half-brother.

280
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,660
- You think I'm a fool?
- Gosh.

281
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,810
- You rotten punk.
- Why did you do it?

282
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,450
Tell me.

283
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:55,150
Because I suddenly feel like
trusting you, Choi Dae Han.

284
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,200
Why? Why would you?

285
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,660
Not sure.

286
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,910
You're were hurt far more
than I thought.

287
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:13,270
That's why you might have
tried to live a screwed up life.

288
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,750
Who are you?

289
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,000
- Who do you think you are?
- Me?

290
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,860
I'm...

291
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,870
currently the most popular guy
out there, Choi Shin Hyung.

292
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,450
Hey, Ha Soo.

293
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,860
- Look at this.
- What is it?

<i>[Daehan Group Brothers

295
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,370
Wow, this is a relief.

296
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,880
Shouldn't we throw him a party
for getting out of jail?

297
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,220
Should we?

298
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,210
Hold on.

299

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,430
I'm glad that everything was resolved.

301
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,110
About what happened yesterday...

302
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,100
do you really see me
as someone who'd do that?

303
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,310
I didn't think you would.

304
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,210
Why did my brother do that?

305
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,280
Do you know that you just
called him your brother?

306
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,330
What? I did?

307
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,010
When did I do that?
Nonsense.

308
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,740
His name is Shin Hyung.
I probably said that.

309
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,100
The reason why
I asked you out here is...

310
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,090
- When will you give it to me?
- Give what?

311
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,050
My pendant.

312
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,100
- I forgot. I left it at home.
- Did you?

313
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,490
Good then.
I'll get to see you again.

314
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,820
Hello, ma'am.

315
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,180
I heard you got the new coat.
Can I see it?

316
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,080
Well, there was only one
that came to Korea...

317
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,810
and someone else
is already trying it on.

318
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,600
What?

319
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,970
Wow, not too detailed
and it looks luxurious.

320
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,930
Oh my, are you trying
to buy that coat?

321
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,880
You're so fast when it comes
to something like that.

322
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,470
- Were you thinking about buying this, too?
- Yes.

323
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,920
What do we do?
I already decided to get it.

324
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,660
By the way, you're so greedy.

325
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,020
Isn't it enough that you came this far
after coming from the countryside?

326
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,020
Why do you have to try so hard
to act like you're rich?

327
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,050
It can't hide where you're from.

330

And show me something else
that I would want.

- Okay, I'd love to.

334
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,300
Sorry.

335

What was she saying?

00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,800
Is this how you treat

- I'm very sorry, ma'am.
- Shit.

You should pull out of a dead project.

348
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,560
How is Dae Han supposed to revive it?

349
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,330
- Don't you think?
- Of course.

350
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,540
If we build a premium outlet
in that location

351
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,680
the sales will be three times
what it is now.

352
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,160
As you can see,
we've prepared everything for you.

353
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,540
All you need to do is show up
and cut the ribbon at the ceremony...

354
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,670
I'll think about it.
I have a meeting, so...

355
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,250
- What do you think he'll do?
- Don't worry.

356
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,730
He'll take the bait.

357
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,600
What is all this?

358
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,130
Do I have to lower my head to
a former subordinate like Director Jung?

359
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,840
If you don't?

360
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,810
Would you rather get kicked out and
be homeless like someone else we know?

361
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,360
Before Chairman Choi Go Bong
passed away

362
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,870
he had worked on something big.

363
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,120
The Cruise Hotel...

364
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,590
How did you know about that?

365
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,350
That's something only
he and I knew about.

366
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,790
I thought so.

367
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,470
You worked with him
in secret for everything, huh?

368
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,810
How did you know about that?

369
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:18,750
Choi Shin Hyung had the business plan
in his possession.

370
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,990
What?

371
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,900
- Yi Gun.
- Marry me.

372
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,420
I have something to tell you.

373
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,970
- It's about Choi Shin Hyung.
- Okay.

374
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,430
The late Chairman Choi was working
on the Cruise Hotel as his final project.

375
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,360
He seems to have its business plan.

376
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,320
Cruise Hotel? What's that?

377
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,480
Chairman Choi was
preparing for it in secret

378
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,310
and I was assisting him.

379
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,270
Since it was his final project...

380
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,930
I hope you can see it through.

381
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,180
Then how does Choi Shin Hyung
have that information?

382
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,000
I'll get it back, no matter what it takes.

383
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,650
It's always like this...

384
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,800
Ah, seriously.

385
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,410
Who dropped gum in my resort, huh?

386
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,960
Darn it.

387
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,510
You seem very dedicated.

388
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,060
Of course,

389
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:49,100
I'm following my late father's philosophy
in starting from the bottom.

390
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,600
But do you have business with me?

391
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,650
It's about the business plan
for the Cruise Hotel.

392
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,970
I worked on it with the
late Chairman Choi in secret.

393
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,600
It took us more than
three years just to plan it.

394
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,770
We were going to present the plan
at the end of the year and move forward.

395
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,160
So?

396
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,780
I think it's right for Director Choi
to be in charge of it.

397
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,820
Why is that?

398
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,840
Because he prepared it for
Director Choi Dae Han.

399
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,520
- If you steal it away like this...
- It's true that he prepared for him...

400
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,820
But didn't he also say he'd let Dae Han
be in charge if he came to his senses?

401
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,510
How did you handle it?

402
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,570
- What do you mean?
- This isn't what we were looking for.

403
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,640
- How is it not?
- That document...

404
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,710
It's a translated document of
the Meditech business plan in America.

405
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,650
What?

406
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,830
It can't be.

407
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,990
Choi Shin Hyung is toying with us.

408
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,350
It was odd that he came forward
on Choi Dae Han's behalf.

409
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,420
Are they working together or something?

410
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,960
About Choi Dae Han and Choi Shin Hyung...

411
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,670
It wasn't a war between brothers.

412
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,860
But it was love between two brothers?

413
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,880
- Love?
- No way.

414
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,100
He's his half-brother who
showed up out of nowhere.

415
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,640
About Eun Ha Soo...

416
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,060
Is she playing around
with both of them then?

417
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,350
Ha Soo isn't that kind of a woman!

418
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,430
How do you know?

419
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,770
They're both the late
Chairman Choi's sons, after all.

420
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,770
If she uses her wiles

421
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,310
it'll only be a matter of time
before she gets promoted.

422
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,520
Wiles?

423
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,580
What if she becomes my superior one day?

424
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,250
- Excuse me.
- You scared me.

425
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,080
If you're jealous, just say so.

426
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,140
Not everybody can become
Cinderella, you know.

427
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,770
What is she saying?

428
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm going to be Snow White.

429
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,590
I will have seven rich dwarfs.

430
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,320
Gosh, I'm so relieved that
I'm not a dwarf.

431
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,440
Why are they doing this?

432
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,380
That was a nice bath.

433
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,470
I feel good now.

434
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,560
Oh, hello.

435
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,640
Mom, Shin Hyung's here.

436
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,430
Hello, everyone.

437
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,160
What did you bring?

438
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,850
I wanted you to each
enjoy a whole chicken.

439
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,850
Wow.

440
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,570
How have you been?

441
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,680
Oh my.

442
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,290
- She's changed her mind about you.
- It's about the scandal.

443
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,070
Even if it was resolved and all

444
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,410
it still makes me uncomfortable.

445
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,760
That's why I came all the way here.

446
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,340
Mom, don't be mad anymore.

447
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,750
- Wow.
- Wow, one, two, three, four chickens, huh?

448
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,210
Wow, there are four radishes, too.

449
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,570
You think I'd change my mind
over a chicken?

450
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,080
Good.

451
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,720
Men should always be careful
of women problems.

452
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Of course.

453
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,240
Mom, it's not like he cheated
on his girlfriend or anything.

454
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,480
That's enough, Mom.

455
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,110
- Girlfriend?
- Here we go.

456
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,250
Try it with some sauce, Mom.
Have a bite.

457
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,730
Say ah.

458
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,530
It tastes good at least.

459
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,940
- Isn't it good?
- It's so good.

460
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,250
It's just been fried, huh?
It's really good.

461
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,600
It's so good.

462
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,920
You didn't have to do that.

463
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,740
I'm glad that your mother
liked the chicken.

464
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,360
Anyway, about what I didn't
get the chance to tell you last time...

465
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,620
You said it was about the side dishes.

466
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,920
Ah, I said that, didn't I?

467
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,830
But the thing is...

468
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:41,580
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

469
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,710
I guess it's a dish
that's hard to make, huh?

470
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,520
It is difficult indeed.

471
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,340
But even if it's hard...

472
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,290
If I don't tell you now

473
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,670
I think I'll regret it
for a long time.

474
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,800
So...

475
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,900
I'm working up my courage
to say this...

476
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,240
What courage do you need
to talk about a side dish?

477
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,850
Tell me. I can make it.

478
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:23,340
Migratory birds follow
the wind to fly home.

479
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:30,990
An ocean follows the waves
to get to the horizon.

480
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:40,110
Stars follow the moon
to get to dawn.

481
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:47,270
I was thinking of
following the blue sky...

482
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:56,390
and go to the Milky Way...

483
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,080
Can I do that?

484
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,570
What side dish were you
talking about then?

485
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,200
Think about it.

486
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,120
Come to think of it...

487
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,380
the DNA match is too perfect,
don't you think?

488
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,610
What nonsense are you talking about?

489
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,480
No.

490
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,730
Even his walk looks the same
as my brother's.

491
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,070
Even the way he talks...

492
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,260
Even if he's his son,
his tone is like an old man.

493
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,640
Even his tone and accent
are identical.

494
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,740
Then what does this mean?

495
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,420
No matter how much
medicine has improved...

496
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,660
It just can't be done.

497
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,500
Is it a face-off, by any chance?

498
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,750
Seriously. Stop talking nonsense.

499
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,460
He said he was from Canada, right?

500
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,720
If it's Canada, wait a second.

501
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,750
That's where Manager Sung's
wife and kids are, isn't it?

502
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,900
That's right.
After Go Bong passed away...

503
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,090
he's been following
Choi Shin Hyung around.

504
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,600
That's probably because
he wants to keep his job.

505
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,850
By the way, what about that?

506
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,330
No, I was just saying...

507
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,480
- What?
- What is it?

508
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,530
My stomach...

509
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,670
Why is my stomach hurting?

510
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,280
Gosh, seriously...

511
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,720
I have nothing to say.

512
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,810
What took you so long?
Were you slacking off?

513
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,580
<i>Slacking off?</i>

514
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,740
<i>That's your specialty.</i>

515
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,650
I don't know about anything else,
but you need to be on time.

516
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,860
<i>Oh my, listen to yourself.</i>

517
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,110
Come over here.

518
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,160
First, empty the trash can.

519
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,730
Look at that dirty floor.
Wipe it clean.

520
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,480
Well, this desk here...

521
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,920
Organize all the documents.

522
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,070
You said you'd start from the bottom
so that you can stay in the house.

523
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,100
A promise is a promise,
so don't be too upset.

524
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,930
Yes,yes.

525
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,690
Of course.

526
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,600
When my late father hired me,
this is what he made me do, too.

527
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,700
Can you imagine how hard
it was to rise to this position?

528
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:25,190
It was all because our late father
wanted what was best for you.

529
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,300
<i>Give me your name and
identification number.</i>

530
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,060
451105...

531
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,910
I'm a Canadian citizen, and
my name is Choi Shin Hyung.

532
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,820
These are the DNA test results.

533
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,180
100 percent?

534
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,770
- Boo!
- You scared me.

535
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:11,200
- Are you free after work today?
- Yes, I am.

536
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,350
- I'll cook for you tonight.
- Cook for me?

537
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,780
- What are we having?
- Eel soup.

538
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,990
It's my mom's specialty.
I got her recipe.

539
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,800
- Do you like eel?
- I do.

540
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,860
I really like it.

541
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,660
Please go about your work.

542
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,870
You came.

543
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,740
What do you have under your nose?

544
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,350
Since when you started
to grow a mustache?

545
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,310
Oh my...

546
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,660
Wow, you're not bad.

547
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,590
- Oh my goodness!
- What do I do?

548
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,180
Pick them up.

549
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,160
Can't you do something?

550
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,500
Oh my, what do we do?

551
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,960
Oh my, what do I do?

552
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,660
Ouch! That hurts.

553
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,990
Are you okay?

554
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,830
Can you get up? Easy now.

555
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,230
Are you okay?

556
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,330
You seem to be in a lot of pain.

557
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,330
Let me see.

558
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,930
- Can I see it?
- Ouch.

559
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,040
You're such a crybaby. Here.

560
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,710
There.

561
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,000
- Ouch.
- You're faking it.

562
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,680
Can you lift it? Good job.

563
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,350
I always tell you
to be careful, don't I?

564
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,630
I said it was okay.

565
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,350
All done.

566
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,030
Here it is.

567
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,520
We end up having ramen.

568
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,130
Let me see.
It looks delicious.

569
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,050
It's hot.

570
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,190
Yes, go down further.

571
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,090
No, to the left.

572
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,380
Further down.

573
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,150
- Oh my.
- You missed it.

574
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,700
- Can I have more coins?
- I'm all out. Don't do it.

575
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,640
I really wanted to get
that stuffed dog.

576
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,350
This one is designed
not to let anybody win.

577
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,170
Let's go.

578
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,270
That stuffed dog...

579
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,240
Gosh, why wouldn't it work?

580
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,030
It looked like I was going to get it,
but it always drops at the end.

581
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,780
That's their business tactic.

582
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,140
You can never get it.

583
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,880
I'll buy you a truckful.

584
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,340
It's okay.

585
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,410
Here comes a taxi.

586
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,850
Get in.

587
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,190
<i>River Tumen...</i>

588
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:02,460
<i>the blue water...</i>

589
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:08,850
<i>A guy is rowing a boat...</i>

590
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:20,030
<i>I will think about my lover
from my past.</i>

591
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:28,780
<i>The boat that left with
my lover on it...</i>

592
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:34,700
<i>Where did it go?</i>

593
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,950
<i>My lover that I miss so much...</i>

594
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,190
Father!

595
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,590
Hello. What is it at this hour?

596
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,970
Dr. Kim came back.

597
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:16,240
He wants to meet with you right away.

598
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,390
Don't beat around the bush
and just get to the point!

599
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:19,830
How did it go?

600
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,030
Did you get to meet
the American doctor?

601
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,890
I did.

602
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,040
I listened and I learned.

603
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,170
So?

604
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,780
There is something I need
to confirm before we go on.

605
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,980
You said you took the pill when
you fell in the sinkhole, didn't you?

606
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,660
The pill?
Yes, I took whatever it was.

607
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,780
- Why?
- It might not have been the pill.

608
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,980
You may have consumed
a piece of meteor.

609
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,980
- Meteor?
- How is it related to him turning young?

610
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,970
When the accident took place

611
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,400
the head of the village
also fell into the sinkhole...

612
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,440
and he happened to consume
a piece of meteor.

613
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,850
Wait. Why is my cell phone in here?

614
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:51,150
<i>[Choi Go Bong has 25 days
to return the payment.]</i>

615
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,310
What is this?

616
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,440
<i>[Choi Go Bong has 27 days
to return the payment.]</i>

617
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,410
<i>[Choi Go Bong has 48 days
to return the payment.]</i>

618
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,160
Did you find anything
about Choi Shin Hyung?

619
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,040
There was nothing wrong
with his Canadian citizenship.

620
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,300
By any chance...

621
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,160
Isn't there a possibility of him
using someone else's identity?

622
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,360
Shall I send someone
to Canada to verify?

623
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,610
Do that.

624
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:26,440
Go find someone who might know him
and show them his picture to verify.

625
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,770
And find the graduation pictures
from his schools, too.

626
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,320
I will.

627
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,690
Hi, Eun Ha Soo.

628
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,600
Okay. What time?

629
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,230
Should I come by or
do you want to come over?

630
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,800
I'm not sure if it was captured
on the black box.

631
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,670
Play it.

632
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,010
It's ready.

633
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:11,130
- What on earth am I taking?
- Perhaps...

634
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:14,910
Perhaps was it really a meteor?

635
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:20,230
You took it. You swallowed it!

636
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,280
The power that cannot
be explained by modern science...

637
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,870
was hidden inside the meteor!

638
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,110
That's what the American doctor believes.

639
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:34,540
Man, I could have made a ton
of money selling those rocks then.

640
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,100
Shut it!

641
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,010
So what happened
to the village chief?

642
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,240
You're not going to hurry up
and give me an answer?

643
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,200
Do you want to see me out of breath?

644
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,630
Breath! He ended up dying!

645
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,380
He's dead?

646
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,910
On the morning of the 48th day
he turned young to be exact.

647
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:04,370
He couldn't wake up for good.

648
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,720
His physical appearance changed
back into an old man, too.

649
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,690
You said the village celebrated
for three months and ten days.

650
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,750
I was just exaggerating.
Seriously.

651
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:28,230
Anyhow, I believe the the power of
the meteor won't guarantee eternal life.

652
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,050
Wait.

653
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,300
How many days has it been
since you turned young, sir?

654
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,020
Then how many days
do you have left now?

655
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:52,360
- Dr. Kim.
- Yes?

656
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,920
I'll get you anything you need

657
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,600
in terms of expenses
for research and staff.

658
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:03,470
Can you find a way somehow?

659
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,940
I did receive the materials from him...

660
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:14,310
But I cannot give you a guarantee.

661
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,620
Look.

662
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:26,480
I... can't die like this.

663
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,060
I still have things left to do.

664
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,950
I found someone to take care of, too.

665
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,950
Please.

666
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,470
Please. I'm begging you.

667
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,820
Oh my, my sister is seeing
two men at the same time?

668
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,800
Man, she's good.

669
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,370
<i>[Shin Hyung]</i>

670
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,100
Hi, Shin Hyung.

671
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,560
My sister?

672
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,310
Where is she?

673
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,720
She's at the cafe.

674
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,900
Hello? Hello?

675
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,520
Gosh, I caused trouble again.

676
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,260
<i>[Choi Shin Hyung]</i>

677
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:55,690
- Here it is.
- Wow.

678
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,800
It finally made it back
into my hands.

679
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,220
How did you find it?

680
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,570
It was in my bag.

681
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,880
When I was looking for it,
it wasn't there.

682
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,080
It's enough that you found it now.

683
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,080
Come to think of it, everything
was going wrong while it was gone.

684
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,160
I should be the one to say that
everything went wrong after I lost it.

685
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,000
But it's that important to you?

686
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,060
This?

687
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,530
It's a keepsake from my mom.

688
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,780
Ah.

689
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,890
That's why.

690
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,710
When I got this

691
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,460
it was probably
the happiest time in my life.

692
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:44,000
My mom and I went to  see a meteor
shower together when I was little.

693
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,180
She got a piece of meteor then,
and made this pendent with that.

694
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:53,220
She said it would help my wish
come true or something.

695
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,960
And did you wish truly come true?

696
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,020
Not sure yet.

697
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,810
She really must be in there, huh?

698
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,900
It's amazing.

699
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:33,610
- Stop looking. You'll wear it out.
- What?

700
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,890
Here it is.

701
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,100
Shin Hyung...

702
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,990
What's gotten into you?

703
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,770
You asked me out on a date?

704
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,360
I was nervous that
you didn't give me an answer

705
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,750
when I proposed.

706
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:12,200
But I'm more nervous to see you now.

707
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,790
I'm sorry, Yi Gun.

708
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:19,010
Let's enjoy dinner first.
I'll get rejected later.

709
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,280
Yi Gun.

710
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,540
About the scandal involving
Director Choi Dae Han...

711
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,420
were you the one behind it?

712
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,080
I want to know what
your ultimate goal is.

713
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,260
You must have misunderstood.

714
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,010
I did that to find out who
Choi Shin Hyung really was.

715
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,790
- Choi Shin Hyung?
- He's using someone else's identity.

716
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,350
Is that true?

717
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:55,850
If he really was the late Chairman Choi's son
and Choi Dae Han's brother

718
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:59,030
I was curious how he would
handle something like that.

719
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:04,320
But he surprisingly acted like
Choi Dae Han's real brother.

720
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:11,930
I saw him for sure.
Where has he gone?

721
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,320
Choi Shin Hyung.

722
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,220
What are you doing out here?

723
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,280
If you came, you should've come inside.

724
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,860
I was just passing by.

725
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,800
You looked like you were
in the middle of a conversation.

726
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,010
Gosh.

727
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,190
- What is that?
- This?

728
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:59,870
It's a reed pipe.

729
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:02,280
Ah, a reed pipe?

730
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,170
When did you learn how to do that?

731
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,520
When I was in the army.
It was about fifty years ago...

732
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,440
- Pardon?
- No, nothing.

733
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,740
Director Choi is sitting inside.
Come with me.

734
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,740
No, it's okay.

735
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,890
Seriously.

736
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,060
You two are family now.

737
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,540
You just met your brother.

738
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,880
You two didn't grow up together

739
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,920
but you don't know how long
you'll be able to see each other.

740
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:37,720
Come inside with me, will you?

741
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:42,860
Eun Ha Soo, move away
from Choi Shin Hyung.

742
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:49,470
Director Choi, what's wrong?

743
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,890
He's... someone who will
eventually leave anyway.

744
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,670
Don't fall for him.

745
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,750
How can you say
something like that?

746
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,220
I have a good idea as to
who you really are.

747
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:12,050
- What?
- Am I right?

748
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,910
Chairman Choi Go Bong.

749
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,810
Father.
