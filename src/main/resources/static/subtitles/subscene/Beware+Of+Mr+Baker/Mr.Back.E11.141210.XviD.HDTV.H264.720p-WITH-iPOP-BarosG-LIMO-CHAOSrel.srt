00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mr. Back

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,170
<i>The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.</i>

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,940
<i>To the one who's given me
such precious memories</i>

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,880
<i>Again, I'm very grateful to you.</i>

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,570
<i>Thanks to Choi Shin Hyung,
I'm very happy now.</i>

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,020
<i>I wish this precious moment
would last forever.</i>

7
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,770
<i>[Episode 11]</i>

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,110
- Manager Hong.
- What brings you here?

9
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,210
Well, I just wanted to get some air.

10
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,450
How about you, Manager Hong?

11
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,490
They asked me to leave them alone
so they could talk about work.

12
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,150
Why do they look so serious?

13
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,330
See you around.

14
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,240
- Are you looking for someone?
- No, it's just that...

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,830
- Are you looking for Eun Ha Soo?
- Yes, I wanted to thank her...

16
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,440
As a token of my appreciation.

17
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,330
- It's just that she is...
- Where is she?

18
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,390
It's just that...

19
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,750
The interns are gathered
to receive their evaluations.

20
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,600
Why do they have to work this late?

21
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,730
I'll see you at the conference
room at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

22
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,090
Sure.

23
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,380
Excuse me...

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,460
Tomorrow morning...

25
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,290
What are you doing there?

26
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,180
I was just telling you to come to
the conference room by 8 a.m. tomorrow.

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,160
I got it.

28
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,420
When it comes to men...

29
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,190
it's all about their bodies,
not their money, huh?

30
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,680
Was that your favorite movie?

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,990
Yes, it's my favorite one.

32
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,480
The movie was in celebration of
two actors' engagement in real life.

33
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,520
Wow, that's romantic.

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,480
But they called it off.

35
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,000
Maybe there is no such thing
as happily ever after...

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,980
You and I can be happy forever then.

37
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,580
Forever?

38
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,940
Is there such a thing
as forever in this world?

39
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,890
Every moment adds up to become forever.

40
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,550
If we cherish this moment

41
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,060
it could last forever.

42
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,800
This is nice.

43
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,550
What is it that you wanted
to talk to me about?

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,120
It's okay, so go ahead.
I'm all ears tonight.

45
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,830
Then what you are about to hear

46
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,450
you should forget about it
immediately after you hear it.

47
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,980
I got it, so tell me.

48
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,060
And go.

49
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,470
- You like Eun Ha Soo, don't you?
- What?

50
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,800
Ah... you found out.

51
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,550
How much of your heart
has gone to her now?

52
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,640
Not sure.

53
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,790
What if you get hurt?

54
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,300
I already know that
she likes Choi Shin Hyung.

55
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,550
By the way, what do you think
about unrequited love?

56
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,500
If the other person doesn't
accept your feelings...

57
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,400
you'll just end up hurt
and broken-hearted.

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,510
If one is still okay with that...

59
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,320
then one can't stop those feelings.

60
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,190
Don't worry. I won't end up
with a broken heart or anything.

61
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,770
How do you know so much
about this topic?

62
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,130
Did you study about love through
textbooks or something?

63
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,410
- Pardon?
- I'm just kidding.

64
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,000
You're kidding?

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why do you think that I wouldn't
have those kinds of feelings?

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,890
Well, I-I'm sure you do.

67
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,690
You should have those feelings.
You're a woman.

68
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,100
I know that.

69
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,950
Did you know about my feelings
for you this entire time then?

70
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,230
W-what's wrong?

71
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,070
Are you pretending not to know,
or do you really not know about them?

72
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,670
You knew, didn't you?

73
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,140
N-no, I really had no idea.

74
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,870
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,720
You didn't know?

76
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,140
I'm sorry, but I'll get going now.

77
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,890
Please forget what I said tonight.

78
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,840
Aren't you tired?

79
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,840
I'm okay, but you must be, right?

80
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,900
No, I'm not tired.

81
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,080
- Then shall we play a game?
- A game?

82
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Starting now, we can only say sentences
up to five syllables long.

83
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,900
Do. You. Like. Me?

84
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,530
- Oh my, what do I do?
- 'Oh. My. What. Do. I Do.'

85
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,940
It's my turn now.

86
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,870
What. Do. You. Like. About. Me?

87
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,210
What? Very informal, aren't we?

88
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,630
Very. Informal...
you're good at this.

89
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,590
You. Are. Good. At. This.
You lose.

90
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,370
You. Should. Be. Happy.

91
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,800
Of. Course. I'm. Happy.

92
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,790
What. A. Great. Relief.

93
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,770
I. Don't. Have. A. Reason.
Why. I. Like. You.

94
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,400
Neither. Do. I.

95
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,980
I. Just. Like. Everything. About. You.

96
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,390
I. Have. Never. Felt. This. Way. Before.

97
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,130
Thank. You.

98
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,130
I. Feel. The. Same. Way.

99
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,790
Guess. It's. Not. Your. First. Time.

100
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,600
For. You. Choi. Shin. Hyung?

101
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,760
I. Will. Not. Tell. You.

102
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,490
Gosh, you're too much.

103
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,160
- Are you sleepy?
- No, I'm not.

104
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,370
I know that you are.

105
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,590
- What wish did you write down?
- Me?

106
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,610
- Well, that's a secret.
- A secret?

107
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,580
- I'll go and find out.
- No, you can't!

108
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,340
- Here we go.
- No, no, you can't!

109
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,390
It's over there! That one!

110
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,720
No, you can't!

111
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,400
So did you have a good time?

112
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,070
- Was the movie fun, too?
- Yes. You did well.

113
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,860
Of course, I did a good job.

114
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,240
Do you think I'd ever imagine
doing something like this for you?

115
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,210
By the way, what's with the face?

116
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,400
Did something happen?

117
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,970
I thought you would be overjoyed by now.

118
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,160
Overjoyed...

119
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,370
I'm so happy that I'm so scared now...

120
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,680
I feel like I'm standing on thin ice,
not knowing when it might crack.

121
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,760
Don't be so anxious.

122
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,830
Why worry about something
that hasn't happened yet?

123
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,940
Time is too precious even if
you were to live happily every day.

124
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:14,180
<i>Is there really such a thing
as forever in this world?</i>

125
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,180
Each moment adds up to become forever.

126
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,840
If we cherish this moment

127
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,100
<i>it could last forever.</i>

128
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,470
<i>[Movie ticket]</i>

129
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,660
<i>We watched a movie.</i>

130
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,460
<i>How do I look?</i>

131
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,600
Don't I look like Alain Delon?

132
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,280
Well, let me see...

133
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,570
you look nothing like him.

134
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,950
Nonsense.

135
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,310
Fine then.

136
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,920
<i>Actually, Choi Shin Hyung...</i>

137
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,340
<i>is far cooler than Alain Delon.</i>

138
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,860
- What is it?
- What?

139
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,560
No, I was just wondering if you
got back home okay last night.

140
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,780
- Of course.
- Ah, did you?

141
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,870
This won't be enough.

142
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,060
We may need something more special.

143
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,970
Didn't Choi Shin Hyung say last time...

144
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,220
that my late father prepared
a hidden card for Seohae Hotel?

145
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,430
Yes, he did.

146
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,620
Then he came to me...

147
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,720
and asked what demographic
we should target as potential guests.

148
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,460
So did you come up
with any answers?

149
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,960
We have prepared a folk dance lesson

150
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,590
to better serve our guests
here at Seohae Hotel.

151
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,850
I want you to learn how to do the dance.

152
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,080
I'd appreciate it if you could be
a reliable partner for our guests.

153
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,470
Please hold each other's hands.

154
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,510
Relax and...

155
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,680
One, two, three, four...

156
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,530
From this pose,
five, six, seven, eight...

157
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,200
Again. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

158
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Dae Han is surprisingly
working hard, isn't he?

159
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,070
It's the same here,
but if you do a half-spin...

160
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,960
He's even teaching the dance himself?

161
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,660
Put your hands out and cross them...

162
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,920
Like this, one, two, three, four...

163
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,370
Right here, to the side.
Five, six, seven, eight...

164
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,250
Whatever she does is beautiful.

165
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,760
One, two, three, four...

166
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,440
What am I supposed to do, huh?

167
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,790
- Thank you for your time.
- Don't mention it.

168
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,570
How can I just ignore it when
it's my late father's hotel?

169
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,950
Furthermore, so many employees' families
depend on this job.

170
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,080
How many employees
do we have in this hotel alone?

171
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,380
We all have to work together
for everyone to make a living.

172
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,560
To switch to Meditel

173
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,220
it will require a tremendous
amount of money right away.

174
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,900
If we spend the money and
there aren't enough guests...

175
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,830
We need a shocking headline.

176
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,300
One way to appeal to the elderly

177
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,600
is to make them feel like
they're at a cultural center.

178
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,170
You're saying to open up
our facilities to the public, right?

179
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,310
What's the point of properly
setting the table?

180
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,870
The food will go to waste
if no one will come and eat.

181
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:30,690
About my late father's
business plan for Meditel

182
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,630
I'll hand it over to Dae Han.

183
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,760
Have him go over it thoroughly.

184
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,700
It looks as if President Choi
revived Seohae Hotel.

185
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,430
It would be impossible
by Choi Dae Han's own efforts.

186
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,040
It seems that Choi Shin Hyung
is helping him.

187
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,250
Since when did they start
getting along with one another

188
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,260
that they would team up like that?

189
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,750
Isn't there a way to make them
turn against each other again?

190
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,930
It's men who conquer the world.

191
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,930
But it's women who move those men.

192
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,990
I'm saying that we can handle them
if we use one woman.

193
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,750
- You're saying that's Eun Ha Soo, huh?
- Bingo.

194
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,200
Wasn't it suspicious ever since
she applied to work at Seohae Hotel?

195
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,990
When no one wanted to go

196
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,620
she even convinced
her co-workers to go with her.

197
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,950
Well, among young people these days...

198
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,380
there something called,
'How To Win Over A Rich Man'.

199
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,610
- 'How To Win Over A Rich Man'?
- Yes.

200
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:46,000
The first step is to get a job
where the rich guy works.

201
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,330
She sure did get a job, didn't she?

202
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,090
<i>Second, whereas everybody
is crazy about him</i>

203
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,830
<i>she's the only one
who ignores him.</i>

204
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,360
Wait a second.

205
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,760
Who are you to ignore me?

206
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,780
- Thank you.
- That's attractive.

207
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,490
<i>Then the rich guy falls for her
that refreshing quality about her.</i>

208
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,990
You're the first woman
who has treated me this way.

209
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,690
Starting today, you're mine. Got it?

210
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,190
<i>Third, the woman always
slaps him in the face.</i>

211
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,260
Take that filthy hand off of me!

212
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,010
How refreshing.

213
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,870
You're the first woman
who treats me this badly.

214
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,970
<i>From that moment, the rich guy...</i>

215
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,470
Eun Ha Soo, Eun Ha Soo, Eun Ha Soo...

216
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,610
<i>- I'm sorry.
- He becomes her slave.</i>

217
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,750
Oh my, that's how Eun Ha Soo
seduced him then?

218
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,820
She looks so innocent,
but she's totally wicked, isn't she?

219
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,590
So what do you suggest
we do with Eun Ha Soo then?

220
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,100
We don't have to do anything.

221
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,200
If we just let her do
whatever she does

222
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,680
the brothers will turn against
each other on their own.

223
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,670
We'll just sit back and watch.

224
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,170
No, we should make her work for us.

225
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,170
- So we can use her as our spy.
- Will she go for that?

226
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,970
She'll find it easier to turn her life
around by picking one of the two men.

227
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,080
No, no, no!

228
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,100
President Choi.

229
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,710
Why is it so hard to track you down
to say thank you?

230
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,970
- Thank me?
- Yes.

231
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,750
I wanted to thank you for persuading
the other employees to come and work here.

232
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,710
Not at all. It's my job.

233
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,460
It's disappointing when you say
you were only doing your job.

234
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,180
You refused my necklace, too.

235
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,270
Actually, I...

236
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:31,130
those feelings that were
at one percent have grown...

237
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,310
I'm worried that they may become
100 percent one day.

238
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,490
I'm sorry.

239
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,410
But I hope that you would
get over your feelings for me.

240
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,720
Are you turning me down?

241
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,800
Actually, I like Choi Shin Hyung.

242
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,800
With Choi Shin Hyung...

243
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,230
I don't know how serious
it is between you two...

244
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:12,520
but I just wanted to let you know
that I have feelings for you, too.

245
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,340
I'm nobody...

246
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,430
I appreciate that
you think of me that way...

247
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,470
but President Choi, please consider
the other person's feelings as well.

248
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,900
You once told me...

249
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,780
When reality doesn't go along
with your feelings

250
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,590
you can make the reality work for you.

251
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,540
- About that...
- I can just make it work for my feelings.

252
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,520
Man, I'm hungry.

253
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,500
<i> The first assignment out of five is...</i>

254
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,910
<i>- going fishing.
- Going fishing?</i>

255
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,580
Actually, I like Choi Shin Hyung.

256
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,030
Honey!

257
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,290
Come on, wake up. You'll be late.

258
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,210
Give back the teddy bear.

259
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,540
Can you put it down?

260
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,680
Now can you change your clothes?

261
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,760
You're a good boy. How good.

262
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,570
Here is your jacket.

263
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,220
- You should come home early.
- Of course.

264
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,520
There's such a pretty flower
waiting for me at home...

265
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,050
I have never seen such a pretty flower
like yourself before.

266
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,090
You'll be late. Hurry up.

267
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,950
- Okay.
- Bye.

268
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,140
Brother-in-law, breakfast is ready.
Come and eat.

269
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,170
No, no way.

270
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,510
No way. Absolutely not.

271
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,950
- Where are you going?
- No need to know.

272
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,670
Are you going out on a date,
by any chance?

273
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,310
Are you going to see Eun Ha Soo?

274
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,650
Why did you want to go fishing?

275
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,540
I told you to think it through
and pick five things.

276
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,770
I did think it through.

277
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:58,690
- This is what I did with my late father.
- Ah, I see.

278
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,230
I wonder if Dae Han
has anything like that.

279
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,630
Oh my, what are you doing here?

280
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,400
Of all the fishing spots,
you picked this one?

281
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,050
I agree. What a coincidence.

282
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,880
- It's freezing.
- How can a young man think it's cold out?

283
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,350
Man, it's been a while.

284
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,780
By the way, who's better at fishing
between the two of you?

285
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,300
Of course, that's me.

286
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
What can he possibly know?

287
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,730
He only knows mackerel and cutlass fish
when they're on the dinner table.

288
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,570
Don't underestimate me.

289
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,730
I usually have no interest in this.

290
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,320
My late father never took me with him.

291
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,930
The rod is moving!

292
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,160
- Pull it.
- How?

293
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,740
- How, how?
- Move away.

294
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,550
- Let me.
- Wow, it's big!

295
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,860
Once you pull it,
you need to lift slowly.

296
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,470
Otherwise, it will escape.

297
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,320
- Oh my, this guy is strong, huh?
- Be careful!

298
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,100
- Wow!
- Jackpot!

299
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,710
- Here it is.
- Wow, it's a big one.

300
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,150
By the way, who caught this one?

301
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,380
- I caught it.
- I caught it.

302
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,940
What do you mean?
I held the rod right here.

303
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,950
If you held on, it would
have already escaped.

304
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,590
Oh my, then let's say
that I caught this one.

305
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,220
Carp!

306
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,160
Wow, that's amazing.

307
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,190
Okay then. Shall we taste it now?

308
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,640
It's so good.

309
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,440
It's delicious.

310
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,680
It's good, right?
Have one more.

311
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,530
It's my fish.

312
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,040
What do you think?

313
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,490
We'll choose the best of the best
for the merchandise.

314
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,540
- What's going on with Seohae Hotel?
- Not sure.

315
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,530
Dae Han won't be able
to do it by himself.

316
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,910
Are you saying Choi Shin Hyung
is capable enough to pull it off?

317
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,330
He's not the late Chairman Choi Go Bong.

318
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,470
Not only does he look like
my late brother...

319
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,650
but is it possible to have
his exact DNA, too?

320
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,030
How can he make this possible otherwise?

321
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,710
Excuse me.

322
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,270
What do we do?

323
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,910
Director Jung is very angry.

324
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,780
- I'm sure there is a way.
- We have to find the way.

325
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,410
If we had known things
would turn out this way

326
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,390
should we have joined the team
for Seohae Hotel?

327
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,400
Seriously...
That is so wrong.

328
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,430
Hey, honey.

329
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,140
What are you doing in my office?

330
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,980
We'll see each other often from now on.

331
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,490
Manager Hong gave him this office
because he helped out with Seohae Hotel.

332
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,710
It's time for you two
to get along.

333
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,110
We're getting along just fine.

334
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,450
Don't you think so?

335
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,310
As for how you're going
to handle Seohae Hotel

336
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,210
go and get me the reports immediately.

337
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,040
Something is buzzing here
on the Internet.

338
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,320
<i>[A premium outlet is moving into
Seohae Hotel's current location.]</i>

339
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,050
<i>[A premium outlet is moving into
Seohae Hotel's current location.]</i>

340
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,300
- What is it that you want?
- President Choi. Let go.

341
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,530
Are you destroying the efforts made
by all those people overnight?

342
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,530
It's not what I wanted.

343
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,560
- It's what the board of directors want.
- What?

344
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,470
President Choi, please stop.
You shouldn't handle this matter this way.

345
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,000
The decision was made for
the sake of the company.

346
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,500
It's not what I want.

347
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,220
You know at least that much, don't you?

348
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,500
Jung Yi Gun is really
a cunning man.

349
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:16,750
Choi Young Dal, Lee In Ja,
Choi Yi Hye, Jung Yi Gun.

350
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,100
Find out what they are up to right now.

351
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,790
Do you want me to look into
all of them on my own?

352
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,780
Of course you should.

353
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,760
Did you expect me to hold your hand
and come with you?

354
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,670
- Go now!
- Jeez.

355
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,280
Why do you boss me around all the time?

356
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,860
You can't stand to see me
relax for a day, can you?

357
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,880
I'm going.

358
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,040
What am I doing here
without eating?

359
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,690
I'm not a detective. I'm starving.

360
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,410
Why aren't these people coming out
after going in to see a fortuneteller?

361
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,860
How could you ask me
to come to a place like this?

362
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,580
Excuse me.

363
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,830
Are you here to find out your fortune?

364
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,340
Do you have to do that now?

365
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,810
No, it's just that...

366
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,560
The women that were just here...
what kind of reading did they come in for?

367
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,650
Hey, hey!

368
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,960
Doctors must keep
patient confidentiality.

369
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,270
Like reporters who
protect their informants

370
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:09,260
We, fortunetellers must also protect
our clients in the same manner.

371
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,760
If we go yapping about their personal lives,
we're done for in this field.

372
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,740
What's with the face?

373
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,220
- You have a lot of worries.
- Pardon?

374
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,580
Tell me your birth date.

375
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,660
Yes, the name is Choi Go Bong.

376
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,780
He was born on November 5, 1945, at 6 a.m.

377
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,780
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

378
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:46,000
Do dead people show up for
health check-ups these days?

379
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,090
How dare you bring information
of a dead man!

380
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,550
I don't want to see you. Get out!

381
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,360
He's already dead?

382
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,370
- Are you sure?
- Gosh.

383
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,550
What's the matter?

384
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,800
The mystery of the universe
is wrapped around his body.

385
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,360
He's been given a new life for free.

386
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,430
It's true that he came back
to life, isn't it?

387
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:32,550
It's a very precious time he should be
willing to trade for living 70 years.

388
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,810
However...

389
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,310
He should keep the time he promised.

390
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,560
What do you mean? Does that mean...

391
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,740
After the time he was given...

392
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,280
He'll die?

393
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,120
If he takes a rock from the universe

394
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,500
he'll return to looking like an old man
and die when the time comes.

395
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,190
If he doesn't do anything...

396
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,840
he's destined to die when
the time comes in his current body.

397
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,350
He doesn't have much time left.

398
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,020
What do I do about him?

399
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,740
Gosh, what do I do?

400
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,670
Why are you still here, huh?

401
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,930
Then...

402
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,580
There  must be some kind of
talisman to stop it, isn't there?

403
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,290
What did I say?

404
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,520
Gosh, why are you still here, huh?

405
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,660
You brought me information
about a dead man.

406
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,250
Get out now!

407
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,540
I was wrong, but...

408
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,220
- Give me an talisman to take care of it.
- I said get out.

409
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,300
- One talisman, please.
- Get out. I said, get out.

410
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,240
Just one talisman...

411
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,030
I said leave. Now.

412
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,910
How can he bring information
about a dead man?

413
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,390
What are you going to do?

414
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,620
I should let Choi Dae Han
handle it on his own...

415
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,840
even if he might end up
losing everything.

416
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,370
How can you say such nonsense?

417
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,450
If you're still around
at the crucial moment

418
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,960
as long as you don't collapse...

419
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,720
couldn't you take back
whatever it is?

420
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,650
Without me...

421
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:33,260
Dae Han has to learn to stand
in the ring on his own.

422
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,450
You've seen him all your life.
Don't you know that by now?

423
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,650
I know that you wanted
to raise him to be a lion

424
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,850
but he's not cut out for it.

425
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,810
He's too weak.

426
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,290
Even so...

427
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:49,440
He's getting stronger.

428
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,660
- And I'm getting weak.
- Don't say that.

429
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,140
And throw away the cell phone
and the texts.

430
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,850
- It's no use.
- What?

431
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,310
Do you know how nervous
I get every day because of those?

432
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,260
You don't know how I feel.

433
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,900
By the way, the fortuneteller said...

434
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,800
It's okay. I don't believe
in things like that.

435
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,160
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

436
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:24,910
I never knew how precious
each and every day would be.

437
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,430
Aren't you done yet? Let's go.

438
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,330
Stop damaging President Choi's reputation.

439
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,570
Ji Yoon.

440
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,020
How could you destroy
what we started like this?

441
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,860
I told you that you'd get hurt.

442
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,930
- I was against it for your sake...
- Yi Gun.

443
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,650
Are you really going to do this?

444
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,050
It seems that Director Choi Young Dal
contacted the board of directors.

445
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,560
I had no choice but to
go along with the majority.

446
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,010
Please help us.

447
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,210
I'll do whatever you want.

448
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,040
<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have 20 days
to return on your payment.]</i>

449
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,290
Who in the world is
sending these messages?

450
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,510
<i>[You have a message.]</i>

451
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,990
<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have 19 days
to return on your payment.]</i>

452
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,190
<i>[Please call me.]</i>

453
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,700
<i>Who are you?</i>

454
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,890
<i>Your second assignment out of five is...</i>

455
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,800
<i>to visit Eun Ha Soo's
favorite restaurants.</i>

456
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,360
What a simple-minded woman.

457
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,040
What is this? Your favorite place to eat
is a measly spicy rice cakes place?

458
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,060
What do you mean a measly
spicy rice cakes place?

459
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,620
This isn't just an ordinary
spicy rice cake.

460
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,360
It's a super hot dish that
relieves all of your stress.

461
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,590
- Super Hot spicy rice cakes?
- Yes.

462
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,280
- Let me see.
- What do you suggest?

463
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,690
You have to finish this dish
within three minutes.

464
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,470
Get ready. Set.

465
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,280
Get ready, come on.

466
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,040
Go.

467
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,920
Spicy! It's so spicy.

468
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,980
How can anybody eat this?

469
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,320
You pay for something like this?

470
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,480
It's free if you finish it
within three minutes.

471
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,340
Hurry.

472
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,820
Gosh, why do I have to do this, huh?

473
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,850
It's hot.

474
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,600
The last one.

475
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,330
Ma'am, I did it.

476
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,430
What is it?

477
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,040
You ate here for free a month ago
and you're back again?

478
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,750
You finished it nine seconds
faster this time.

479
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,160
- You finished in first place.
- Thank you.

480
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,400
I was in first place last time, too.

481
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,960
But are you usually that extreme?

482
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,920
Why? I still had spice rice cakes
for free, you know.

483
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,520
You're one of those people who would
chew bricks if they were free, huh?

484
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,880
No way. Bricks aren't tasty.

485
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,330
I can still taste the spiciness.

486
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,300
Here. You went to that place
again, didn't you?

487
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,410
Yes.

488
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,340
- It's self-service here, by the way.
- You seriously.

489
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,190
Go ahead.

490
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,260
After you eat something spicy

491
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,070
you should have something
sweet to calm your lips.

492
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,570
Gosh, that's not it.

493
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,860
If you do this, the chocolate will melt,
and it becomes sweet.

494
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,230
- Go ahead.
- Wow.

495
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,090
It's amazing.

496
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,010
- Choi Shin Hyung.
- Yes?

497
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,150
- You woman!
- You look like Charlie Chaplin.

498
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,170
- Come over here.
- No!

499
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,920
Why are they doing that again?

500
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,870
Come here.

501
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,280
Oh my, they make me itchy.

502
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,590
Is it gone? No?

503
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,420
What are you doing here?

504
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,220
I was just looking at this.

505
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:26,610
I made a tree with my father
just once when I was little.

506
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:33,420
That might be the first time
I learned what a Christmas tree was.

507
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,120
Ever since that time, I never once
decorated a tree with him again.

508
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,200
If I made one with my mother
and waited up for him

509
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,400
he wouldn't even look at it saying
he was too busy with year-end business.

510
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,620
He must have done that
because he didn't have the time.

511
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,120
He was responsible for his family,
but also his many employees.

512
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,330
He must have been.

513
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,980
I hope the deal about Seohae Hotel
won't trouble the employees.

514
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,590
You handled today's schedule quite well.

515
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,200
You're more confident in front
of the board of directors, too.

516
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
It's not that I couldn't.

517
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,270
Once I do it, I do it well, don't I?

518
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,730
We have a tight schedule tomorrow.

519
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,000
I canceled your dinner appointment.

520
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,920
- Why?
- It's your birthday tomorrow.

521
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,130
Whose birthday? Mine?

522
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,230
How time flies.

523
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,970
I wish you a happy birthday
ahead of time.

524
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,730
Don't buy me anything expensive again,
like a watch or something.

525
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,660
I'm grateful enough that
you remember my birthday every year.

526
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,950
You don't know what day it is, do you?

527
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,560
Today?

528
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,530
Not really. Is it Wednesday?

529
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,530
- This smells good, doesn't it?
- Yes.

530
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,760
Hey.

531
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,620
It's very moist. It's good.

532
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,510
Wow, it's nice.

533
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,640
Hey, should we buy this whole set
and share it?

534
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,430
Deal.

535
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,620
I'll buy it.

536
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,380
Cool, aren't you? It's good.

537
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,860
<i>[Pervert punk]</i>

538
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,870
One second.

539
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,040
- Yes, President Choi.
- It's me.

540
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,520
- Are you done for the day?
- Yes, I left the office a little while ago.

541
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,310
Did you?

542
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,250
Can you come by my house later?

543
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,260
What is it about?

544
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,510
You asked me to be considerate
towards other people...

545
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,850
so I'll be honest.

546
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:08,560
It's my birthday today,
so I wanted to invite you over...

547
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,320
I worked up the courage to call you
because it's my birthday.

548
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,240
Please don't stand me up.

549
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,200
What is it? What did he say?

550
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,760
It's his birthday, so he wants me
to come over. What do I do?

551
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,080
What do I do?

552
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,950
You can't not go when he invited you
to his birthday party.

553
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,920
Is that right?

554
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,890
Hi, The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

555
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,930
What? Dae Han did?

556
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:55,110
Ah, he did, huh?

557
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,850
Come over.

558
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,930
I get to see you,
so it's fine with me.

559
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,580
What misunderstanding?
I won't do that.

560
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:10,150
I'd be grateful if you could come over
and wish him a happy birthday.

561
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,650
You're here. Have a seat.

562
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,520
Thank you.

563
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,060
Thanks for coming.

564
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:38,190
I was worried that
you might not come over.

565
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,290
By the way, why are you alone?

566
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,070
Oh my, who did you say came by?

567
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,680
Dae Han! Dae Han!

568
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,330
- Happy birthday!
- Let's go party. Congratulations.

569
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,060
How can you stop by
without any notice?

570
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,880
We wanted to throw you
a surprise birthday party.

571
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,560
- Isn't that right?
- You're no help at all.

572
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,660
- Shall we go out?
- No, I'll leave.

573
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,540
Where are you going?
You're a guest.

574
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:28,910
Did you say your name...
was Eun Ha Soo?

575
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,110
Yes.

576
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,880
What do your parents do for a living?

577
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,150
My mother runs a tailor shop.

578
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,680
- My father passed away.
- Goodness.

579
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,490
Oh my, you were raised by a single mom.

580
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,580
Why do you ask such things?

581
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,860
A tailor shop?

582
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,040
- Is that okay with you?
- What are you talking about now?

583
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,770
If she were the one
whom you would marry...

584
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,770
Oh my.

585
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,950
Did someone just make
a wedding announcement?

586
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:01,600
Still, an intern isn't quite
good enough, you know.

587
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,030
Wouldn't there be such a difference
between households?

588
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,360
If you're going to talk about that,
please just leave.

589
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:13,580
It's up to me whether
I date her or marry her.

590
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,730
Oh my, you're already making
an official announcement?

591
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,480
They might end up getting married
at that rate, huh?

592
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,440
Enough. Enough!

593
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,000
Get up.

594
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:32,740
What are you doing?

595
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,570
Good night.

596
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,600
Wait!

597
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,980
She is my guest.

598
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,270
Let go of her hand.

599
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,090
A war is about to break out
between them.

600
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,500
We have a problem.

601
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,180
I said let go of her hand, seriously!

602
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,760
I want you all to leave.

603
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,120
You may not know this...

604
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,950
But Eun Ha Soo is a sly woman.

605
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,900
I can sense that she's a golddigger...

606
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,160
- What did you say?
- Shin Hyung.

607
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,640
- Be careful.
- Of course.

608
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,710
Bringing in a wrong woman
will ruin the whole family.

609
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,810
How long are you
going to live like this?

610
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,940
- How long?
- Oh, shit.

611
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,140
Eun Ha Soo.

612
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,510
I apologize if my family offended you.

613
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,420
That's not it.

614
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,430
I'm sorry.

615
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,350
Oh my, I'm sleepy.

616
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,140
What is it? Did something happen?

617
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,510
No.

618
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,960
It seems that President Choi is
very serious these days.

619
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,040
He seems really into you.

620
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,820
- That's not it.
- Eun Ha Soo, I envy you.

621
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,770
You're having a happy dilemma
between two rich men.

622
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,110
What do you mean, happy?

623
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,400
When he showed interest in me at first

624
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,900
I thought he was playing around,
so I didn't take it seriously.

625
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,540
He might have been sincere.

626
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,590
Did President Choi confess
his feelings for you or something?

627
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,600
He did, didn't he?

628
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,380
What do you do?

629
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,930
It's good to see them
working so well together right now.

630
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,290
What if I come between them
and ruin everything?

631
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,470
You just focus on your feelings.

632
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,680
How can I only think of myself?

633
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,160
They're brothers, not complete strangers.

634
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,100
Gosh, what do you do?

635
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,670
I really enjoyed
my birthday dinner tonight.

636
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:47,150
The seaweed soup this morning
was a bit bland.

637
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,550
Can you add more seasoning next time?

638
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,770
- What is it?
- We didn't make the seaweed soup.

639
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,240
Then who made it?

640
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,720
Choi Shin Hyung got up
early this morning.

641
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:05,190
He prepared the seaweed
and made the soup himself.

642
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,320
Why did you come here?

643
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,950
It's just that...

644
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:49,280
I wish I were unconscientious,
so I could ignore how Dae Han feels.

645
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,470
Aren't I worse in that department?

646
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,720
I like someone like you
when I'm a nobody.

647
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,170
What are you talking about?

648
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,330
I'm not saying this just because
your family hurt my feelings.

649
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:15,430
What I'm trying to say is...

650
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,860
that we should stop here.

651
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,220
What is his deal?

652
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:38,070
Why did he make me the seaweed soup?

653
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,440
What is that?

654
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,750
'My wishes.'

655
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,150
'Be happy every day.'

656
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,120
What's all this?

657
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,520
'Try to email.'

658
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:13,440
<i>[Try to parachute like my son.]</i>

659
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,480
<i>[Travel with my son.]</i>

660
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,200
<i>[Make seaweed soup on my son's birthday.]</i>

661
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:32,180
'Make seaweed soup on my son's birthday.'

662
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,160
Is it because of Dae Han,
by any chance?

663
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,710
That's not it.

664
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,650
I'm not someone your family
would welcome.

665
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,990
I thought I'd been living a good life.

666
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:08,070
Somehow, I felt lousy.

667
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:14,850
They're not wrong
in their words, either.

668
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,950
And what scares me the most is...

669
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:30,590
you two have just gotten close.

670
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:35,580
I don't want you to grow apart
because of me.

671
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:41,570
Choi Shin Hyung.

672
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:49,430
I want us to stop seeing each other.

673
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:57,180
Even if everything about me may be false

674
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:08,760
my sincerity and the way
I feel about you is real.
