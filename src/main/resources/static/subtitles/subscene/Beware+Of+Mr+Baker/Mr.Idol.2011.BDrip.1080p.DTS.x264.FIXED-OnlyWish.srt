5
00:00:50,775 --> 00:01:06,915
You say goodbye.
But your eyes seem painful...

6
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:18,091
So you wanna retire quite early.
Aren't you?

7
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:20,397
Ji-hoon.

8
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:23,998
What is this?
Do you love her?

9
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:26,712
You?
You and her?

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,705
You two will not be seen
in one place, you got it?

11
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:35,408
- Let's hear what they have to say.
- No!

12
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,323
It was a one-time thing.

13
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:40,816
It'll not happen again.

14
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:47,524
Ji-hoon!

15
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,926
Open the door!

16
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,644
Are you gonna let some girl
ruin your career?

17
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,268
I don't know.

18
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:06,875
This was my dream.

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,590
I've tried so hard for this.

20
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:15,786
But now I don't know.

21
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,587
Think about the other members.

22
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,589
And the stage.

23
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:27,204
It was all a lie.

24
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,308
He's not in a condition
to go on a stage.

25
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,601
- Give him some time and...
- And what?

26
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:37,704
You know the answer.
Just put them on stage.

27
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:45,714
Mr. Children's Showcase, 2008

28
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,203
MR. IDOL

29
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:58,524
Three years later

30
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,187
Welcome, O Gu-ju.

31
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,690
You're gonna find the bag
in the lost and found.

32
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:32,874
Hello, we're Wonder Boys!

33
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:37,477
We'll hold a showcase right away
after the audition.

34
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:41,592
Of course, the audition is part of PR.

35
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:43,676
Take off the headphone.

36
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:48,691
Spit the gum.

37
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:51,895
Get out.

38
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,911
We're Wonder Boys!

39
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:08,444
Where's Mr. Children?

40
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,147
I came to see them.

41
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:14,561
Sign this.

42
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,852
You'll be a director
and a shareholder.

43
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:22,355
We can't sell Mr. Children.
They're out of date.

44
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,570
Well, I totally understand.
You've been alienated for long.

45
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:31,766
It's gonna be much easier than
Mr. Children.

46
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:37,470
Just try half as hard.
Then I'll do the rest.

47
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:43,676
You mean Mr. Children
doesn't get second chance?

48
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:49,381
After you left, I had to work
my ass off for 3 years.

49
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:54,117
It was a nightmare!
Money doesn't grow on trees.

50
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:58,858
I can't make any money
with them.

51
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:00,826
It wasn't their fault.

52
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:03,031
So they didn't pay
bust-up fees.

53
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:07,735
Send me a document
proving the breach of contract.

54
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:11,105
From now on,
I'll work with Mr. Children.

55
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:16,279
It's losing game.
You're gonna be tapped out.

56
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:24,259
- Do as I say, it's better...
- No thanks.

57
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,156
I'll work on my own.

58
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:28,958
Are you throwing
down the gauntlet?

59
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,470
You didn't know?
I've already started the game.

60
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:39,769
Are you leaving for real?

61
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,780
Do you have a plan?

62
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:46,274
Find the members
and set an office.

63
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:50,377
Think again.
You could lose big.

64
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,781
Listen!

65
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:56,493
He's not the same man
you used to know.

66
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,620
Alright.
See you soon.

67
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,626
Yeah, see you soon...

68
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:07,528
But it's better for me
to stay here.

69
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:08,732
Hey!

70
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,833
You never listen!

71
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,549
What is that?

72
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:32,463
I don't know.
What should we do?

73
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:37,466
What's the problem?
Just take it with you.

74
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:06,796
Oh, my god.
I see a disaster and illness.

75
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:11,891
You can't change your fate,
but you can change the future.

76
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:17,196
You need a strong will
and preparation, right?

77
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,411
What kind of preparation?

78
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:24,913
Is it okay if I give you
some advice?

79
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,809
Of course it is.

80
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:37,416
It's not like any other insurance.
You only need to pay...

81
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:39,721
What are you doing?

82
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,027
How much do we have
to pay for nursery school?

83
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,329
How about home schooling
her myself?

84
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:50,031
Then she would have
even less friend than now.

85
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:53,944
I'll pay the bills, later.

86
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:55,338
Debt Repayment Reminder

87
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,839
You think about medical bills.

88
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:03,078
A suitcase?
Don't open it.

89
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,190
Why not?
I have to find the owner.

90
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,083
Your fate changes
once you open that bag.

91
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:12,886
It is? Then I really
have to open it.

92
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,004
I told you not to touch it.

93
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,898
I didn't open it.
It opened itself.

94
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:24,911
Eun-Seo?

95
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,012
She's not sleeping?
Let me talk to her.

96
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:33,908
No, she's sleeping.

97
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,393
Hello?

98
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:16,886
Did you steal my bag?

99
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,987
Not me.

100
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:24,102
Someone wants to talk to you.

101
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:30,198
The king lived here, right?

102
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:33,811
- Where are you?
- I'm going up.

103
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:37,714
You have to come up
some more.

104
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:38,818
More?

105
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:40,609
I think you'll be here.

106
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:43,112
Can't you see me?

107
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:47,615
No, nothing.

108
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:49,918
Put your hands up.

109
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,368
What the...

110
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,679
The bag!

111
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:36,398
Get the bag.

112
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,201
Me?

113
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:43,005
I can't.

114
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,919
Help me!

115
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,476
Hey, you got old.

116
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:24,588
I have two kids.
It's not surprising.

117
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:26,591
Oh, yes.
You got married again.

118
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:30,984
Yes, I did.
And they died.

119
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:32,388
Why?

120
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:35,889
Stop following me!

121
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,595
Where's the emergency?

122
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,301
There he is.

123
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,413
He's fine.

124
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:52,396
I told you to be careful!
I had a bad dream.

125
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,261
We're here.

126
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,181
My friend needs money.

127
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:36,693
So I bought it at a fair price
for quick sale.

128
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:41,187
You can sleep and work
in here.

129
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,202
You can do literally
everything in here.

130
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:47,895
You see, some years ago...

131
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,110
This was a room
for many champions.

132
00:15:54,444 --> 00:16:00,114
Hey, I understand.
This is one lousy office.

133
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,250
But the rent fee is so cheap.
You don't have money, right?

134
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:16,668
I like it.

135
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:26,883
Our next guest is JEONG lm-bok,
adopted to Canada in 1986.

136
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,810
- Thank you for coming.
- Hello.

137
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:36,582
If you have some memory
of that time, please tell us.

138
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:43,182
I remember a lamppost
in an alley.

139
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:47,088
I was three years old.

140
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:53,401
And I was playing with a girl.

141
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:55,898
Huh?

142
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,501
Ms. O?

143
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:16,160
I miss the time.
If you ever feel sad...

144
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:24,655
You want me to dance?
I can't even lift a baby for long.

145
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,162
Hyun, clean room no. 5!

146
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:31,855
What are you doing?
You lazy ass!

147
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:36,982
I want to dance again.

148
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,893
Stop it!

149
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:00,095
I'm sick of you.

150
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:07,736
It's over.

151
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,652
Jio.

152
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:23,561
Oh, you all came!

153
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:32,261
What's this place?

154
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:34,663
Do you do boxing?

155
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:41,009
No, it's for you.
It'll be a good dancing floor.

156
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:43,871
Do we have a lead singer?

157
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:47,775
A singer who will
dump us again?

158
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,080
Jio, don't say...

159
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:57,294
Anyway, I'm happy to
see you guys together.

160
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:03,318
Remember HWANG?
You'll perform in his show.

161
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,828
Have you talked to him?

162
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,460
No, you make an arrangement.
President PARK.

163
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:15,444
President PARK?
Who, me?

164
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,649
I handed in your resignation.

165
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,651
Letter of Resignation
O Gu-ju and PARK Sang-sik

166
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,053
You little...

167
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,477
President PARK?

168
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,350
A Cottage on a Grassland

169
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:35,662
I wish my words

170
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:48,279
stay in your heart
like an old picture.

171
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:50,172
Knock it out.

172
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,275
I'm having a conversation here.

173
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,180
We're going on an audition
this Saturday.

174
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:01,593
I feel good about it.

175
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:07,186
I bought your outfits.
Look, they're expensive!

176
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,990
So don't expect your back pay.

177
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:13,995
- No way!
- Hey, guys.

178
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:16,797
If you do well in audition
and become a star...

179
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,710
I'm giving you loads of
money.

180
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,402
Believe me boys.
You all wear size 100.

181
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:25,506
I mean, even your sizes
prove you're a team!

182
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,910
- You don't feel it?
- I don't feel it.

183
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:45,034
I'm a Ioner.
I'm a Ioner.

184
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:47,398
Don't you love me?

185
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:49,134
What I can do?

186
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,290
We're looking for boys.

187
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,092
Ok, but we'll just do it.

188
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:16,219
Mimicking

189
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,099
Will you marry me?

190
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:26,601
Where are all the good ones?

191
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:32,003
Mr. SA has set his audition
on the same time as ours.

192
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:38,519
I will not say
that I am sorry.

193
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:39,815
Next!

194
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:49,725
Are you the member?

195
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,416
I'm the manager.

196
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:13,991
What are you doing here?

197
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,784
Are you a team?

198
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:20,816
- We're the underground band.
- "Rebel Without a Cause."

199
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:22,501
Start.

200
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:47,011
I wish my words

201
00:22:48,258 --> 00:23:00,428
sink into you
and touch your heart.

202
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:03,866
Stop!

203
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:25,287
You want stronger beat?

204
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,999
Faster?

205
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:29,091
Solo.

206
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:34,286
We're okay.

207
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:44,613
The sound of a warm breeze.

208
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:51,108
Comes to me and comforts me.

209
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:55,315
I feel sweet.

210
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,318
Happy as in a dream.

211
00:23:59,863 --> 00:24:05,063
I can smile because of you.

212
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:08,863
Summer dream.

213
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:14,165
The sweet melody.

214
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,071
Feel your dream.

215
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:21,482
We will stay together.

216
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:24,578
It may break your heart.

217
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:28,181
It may bring you down.

218
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:31,384
But you have me.

219
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:38,588
We'll dream forever.

220
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:40,495
He's out of breath.

221
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:47,802
What a mantrap.

222
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:49,714
You suck.

223
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:52,906
Poor, rough and dull.

224
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:58,319
You're self-indulgent.
There's just your voice.

225
00:25:00,557 --> 00:25:02,247
But I can hear it.

226
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:06,452
You can't be a star
unless you work with me.

227
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,669
Only me?
Isn't it a band audition?

228
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:15,273
Why do you say like that?

229
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:16,765
We need a lead singer.

230
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:22,969
We need a singer
for a idol pop group.

231
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:24,582
I won't do it.

232
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,984
As you can see,
we are a band.

233
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,379
Hope you find the right one.

234
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:44,088
I'm going to take a train
and go to the countryside.

235
00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:47,604
You know, I always
wanted to be a farmer.

236
00:25:47,737 --> 00:25:49,707
Band without a bassist?

237
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:53,501
Are you leaving too?

238
00:25:53,643 --> 00:25:56,613
I had a job interview,
yesterday.

239
00:25:57,747 --> 00:26:02,337
My girlfriend wants me
to work at some company.

240
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:05,846
Her father runs it.

241
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:07,149
Come on!!

242
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:14,161
We rebel without a cause,
not betray without a cause!

243
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:30,472
Eat when it's hot.

244
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,010
Excuse me.

245
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:41,381
I don't understand.

246
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:46,294
Why is hers and mine
so different in quantity?

247
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:48,389
She's a regular.

248
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:52,003
I see.

249
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:10,648
Run as fast as you can,
little boy.

250
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:15,877
If you look back now,
you will give up...

251
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:30,572
He is a freelance worker
doing several jobs.

252
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:34,877
A coffee shop part-timer,
a chauffeur and a performer.

253
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:38,281
You know, he was
a trainee in Star Music.

254
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:43,784
SA wanted to make a band
few years ago, remember?

255
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,690
He was kicked out
for his bad attitude.

256
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:08,336
Caramel Macchiato.

257
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,743
Work with me.

258
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:24,653
Here.

259
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,269
You're born to be a singer.

260
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:32,371
How much?

261
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,562
Work with me!

262
00:28:36,406 --> 00:28:39,266
Hello, where should I go?

263
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:44,983
Miss...

264
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,975
Tunnel No.1.

265
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,277
Are you stalking me?

266
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,590
Stop following me around.

267
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:03,019
- Hello
- Eugene...

268
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,350
I'll pay the bills
at the end of the month.

269
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:22,143
I said I'll pay!

270
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,346
Alright, I'll talk to the director.

271
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:29,249
It will be better
begging for a mercy.

272
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:32,462
What?
You telling me to beg?

273
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:39,057
I don't like it, here.
Let's go to another hospital!

274
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,772
We don't have
anywhere else to go.

275
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:47,365
You should pay right now,
or leave the room, got it?

276
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,570
Please, I beg you.
Let it go just this once.

277
00:29:51,714 --> 00:29:52,984
24-months installment.

278
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,085
Who are you?

279
00:30:29,552 --> 00:30:31,522
I don't want your charity.

280
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:33,724
Are you always like that?

281
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:41,419
You are in a 24-month
contract with me.

282
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:49,927
I will pay back for 2 years
on bank interest.

283
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:51,332
Pay in a lump sum.

284
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,344
- Are you a loan shark?
- Yes, from now on.

285
00:30:55,678 --> 00:30:57,238
What do you want from me?

286
00:30:58,281 --> 00:31:01,981
You gonna make me a singer?
Can you promise that?

287
00:31:02,618 --> 00:31:05,278
Depends on you.

288
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:09,794
Star Music.

289
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:12,997
I'm gonna bust Mr. SA.

290
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:20,501
When the cool breeze blows,

291
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:30,799
please remember
that I was with you.

292
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,319
You are quite naive
than I thought.

293
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:39,713
They don't sell.
I just know it.

294
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:42,716
They're out of trend.

295
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:47,229
National television is not a joke.
It's not for some rubbish stuff.

296
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:50,433
The answer is no.
Do not speak!

297
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:53,828
You wasted my time.

298
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:13,778
I don't understand.
Why do we have to leave?

299
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:18,293
You are just not
what Koreans want now.

300
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,798
People don't want to
listen to your song.

301
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:30,713
Anyway, you have to accept
that you resigned voluntarily.

302
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,210
That's the most important.
You got it?

303
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:46,024
Is he coming or not?

304
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:49,315
I can replace him.

305
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:53,329
I practiced a lot
in my karaoke.

306
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,823
This is not the 80s.

307
00:32:56,966 --> 00:32:59,026
Boy groups should
have 4 members at least.

308
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:05,467
I quit.

309
00:33:19,522 --> 00:33:23,482
It's a gift.
Good luck with your business.

310
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:30,399
I dropped by just to
have a talk with you.

311
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:33,703
Forty minutes late.
4,000 jumps.

312
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:55,316
Good!

313
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,031
Go!

314
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,260
Go!

315
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,661
Go!

316
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:10,155
Faster!

317
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:29,382
Who are we?

318
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,885
A national team
for the Olympic?

319
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:39,490
I'm a national team
for Korean music!

320
00:34:46,442 --> 00:34:49,612
This is the first step of dancing.

321
00:34:49,745 --> 00:34:52,405
If you can do it,
you can do any movement.

322
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:56,408
You can't dance,
if you can't do it.

323
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,150
See? I can't do it.

324
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:08,753
Because I'm not an Idol.
But you should do it.

325
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:11,059
I'm a rapper.

326
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,061
Rappers don't dance.

327
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:17,164
Why do I have to do it?

328
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:20,066
- Is it hard?
- Yes.

329
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:24,069
I never give up.
I never stop.

330
00:35:24,213 --> 00:35:27,483
I'm a warrior.
Nothing can't stop me.

331
00:35:33,322 --> 00:35:34,582
He's a lousy dancer.

332
00:35:34,723 --> 00:35:37,693
You have a week to
make him dance like you.

333
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:01,548
I don't wanna be an Idol!

334
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:06,046
I want to go home!

335
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,860
Let me go!

336
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:11,252
Catch him!

337
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:21,461
Seaweed rice roll.
Pork sausage soup.

338
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:23,774
Roasted beef rib...

339
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:29,467
Want it so much...
Ricky is hungry.

340
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:12,344
- The waves...
- Again!

341
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:14,648
- For my dream...
- Again!

342
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,050
For my dream...

343
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,662
- Forever...
- Again!

344
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:29,864
Do it again.

345
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:34,866
The soft sound of the waves.

346
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:41,181
But your voice is sweeter.

347
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:53,487
Let's do the final rehearsal.

348
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,800
What do we do
after a final rehearsal?

349
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:02,629
Your debut.

350
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:05,931
Don't crease it unless
you wanna pay for them.

351
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:08,735
I borrowed them from
a designer boutique.

352
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:14,638
Don't look at the stars,
be one.

353
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,054
Who said that?

354
00:38:17,886 --> 00:38:18,846
I did.

355
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:43,075
Feel your dream.
We will stay together.

356
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:44,072
Cut!

357
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:47,273
Let's do it again.
Don't look at the camera.

358
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:52,076
- We will stay together.
- Cut!

359
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:54,191
Don't look at the camera,
will ya?

360
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:58,093
- Feel you dream...
- Cut, Cut!

361
00:38:58,327 --> 00:38:59,487
I said don't look!

362
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,828
Take a break.
Wonder Boys, come up.

363
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,526
Come back to me.

364
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,430
Their look and song are
really different from us.

365
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:14,243
I'm ravaged.
I'm ravaged.

366
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:18,036
Without you,
I'm ruined.

367
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:22,151
It's so hard to live
without you.

368
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:27,044
I am a fool
and I hate myself.

369
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:34,063
I'm ravaged.

370
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,759
Can we take a break?

371
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:40,661
- Okay.
- Thank you.

372
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:45,863
- Come on!
- I could have tripped over.

373
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:47,578
Do it properly.

374
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:51,972
What's your problem?

375
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:55,977
Hey, stop!

376
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,390
Let it go.

377
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:06,386
Guys, you're younger.

378
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:18,506
I can't believe my eyes.

379
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:23,112
They are real 'wild idols'.
Aren't they?

380
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:27,617
Let's go.

381
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:34,115
Pack your things.

382
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:37,118
What?

383
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,520
What about the show?

384
00:40:39,962 --> 00:40:41,622
You're not a team.

385
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:45,634
What do you mean?
They are a team.

386
00:40:45,968 --> 00:40:48,028
I won't let you debut
like this.

387
00:41:01,216 --> 00:41:05,276
Mom, do you remember me?

388
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:10,281
- I'm lmbok, mom...
- Are you separated?

389
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:14,988
- You surprised me.
- Looking for your mom?

390
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:22,401
PARK said I can find mom
if I become a star.

391
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,409
So have you written that?

392
00:41:27,142 --> 00:41:28,702
Then, make it into a rap.

393
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:32,506
You're good at it.

394
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:34,818
Mommy, remember me?
It's lmbogi?

395
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,110
No.

396
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:41,023
Mommy, remember me?
It's lmbok.

397
00:41:41,156 --> 00:41:42,206
Keep going.

398
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,929
Mommy, remember me?
It's lmbok.

399
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:51,933
I became a star for you.
I want to meet you.

400
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,228
What a moron.

401
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:24,291
One octopus is missing.

402
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:33,596
Thank you, Wonder Boys.
Brave Girls, please come up.

403
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:38,913
The winner of this week is,
Wonder Boys!

404
00:42:39,047 --> 00:42:40,107
Congratulations!

405
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:42,309
Now, you can perform
at the Music Festival.

406
00:42:50,659 --> 00:42:54,619
Mr. HWANG!
It's been a long time.

407
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:00,527
I was saying...

408
00:43:16,818 --> 00:43:18,178
Oh, you came early.

409
00:43:29,131 --> 00:43:34,301
A personal problem?
What do you mean?

410
00:43:34,836 --> 00:43:37,806
Star Music is doing that
because we...

411
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,800
Hello?

412
00:43:41,543 --> 00:43:43,913
Was it cut off, again?
Yes, I see.

413
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:48,106
So have you talked to
the producer? Hello?

414
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:53,521
You know Ms. O, right?
You can trust us!

415
00:43:54,156 --> 00:43:55,316
Hello?

416
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,430
Don't hang up!

417
00:43:59,761 --> 00:44:03,751
We have to pay for the rent.

418
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,159
My credit card is maxed-out.

419
00:44:06,802 --> 00:44:09,362
But we can't perform
in nightclubs for money.

420
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:19,280
Hello?
Oh, Mr. HONG.

421
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:27,076
Nightclub?
Oh, they can't.

422
00:44:28,023 --> 00:44:29,793
Can't do it.

423
00:44:32,928 --> 00:44:34,088
Hold on, please.

424
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:42,291
Please help me.
Please help me.

425
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:47,508
I have to earn a crust.

426
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:54,814
I have worked so hard.

427
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,810
I have tried so hard.

428
00:44:57,953 --> 00:45:03,653
We starved and pushed a car.
Is this what we get?

429
00:45:05,894 --> 00:45:10,464
You are nothing.
Just do what you're told to.

430
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:14,461
I need a toilet...

431
00:45:17,706 --> 00:45:18,966
What has he eaten?

432
00:45:25,614 --> 00:45:30,784
It's been so long.
My dear friend, PARK!

433
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,290
I'm happy to see you.
I didn't think you'd come.

434
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,386
Are you a back-up dancer?

435
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,289
Or a back-up singer?

436
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:49,502
No, she is a producer,
O Gu-ju.

437
00:45:49,738 --> 00:45:52,708
He's a friend of mine.
You remember?

438
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:53,901
A producer?

439
00:45:55,343 --> 00:45:59,613
I'm a singer-songwriter,
HONG Gil-dong.

440
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,039
Same as the hero.

441
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:09,257
We'll dream forever.
Summer Dream.

442
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,261
Let's take it to the top.
Close your eyes and imagine it.

443
00:46:12,794 --> 00:46:15,964
It's gonna be okay.
Hold back your tears.

444
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:19,258
Spread your wings
and fly high.

445
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,861
A bright future is
waiting for us.

446
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:26,466
Five women are standing here.

447
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:30,768
And the members of
Mr. Children are behind them.

448
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:35,372
The women have to
seduce their partners.

449
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:38,077
Start the music!

450
00:46:39,621 --> 00:46:42,991
Feel it, guys!

451
00:46:44,726 --> 00:46:46,786
You are doing great.

452
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:51,399
But this one is too old
to be children.

453
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:56,403
He hid his face with
a sunglass.

454
00:46:56,538 --> 00:47:01,028
Who will be the winner?
Yes, good.

455
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:07,647
Oh, she got water bottles.
Are you gonna pour it on me?

456
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,053
Oh, she's poured it
on herself.

457
00:47:10,185 --> 00:47:12,845
Why are you coming to me?

458
00:47:14,189 --> 00:47:17,849
Alright, good.
I am all wet.

459
00:47:17,993 --> 00:47:20,153
From now on,

460
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:24,855
show your best dance moves
for 10 seconds!

461
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,275
A CEO of Nightclub Middle-Aged.
Electrocuted.

462
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:44,887
My skin was burning...

463
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:47,681
Damn it.

464
00:47:51,726 --> 00:47:52,986
Mr. Children, boy group.

465
00:47:53,228 --> 00:47:56,888
I could smell
something burning.

466
00:47:59,034 --> 00:48:03,234
I saw him shaking, and...

467
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:06,633
Do you have something
to say?

468
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:26,652
You look better in television.

469
00:48:28,897 --> 00:48:35,167
Anyway, we made a TV debut.
Yo, baby.

470
00:48:53,722 --> 00:49:00,792
Why do they play classics?
I like Wonder Boys.

471
00:49:03,064 --> 00:49:06,634
Let's go to see them
when my hair grows.

472
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:12,541
We have a surgery next week.

473
00:49:15,176 --> 00:49:19,236
How about I ask them
to come here?

474
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:28,148
Alright, we will.

475
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:45,672
The soft sound of the waves.

476
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:47,667
But your voice is sweeeeee...

477
00:49:51,913 --> 00:49:54,783
What's the noise...

478
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,280
Speaker seems to be broken...

479
00:50:03,425 --> 00:50:07,585
I'm sorry.
Wait a second.

480
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:40,719
The Red Cross Medical Center

481
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:44,032
The soft sound of the waves.

482
00:50:44,466 --> 00:50:50,836
But your voice is sweeter.

483
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:54,442
Come closer.

484
00:50:54,776 --> 00:50:59,036
We will go together.

485
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:04,081
And make a dream come true.

486
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:11,281
The sound of a warm breeze.

487
00:51:11,926 --> 00:51:17,886
Comes to me and comforts me.

488
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:21,903
I feel sweet.

489
00:51:22,337 --> 00:51:26,397
Happy as in a dream.

490
00:51:26,741 --> 00:51:29,211
I can smile because of you.

491
00:51:33,948 --> 00:51:37,318
Summer dream.

492
00:51:37,652 --> 00:51:40,712
It's a sweet melody.

493
00:51:40,955 --> 00:51:42,415
Feel your dream.

494
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:48,217
We will stay together.

495
00:51:48,963 --> 00:51:51,523
It may break your heart.

496
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:54,526
It may bring you down.

497
00:51:54,669 --> 00:51:56,229
Center for the Sight and
Hearing Impaired

498
00:51:56,371 --> 00:51:58,341
But you have me.

499
00:51:58,473 --> 00:52:02,973
We'll dream forever.

500
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:05,381

503
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:18,283
Summer dream.

504
00:52:18,726 --> 00:52:21,786
It's a sweet melody.

505
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,600
Feel your dream.

506
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:29,102
We will stay together.

507
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,498
It may break your heart.

508
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,010
It may bring you down.

509
00:52:36,144 --> 00:52:39,114
But you have me.

510
00:52:39,247 --> 00:52:43,307
We'll dream forever.

511
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:47,011
Let's take it to the top.
Close your eyes and imagine it.

512
00:52:47,155 --> 00:52:50,415
Spread your wings
and fly high.

513
00:52:50,758 --> 00:52:53,918
It's gonna be okay.
Hold back your tears.

514
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:57,432
A bright future is
waiting for us.

515
00:53:10,011 --> 00:53:13,381
Summer dream.

516
00:53:13,515 --> 00:53:16,675
It's a sweet melody.

517
00:53:17,018 --> 00:53:18,378
Feel your dream.

518
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:24,680
We will stay together.

519
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,386
It may break your heart.

520
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:30,789
It may bring you down.

521
00:53:31,032 --> 00:53:34,002
But you have me.

522
00:53:34,135 --> 00:53:40,795
We'll dream forever.

523
00:53:44,445 --> 00:53:47,205
Summer dream.

524
00:54:10,505 --> 00:54:14,665
You have to be in school.
Are you playing hooky?

525
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:16,469
It's a lunch break.

526
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:21,983
Hey, look.
It's a rainbow.

527
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:23,977
You're right.

528
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:32,885
How about shaving your face?

529
00:54:33,928 --> 00:54:35,398
I can't

530
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,701
Why?

531
00:54:38,433 --> 00:54:41,303
It's a rocker thing.

532
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,754
I feel anxious.

533
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:06,760
Can't find peace of mind.

534
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:11,755
I think of you
all the time.

535
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:24,077
The sound of a warm breeze.

536
00:55:24,412 --> 00:55:30,782
Comes to me and comforts me.

537
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:34,579
I feel sweet.

538
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,093
Happy as in a dream.

539
00:55:44,932 --> 00:55:48,892
- Calm down, please.
- Stay away.

540
00:55:55,943 --> 00:55:57,413
Dad!

541
00:55:57,545 --> 00:56:00,705
You say you're a dancer?
You can't even dodge.

542
00:56:01,282 --> 00:56:04,552
You told me going to China
to be a tourist guide.

543
00:56:05,486 --> 00:56:09,546
If you're gonna be singer,
I'll never see you again!

544
00:56:22,904 --> 00:56:24,874
Why didn't you
give up music?

545
00:56:27,308 --> 00:56:30,968
After you got kicked out
from Star Music.

546
00:56:31,412 --> 00:56:35,972
- It's my dream.
- Dream?

547
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:40,489
Dreams never come true.

548
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:56,392
Are you always poker-faced?
You're a person, not a robot.

549
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,950
I'm a robot.

550
00:57:10,785 --> 00:57:12,745
I guess you haven't
had any relationship.

551
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:21,249
I've dated 5 Michaels
when I was abroad.

552
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,657
- I'm offended.
- You're lying.

553
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,860
People say...

554
00:57:30,004 --> 00:57:33,064
you hear a chime bell
when you kiss someone?

555
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:37,880
That could be
the death knell.

556
00:57:44,218 --> 00:57:45,978
Are you crazy?

557
00:57:49,824 --> 00:57:51,384
I can't feel anything.

558
00:58:25,393 --> 00:58:28,163
I really want Mr. Children
to come to my school!

559
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:41,667
Horse Chestnut Park

560
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,469
The most expected
boy group of the year!

561
00:58:43,611 --> 00:58:45,981
Mr. Children!
Summer Dream.

562
00:58:46,113 --> 00:58:48,173

The winner is,
Mr. Children.

571
01:00:24,645 --> 01:00:25,805
Cheers!

01:00:28,649 --> 01:00:31,519
31th of December.
The Music Festival!

573
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,930
It's a sweet melody.

574
01:00:43,064 --> 01:00:44,624
Feel your dream.

575
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:53,440
Those boys are too skinny.
Just like a skeleton.

576
01:00:57,979 --> 01:01:00,039
Can't understand them.

577
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:04,476
I can't understand you.

578
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,080
You haven't changed.

579
01:02:15,923 --> 01:02:17,583
I missed you.

580
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:20,386
Always.

581
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:28,290
I missed you, too.

582
01:02:30,738 --> 01:02:32,398
Mommy.

583
01:02:36,444 --> 01:02:38,614
Mommy, remember me?
It's Imbok.

584
01:02:38,746 --> 01:02:42,196
I became a star for you.
I want to meet you.

585
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:48,011
Where are you? I miss you.
Come to me. I'm right here.

586
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:51,215
Don't be sorry.
I'm here, look at me.

587
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,319
You're my life.

588
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:57,121
I miss you. I love you.
That's it.

589
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:03,866
Is that what you call
the long-waited reunion?

590
01:03:07,108 --> 01:03:12,168
I think they love
each other too much.

591
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,076
I'm sorry.

592
01:03:21,622 --> 01:03:23,892
I'm really sorry.

593
01:03:44,645 --> 01:03:45,605
What're you doing?

594
01:03:48,048 --> 01:03:49,108
Where's the others?

595
01:03:53,154 --> 01:03:55,714
You should've called me,
or go to a hospital.

596
01:03:56,157 --> 01:03:59,517
Just sitting here
like a child!

597
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:01,461
I'm fine.

598
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:21,674
Let me see.

599
01:04:23,717 --> 01:04:25,477
Didn't you know
it would explode?

600
01:04:27,621 --> 01:04:28,591
No.

601
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,383
They are things you shouldn't
put in a microwave.

602
01:04:32,526 --> 01:04:33,686
Shut up.

603
01:04:38,132 --> 01:04:39,392
When I first met you,

604
01:04:40,034 --> 01:04:45,704
you said you don't want to
perform or talk on TV show.

605
01:04:48,142 --> 01:04:52,102
But you look happy now.

606
01:04:52,246 --> 01:04:56,106
Hey, don't move.

607
01:04:57,251 --> 01:04:58,811
You'll get hurt.

608
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:07,748
You feel affection towards
something you touch or see.

609
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:11,757
Don't move.

610
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,763
Are they a couple?

611
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,266
Do you have time?

612
01:05:32,019 --> 01:05:33,079
Me?

613
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:48,701
Do you like me?

614
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,697
Yes, I do.

615
01:05:54,842 --> 01:05:59,112
You shouldn't.
We can't be a couple.

616
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:03,247
I like you as a fan.

617
01:06:11,992 --> 01:06:13,762
Well, in that case...

618
01:06:15,796 --> 01:06:17,756
One, two, three.

619
01:06:21,302 --> 01:06:22,772
Nice picture.

620
01:06:23,203 --> 01:06:26,873
My niece is your huge fan.

621
01:06:27,508 --> 01:06:28,768
Thank you.

622
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:32,469
No, thank you for
taking a picture with me.

623
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:38,065
Eugene, do you know?

624
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:43,491
You remind me of Ji-hoon.

625
01:06:45,526 --> 01:06:47,386
I do?

626
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:19,852
Mr. Children

627
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,070
That's what I love to do.

628
01:07:28,202 --> 01:07:30,072
You can't stop,
because I'm the truth.

629
01:07:30,204 --> 01:07:31,574
I just want to dance.

630
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:35,066
I have a bad cold.

631
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:37,770
But I'll try my best.

632
01:07:39,613 --> 01:07:41,273
Summer...

633
01:07:42,716 --> 01:07:45,776
But you have me.

634
01:07:45,919 --> 01:07:51,979
We'll dream forever.

635
01:07:58,332 --> 01:08:03,532
Poor, rough and raw.

636
01:08:05,172 --> 01:08:09,942
- What?
- But I can hear it.

637
01:08:11,779 --> 01:08:13,839
I will make you a singer.

638
01:08:14,481 --> 01:08:18,541
So everyone can hear it.

639
01:08:38,005 --> 01:08:40,765
Where have you been?

640
01:08:51,618 --> 01:08:53,678
- Get out.
- Why?

641
01:08:56,323 --> 01:08:58,093
You didn't want me
to see this?

642
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:00,485
- It's none of your business.
- It is.

643
01:09:00,627 --> 01:09:03,317
I think it has a lot
to do with me.

644
01:09:07,968 --> 01:09:11,228
- What do you feel about him?
- What?

645
01:09:12,172 --> 01:09:14,542
Am I a substitute
for KIM Ji-hoon?

646
01:09:15,976 --> 01:09:18,136
So you can feel better?

647
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,240
- Cuz I'm living out his dream?
- Shut up.

648
01:09:23,383 --> 01:09:27,753
Okay, I'll be KIM Ji-hoon.
I'll sing, dance and everything.

649
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,849
Then kill myself like him, right?

650
01:09:34,194 --> 01:09:41,574
I needed someone to replace him
and you were the right person.

651
01:09:43,203 --> 01:09:44,573
Do you know

652
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:50,678
what hurts me the most?

653
01:09:55,015 --> 01:10:00,575
That I was another
Ji-hoon for you.

654
01:10:04,224 --> 01:10:08,994
Eugene didn't exist to you.

655
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,500
- The winner of this week is
- Mr. Children, Congratulations!

656
01:10:24,645 --> 01:10:28,805
You won 4 weeks in a row and
earned a ticket to the Festival!

657
01:10:29,049 --> 01:10:34,109
It's time to say goodbye.
Thank you for watching.

658
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:40,819
Simon SA

659
01:10:55,776 --> 01:10:59,226
I am nothing
without you.

660
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:03,280
You broke my heart
but I wait for you.

661
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:06,677
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm out of my mind.

662
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:10,780
I just can't get over you.

663
01:11:10,924 --> 01:11:13,394
Tell me, tell me.
Oh why?

664
01:11:13,527 --> 01:11:18,587
I don't want to love
anybody.

665
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:21,502
Tell me, tell me.
Oh why?

666
01:11:21,835 --> 01:11:25,785
Please, come back to me.

667
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:29,699
I'm ravaged.

668
01:11:29,843 --> 01:11:32,113
Without you, I'm...

669
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:35,306
I'm ravaged.

670
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:43,110
This part is so difficult.
There're things you can't do.

671
01:11:46,059 --> 01:11:51,429
You turned a rocker to an Idol.
Well done, O Gu-ju.

672
01:11:52,366 --> 01:11:53,826
What do you want?

673
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:58,240
Star Music
Artist Transfer Contract

674
01:11:58,572 --> 01:12:02,472
If you play a game with me,
you will lose.

675
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:03,769
So?

676
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:08,780
They're doing great.
I mean Wonder Boys.

677
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:14,086
But they won't last long.
They are too fragile.

678
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:19,691
They don't have tenacity.
You know what I mean?

679
01:12:20,427 --> 01:12:22,287
Actually, they can't sing.

680
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:26,699
I was thinking about
making a visual rock band.

681
01:12:28,035 --> 01:12:31,095
Mr. Children will be perfect.

682
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,900
Hand them to me
when they hit the top.

683
01:12:36,543 --> 01:12:38,913
Those boys were mine.

684
01:12:40,247 --> 01:12:43,707
It's better for you
and the members.

685
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:47,811
Or will you run off again
after one of them dies?

686
01:12:57,764 --> 01:13:02,264
You can't even keep
a microphone with care.

687
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:42,701
You hold my hand
and stayed by my side.

688
01:13:42,843 --> 01:13:48,413
Now, I can feel
your heart.

689
01:13:54,654 --> 01:13:56,524
Eugene!

690
01:14:03,797 --> 01:14:05,257
Idol pop groups?

691
01:14:08,201 --> 01:14:09,261
Trash.

692
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,874
They are stupid.

693
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:18,667
I think music should
feed your soul.

694
01:14:18,812 --> 01:14:22,512
Eugene of Mr. Children.
His controversial remarks on Idols!

695
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:32,190
Mr. Children is temporarily banned
from TVshow programs,

696
01:14:32,325 --> 01:14:36,185
and it remains uncertain whether
they can be seen at the Music Festival,

697
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:38,299
the biggest K-pop event.

698
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:43,502
The agency 'Champion' hasn't
made any announcement yet.

699
01:14:49,843 --> 01:14:54,303
My boss blamed me for
losing ads because of this.

700
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:58,709
This video clip thing
is quite serious.

701
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:05,548
It's better for them to skip
this week's show.

702
01:15:05,692 --> 01:15:09,462
I'm verifying the video.
I'll take care of it.

703
01:15:11,498 --> 01:15:12,758
Give me some time.

704
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,160
O Gu-ju.

705
01:15:18,505 --> 01:15:19,665
I am sorry...

706
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:35,881
We gotta talk.

707
01:15:36,223 --> 01:15:37,193
Listen.

708
01:15:43,129 --> 01:15:44,189
What is it?

709
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,491
I didn't say that.

710
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:49,603
You didn't?
What a relief.

711
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:52,397
Then prove it.

712
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,810
I was just...

713
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:00,614
- I mean...
- Whatever you say...

714
01:16:00,747 --> 01:16:02,647
Nothing changes.

715
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:04,243
Go home.

716
01:16:11,992 --> 01:16:16,762
LEE Eugene was a singer
in underground band,

717
01:16:16,897 --> 01:16:19,157
when he took this video.

718
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:20,759
Whatever the reason may be,

719
01:16:21,301 --> 01:16:25,571
his thoughtless action has
disappointed many fans.

720
01:16:25,705 --> 01:16:27,865
And he caused trouble
to related people.

721
01:16:28,308 --> 01:16:32,268
Once again, I apologize
for his behavior.

722
01:16:32,412 --> 01:16:33,782
We'll take questions.

723
01:16:35,015 --> 01:16:37,175
Is it true Eugene will
drop out of the team?

724
01:16:37,317 --> 01:16:38,477
It's not true.

725
01:16:38,618 --> 01:16:41,278
I heard you're searching
for a new member.

726
01:16:41,421 --> 01:16:42,391
Not true.

727
01:16:42,522 --> 01:16:44,292
What about the
other members?

728
01:16:44,824 --> 01:16:48,284
Jio was arrested for
assault in San Diego.

729
01:16:48,428 --> 01:16:50,988
He was booked without
detention in Korea, twice.

730
01:16:51,131 --> 01:16:53,691
Ricky is an illegal immigrant
with double nationality.

731
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:57,103
Hyun has a girlfriend
and a baby.

732
01:16:57,237 --> 01:17:00,927
These things are their
private lives of the past.

733
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:06,644
People say that if the rumors
are true, they should break up.

734
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,350
There are so many
pop groups nowadays,

735
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:12,643
but many are unqualified.

736
01:17:12,786 --> 01:17:14,746
It's definitely a social problem.

737
01:17:15,288 --> 01:17:17,848
Music industry is
not a rehab.

738
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:21,861
Excuse me but that
sounds like an offense.

739
01:17:21,995 --> 01:17:22,955
You're right.

740
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:26,057
I agree with you.

741
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:31,661
So Mr. Children sang.

742
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:36,566
It was the only thing
they could do.

743
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:41,470
They sang, dance and mend
their hearts with music.

744
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,675
Music was their dream.

745
01:17:43,817 --> 01:17:46,177
Is that even relevant?

746
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,680
They can't make a
clean break with the past

747
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:55,094
But what they put in music

748
01:17:55,729 --> 01:17:56,789
It was real.

749
01:17:56,930 --> 01:18:01,330
Do we have to sit out the
whole play until one dies?

750
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:02,228
Bullshit!

751
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:03,839
What the fuck is this!

752
01:18:05,171 --> 01:18:06,931
You blaming us for all this?

753
01:18:07,173 --> 01:18:09,643
- You know nothing!
- Stop it.

754
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,340
Eugene.

755
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:20,945
I apologize for having
caused trouble.

756
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:26,448
This is all my fault.

757
01:18:26,793 --> 01:18:32,163
If the members can't
perform because of me!?

758
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:33,859
From now on,

759
01:18:35,902 --> 01:18:38,062
I will drop out of Mr. Children.

760
01:18:39,806 --> 01:18:42,666
You mean you'll stop
your career as a singer?

761
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:44,569
What about Mr. Children?

762
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:46,371
Tell us some more!

763
01:18:48,415 --> 01:18:49,465
LEE Eugene.

764
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:51,066
Eugene!

765
01:18:51,718 --> 01:18:53,578
Just a moment!

766
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:14,739
Wonder Boys records sales
hit 0.3 million.

767
01:19:43,203 --> 01:19:46,473
- What is this?
- Rainbow spicy noodle.

768
01:19:55,715 --> 01:19:56,975
The noodles are tough.

769
01:19:57,717 --> 01:19:58,977
I like it.

770
01:20:06,826 --> 01:20:08,686
So what will you do?

771
01:20:09,229 --> 01:20:13,289
People will recognize you.

772
01:20:15,335 --> 01:20:17,495
You said I should
take over the restaurant.

773
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:24,411
Are you going to cook
with that face?

774
01:20:25,044 --> 01:20:30,614
You have to feel happy
when you're cooking.

775
01:20:33,052 --> 01:20:35,022
If you cook with a smile
on your face,

776
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:40,717
the dish will be delicious
and the customer smiles!

777
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:44,420
Dad, smile.

778
01:20:51,371 --> 01:20:53,741
You smiled a lot
on television.

779
01:22:17,624 --> 01:22:22,494
You ran away like that
and end up being here?

780
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:25,900
I'll ask one thing.

781
01:22:27,433 --> 01:22:31,393
You don't want to be
Mr. Children anymore?

782
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:36,909
This place suits me better.

783
01:22:37,543 --> 01:22:39,103
That was our dream.

784
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:41,807
It was.

785
01:22:42,448 --> 01:22:43,708
Then do it.

786
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:46,110
It's not a dream, now.

787
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:53,815
And dreams never
come true.

788
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:13,171
Why are you leaving?

789
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:16,584
It's not your fault.

790
01:23:18,918 --> 01:23:22,788
You grew into a habit
of flying abroad.

791
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:26,985
Gu-ju.

792
01:23:28,027 --> 01:23:30,187
How about we train
another group?

793
01:23:32,332 --> 01:23:34,892
A girl group, this time.

794
01:23:35,435 --> 01:23:37,595
I manage and
you write songs.

795
01:23:41,841 --> 01:23:47,211
I don't want anyone
to be hurt, again.

796
01:23:49,849 --> 01:23:52,319
I don't have a reason to leave.

797
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:56,523
But I don't have
a reason to stay either.

798
01:24:03,096 --> 01:24:04,556
Wanna drink?

799
01:24:11,104 --> 01:24:12,774
- I have somethingl've got something!?

800
01:24:14,407 --> 01:24:16,267
You first.

801
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:21,980
We had a different life but
we understand each other.

802
01:24:23,216 --> 01:24:27,476
What does that mean?
What's your point?

803
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,490
Well, I want to say!?

804
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:34,786
Marry me.

805
01:24:36,329 --> 01:24:37,689
You wanna die?

806
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:40,690
Yes, I'm happy to die

807
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,995
If I can live with you.

808
01:25:17,804 --> 01:25:19,864
Eugene, it's me.

809
01:25:21,507 --> 01:25:26,967
Are you gonna be mad at me
for working on your song?

810
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:32,374
But you won't be able
to turn it off.

811
01:25:33,519 --> 01:25:37,979
I want you to sing again.

812
01:25:38,724 --> 01:25:42,184
And I want to hear you
singing this song.

813
01:25:42,628 --> 01:25:44,688
You, sad Rudolf.

814
01:25:46,632 --> 01:25:47,692
Hey.

815
01:25:49,635 --> 01:25:52,395
Go and find her.

816
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:55,799
She's waiting for you.

817
01:26:02,582 --> 01:26:09,252
I can hear you laugh
when I close my eyes.

818
01:26:09,489 --> 01:26:11,719
You were always
next to me.

819
01:26:15,495 --> 01:26:16,355
Eugene!

820
01:26:16,596 --> 01:26:21,966
Where's Gu-ju
and the members?

821
01:26:23,402 --> 01:26:27,362
They went to!?
I don't know.

822
01:26:27,507 --> 01:26:29,267
Gu-ju is in airport.

823
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:31,580
Hey!

824
01:26:35,615 --> 01:26:36,975
Eugene!

825
01:26:38,317 --> 01:26:39,477
Who are you?

826
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:42,489
- Delivery for O Gu-ju.
- For Gu-ju?

827
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:56,103
What are you doing?

828
01:26:56,636 --> 01:26:57,996
Hey!

829
01:27:04,277 --> 01:27:05,437
You wanna die?

830
01:27:05,578 --> 01:27:10,238
- I'll fall if you let me go.
- Stop it!

831
01:27:13,386 --> 01:27:17,046
Yong-su!
Please, I beg you.

832
01:27:20,893 --> 01:27:24,353
Eugene, bring Gu-ju with you
to the Music Festival.

833
01:27:24,497 --> 01:27:26,857
The members are coming!
You got it?

834
01:27:55,828 --> 01:27:57,388
What're you doin' here?

835
01:28:17,683 --> 01:28:26,563
When I was hurt
and shut my heart,

836
01:28:26,792 --> 01:28:36,462
you hold my hand
and stayed by my side.

837
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:43,772
I can hear you laugh
when I close my eyes.

838
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:50,280
You were always
next to me.

839
01:28:56,322 --> 01:29:05,032
This song is for you.
Can you hear me?

840
01:29:05,164 --> 01:29:11,634
Can you feel my heart?

841
01:29:12,772 --> 01:29:24,342
I will always be here
and sing this for you.

842
01:29:25,584 --> 01:29:34,154
The story that never ends.
The time that passes.

843
01:29:34,293 --> 01:29:42,863
A glimpse of your back.
I will sing for you.

844
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:00,879
I don't like it.

845
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,490
It's poor, rough and dull.

846
01:30:06,525 --> 01:30:07,985
Nothing glamorous.

847
01:30:09,729 --> 01:30:11,199
Gu-ju.

848
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:22,800
Where's my scooter?

849
01:30:33,853 --> 01:30:35,223
Hold on tight!

850
01:30:47,867 --> 01:30:49,427
Look at this.

851
01:30:54,173 --> 01:30:55,333
It's hilarious.

852
01:30:55,674 --> 01:30:58,234
What do you think
about Idol pop groups?

853
01:30:58,377 --> 01:31:02,577
Pop group?
They are so talented.

854
01:31:03,315 --> 01:31:06,875
What do you think about
copying other's work?

855
01:31:07,019 --> 01:31:08,989
I think they are trash.

856
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:16,392
Trash?
I just think it's unfair.

857
01:31:16,729 --> 01:31:21,099
I think music should
feed your soul.

858
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:23,103
You're a sweet looking boy.

859
01:31:24,136 --> 01:31:26,396
Thank you.
Next!

860
01:31:26,539 --> 01:31:29,699
We're Chocolat!

861
01:31:30,042 --> 01:31:32,912
Hello, we're Brave Girls.

862
01:31:36,348 --> 01:31:38,608
Let's have fun tonight!

863
01:31:38,751 --> 01:31:40,311
I love you, my fans.

864
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:41,923
We are so happy.
Thank you.

865
01:31:42,054 --> 01:31:44,524
We're Wonder Boys!

866
01:31:49,161 --> 01:31:50,921
Who is he?

867
01:31:52,865 --> 01:31:55,225
Are you a new trot singer?

868
01:31:55,367 --> 01:32:00,127
I am a CEO of
Champion Music.

869
01:32:00,272 --> 01:32:02,472
I want to say
Eugene is innocent.

870
01:32:02,908 --> 01:32:06,868
The video clip was proved
to be manipulated.

871
01:32:07,012 --> 01:32:08,982
So from today,

872
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:13,675
you can see Mr. Children
perform on a stage.

873
01:32:14,019 --> 01:32:15,079
Thank you.

874
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:17,591
Okay, that was...
unexpected.

875
01:32:17,923 --> 01:32:20,693
Do you have something else
to say?

876
01:32:23,529 --> 01:32:25,999
Why don't you guys
return my calls?

877
01:32:26,632 --> 01:32:31,702
Jio, Hyeoni, Ricky, Eugene!
This was your dream.

878
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:34,697
It's not too late.
There's a traffic jam.

879
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,210
So take the subway!

880
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:39,712
Hurry up, guys!

881
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:33,989
I'm always beside you baby.
You're my shining star.

882
01:33:34,633 --> 01:33:40,703
You were bad last night.
Where were you?

883
01:33:40,839 --> 01:33:47,299
I said bad things
and I regret it.

884
01:33:47,546 --> 01:33:52,916
I just hung up on you.

885
01:34:01,093 --> 01:34:03,653
They are not here?

886
01:34:12,104 --> 01:34:18,674
If they don't show up in 5 mins,
I get fired!

887
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:28,677
- Jio.
- Is it only you?

888
01:34:30,122 --> 01:34:34,892
- Hyeoni.
- Had to transfer

889
01:34:36,829 --> 01:34:38,189
Ricky!

890
01:34:42,534 --> 01:34:50,004
Now I can tell you
how I feel.

891
01:34:52,244 --> 01:34:59,514
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?

892
01:35:00,052 --> 01:35:06,862
Do you know
my heart belongs to you?

893
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:15,662
Now I know.
I miss you so much.

894
01:35:17,403 --> 01:35:22,773
The boy group of the year,
Wonder Boys!

895
01:35:42,127 --> 01:35:45,997
It's so hard when
you're not with me.

896
01:35:46,131 --> 01:35:49,691
I can't live.
Please, let me go.

897
01:35:49,835 --> 01:35:53,695
I don't know why
you're not with me.

898
01:35:53,839 --> 01:35:57,099
I can't forget you.
I just can't.

899
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:59,203
I'm without you.

900
01:36:00,145 --> 01:36:01,335
Will they come?

901
01:36:02,681 --> 01:36:05,841
Yes, they will.

902
01:36:07,186 --> 01:36:09,246
After the show.

903
01:36:35,814 --> 01:36:39,384
Take it off, stupid.

904
01:36:49,128 --> 01:36:52,588
Just feel the music.

905
01:36:55,934 --> 01:36:57,704
That's all you have to do.

906
01:37:00,973 --> 01:37:04,343
I'm ravaged.

907
01:37:04,476 --> 01:37:08,136
Without you,
I'm ravaged.

908
01:37:08,881 --> 01:37:12,651
It's so hard to live
without you.

909
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:16,735
I am a fool.
I hate myself.

910
01:37:21,894 --> 01:37:23,954
I'm ravaged.

911
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:32,462
Without you,
I'm ravaged.

912
01:37:44,116 --> 01:37:48,376
So much energy here.
It was Wonder Boys!

913
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,980
The next group is a rookie who
made so much issues this year.

914
01:37:54,126 --> 01:37:58,686
- I think I know.
- They are Mr. Children.

915
01:38:12,978 --> 01:38:17,538
Hello, I'm Eugene
of Mr. Children.

916
01:38:20,085 --> 01:38:22,545
I had a thought
on the way here.

917
01:38:23,589 --> 01:38:25,749
Actually, I'm from band.

918
01:38:27,092 --> 01:38:32,962
And, pop music was
not what I wanted to do.

919
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:39,660
But then I realized that
any music is great,

920
01:38:40,105 --> 01:38:45,165
if I can enjoy singing it
and also make you happy.

921
01:38:46,111 --> 01:38:51,481
The members and one person
taught me this.

922
01:38:53,018 --> 01:38:55,888
And I will sing for them.

923
01:39:09,868 --> 01:39:14,238
The soft sound of the waves.

924
01:39:14,873 --> 01:39:20,643
But your voice is sweeter.

925
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:24,850
Come closer.

926
01:39:25,183 --> 01:39:29,243
We will go together.

927
01:39:29,888 --> 01:39:34,548
And make a dream come true.

928
01:39:37,296 --> 01:39:41,666
The sound of a warm breeze.

929
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:48,660
Comes to me and comforts me.

930
01:39:49,107 --> 01:39:52,467
I feel sweet.

931
01:39:52,711 --> 01:39:56,981
Happy as in a dream.

932
01:39:57,215 --> 01:40:03,175
I can smile because of you.

933
01:40:04,523 --> 01:40:07,893
Summer dream.

934
01:40:08,026 --> 01:40:11,286
It's a sweet melody.

935
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:12,900
Feel your dream.

936
01:40:13,131 --> 01:40:18,691
We will stay together.

937
01:40:19,538 --> 01:40:21,798
It may break your heart.

938
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:25,400
It may bring you down.

939
01:40:25,544 --> 01:40:28,514
But you have me.

940
01:40:28,847 --> 01:40:35,217
We'll dream forever.

941
01:40:37,456 --> 01:40:41,716
Like the burning sun,

942
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:48,330
Like the shining star.

943
01:40:49,067 --> 01:40:52,527
I feel sweet.

944
01:40:52,871 --> 01:40:56,831
Happy as in a dream.

945
01:40:57,275 --> 01:41:02,265
I can smile because of you.

946
01:41:02,814 --> 01:41:06,184
Summer dream.

947
01:41:06,318 --> 01:41:09,578
It's a sweet melody.

948
01:41:09,821 --> 01:41:11,381
Feel your dream.

949
01:41:11,523 --> 01:41:17,293
We will stay together.

950
01:41:17,729 --> 01:41:20,289
It may break your heart.

951
01:41:20,432 --> 01:41:23,602
It may bring you down.

952
01:41:23,835 --> 01:41:26,895
But you have me.

953
01:41:27,139 --> 01:41:31,409
We'll dream forever.

954
01:41:31,543 --> 01:41:34,603
Let's take it to the top.
Close your eyes and imagine it.

955
01:41:34,746 --> 01:41:38,106
Spread your wings
and fly high.

956
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:41,410
It's gonna be okay.
Hold back your tears.

957
01:41:41,653 --> 01:41:45,113
A bright future is
waiting for us.

958
01:41:57,469 --> 01:42:01,059
Summer dream.

959
01:42:01,206 --> 01:42:04,366
It's a sweet melody.

960
01:42:04,509 --> 01:42:06,069
Feel your dream.

961
01:42:06,211 --> 01:42:11,771
We will stay together.

962
01:42:12,517 --> 01:42:15,077
It may break your heart.

963
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,490
It may bring you down.

964
01:42:18,723 --> 01:42:21,893
But you have me.

965
01:42:22,027 --> 01:42:28,587
We'll dream forever.

966
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:36,097
Summer Dream.

967
01:42:43,815 --> 01:42:52,685
Mr. Children!

968
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,680
Why did you fabricate the video?

969
01:43:23,822 --> 01:43:25,982
How do you feel
right now?

970
01:43:26,124 --> 01:43:35,694
I will tell everything
in prosecutors' office.

971
01:43:39,838 --> 01:43:42,808
When are you gonna
make me a band vocal?

972
01:43:42,941 --> 01:43:46,901
Depends on you.

973
01:43:47,245 --> 01:43:49,705
I can't trust you.
Tell me when.

974
01:43:49,848 --> 01:43:51,208
Shut up.

975
01:43:53,752 --> 01:43:55,312
Watch my bag.

976
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:30,881
Hello?

977
01:44:31,423 --> 01:44:33,293
Your bag just went in.

978
01:45:34,819 --> 01:45:42,189
When I was hurt
and shut my heart,

979
01:45:42,327 --> 01:45:50,497
you hold my hand
and stayed by my side.

980
01:45:50,635 --> 01:45:57,295
I can hear you laugh
when I close my eyes.

981
01:45:57,442 --> 01:46:03,242
You were always
next to me.

982
01:46:03,682 --> 01:46:11,752
I wanted to run to you,
wherever it would take me.

983
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:18,560
The world around me
have changed me.

984
01:46:18,897 --> 01:46:29,967
I could not tell you
the feelings deep in my heart.

985
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:40,181
I want you to feel it
with this song.

986
01:46:40,418 --> 01:46:47,878
I felt lost and
my mind was uneasy.

987
01:46:48,026 --> 01:46:55,986
My dream was so far away.
I could never touch it.

988
01:46:56,134 --> 01:47:02,734
I could not see
the star in your eyes.

989
01:47:02,974 --> 01:47:08,344
You gave me a strength.

990
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:17,251
I wanted to run to you,
wherever it would take me.

991
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:24,159
The world around me
have changed me.

992
01:47:24,295 --> 01:47:38,035
I could not tell you
the feelings deep in my heart.

993
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:45,080
I want you to feel it
with this song.

994
01:47:45,216 --> 01:47:52,486
Do you remember
that song?

995
01:47:52,624 --> 01:48:01,734
Your sweet voice
made me dream again.

996
01:48:01,966 --> 01:48:09,926
This song is for you.
Can you hear me?

997
01:48:10,074 --> 01:48:16,744
Can you feel my heart?

998
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:28,162
I will always be here
and sing this for you.

999
01:48:30,895 --> 01:48:39,055
The story that never ends.
The time that passes.

1000
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:46,684
A glimpse of your back.
I will sing for you.
