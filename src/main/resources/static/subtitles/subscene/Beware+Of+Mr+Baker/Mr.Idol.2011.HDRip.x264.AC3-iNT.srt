5
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:26,540
You say goodbye.
But your eyes seem painful...

6
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,700
So you wanna retire quite early.
Aren't you?

7
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,000
Ji-hoon.

8
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,600
What is this?
Do you love her?

9
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,300
You?
You and her?

10
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,300
You two will not be seen
in one place, you got it?

11
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,000
- Let's hear what they have to say.
- No!

12
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,900
It was a one-time thing.

13
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,400
It'll not happen again.

14
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,090
Ji-hoon!

15
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,500
Open the door!

16
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,200
Are you gonna let some girl
ruin your career?

17
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,830
I don't know.

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,430
This was my dream.

19
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,130
I've tried so hard for this.

20
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,330
But now i don't know.

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,130
Think about the other members.

22
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,130
And the stage.

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,730
It was all a lie.

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,830
He's not in a condition
to go on a stage.

25
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,130
- Give him some time and...
- And what?

26
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,230
You know the answer.
Just put them on stage.

27
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,230
Mr. Children's Showcase, 20O8

28
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,600
MR. IDOL

29
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,900
Three years later

30
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,530
Welcome, O Gu-ju.

31
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,030
You're gonna find the bag
in the lost and found.

32
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,160
Hello, we're Wonder Boys!

33
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,760
We'll hold a showcase right away
after the audition.

34
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,860
Of course, the audition is part of PR.

35
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,960
Take off the headphone.

36
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,960
Spit the gum.

37
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,160
Get out.

38
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,160
We're Wonder Boys!

39
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,690
Where's Mr. Children?

40
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,400
I came to see them.

41
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,800
Sign this.

42
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,100
You'll be a director
and a shareholder.

43
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,600
We can't sell Mr. Children.
They're out of date.

44
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:47,800
Well, i totally understand.
You've been alienated for long.

45
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,000
It's gonna be much easier than
Mr. Children.

46
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,700
Just try half as hard.
Then i'll do the rest.

47
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,900
You mean Mr. Children
doesn't get second chance?

48
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,600
After you left, l had to work
my ass o for 3 years.

49
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,330
It was a nightmare!
Money doesn't grow on trees.

50
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,070
I can't make any money
with them.

51
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,030
It wasn't their fault.

52
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,230
So they didn't pay
bust-up fees.

53
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,930
Send me a document
proving the breach of contract.

54
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,300
From now on,
I'll work with Mr. Children.

55
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,470
It's losing game.
You're gonna be tapped out.

56
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,430
- Do as i say, it's better...
- No thanks.

57
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,330
I'll work on my own.

58
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,130
Are you throwing
down the gauntlet?

59
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,630
You didn't know?
I've already started the game.

60
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,930
Are you leaving for real?

61
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,930
Do you have a plan?

62
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,430
Find the members
and set an office.

63
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,530
Think again.
You could lose big.

64
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,930
Listen!

65
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,630
He's not the same man
you used to know.

66
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Alright.
See you soon.

67
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah, see you soon...

68
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,660
But it's better for me
to stay here.

69
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,860
Hey!

70
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,960
You never listen!

71
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,660
What is that?

72
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,560
I don't know.
What should we do?

73
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,570
What's the problem?
Just take it with you.

74
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,870
Oh, my god.
I see a disaster and illness.

75
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,970
You can't change your fate,
but you can change the future.

76
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,270
You need a strong will
and preparation, right?

77
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,460
What kind of preparation?

78
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,970
Is it okay if i give you
some advice?

79
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,860
Of course it is.

80
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,470
It's not like any other insurance.
You only need to pay...

81
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,760
What are you doing?

82
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,060
How much do we have
to pay for nursery school?

83
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,360
How about home schooling
her myself?

84
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,060
Then she would have
even less friend than now.

85
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,960
I'll pay the bills, later.

86
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,360
Debt Repayment Reminder

87
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,860
You think about medical bills.

88
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,100
A suitcase?
Don't open it.

89
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,200
Why not?
I have to find the owner.

90
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,100
Your fate changes
once you open that bag.

91
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,900
It is? Then l really
have to open it.

92
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,000
I told you not to touch it.

93
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,900
I didn't open it.
It opened itself.

94
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,890
Eun-Seo?

95
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,000
She's not sleeping?
Let me talk to her.

96
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,900
No, she's sleeping.

97
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,330
Hello?

98
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,830
Did you steal my bag?

99
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,930
Not me.

100
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,030
Someone wants to talk to you.

101
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,130
The king lived here, right?

102
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,730
- Where are you?
- I'm going up.

103
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,630
You have to come up some more.

104
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,730
More?

105
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,530
I think you'll be here.

106
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,030
Can't you see me?

107
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,530
No, nothing.

108
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,830
Put your hands up.

109
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,260
What the...

110
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,560
The bag!

111
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,260
Get the bag.

112
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,060
Me?

113
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,860
I can't.

114
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,760
Help me!

115
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,300
Hey, you got old.

116
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,400
I have two kids.
It's not surprising.

117
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,400
Oh, yes.
You got married again.

118
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,800
Yes, i did.
And they died.

119
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,190
Why?

120
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,700
Stop following me!

121
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,400
Where's the emergency...?

122
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,100
There he is.

123
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,200
He's fine.

124
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,200
I told you to be careful!
I had a bad dream.

125
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,030
We're here.

126
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,930
My friend needs money.

127
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,430
So i bought it at a fair price
for quick sale.

128
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,930
You can sleep and work in here.

129
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,930
You can do literally
everything in here.

130
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,630
You see, some years ago...

131
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,830
This was a room
for many champions.

132
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,830
Hey, i understand.
This is one lousy office.

133
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,960
But the rent fee is so cheap.
You don't have money, right?

134
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,360
I like it.

135
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:45,570
Our next guest is JEONG Im-bok,
adopted to Canada in 1986.

136
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:45,690
- Thank you for coming.
- Hello.

137
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:55,270
If you have some memory
of that time, please tell us.

138
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,870
I remember a lamppost
in an alley.

139
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,760
I was three years old.

140
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:12,070
And l was playing with a girl.

141
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,560
Huh?

142
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,160
Ms. O?

143
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:34,810
I miss the time.
If you ever feel sad...

144
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:43,300
You want me to dance?
I can't even lift a baby for long.

145
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,800
Hyun, clean room no. 5!

146
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,500
What are you doing?
you lazy ass!

147
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,600
I want to dance again.

148
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,500
Stop it!

149
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,700
I'm sick of you.

150
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,330
It's over.

151
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,230
Jio.

152
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,130
Oh, you all came!

153
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,830
What's this place?

154
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,230
Do you do boxing?

155
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:59,570
No, it's for you.
It'll be a good dancing floor.

156
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,430
Do we have a lead singer?

157
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,330
A singer who will
dump us again?

158
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,630
Jio, don't say...

159
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,830
Anyway, i'm happy to
see you guys together.

160
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,870
Remember HWANG?
You'll perform in his show.

161
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,360
Have you talked to him?

162
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,000
No, you make an arrangement.
President PARK.

163
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,270
President PARK?
Who, me?

164
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,460
I handed in your resignation.

165
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,460
Letter of Resignation
O Gu-ju and PARK Sang-sik

166
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,860
You little...

167
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,300
President PARK?

168
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,560
A Cottage on a Grassland

169
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:54,870
I wish my words

170
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:07,470
stay in your heart
like an old picture.

171
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,360
Knock it out.

172
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,460
I'm having a conversation here.

173
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,360
We're going on an audition
this Saturday.

174
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,760
I feel good about it.

175
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,370
I bought your outfits.
Look, they're expensive!

176
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,160
So don't expect your back pay.

177
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,160
- No way!
- Hey, guys.

178
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,960
If you do well in audition
and become a star...

179
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,860
I'm giving you loads of
money.

180
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,560
Believe me boys.
You all wear size 100.

181
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,660
I mean, even your sizes
prove you're a team!

182
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,060
- You don't feel it?
- I don't feel it.

183
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm a loner.
I'm a loner.

184
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:04,290
Don't you love me?

185
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,260
What i can do?

186
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,400
We're looking for boys.

187
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,200
Ok, but we'll just do it.

188
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,330
Mimicking

189
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,200
Will you marry me?

190
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,700
Where are all the good ones?

191
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,100
Mr. SA has set his audition
on the same time as ours.

192
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:57,600
I will not say that i am sorry.

193
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,890
Next!

194
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,800
Are you the member?

195
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm the manager.

196
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,030
What are you doing here?

197
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,830
Are you a team?

198
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,870
- We're the underground band.
- ''Rebel Without a Cause.''

199
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,530
Start.

200
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:06,030
I wish my words

201
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:19,440
sink into you
and touch your heart.

202
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,860
Stop!

203
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,260
You want stronger beat?

204
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,960
Faster?

205
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,060
Solo.

206
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,260
We're okay.

207
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,570
The sound of a warm breeze.

208
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:10,070
Comes to me and comforts me.

209
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,260
I feel sweet.

210
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,260
Happy as in a dream.

211
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:24,000
I can smile because of you.

212
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,800
Summer dream.

213
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,100
The sweet melody.

214
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,000
feel your dream.

215
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:40,400
We will stay together.

216
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,500
It may break your heart.

217
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,100
It may bring you down.

218
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,300
But you have me.

219
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:57,500
We'll dream forever.

220
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,400
He's out of breath.

221
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,700
What a mantrap.

222
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,600
You suck.

223
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,800
Poor, rough and dull.

224
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,200
You're self-indulgent.
There's just your voice.

225
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,130
But i can hear it.

226
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,330
You can't be a star
unless you work with me.

227
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,530
Only me?
Isn't it a band audition?

228
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,130
Why do you say like that?

229
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,630
We need a lead singer.

230
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,830
We need a singer
for an idol pop group.

231
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,430
I won't do it.

232
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,830
As you can see,
we are a band.

233
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,230
Hope you find the right one.

234
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,930
I'm going to take a train
and go to the countryside.

235
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,430
You know, l always
wanted to be a farmer.

236
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,530
Band without a bassist?

237
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,330
Are you leaving too?

238
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,430
I had a job interview,
yesterday.

239
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,170
My girlfriend wants me
to work at some company.

240
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,660
Her father runs it.

241
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,960
Come on!!

242
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:32,970
We rebel without a cause,
not betray without a cause!

243
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,260
Eat when it's hot.

244
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,800
Excuse me.

245
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,160
I don't understand.

246
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,070
Why is hers and mine
so different in quantity?

247
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,160
She's a regular.

248
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,760
I see.

249
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:29,400
Run as fast as you can,
little boy.

250
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:34,630
If you look back now,
you will give up...

251
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,300
He is a freelance worker
doing several jobs.

252
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,600
A coffee shop part-timer,
a chauffeur and a performer.

253
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,000
You know, he was
a trainee in Star Music.

254
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,500
SA wanted to make a band
few years ago, remember?

255
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,400
He was kicked out
for his bad attitude.

256
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,030
Caramel Macchiato.

257
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,430
Work with me.

258
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,330
Here.

259
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,930
You're born to be a singer.

260
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,030
How much?

261
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,230
Work with me!

262
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,930
Hello, where should i go?

263
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,630
Miss...

264
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,630
Tunnel No.1.

265
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,930
Are you stalking me?

266
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,230
Stop following me around.

267
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,660
- Hello
- Eugene...

268
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,960
i'll pay the bills
at the end of the month.

269
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,760
I said i'll pay!

270
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,960
Alright, I'll talk to the director.

271
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,860
it will be better
begging for mercy.

272
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,060
What?
You’re telling me to beg?

273
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,660
I don't like it, here.
Let's go to another hospital!

274
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,360
We don't have
anywhere else to go.

275
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,970
You should pay right now,
or leave the room, got it?

276
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,160
Please, i beg you.
Let it go just this once.

277
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,560
24-months installment.

278
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,660
Who are you?

279
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,060
I don't want your charity.

280
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,260
Are you always like that?

281
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,970
You are in a 24-month
contract with me.

282
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:08,470
I will pay back for 2 years
on bank interest.

283
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,860
Pay in a lump sum.

284
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,860
- Are you a loan shark?
- Yes, from now on.

285
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,760
What do you want from me?

286
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,500
You’re gonna make me a singer?
Can you promise that?

287
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,800
Depends on you.

288
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,300
Star Music.

289
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm gonna bust Mr. SA.

290
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:39,000
When the cool breeze blows,

291
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:49,300
please remember
that i was with you.

292
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,800
You are quite naive
than i thought.

293
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,200
They don't sell.
I just know it.

294
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,200
They're out of trend.

295
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,700
National television is not a joke.
It's not for some rubbish studio.

296
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,900
The answer is no.
Do not speak!

297
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,300
You wasted my time.

298
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,230
I don't understand.
Why do we have to leave?

299
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,730
You are just not
what Koreans want now.

300
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,230
People don't want to
listen to your song.

301
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:49,130
Anyway, you have to accept
that you resigned voluntarily.

302
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:54,630
That's the most important.
You got it?

303
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,430
Is he coming or not?

304
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,730
I can replace him.

305
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,730
I practiced a lot
in my karaoke.

306
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,230
This is not the 80s.

307
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,430
Boy groups should
have 4 members at least.

308
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,860
I quit.

309
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,860
It's a gift.
Good luck with your business.

310
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,760
I dropped by just to
have a talk with you.

311
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,060
Four minutes late.
4,000 jumps.

312
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,660
Good!

313
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,360
Go!

314
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,600
Go!

315
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,990
Go!

316
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,500
Faster!

317
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,700
Who are we?

318
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,200
A national team
for the Olympic?

319
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm a national team
for Korean music!

320
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,900
This is the first step of dancing.

321
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,700
If you can do it,
you can do any movement.

322
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,700
You can't dance,
if you can't do it.

323
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,430
See? I can't do it.

324
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,030
Because i'm not an Idol.
But you should do it.

325
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,330
I'm a rapper.

326
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,330
Rappers don't dance.

327
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,430
Why do i have to do it?

328
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,330
- Is it hard?
- Yes.

329
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,330
I never give up.
I never stop.

330
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,730
I'm a warrior.
Nothing can stop me.

331
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,830
He's a lousy dancer.

332
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,930
You have a week to
make him dance like you.

333
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,760
I don't wanna be an Idol!

334
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,260
I want to go home!

335
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,060
Let me go!

336
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,460
Catch him!

337
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,660
Seaweed rice roll.
Pork sausage soup.

338
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,960
Roasted beef rib...

339
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,670
Want it so much...
Ricky is hungry.

340
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,500
- The waves...
- Again!

341
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,800
- for my dream...
- Again!

342
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,190
for my dream...

343
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,800
- forever...
- Again!

344
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,990
Do it again.

345
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,000
The soft sound of the waves.

346
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:59,300
But your voice is sweeter.

347
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,600
Let's do the final rehearsal.

348
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:18,900
What do we do
after a final rehearsal?

349
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,730
Your debut.

350
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,030
Don't crease it unless
you wanna pay for them.

351
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,830
I borrowed them from
a designer boutique.

352
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,730
Don't look at the stars,
be one.

353
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,130
Who said that?

354
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,930
I did.

355
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:01,130
feel your dream.
We will stay together.

356
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,130
Cut!

357
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,330
Let's do it again.
Don't look at the camera.

358
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,130
- We will stay together.
- Cut!

359
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,230
Don't look at the camera,
will ya?

360
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,130
- feel your dream...
- Cut, Cut!

361
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,530
I said don't look!

362
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,860
Take a break.
Wonder Boys, come up.

363
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,560
Come back to me.

364
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,460
Their look and song are
really different from us.

365
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,260
I'm ravaged.
I'm ravaged.

366
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,060
Without you,
I'm ruined.

367
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,160
It's so hard to live
without you.

368
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,070
I am a fool
and i hate myself.

369
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,060
I'm ravaged.

370
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,760
Can we take a break?

371
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,660
- Okay.
- Thank you.

372
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,870
- Come on!
- I could have tripped over.

373
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,560
Do it properly.

374
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,260
What's your problem?

375
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,660
Hey, stop!

376
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,060
Let it go.

377
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,060
Guys, you're younger.

378
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:37,170
I can't believe my eyes.

379
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,760
They are real 'wild idols'.
Aren't they?

380
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,260
Let's go.

381
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,460
Pack your things.

382
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,460
What?

383
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,860
What about the show?

384
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,960
You're not a team.

385
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,960
What do you mean?
They are a team.

386
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,360
I won't let you debut
like this.

387
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:24,600
Mom, do you remember me?

388
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:29,600
- I'm Imbok, mom...
- Are you separated?

389
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,300
- You surprised me.
- Looking for your mom?

390
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:41,700
PARK said i can find mom
if i become a star.

391
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,700
So have you written that?

392
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,000
Then, make it into a rap.

393
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,800
You're good at it.

394
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,100
Mommy, remember me?
It's Imbok?

395
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,390
No.

396
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,300
Mommy, remember me?
It's Imbok.

397
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,490
Keep going.

398
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,200
Mommy, remember me?
It's Imbok.

399
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,200
I became a star for you.
I want to meet you.

400
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,490
What a moron.

401
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,530
One octopus is missing.

402
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:52,830
Thank you, Wonder Boys.
Brave Girls, please come up.

403
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,130
The winner of this week is,
Wonder Boys!

404
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,330
Congratulations!

405
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,530
Now, you can perform
at the Music Festival.

406
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,830
Mr. HWANG!
It's been a long time.

407
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,730
l was saying...

408
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,360
Oh, you came early.

409
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:53,470
A personal problem?
What do you mean?

410
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,960
Star Music is doing that
because we...

411
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:57,960
Hello?

412
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,060
Was it cut o, again?
Yes, i see.

413
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,260
So have you talked to
the producer? Hello?

414
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,660
You know Ms. O, right?
You can trust us!

415
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,460
Hello?

416
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,560
Don't hang up!

417
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,900
We have to pay for the rent.

418
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,300
My credit card is maxed-out.

419
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,500
But we can't perform
in nightclubs for money.

420
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:38,400
Hello?
Oh, Mr. HONG.

421
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:46,200
Nightclub?
Oh, they can't.

422
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,900
Can't do it.

423
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,190
Hold on, please.

424
00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:01,400
Please help me.
Please help me.

425
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,600
I have to earn a crust.

426
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:13,900
I have worked so hard.

427
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,900
I have tried so hard.

428
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:22,730
We starved and pushed a car.
Is this what we get?

429
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,530
You are nothing.
Just do what you're told to.

430
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,530
I need a toilet...

431
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,030
What has he eaten?

432
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,830
It's been so long.
My dear friend, PARK!

433
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,330
I'm happy to see you.
I didn't think you'd come.

434
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,430
Are you a back-up dancer?

435
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,330
Or a back-up singer?

436
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:08,530
No, she is a producer,
O Gu-ju.

437
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,730
He's a friend of mine.
You remember?

438
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,930
A producer?

439
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,630
I'm a singer-songwriter,
HONG Gil-dong.

440
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,060
Same as the hero.

441
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,260
We'll dream forever.
Summer Dream.

442
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,260
Let's take itto the top.
Close your eyes and imagine it.

443
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,960
It's gonna be okay.
Hold back your tears.

444
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,260
Spread your wings
and fly high.

445
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:41,860
A bright future is
waiting for us.

446
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,460
Five women are standing here.

447
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,760
And the members of
Mr. Children are behind them.

448
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:54,370
The women have to
seduce their partners.

449
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,060
Start the music!

450
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,960
Feel it, guys!

451
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,760
You are doing great.

452
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:10,360
But this one is too old
to be children.

453
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:15,370
He hid his face with
a sunglass.

454
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:20,000
Who will be the winner?
Yes, good.

455
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:26,600
Oh, she got water bottles.
Are you gonna pour it on me?

456
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,000
Oh, she's poured it
on herself.

457
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,800
Why are you coming to me?

458
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:36,800
Alright, good.
I am all wet.

459
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,100
From now on,

460
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,800
show your best dance moves
for 10 seconds!

461
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,200
A CEO of Nightclub Middle-Aged.
Electrocuted.

462
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,800
My skin was burning...

463
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,600
Damn it.

464
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,890
Mr. Children, boy group.

465
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,800
I could smell
something burning.

466
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:22,130
I saw him shaking, and...

467
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,530
Do you have something
to say?

468
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,830
You look better in television.

469
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:54,330
Anyway, we made a TV debut.
Yo, baby.

470
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:19,930
Why do they play classics?
I like Wonder Boys.

471
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:25,760
Let's go to see them
when my hair grows.

472
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,660
We have a surgery next week.

473
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,370
How about i ask them
to come here?

474
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,260
Alright, we will.

475
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:04,770
The soft sound of the waves.

476
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,760
But your voice is sweeeeee......

477
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,860
What's the noise..

478
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,360
Speaker seems to be broken..

479
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,660

But your voice is sweeter.

483
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,460
Come closer.

484
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:18,060
We will go together.

485
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:23,100
And make a dream come true.

486
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:30,300
The sound of a warm breeze.

487
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:36,900
Comes to me and comforts me.

488
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,900
I feel sweet.

489
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:45,400
Happy as in a dream.

490
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,200
I can smile because of you.

491
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,300
Summer dream.

492
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,700
It's a sweet melody.

00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,500
It may break your heart.

496
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,500
It may bring you down.

You have to be in school.
Are you playing hooky?

525
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,300
It's a lunch break.

526
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,800
Hey, look.
It's a rainbow.

527
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,800
You're right.

528
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,700
How about shaving your face?

529
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,200
I can't

530
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,490
Why?

531
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,100
It's a rocker thing.

532
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,530
I feel anxious.

533
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,530
Can't find peace of mind.

534
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,530
I think of you
all the time.

535
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,830

Dad!

541
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,830
You say you're a dancer?
You can't even dodge.

542
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:23,660
You told me going to China
to be a tourist guide.

543
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,660
If you're gonna be singer,
I'll never see you again!

544
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,960
Why didn't you
give up music?

545
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:50,060
After you got kicked out
from Star Music.

546
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:55,070
- It's my dream.
- Dream?

547
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,560
Dreams never come true.

548
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:15,470
Are you always poker-faced?
You're a person, not a robot.

549
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,000
I'm a robot.

550
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,800
I guess you haven't
had any relationship.

551
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:40,300
I've dated 5 Michaels
when i was abroad.

552
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,700
- I'm offended.
- You're lying.

553
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,900
People say...

554
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:52,100
you hear a chime bell
when you kiss someone?

555
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,900
That could be
the death bell.

556
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,000
Are you crazy?

557
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,400
I can't feel anything.

558
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,130
I really want Mr. Children
to come to my school!

feel your dream.

575
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:12,270
Those boys are too skinny.
Just like a skeleton.

576
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,860
Can't understand them.

577
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,300
I can't understand you.

578
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,830
You haven't changed.

579
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,330
I missed you.

580
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,130
Always.

581
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:47,030
I missed you, too.

582
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,130
Mommy.

583
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,330
Mommy, remember me?
It's Imbok.

584
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:00,930
I became a star for you.
I want to meet you.

585
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,730
Where are you? I miss you.
Come to me. I'm right here.

586
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:09,930
Don't be sorry.
I'm here, look at me.

587
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,030
You're my life.

588
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,830
I miss you. I love you.
That's it.

589
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:22,570
Is that what you call
the long-waited reunion?

590
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:30,870
I think they love
each other too much.

591
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,760
I'm sorry.

592
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:42,560
I'm really sorry.

593
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:04,760
What're you doing?

594
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,260
Where's the others?

595
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:14,860
You should've called me,
or go to a hospital.

596
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,660
Just sitting here
like a child!

597
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,600
l'm fine.

598
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,790
Let me see.

599
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,600
Didn't you know
it would explode?

600
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:47,690
No.

601
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:50,500
They are things you shouldn't
put in a microwave.

602
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,790
Shut up.

603
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:58,490
When l first met you,

604
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:04,800
you said you don't want to
perform or talk on TV show.

605
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:11,200
But you look happy now.

606
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:15,200
Hey, don't move.

607
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,900
You'll get hurt.

608
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:26,830
You feel affection towards
something you touch or see.

609
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,830
Don't move.

610
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,830
Are they a couple?

611
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,330
Do you have time?

612
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,130
Me?

613
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,730
Do you like me?

614
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,730
Yes, i do.

615
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:18,130
You shouldn't.
We can't be a couple.

616
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,260
I like you as a fan.

617
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,760
Well, in that case...

618
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,760
One, two, three.

619
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:41,760
Nice picture.

620
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,870
My niece is your huge fan.

621
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:47,760
Thank you.

622
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:51,460
No, thank you for
taking a picture with me.

623
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:57,060
Eugene, do you know?

624
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:02,460
You remind me of Ji-hoon.

625
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,360
I do?

626
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:38,790
Mr. Children

627
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,000
That's what i love to do.

628
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,000
You can't stop,
because i'm the truth.

629
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,500
I just want to dance.

630
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,000
I have a bad cold.

631
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,690
But i'll try my best.

632
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,200
Summer...

633
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,700
But you have me.

634
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:10,900
We'll dream forever.

635
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:22,430
Poor, rough and raw.

636
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,830
- What?
- But i can hear it.

637
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,730
I will make you a singer.

638
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,430
So everyone can hear it.

639
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:59,630
Where have you been?

640
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,530
- Get out.
- Why?

641
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,930
You didn't want me
to see this?

642
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,330
- It's none of your business.
- It is.

643
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,160
I think it has a lot
to do with me.

644
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:30,060
- What do you feel about him?
- What?

645
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:33,360
Am i a substitute
for KIM Ji-hoon?

646
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,960
So you can feel better?

647
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:42,060
- Coz i'm living out his dream?
- Shut up.

648
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,570
Okay, i'll be KIM Ji-hoon.
i'll sing, dance and everything.

649
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,660
Then kill myself like him, right?

650
01:09:52,990 --> 01:10:00,370
I needed someone to replace him
and you were the right person.

651
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,360
Do you know

652
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:09,460
what hurts me the most?

653
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:19,370
That i was another
Ji-hoon for you.

654
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:27,770
Eugene didn't exist to you.

655
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:43,270
- The winner of this week is
- Mr. Children, Congratulations!

656
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:47,560
You won 4 weeks in a row and
earned a ticket to the Festival!

657
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:52,870
It's time to say goodbye.
Thank you for watching.

658
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,560
Simon SA

659
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:17,960
I am nothing
without you.

660
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:22,000
You broke my heart
but i wait for you.

661
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:25,400
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm out of my mind.

662
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:29,500
I just can't get over you.

663
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:32,100
Tell me, tell me.
Oh why

664
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:37,300
I don't want to love
anybody.

665
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:40,200
Tell me, tell me.
Oh why

666
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:44,500
Please, come back to me.

667
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:48,400
I'm ravaged.

668
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,800
Without you, i'm...

669
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:54,000
I'm ravaged.

670
01:11:55,730 --> 01:12:01,800
This part is so difficult.
There're things you can't do.

671
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:10,600
You turned a rocker to an Idol.
Well done, O Gu-ju.

672
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:13,200
What do you want?

673
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:17,600
Star Music
Artist Transfer Contract

674
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:21,830
If you play a game with me,
you will lose.

675
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,130
So?

676
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:28,130
They're doing great.
I mean Wonder Boys.

677
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:33,430
But they won't last long.
They are too fragile.

678
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:39,030
They don't have tenacity.
You know what i mean?

679
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,630
Actually, they can't sing.

680
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,030
I was thinking about
making a visual rock band.

681
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,430
Mr. Children will be perfect.

682
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,230
Hand them to me
when they hit the top.

683
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,230
Those boys were mine.

684
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,030
It's better for you
and the members.

685
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,130
Or will you run o again
after one of them dies?

686
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,560
You can't even keep
a microphone with care.

687
01:13:50,490 --> 01:14:01,970
You hold my hand
and stayed by my side.

688
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:07,670
Now, i can feel
your heart.

689
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,760
Eugene!

690
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:24,500
Idol pop groups?

691
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,490
Trash.

692
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,100
They are stupid.

693
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:37,900
I think music should
feed your soul.

694
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:41,730
Eugene of Mr. Children.
His controversial remarks on Idols!

695
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:51,400
Mr. Children is temporarily banned
from TV show programs,

696
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:55,400
and it remains uncertain whether
they can be seen at the Music festival,

697
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,500
the biggest K-pop event.

698
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:02,700
The agency 'Champion' hasn't
made any announcement yet.

699
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:13,500
My boss blamed me for
losing ads because of this.

700
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,900
This video clip thing
is quite serious.

701
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:24,730
It's better for them to skip
this week's show.

702
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:28,630
I'm verifying the video.
I'll take care of it.

703
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:31,930
Give me some time.

704
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,330
O Gu-ju.

705
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,830
I am sorry...

706
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,030
We have to talk.

707
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,330
Listen.

708
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,330
What is it?

709
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,630
I didn't say that.

710
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,730
You didn't?
What a relief.

711
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,530
Then prove it.

712
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:13,930
I was just...

713
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,730
- I mean...
- Whatever you say...

714
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,760
Nothing changes.

715
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:23,360
Go home.

716
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:35,870
LEE Eugene was a singer
in underground band,

717
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,260
when he took this video.

718
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:39,860
Whatever the reason may be,

719
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:44,660
his thoughtless action has
disappointed many fans.

720
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:46,960
And he caused trouble
to related people.

721
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:51,360
Once again, i apologize
for his behavior.

722
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:52,860
We'll take questions.

723
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,260
Is it true Eugene will
drop out of the team?

724
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:57,560
It's not true.

725
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:00,360
I heard you're searching
for a new member.

726
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,460
Not true.

727
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,360
What about the
other members?

728
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:07,370
Jio was arrested for
assault in San Diego.

729
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:10,060
He was booked without
detention in Korea, twice.

730
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,760
Ricky is an illegal immigrant
with double nationality.

731
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:16,160
Hyun has a girlfriend
and a baby.

732
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:20,000
These things are their
private lives of the past.

733
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:25,700
People say that if the rumors
are true, they should break up.

734
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,400
There are so many
pop groups nowadays,

735
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:31,700
but many are unqualified.

736
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:33,800
lt's definitely a social problem.

737
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:36,900
Music industry is
not a rehab.

738
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:40,900
Excuse me but that
sounds like an offense.

739
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,990
You're right.

740
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,100
I agree with you.

741
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:50,700
So Mr. Children sang.

742
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:55,600
lt was the only thing
they could do.

743
01:17:56,030 --> 01:18:00,500
They sang, dance and mend
their hearts with music.

744
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:02,700
Music was their dream.

745
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:05,200
Is that even relevant?

746
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:09,700
They can't make a
clean break with the past

747
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:14,100
But what they put in music

748
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:15,800
It was real.

749
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:20,330
Do we have to sit out the
whole play until one dies?

750
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,230
Bullshit!

751
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,830
What the fuck is this!

752
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,930
You blaming us for all this?

753
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,630
- You know nothing!
- Stop it.

754
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,330
Eugene.

755
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,930
I apologize for having
caused trouble.

756
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,430
This is all my fault.

757
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:51,130
If the members can't
perform because of me?

758
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:52,830
From now on,

759
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,030
I will drop out of Mr. Children.

760
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,630
You mean you'll stop
your career as a singer?

761
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,530
What about Mr. Children?

762
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,330
Tell us some more!

763
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,430
LEE Eugene.

764
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,030
Eugene!

765
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,530
Just a moment!

766
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:33,670
Wonder Boys records sales
hit O.3 million.

767
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:05,360
- What is this?
- Rainbow spicy noodle.

768
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:15,860
The noodles are tough.

769
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,860
I like it.

770
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:27,560
So what will you do?

771
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:32,160
People will recognize you.

772
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:36,360
You said i should
take over the restaurant.

773
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:43,260
Are you going to cook
with that face?

774
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:49,470
You have to feel happy
when you're cooking.

775
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,860
If you cook with a smile
on your face,

776
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:59,560
the dish will be delicious
and the customer smiles!

777
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:03,260
Dad, smile.

778
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:12,560
You smiled a lot
on television.

779
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:41,730
You ran away like that
and end up being here?

780
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,130
I'll ask one thing.

781
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:50,630
You don't want to be part of
Mr. Children anymore?

782
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:56,130
This place suits me better.

783
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,330
That was our dream.

784
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,030
It was.

785
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,930
Then do it.

786
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,330
It's not a dream, now.

787
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:13,030
And dreams never
come true.

788
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:32,360
Why are you leaving?

789
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:35,760
It's not your fault.

790
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:41,960
You grew into a habit
of flying abroad.

791
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:46,160
Gu-ju.

792
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,360
How about we train
another group?

793
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:54,060
A girl group, this time.

794
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:56,760
I manage and
you write songs.

795
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:06,370
I don't want anyone
to be hurt, again.

796
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:11,460
I don't have a reason to leave.

797
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:15,660
But i don't have
a reason to stay either.

798
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:23,700
Wanna drink?

799
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,900
-I have something
-i've got something?

800
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:35,400
You first.

801
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:41,100
We had a different life but
we understand each other.

802
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:46,600
What does that mean?
What's your point?

803
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:48,600
Well, i Want to say?

804
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,890
Marry me.

805
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:56,800
You wanna die?

806
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:59,800
Yes, i'm happy to die

807
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,100
If i can live with you.

808
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:38,930
Eugene, it's me.

809
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:46,030
Are you gonna be mad at me
for working on your song?

810
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:51,430
But you won't be able
to turn it off.

811
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:57,030
I want you to sing again.

812
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,230
And i want to hear you
singing this song.

813
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,730
You, sad Rudolf.

814
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,730
Hey.

815
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,430
Go and find her.

816
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,830
She's waiting for you.

817
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:28,270
I can hear you laugh
when l close my eyes.

818
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,730
You were always
next to me.

819
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,360
Eugene!

820
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:40,970
Where's Gu-ju
and the members?

821
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,370
They went to?
I don't know.

822
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,260
Gu-ju is in airport.

823
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:50,560
Hey!

824
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:56,460
Eugene!

825
01:26:57,790 --> 01:26:58,960
Who are you?

826
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:01,960
- Delivery for O Gu-ju.
- For Gu-ju?

827
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:15,560
What are you doing?

828
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:17,460
Hey!

829
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:24,900
You wanna die?

830
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:29,700
- I'll fall if you let me go.
- Stop it!

831
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:36,500
Yong-su!
Please, i beg you.

832
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:43,800
Eugene, bring Gu-ju with you
to the Music festival.

833
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:46,300
The members are coming!
You got it?

834
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,800
What're you doin' here?

835
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:45,940
When i was hurt
and shut my heart,

836
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:55,840
you hold my hand
and stayed by my side.

837
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:03,130
I can hear you laugh
when i close my eyes.

838
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:09,630
You were always
next to me.

839
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:24,370
This song is for you.
Can you hear me?

840
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:30,970
Can you feel my heart

841
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:43,670
I will always be here
and sing this for you.

842
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:53,470
The story that never ends.
The time that passes.

843
01:29:53,590 --> 01:30:02,170
A glimpse of your back.
I will sing for you.

844
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:20,160
I don't like it.

845
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,760
It's poor, rough and dull.

846
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:27,260
Nothing glamorous.

847
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:30,460
Gu-ju.

848
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:42,060
Where's my scooter?

849
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:54,460
Hold on tight!

850
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:08,660
Look at this.

851
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:14,560
It's hilarious.

852
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,460
What do you think
about Idol pop groups?

853
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:21,800
Pop group?
They are so talented.

854
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:26,100
What do you think about
copying other’s work?

855
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,200
I think they are trash.

856
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:35,600
Trash?
I just think it's unfair.

857
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:40,300
I think music should
feed your soul.

858
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:42,300
You're a sweet looking boy.

859
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:45,600
Thank you.
Next!

860
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:48,900
We're Chocolat!

861
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:52,100
Hello, we're Brave Girls.

862
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:57,800
Let's have fun tonight!

863
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,500
I love you, my fans.

864
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:01,100
We are so happy.
Thank you.

865
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:03,700
We're Wonder Boys!

866
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:10,100
Who is he?

867
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:14,400
Are you a new trot singer?

868
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:19,300
l am a CEO of
Champion Music.

869
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:21,630
I want to say
Eugene is innocent.

870
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:26,030
The video clip was proved
to be manipulated.

871
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,130
So from today,

872
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:32,830
you can see Mr. Children
perform on a stage.

873
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,230
Thank you.

874
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:36,730
Okay, that was...
unexpected.

875
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,830
Do you have something else
to say?

876
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:45,130
Why don't you guys
return my calls?

877
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,830
Jio, Hyeoni, Ricky, Eugene!
This was your dream.

878
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,830
It's not too late.
There's a traffic jam.

879
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,330
So take the subway!

880
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:58,830
Hurry up, guys!

881
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:53,060
l'm always beside you baby.
You're my shining star.

882
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:59,770
You were bad last night.
Where were you?

883
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:06,370
l said bad things
and i regret it.

884
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:11,970
I just hung up on you.

885
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:22,700
They are not here?

886
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:37,700
If they don't show up in 5 mins,
I get fired!

887
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:47,700
- Jio.
- Is it only you?

888
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:53,900
- Hyeoni.
- Had to transfer

889
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:57,200
Ricky!

890
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:09,000
Now i can tell you
how i feel.

891
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:18,500
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?

892
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:25,830
Do you know
my heart belongs to you?

893
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:34,640
Now i know.
I miss you so much.

894
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:41,730
The boy group of the year,
Wonder Boys!

895
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:04,930
It's so hard when
you're not with me.

896
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:08,630
I can't live.
Please, let me go.

897
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:12,630
I don't know why
you're not with me.

898
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:16,030
I can't forget you.
I just can't.

899
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,130
I'm without you.

900
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:20,260
Will they come?

901
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:24,760
Yes, they will.

902
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:28,160
After the show.

903
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:58,260
Take it o, stupid.

904
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:11,460
Just feel the music.

905
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:16,560
That's all you have to do.

906
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:23,200
I'm ravaged.

907
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:27,000
Without you,
I'm ravaged.

908
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:31,500
It's so hard to live
without you.

909
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:35,600
I am a fool.
I hate myself.

910
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:42,800
I'm ravaged.

911
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:51,300
Without you,
I'm ravaged.

912
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:07,200
So much energy here.
It was Wonder Boys!

913
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:12,800
The next group is a rookie who
made so much issues this year.

914
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:17,500
- l think l know.
- They are Mr. Children.

915
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,330
Hello, i'm Eugene
of Mr. Children.

916
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:41,330
I had a thought
on the way here.

917
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,530
Actually, i'm from band.

918
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:51,730
And, pop music was
not what i wanted to do.

919
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:58,430
But then i realized that
any music is great,

920
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:03,930
if i can enjoy singing it
and also make you happy.

921
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:10,230
The members and one person
taught me this.

922
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,630
And i will sing for them.

923
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:32,970
The soft sound of the waves.

924
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:39,370
But your voice is sweeter.

925
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:43,560
Come closer.

926
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:47,970
We will go together.

927
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:53,270
And make a dream come true.

928
01:39:55,990 --> 01:40:00,370
The sound of a warm breeze.

929
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:07,370
Comes to me and comforts me.

930
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:11,160
I feel sweet.

931
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:15,660
Happy as in a dream.

932
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:21,870
I can smile because of you.

933
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:26,560
Summer dream.

934
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:29,960
It's a sweet melody.

935
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,560
feel your dream.

936
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:37,370
We will stay together.

937
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:40,460
It may break your heart.

938
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:44,060
It may bring you down.

939
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:47,160
But you have me.

940
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:53,870
We'll dream forever.

941
01:40:56,090 --> 01:41:00,360
Like the burning sun,

942
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:06,970
Like the shining star.

943
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:11,160
I feel sweet.

944
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:15,460
Happy as in a dream.

945
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:20,900
I can smile because of you.

946
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:24,800
Summer dream.

947
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:28,200
It's a sweet melody.

948
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:30,000
feel your dream.

949
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:35,900
We will stay together.

950
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:38,900
It may break your heart.

951
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:42,200
It may bring you down.

952
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:45,500
But you have me.

953
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:50,000
We'll dream forever.

954
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:53,200
Let's take itto the top.
Close your eyes and imagine it.

955
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:56,700
Spread your wings
and fly high.

956
01:41:56,830 --> 01:42:00,000
It's gonna be okay.
Hold back your tears.

957
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:03,700
A bright future is
waiting for us.

958
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:19,630
Summer dream.

959
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,930
It's a sweet melody.

960
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:24,630
feel your dream.

961
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:30,330
We will stay together.

962
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,630
It may break your heart.

963
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:37,030
It may bring you down.

964
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:40,430
But you have me.

965
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:47,130
We'll dream forever.

966
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:54,630
Summer Dream.

967
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:11,200
Mr. Children!

968
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:42,160
Why did you fabricate the video?

969
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:44,460
How do you feel
right now?

970
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:54,170
I will tell everything
in prosecutors' office.

971
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:01,960
When are you gonna
make me a band vocal?

972
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:06,060
Depends on you.

973
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:08,860
I can't trust you.
Tell me when.

974
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,360
Shut up.

975
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:14,460
Watch my bag.

976
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:49,990
Hello?

977
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:52,400
Your bag just went in.

978
01:45:53,860 --> 01:46:01,230
When l was hurt
and shut my heart,

979
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:09,540
you hold my hand
and stayed by my side.

980
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:16,330
I can hear you laugh
when i close my eyes.

981
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:22,270
You were always
next to me.

982
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:30,770
I wanted to run to you,
wherever it would take me.

983
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:37,570
The world around me
have changed me.

984
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:48,970
I could not tell you
the feelings deep in my heart.

985
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:59,170
I want you to feel it
with this song.

986
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:06,870
I felt lost and
my mind was uneasy.

987
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:14,970
My dream was so far away.
I could never touch it.

988
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:21,700
I could not see
the star in your eyes.

989
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:27,300
You gave me strength.

990
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:36,200
I wanted to run to you,
wherever it would take me.

991
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:43,100
The world around me
have changed me.

992
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:56,970
I could not tell you
the feelings deep in my heart.

993
01:47:57,330 --> 01:48:04,000
I want you to feel it
with this song.

994
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:11,400
Do you remember
that song?

995
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:20,640
Your sweet voice
made me dream again.

996
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:28,830
This song is for you.
Can you hear me?

997
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:35,630
Can you feel my heart

998
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:47,040
I will always be here
and sing this for you.

999
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:57,930
The story that never ends.
The time that passes.

1000
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:05,540
A glimpse of your back.
I will sing for you.
