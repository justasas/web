00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mr. Back

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,450
It's already Christmas Eve tomorrow.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,500
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,170
It's finally tomorrow.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,970
Ah, that's right.

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,820
Here you go.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,920
- What is it?
- It's an invitation.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,120
We have a Christmas event at
our resort the day after tomorrow.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,460
My proposal was chosen.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,300
Really?

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,930
Congratulations.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,860
One who creates memories...

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,690
I did well in all my training classes

14
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,640
and I did my best preparing for it,
so you have to come.

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,640
Sure.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,760
Christmas...

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,490
I'll wait for you there.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,550
Christmas...

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,030
I should come.

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,750
<i>[Final Episode]</i>

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,720
<i>On the day of the next meteor shower</i>

22
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,270
<i>take this at where
the accident took place.</i>

23
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,600
<i>'Gu Bu Duk Gu.'</i>

24
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,750

25

<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have one day
to return on your payment.]</i>

26
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,080
I wonder whose son he is.

27
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,790
He's so handsome.

28
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,100
What do you think you're doing?

29
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,250
The buyer wants to postpone the date
to sign off on the contract.

30
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,250
I had no choice.

31
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,530
Selling the resort to
a foreign company isn't right.

32
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,710
It's not too late to change your mind.

33
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,360
You, seriously...

34
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,570
I'm busy preparing for tomorrow's event.

35
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,930
I should go now.

36
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,290
What do you think you're doing?

37
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,140
What are you doing?
People are watching.

38
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,020
You shouldn't be doing this here.

39
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,810
You get your entire family involved
and even use my weaknesses.

40
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,430
What did you hand over
to the investor?

41
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,840
- Who you really are.
- What?

42
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,850
I let them know what would happen
to the resort if they let you run it.

43
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,430
I explained that to them in vivid detail.

44
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,030
What is it?
A hiccup in your plan?

45
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,430
I can handle that
on my own just fine.

46
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,980
If you keep this up, it'll be dangerous.

47
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,820
- What's dangerous about it?
- Hong Ji Yoon...

48
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,540
As for what you're working on...

49
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,100
put everything back
in its original place.

50
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,480
What are you planning to do?

51
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,870
So did everything go well?

52
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,000
Of course. You know whose son I am.

53
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,140
He said he would either
postpone the deal or think it over.

54
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,620
I guess he realized who
Director Jung really was.

55
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,540
- Anyway, you're okay, right?
- Of course.

56
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,660
You know whose father I am.

57
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,170
Don't worry about the text messages.

58
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,600
It just adds more stress,
so it won't be good for your health.

59
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,900
- Okay.
- I'll just throw it out.

60
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,500
What kind of cell phone is that?

61
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,640
- Nothing will happen, so don't worry.
- Okay.

62
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,640
I hear there's a Christmas event
at the resort tomorrow.

63
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,290
That's right.
I have to step out again because of that.

64
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,250
Sure. Don't worry about me, and get to it.

65
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,150
Eun Ha Soo worked on it, so you have
to come no matter what, okay?

66
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,360
Okay, I understand.

67
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,550
Choi Shin Hyung!

68
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,540
Excuse me...

69
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,810
What were you doing there?

70
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,600
You could've been hit by a car.

71
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,870
It's just that my meteor bracelet
fell off, so...

72
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,680
Where were you headed?

73
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,040
I had to do something
for the event tomorrow.

74
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,460
I'll go find the bracelet

75
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,680
so go about your work.

76
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,810
All right then. I'll go.

77
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,390
Hong Ji Yoon.

78
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,280
Can I help you?

79
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,210
You worked on the Cruise Hotel project
with the late Chairman Choi, correct?

80
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,370
Yes, I did.

81
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,690
One of the contractors
has filed a lawsuit against you.

82
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,510
Since Chairman Choi passed away

83
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,480
there hasn't been any progress.

84
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,300
We will need to ask questions
on the charges of dereliction of duties.

85
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,810
Merry Christmas.

86
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,570
What brings you here at this hour?

87
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,320
Santa Claus who even gives toys
to crying children is here.

88
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,630
Thank you.

89
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,710
Have a seat.
Would you like some tea?

90
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,820
No, just continue.

91
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,660
What will you be doing then?

92
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,530
I'll just watch you work.

93
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,440
Have a seat.

94
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,280
You set the date for the surgery, right?

95
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,390
Yes, I did.

96
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,440
<i>The next program is called,
'Walk For the Mind.'</i>

97
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,820
<i>Ever since I met you...</i>

98
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,200
<i>I feel like I can walk in
a dark road without a lamp.</i>

99
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,140
<i>I feel like I can cross the ocean on foot.</i>

100
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,250
<i>I feel like I can fly without wings.</i>

101
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,170
<i>Ever since I met you...</i>

102
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,440
<i>I feel like I have everything
I've ever wanted.</i>

103
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,140
Oh man, I'm so tired.

104
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,540
I can't help yawning.

105
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,120
By the way, aren't you
going to open my present?

106
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,210
Open my present first.

107
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,310
Ta-da.

108
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,090
Eun Ha Soo.

109
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,670
They say even a kitchen-hand working
for three years can cook ramen.

110
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,910
I'm don't even come close
to my father's skills.

111
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,120
But I made it myself.

112
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,640
I've always been on the receiving end.

113
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,880
I wanted to get you something, too.

114
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,960
Try it on.

115
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,410
I made it according to your measurements
from the last time.

116
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,450
I wonder if it will fit well.

117
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,140
Wow.

118
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,380
The model is good,
so the clothes fit so well.

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,060
In all my life...

122
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,150
I've never received any present
that's more special than this one.

123
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,780
Well, it's not that special, you know.

124
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,820
Thank you.

125
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm sorry.

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,240
<i>Go home.</i>

179
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,750
<i>I'll come to the event tomorrow.</i>

180
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,340
<i>[Eun Ha Soo]</i>

181
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,920
<i>Redirecting your call...</i>

182
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,550
Manager Sung, have you seen my father?

183
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,180
- Where is Chairman Choi?
- Nowhere.

184
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,260
He wants us to come home.

185
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,910
Father...

186
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,650
Father.

187
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,610
Have you now returned
to the way you were?

188
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,720
Father, let's go to the hospital.

189
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,810
Let's go have the surgery now.

190
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,810
Let's do that, Chairman Choi.

191
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,930
What if something goes wrong
tomorrow morning like Dr. Kim said?

192
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,340
What do we do?

193
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,900
Let's go to the hospital now,
Chairman Choi.

194
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,810
- Please.
- Okay.

195
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,500
- Let's go to the hospital.
- Okay.

196
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,990
But...

197
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,510
- Just one more day.
- Father.

198
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,520
I made a promise.

199
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,430
I promised to come to the event tomorrow.

200
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,560
After I go there...

201
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,650
I'll go to the hospital immediately.

202
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,450
Chairman Choi.

203
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,180
<i>Tumen River...</i>

204
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,500
<i>in the blue water...</i>

205
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:53,900
<i>The boatman is rowing a boat.</i>

206
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:05,730
<i>He's rowing a boat
with my lover from the past.</i>

207
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:16,640
<i>The boat has left...</i>

208
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:24,300
<i>Where did it go?</i>

209
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,000
Father.

210
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:37,690
<i>My lover that I miss so dearly.</i>

211
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,830
<i>My lover that I miss so dearly.</i>

212
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,900
- Could you clean up the table there?
- Sure.

213
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,490
- It's so pretty.
- Really?

214
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,170
Ha Soo, how do we look?

215
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,840
You two look good together.

216
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,780
It's so pretty.

217
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,170
I'll finish up here.

218
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,740
<i>Choi Shin Hyung, you're really okay, right?</i>

219
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,570
<i>You're coming to today's event, right?</i>

220
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,160
I wonder what time
the event will end.

221
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,820
It would probably
take about two hours.

222
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,140
What are you so worried about?

223
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,140
No, I'm not worried.

224
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,820
It's just that...

225
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,950
You still have the medicine
that Dr. Kim gave you, right?

226
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,910
Yes.

227
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,170
What are you going to do with it?

228
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,870
Will you take it?

229
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,550
If you're going to take it

230
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,420
you have to go to where the sinkhole was.

231
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,200
It's better to go there and wait...

232
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,770
Then I'll go in.

233
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,460
I'll wait in the car then.

234
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,730
If there is anything,
call me right away.

235
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,210
Okay, I will.

236
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,490
- Where did Choi Shin Hyung go?
- Who knows?

237
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,620
Whether he disappeared
to the sky or to the ground...

238
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,810
Gosh, I thought he'd save us.

239
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,540
We have no choice
but to stick to Dae Han.

240
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,000
How is he able to save us?

241
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,930
Like Choi Shin Hyung said,
we can all go to prison...

242
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,960
or we can do community service.

243
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,900
We will just have to wait for
the court's decision.

244
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,360
Oh my god.

245
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,650
If I had known this

246
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,610
I'd have taken out more money
and flown to Germany.

247
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,360
What? You still haven't
come to your senses, have you?

248
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,560
How much did you sneak out to Germany?

249
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Why would you want to know that?

250
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,360
Why don't you reclaim
the New York department store?

251
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,020
Gosh, how about you two?

252
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,210
How much of the secret funds
did you take out?

253
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,020
- Oh my! What's happening?
- What's going on?

254
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,260
<i>- Please wait.
- Press the emergency button.</i>

255
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,910
- Emergency button.
- Emergency button?

256
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,680
Yi Hye, you're closer.

257
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,440
- Where is it? Where?
- Right there.

258
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,000
No way! No way!

259
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,210
You half-wits.

260
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,640
Brother.

261
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,270
If you don't get your act together...

262
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,650
I'll show up every day...

263
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,140
and I'll haunt you!

264
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,330
Please save us.

265
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,840
- I was wrong, brother.
- Please don't do that.

266
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,170
Please forgive me.
I won't live like that again.

267
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,930
- I was wrong, brother.
- Kill me, brother.

268
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,690
I was wrong, brother.
I won't do it again.

269
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,110
- Are you okay, Yi Hye?
- Yes.

270
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,040
- How about you, honey?
- I wasn't the only one who saw him ,right?

271
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,980
I wasn't the only one
who saw him, right?

272
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,400
I can even smell the cologne
my brother used all the time.

273
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,900
That was so weird.

274
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,100
Did everything go okay
at the prosecution office?

275
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,460
I was sued for obstruction to
perform duties by our contractor.

276
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:50,630
Yesterday Choi Shin Hyung
said this could help and left it.

277
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,200
What is it?

278
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,520
We did terminate the contract
with them in the past.

279
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,780
We did it in secret,
so we even got rid of the document.

280
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,990
He said this would help
since we need the documents now.

281
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,410
So Choi Shin Hyung gave this document
with my late father's signature, huh?

282
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,820
But I'm not sure what I should do with it.

283
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,340
- This will do.
- Pardon?

284
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,630
Prosecutor Yang, how did it go?

285
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,590
<i>We have a problem.
Everything has been exposed.</i>

286
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,150
<i>Prosecutor Gu is on his way there now.</i>

287
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,410
Is he?

288
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,770
Okay.

289
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:46,780
<i>I'm grateful that I get to share
this special event with my loving parents.</i>

290
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,410
<i>Mom and Dad.</i>

291
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,840
Thank you for raising me.

292
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,240
<i>Don't be sad that your daughter
of 27 years is getting married.</i>

293
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,320
<i>I'll live a fulfilling and happy life.
Thank you.</i>

294
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,100
<i>This is our final event for the night.</i>

295
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,250
The last applicant is the most
handsome man at our resort.

296
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,540
President Choi Dae Han.

297
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,450
The one I wanted to give
my best Christmas memory is...

298
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,040
my father, the late Chairman Choi Go Bong.

299
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,770
He spent all his life at Daehan Resort.

300
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,870
He loved his employees
more than anyone.

301
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,630
Compared to him, I have so much to learn.

302
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,560
I realized that as I rose
to lead Daehan Resort.

303
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,890
He taught me that the best leader...

304
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:06,090
is someone who works next to
the employees, not above them.

305
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,320
I want to send him
my appreciation and respect.

306
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,000
<i>[Appreciation Plaque]</i>

307
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,370
Eun Ha Soo.

308
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:13,100
These are the ones
I've been working on.

309
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,530
Because they are well organized into files

310
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,590
it will be easy to look over them.

311
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,010
Yi Gun.

312
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,420
Jung Yi Gun.

313
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,130
Regarding the case involving the late
Chairman Choi's five billion won

314
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:38,270
a warrant has been issued for your arrest
for defamation and embezzlement.

315
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,160
Please come with us.

316
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,490
I will.

317
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,420
Hold on a second.

318
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,700
I almost forgot something important.

319
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,880
And this is something you worked on
with the late Chairman Choi.

320
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,380
It's the business plan for Cruise Hotel.

321
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,370
Take care.

322
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,920
Take care of Hong Ji Yoon.

323
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,730
<i>Next news is...</i>

324
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,250
<i>November of last year</i>

325
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,830
<i>the late Chairman Choi Go Bong
passed away in defamation</i>

326
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:01,090
<i>due to the case involving an exploding car
containing five billion won.</i>

327
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,030
<i>The truth of the case
has just been revealed.</i>

328
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:08,740
<i>Director Jung wished to bring down
the Choi family from management.</i>

329
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,370
<i>It has been confirmed that he had
placed the money into the chairman's car.</i>

330
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:16,000
<i>Thus the late Chairman Choi's
reputation should be restored.</i>

331
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,930
<i>Redirecting your call...</i>

332
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,660
Why isn't he answering the phone
when the event's over?

333
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,550
Where did he go?

334
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,290
- Manager Sung.
- Yes?

335
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,870
Do you know where
Chairman Choi might be?

336
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,500
No, I can't get in touch with him.

337
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,410
It's crazy.

338
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,260
Did he go to where the
accident took place?

339
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,350
What?

340
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,780
First, get in the car.

341
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,790
Anyway...

342
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,290
If the time is up and
something happened to him

343
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,350
he asked us not to look for him.

344
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,480
Since there’s nothing we could do now.

345
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,280
He said we should just accept
the situation as it is.

346
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,130
- That's what he said and he left.
- Seriously.

347
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,510
He didn't go to the hospital.
Where could he have gone?

348
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,800
If he isn't at the location
of the accident

349
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,370
what are we supposed to do?

350
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,750
It's a mint.

351
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,810
Do you go around
giving it to everyone?

352
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,440
Actually, I am...

353
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,420
The day when you were in
the sinkhole accident...

354
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,120
- Yes?
- Did you eat one of these?

355
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,960
Thank you for holding his hand
at that time.

356
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,080
I don't...

357
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,600
have much time left.

358
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,240
He's not at the hospital.

359
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,520
If he's not at the sinkhole,
where else could he be?

360
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,910
It's almost time now.

361
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,990
Father.

364
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,210

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,240
<i>My son, Choi Dae Han.</i>

366

<i>You've grown up to be
a fine young man.</i>

367
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:33,620

369
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:49,220
<i>I hope you won't lose your beliefs
and live accordingly.</i>

370
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,250
I'm sorry, but could you go
a little bit faster?

371
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,310
Choi Shin Hyung!

372
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,360
You're Choi Shin Hyung, aren't you?

373
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,630
I thought maybe, but...

374
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,560
How?

375
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,440
Chairman Choi Go Bong...

376
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,280
Choi Shin Hyung.

377
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,990
Can you explain this to me
so that I can understand?

378
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,960
I never wanted to deceive you.

379
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,650
I wanted to tell you everything.

380
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,880
But I didn't have the courage to do it.

381
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,450
I'm sorry.

382
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,760
Lies.

383
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,030
Where are you trying to go
if you feel so bad?

384
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,550
If you disappear like that...

385
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,360
what are people left behind
supposed to do?

386
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:59,260
An old man like me...

387
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,740
Forget me.

388
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,980
Time will do that for you.

389
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,360
No.

390
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,710
I don't want to forget about you.

391
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,400
I won't give up either.

392
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,150
You are Choi Shin Hyung in my eyes.

393
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,400
There has to be a way.

394
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,510
Let's find a way together.

395
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,400
Please don't give up, Choi Shin Hyung.

396
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,180
Eun Ha Soo.

397
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,030
Don't do that, Choi Shin Hyung.

398
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,280
Please.

399
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,930
I'll wait for you.

400
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,240
And I'll pray, too.

401
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,910
Until you come back, Choi Shin Hyung.

402
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,550
We cannot sell off Daehan Resort
to a foreign company.

403
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:20,410
Now I will present the new management
strategies to the board of directors.

404
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,260
I will explain the screen presentation.

405
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,550
It's our business nature to get influenced
by the market economy.

406
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,790
The business recession
that lasted a few years now...

407
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,220
is effecting Daehan Resort negatively.

408
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,740
Moreover, due to an increasing number
of competitors in the resort business

409
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,070
it's the truth that Daehan Resort
is being threatened.

410
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:49,830
Especially, as the business recession
influenced the global economy

411
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:55,600
there has been a hiccup in our plan
to expand overseas as well.

412
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,300
For that reason, we need renovation
for our second wind.

413
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,350
Especially, as the regulations have evolved

414
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,330
an idea of combining medical service
and a hotel

415
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,320
a project called Meditel has been allowed.

416
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,430
We can see this as
an opportunity for Daehan Resort.

417
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,430
I did a good job, didn't I?

418
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,180
I want to be praised today.

419
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,370
I have a letter for you.

420
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,020
<i>[Eun Ha Soo]</i>

421
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,720
- What is this?
- You'll know when you read it.

422
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,820
<i>It was my first time.</i>

423
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,170
<i>The way I felt about you...</i>

424
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,770
<i>Is it your first time?</i>

425
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,930
<i>for Choi Shin Hyung?</i>

426
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,370
I. Will. Not. Tell. You.

427
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,850
Gosh, that's not fair.

428
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,980
<i>[One year later]</i>

429
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,950
Smile.

430
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,820
Father, today's the foundation day,
so I have a lot of events to attend.

431
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,130
I'll be late tonight.

432
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,590
I'll see you later.

433
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,160
<i>- Manager Sung.
- I've found him!</i>

434
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,720
<i>I've found him.</i>

435
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,220
After I received your order...

436
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,000
I've been looking for him
all year long.

437
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,560
- I didn't get to go to Canada.
- Are you sure it's him?

438
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,810
- Last time it was the wrong person.
- I'm 100 percent sure this time.

439
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,770
He was found on Christmas Day last year.

440
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,770
It's the same day when
Chairman Choi disappeared.

441
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,970
His description matches, too.

442
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,920
Do you think there was a mysterious force
in place so he wouldn't disappear?

443
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,190
Maybe you wanted to have him
around so badly...

444
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,290
that they heard your prayers.

445
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:14,410
There might be someone else
who prayed more earnestly than I did.

446
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,830
By the way, there is one problem.

447
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,120
When he was found...

448
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,610
they said he couldn't remember anything.

449
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,590
His age or name or anything at all.

450
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,470
Then he's been like that ever since?

451
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,500
They couldn't find who he was,
so they let him stay here.

452
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,870
He's so diligent and nice
that he helps other people.

453
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,080
They treat him like his own family here.

454
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,210
Chairman Choi is not someone
who would do such hard work.

455
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,880
- Let's take him home.
- Manager Sung.

456
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,380
Yes?

457
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,480
Chairman Choi Go Bong of Daehan Resort...

458
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,810
He's already dead.

459
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,490
President Choi.

460
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:16,000
My half-brother from Canada,
Choi Shin Hyung...

461
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,140
Like how you helped my late father...

462
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,920
you will assist my brother
in the same way, right?

463
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,610
It will be my honor to work
for two generations.

464
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,600
Who are you here for?

465
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,680
You can request to see someone
at the office over here.

466
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:48,610
I came to find my brother.

467
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,190
Your brother's name is...

468
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,340
Choi Shin Hyung.

469
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,920
Choi...

470
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,580
Hello.

471
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:18,880
I'm Eun Ha Soo who organized
the Christmas event last year.

472
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:30,090
Then now we will start a presentation
on how to plan Christmas events.

473
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,680
This is the most important part of our event.

474
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,850
Excuse me for a second.

475
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,710
- You came.
- Thank you for inviting me.

476
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,550
No problem.

477
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:05,010
Your seat is over there
around the corner.

478
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,270
- Over there?
- Go ahead.

479
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,710
Sure.

480
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,030
Choi Shin Hyung.

481
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,820
Everybody here calls me by that name.

482
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,130
Saying it's my name...

483
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,410
What happened?

484
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,660
Don't you know who I am?

485
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,940
I'm sorry.

486
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,660
I learned my real name just now, so...

487
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,810
Are you okay?

488
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,940
No, it's just that...

489
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,300
I'm not feeling well...

490
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,900
Well, then try to repeat after me.

491
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,960
It will calm you down.

492
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,670
Koong koong da. Koong koong da.

493
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,240
I know that one.

494
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,730
I taught you that one.

495
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:08,530
- So you are...
- I'm Eun Ha Soo.

496
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,290
- Ah.
- I'm The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

497
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:17,530
You must know a lot about me then.

498
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,770
The stories behind these photos...

499
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,170
Can you tell me about them?

500
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,940
That will take a while.

501
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,300
I... have a lot of time.

502
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,780
I also have lots of questions.

503
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,490
Do you really want to know?

504
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,530
What is it that you want
to know about the most?

505
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,600
I...

506
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:13,220
