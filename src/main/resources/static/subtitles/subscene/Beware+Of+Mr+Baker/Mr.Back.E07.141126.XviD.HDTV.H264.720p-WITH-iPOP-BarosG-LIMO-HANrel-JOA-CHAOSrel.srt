1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mr. Back

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,320
What's wrong with me?

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,410
This is so wrong.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,660
Is it okay to do this? Me?

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,060
I'm not suddenly getting old again, am I?

6
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,700
<i>[Episode 7]</i>

7
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,580
Come on, hurry.
I'll see you later.

8
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,970
Woo Young, wait up.

9
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,200
- Are you off to work now?
- Yes.

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,130
Wow, are you going somewhere?

11
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,250
I'm  meeting someone.

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,200
Man, seriously...

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,630
Make sure it's straight, will you?

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,230
Make sure it's pretty.

15
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,400
There you go.

16
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,180
What are we having for dinner today?

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,710
Well, what would you like?

18
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,710
Well, anything.

19
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,850
Make me something
that you're good at.

20
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,300
All right, I have to go
because I'm running late.

21
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,840
She's pretty.

22
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,810
- Choi Shin Hyung.
- Yes?

23
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,750
Welcome, everyone!

24
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,380
We're going to have
an enjoyable time today.

25
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,670
Before we do that, let's welcome
Director Choi Dae Han

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,850
who organized this event.

27
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,390
Welcome to the Red Day Festival,
which kicks off the winter season.

28
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,500
The color red represents
heat and anger.

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,200
To those who often encounter
angry situations in modern society

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,530
this event could relieve some stress.

31
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,540
Starting now, release all of your stress...

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,510
and that feeling of dislike
towards others...

33
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,340
We can be completely free from it.

34
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,190
I hope that this will be
a great opportunity for all of us.

35
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,460
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,390
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

37
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,570
Think of a person you hate the most.

38
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,660
And then throw it.

39
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,480
What are you doing there?
Come on out.

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,220
No way. I'm going home.

41
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,670
- You came all the way here.
- I'm going home!

42
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,160
- What is this?
- Take this!

43
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,230
What are you doing?

44
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,770
- Director Choi.
- Why are you here?

45
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,000
How rude!

46
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,790
How dare you say that to a customer?

47
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,280
Come here. Get him!

48
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,100
Shin Hyung.

49
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,190
I told you that
I didn't want to do this!

50
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,310
Look at the state of me!

51
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,250
Nonsense. You were having the most fun.

52
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,630
Let me see.
I'll wipe you off.

53
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,450
Over here, too.

54
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,430
Wipe it yourself.
Next to your nose there.

55
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,350
- Man, you were having so much fun.
- Director Choi.

56
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,220
Manager Hong.

57
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,400
I think it's better to have
that man move back in.

58
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,680
Why all of a sudden?

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,930
I don't know.
I just think it's better that way.

60
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,620
How itchy.

61
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,460
Where did he go?

62
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,550
<i>Thanks for your hospitality.
I'm leaving. Choi Shin Hyung.</i>

63
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,440
What is this?

64
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,510
How can he just leave
without saying a word?

65
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,340
How have you been?

66
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,480
Why does he keep changing his mind?
It's annoying.

67
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,060
- Come this way.
- No, my room is that way.

68
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,740
- What's your deal?
- I felt bad you being homeless.

69
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,150
Plus, it doesn't help my image, either.

70
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,360
You should have done this sooner.

71
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,500
I'll have dinner first,
so set the table.

72
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,880
A glass of vegetable juice, please.

73
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,230
- Hello?
<i>- It's me.</i>

74
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,560
Can you bring over the documents
from earlier and come by the house?

75
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,800
Right now?

76
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,020
Yes, I need to go over them tonight.

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,810
There's something my late father
used to say all the time.

78
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,790
'Those who don't work, shouldn't eat.'

79
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,070
I have a suggestion for you.

80
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,630
You can work at Daehan Resort.
What do you think?

81
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,990
I don't have any interest
in management

82
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,200
but you seem to have
great interest in it.

83
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,960
So I'm giving you an opportunity.

84
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,850
I appreciate it.

85
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,760
That's what I wanted.

86
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,420
There was another thing
my late father used to say.

87
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,470
'No matter what kind of work,
always start from the bottom.'

88
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,390
Start from the bottom.

89
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,480
You can do it since you're his son.

90
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,550
If you can't do that,
then get out immediately.

91
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,960
What? You don't think you can do it?

92
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,640
Fine. I'll do it.

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,250
But the thing is...

94
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,150
Our late father said this, too.

95
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,250
'Don't live life without a goal.'

96
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,700
What goal do you have in mind
to suggest that to me?

97
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,010
Goal, huh?

98
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,710
I originally wanted to be
a professional dancer

99
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,070
But I couldn't pursue it because
my late father was against the idea.

100
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,900
He said a child who doesn't listen
to his parents aren't human.

101
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,650
But since he isn't around anymore...

102
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,510
I'm thinking of taking it up again.

103
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,380
- What?
- Why not? It's cool.

104
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,600
You haven't seen me dance.
Want me to show you?

105
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,390
No, I have no interest
in seeing you dance.

106
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,970
Why don't you act like
a human being first?

107
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,840
What a rotten kid.

108
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,440
What brings you here?

109
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,020
- Director Choi invited me.
- At this hour?

110
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,100
It's fine, so you can go home.

111
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,540
How could you leave
without saying a word?

112
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,630
Huh?

113
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,380
You asked me to make dinner earlier...

114
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,660
I did, didn't I?

115
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,590
What do you think you're doing?

116
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,050
She's my guest.

117
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,720
Can you get lost?

118
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,730
Director Choi. Director Choi.

119
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,810
Wait...

120
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,130
Director Choi, the document...

121
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,950
Don't go hanging around
Choi Shin Hyung again.

122
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,480
Why not?

123
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,930
You started to change my life
by one percent.

124
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,300
Well, here.

125
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,130
- Then I'll get going.
- Wait.

126
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,970
- What is it?
- Don't go out yet.

127
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,410
It seems that your conversation
is becoming quite long...

128
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,590
- Would you like some tea?
- No, I'm coming right out.

129
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,900
You two seemed to be living together.
Are you guys dating?

130
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,210
- No...
- Wait a second.

131
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,000
Jujube tea, mulberry leaf tea, and
quince tea. Which one do you like?

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,880
- Answer.
- Gosh, quince tea!

133
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,920
Oh my god!

134
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,150
Excuse me.

135
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,720
Wow, leaving already?

136
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,910
It's kind of late now.

137
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,030
By the way, why did he
call you over at this hour?

138
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,770
He asked me to run an errand.

139
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,080
What a rotten man.

140
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,550
How dare he asks anyone
to run errands at this hour?

141
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,160
- Then...
- Wait a second.

142
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,490
I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye
before I left.

143
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,820
Could you talk to your mother for me?

144
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,270
Since you've decided to stay here,
make the most out of it.

145
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,520
And you two.
Stop arguing, please.

146
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,980
I'll go now.

147
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,430
What do you think you're doing?

148
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,330
Don't harass and manipulate her
because of me.

149
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,160
Who the heck are you
to tell me what to do?

150
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,360
Do you have feelings for her
or something?

151
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,900
- Looks like I'm right.
- It's not like that.

152
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,200
Isn't it about time for you
to come to your senses?

153
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,370
Don't go around and hurt people
if you're not serious.

154
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,800
What can I say?

155
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,080
I like her.

156
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,370
Why?

157
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,420
Is it odd for a young man
to like a young woman?

158
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,240
I'm not married and
I don't have a girlfriend.

159
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,380
Why do you think
I'd end up hurting her?

160
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,790
On what grounds?

161
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,870
<i>The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.</i>

162
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,820
You started to change my life
by one percent.

163
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,810
Let's go to bed.

164
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,590
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

165
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,850
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

166
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,940
Hey, do you know of
the Choi Go Bong Dance?

167
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,140
It's the dance that's taken
the country by storm.

168
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,860
How fast can you run 100 meters?

169
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,280
I've been feeling great lately.

170
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,430
Why are you doing this?
Go away!

171
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,470
Still, those two seem to have
grown much closer, don't you think?

172
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm not so sure.

173
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,130
- They're on fire.
- Are they? Where?

174
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,340
We should put it out.

175
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,890
No one can possibly
put that fire out.

176
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,650
'The prince of Daehan Group,
Director Choi Dae Han'

177
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,860
'has made good on his name.'

178
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,260
'The sensational response
from the Red Day Festival...'

179
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,690
If we leave him be

180
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,400
then he'll come and
take you down in no time.

181
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,160
Do you want to be dismissed by your family?

182
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,210
And go back to be being known as
the invisible man in this company?

183
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,450
Would you disappoint me again?

184
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,570
Let's show them something.

185
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,200
Okay?

186
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,230
Put out the notice immediately!

187
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,350
- What's going on?
- Oh my goodness.

188
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,660
<i>[Personnel announcements]</i>

189
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,550
What is this?

190
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,420
They're everyone who closely worked
with the late Chairman Choi.

191
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,790
How could this be?

192
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,010
<i>[Hong Ji Yoon: Fired.]</i>

193
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,350
- Oh my god.
- What do we do now?

194
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,850
<i>[As of November 26,
you have been terminated.]</i>

195
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,900
What are you people doing?

196
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,760
Leave everything and go.

197
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,280
- That's enough.
- Enough of what?

198
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,720
I told you to leave immediately. Sir.

199
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,520
I had expect this to an extent.

200
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,650
Nonsense.

201
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,470
Do you think this is why I handed
that title over to my uncle?

202
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,590
What do you suggest we do then?

203
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,300
- I will handle it myself...
- What can you possibly do about it?

204
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,450
Manager Hong.

205
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,910
There isn't anything
you can do about it.

206
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,410
I chose the wrong person to work for.

207
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,070
Why would they tell us to clean
the pool on such a cold day,?

208
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,580
Gosh.

209
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,290
How long are you going
to abuse me like this, huh?

210
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,540
What's going on with
Director Jung Yi Gun?

211
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,220
It seems like he's working on it,
but it's easier said than done.

212
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,410
The company is a mess after
Chairman Choi passed away.

213
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,350
Who would buy out the company?

214
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,910
If Choi Young Dal starts stealing
from the company

215
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,620
it's only a matter of time
until the company is ruined.

216
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,480
If you were really Chairman Choi

217
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,460
you would use your brother's
weakness and fight back.

218
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,860
As expected, you're definitely
someone I need!

219
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,680
You only say that
when you need me!

220
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,000
Over there. There.

221
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,190
What brings you here?

222
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,980
I came to check up on the cleaning.

223
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,950
I'm supposed to check up
on it this week.

224
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,930
By the way, you got rehired?

225
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,090
Yes, it turned out that way.

226
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,070
What happened to the workers
that Manager Sung would be...

227
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,150
Ji Yoon.

228
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,080
Congratulations on your promotion.

229
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,850
I'll do whatever it takes.

230
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,050
Thank you for thinking of me.

231
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,960
You don't believe me?

232
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,730
Why would you interfere on my behalf?

233
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,670
I don't want it
to backfire on you.

234
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,430
Ah, seriously.

235
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,210
- Not there, but over there.
- Where?

236
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,410
- Here?
- No. You already cleaned that.

237
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,070
- Over there.
- Where?

238
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,930
- Where is it?
- Over there!

239
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,590
Gosh.

240
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,380
Here?

241
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,020
You're good at this.

242
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,280
How is it that you're so bad at this?

243
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,430
I usually don't do things like this.

244
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,540
Knowing how to do this is a given.

245
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,990
Follow me.

246
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,420
She's bragging because
she was good at it, huh?

247
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,280
Let's race.

248
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,180
- How tiring.
- Let's go.

249
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,880
- Oh, my butt.
- Are you okay?

250
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,400
How tiring was that?

251
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,840
It's been a while
since I worked up a sweat.

252
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,340
Oh my.

253
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,440
Why are you packing
something like that?

254
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,220
It's my snack. Here.

255
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,580
- Try some.
- No, thanks.

256
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,090
Just try some.

257
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,000
Food you eat after working up
a sweat always tastes better.

258
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,040
Try some.

259
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,810
Wow, this is delicious.

260
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,880
But this makes me thirsty.
I'm thirsty.

261
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,580
Here you go.

262
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,870
It's good.

263
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,630
How did you get rehired?

264
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:34,870
It's just that, Choi Dae Han...

265
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:40,590
If he wants you to come over
or meet up, just say no.

266
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,340
- Never!
- Why not?

267
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,210
You just shouldn't.

268
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,770
Do you know how many women's
hearts he's broken?

269
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,630
- How do you know that?
- What?

270
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,170
My late father told me.

271
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,230
Back when he was in school

272
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,580
girls would come over
bawling their eyes out

273
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,810
just because he wouldn't see them.

274
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,930
Wow, so he was popular?

275
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,400
What do you mean, 'popular'?

276
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,630
Some girl jumped in front of a car
because of him.

277
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,570
Do you know how much money
was spent for that?

278
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,960
How does he know about that?

279
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,690
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

280
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,450
I wasted billions of won
because of that.

281
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,670
I mean, my late father did...

282
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,070
But...

283
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,320
Are you interested in him or something?

284
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,790
No.

285
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,110
Don't ever fall for him.

286
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,240
Got it?

287
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,850
- He's an irresponsible man.
- Seriously, that guy...

288
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,060
Hello.

289
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,370
Actually...

290
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,200
Ha Soo.

291
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,660
- Ha Soo?
- What is it? What's wrong?

292
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,620
I've just been just that
all the interns will be fired.

293
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,380
What?

294
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,880
Where did he disappear off to
after calling me over here?

295
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,010
Why did you come here?
I'm just exercising.

296
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,400
What's the matter?
I like it because it's thrilling.

297
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,470
How long are you going to wait?

298
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,800
Don't you know how careless my brother is?

299
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,510
Kicking Choi Young Dal is easy.

300
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,600
It's because we can't buy up
Dae Han's shares, is all.

301
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,030
His shares, huh?

302
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,300
Don't worry.

303
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,510
I've already got
a plan in motion.

304
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,520
Crazy bastards...

305
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,760
- You asked for me?
- Yes.

306
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,420
About the Red Day Festival...

307
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,600
Thanks to you, it was a success.
My reputation improved greatly.

308
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,850
- Good job.
- I was only doing my job.

309
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,350
About Choi Shin Hyung...

310
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,420
You know he's working here again, right?

311
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,580
Yes.

312
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,160
You might run into him often
while you go about your day...

313
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,070
No matter what he says about me...

314
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,510
Don't listen to him or
believe anything he says.

315
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,560
Pardon?

316
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,840
He's going to speak ill of me anyway.

317
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,190
What the?
Has he already said something?

318
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,350
No.

319
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,570
No, huh?

320
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,410
- I'll excuse myself.
- Wait.

321
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,970
You heard that the interns
would be fired, didn't you?

322
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,090
I'll take care of it,
so don't worry about it.

323
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,050
What is it?
You don't trust me?

324
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,890
I'm capable of at least
doing that much.

325
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,230
I'll get going.

326
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,070
Young Dal, you bastard.
Going to fire the employees?

327
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,240
Cruel bastard.

328
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,880
Who spilled coffee in my hotel, huh?

329
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,120
- Chairman Choi.
- What?

330
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,150
Why don't you answer your phone?

331
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,930
What is it?

332
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,630
Seriously, Director Jung Yi Gun...

333
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,220
- With Yi Hye?
- That's what I'm saying.

334
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,980
My heart was pounding, and
I ran around looking for you.

335
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,830
You weren't answering
your phone, either.

336
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,500
Are they firing the interns or not?

337
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,890
It makes me so nervous...

338
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,660
Director Choi said he'd handle it,
so let's trust him to do it.

339
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,300
Do you trust what that guy says?

340
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,610
He's a troublemaker who's incapable
of taking care of himself.

341
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,620
Jeez, let's just go home.

342
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,840
How come this is in here?

343
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,560
- Are you treating today?
- Where are we going?

344
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm sure somewhere nice.

345
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,930
- Thanks, man.
- Let's go.

346
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,620
That man, seriously...

347
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,560
The company is on the brink of ruin

348
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,690
and he's still hanging out
with his friends?

349
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,770
Does he have his head on straight or what?

350
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,310
What are you going to do?

351
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,190
<i>What can you possibly do about it?</i>

352
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,200
There isn't anything
you can do about it.

353
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,690
You upset over your half-brother
who showed up out of nowhere?

354
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,230
Is this the time for you to be dancing
and drinking at a place like this?

355
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:16,170
What do you care whether
I go out dancing and drinking?

356
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,090
Wait, aren't you Dae Han's brother
who was the talk of the town?

357
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,220
- Hang with us.
- Let's have fun.

358
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,230
- Come this way.
- Hey, hey!

359
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,620
Don't mind him and continue.

360
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,110
Come out.

361
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,210
You're stubborn and shameless, too.

362
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,080
How can you be so much
like our late father?

363
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,490
You've never even lived under
the same roof together.

364
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,970
Genetics is a powerful thing, isn't it?

365
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,280
- You punk...
- You're going to act like my older brother?

366
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,620
It seems like you want to try
and change me or something.

367
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,730
Don't bother.

368
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,700
Our late father gave up
trying a long time ago.

369
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:08,490
If you go around badmouthing me
to Eun Ha Soo like that...

370
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,590
- Isn't that a foul?
- A foul?

371
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,450
Is having feelings for someone
some kind of a game to you?

372
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,030
I don't know what you heard
from our late father.

373
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,240
That girl from my past
got into a car accident

374
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,200
I went to get my father's money
because I felt bad for her.

375
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,080
What did you say?

376
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,640
Look at her.

377
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,250
Does she look like someone
who would jump in front of a car

378
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,040
just to try and win me over?

379
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,050
She doesn't, right?

380
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,410
- She's that girl.
- What are you talking about?

381
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,570
Then...

382
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,700
You lied back then to obtain
that amount of money?

383
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,300
What a rotten punk.

384
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,970
How could you fall for a woman that hard

385
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,010
that you'd take money your father
worked so hard to make?

386
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,610
But she's still the girl
who made me seaweed soup

387
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,840
on my birthday after
my mother passed away.

388
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,260
My father didn't even
remember my birthday.

389
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,240
So I did it because
I was grateful towards her.

390
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,220
I did it because I hated my father.

391
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,620
You immature child.

392
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,870
So you'd better not tell Eun Ha Soo
what you heard from our late father.

393
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,820
None of it will be accurate, you see.

394
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,280
Why didn't you tell him the truth?

395
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,670
Not even once!

396
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:52,700
Because... he never believed me.

397
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,600
Not even once.

398
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,390
Gosh, it's cold out.

399
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,410
What brings you here at this hour?

400
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,340
Gosh, you scared me.

401
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,550
You didn't get kicked out again, did you?

402
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,650
Excuse you.

403
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,910
People might think that
I get kicked out all the time.

404
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,670
It's because you two always seem
to be arguing whenever you meet.

405
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,730
It's because Dae Han won't listen to me.

406
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,010
Can you imagine how upset
the late Chairman Choi would be

407
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,070
to see you two fighting like this?

408
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:45,140
How much could he have
possibly hated his late father

409
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,550
that he would hate me this much?

410
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,290
I can believe that.

411
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,870
Director Choi may need some time.

412
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,060
After he's finished
hating his late father

413
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:04,010
Director Choi will start to miss him.

414
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,420
Will he really do that?

415
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,840
Do you know what my father was like
when I was in grade school?

416
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,250
I wanted to wear pretty clothes

417
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,840
but he'd make me clothes out of leftover
fabric rather than buying me new ones.

418
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,120
I was so embarrassed
to go to school in those clothes.

419
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,070
I really hated my father back then.

420
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,090
But...

421
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:41,330
I find those memories
so precious now.

422
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,300
Of course, our situations
are very different.

423
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,180
The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

424
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,950
Thank you.

425
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,440
It's cold out, so go on in.

426
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,000
Try to wear more layers.

427
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,210
Goodbye.

428
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:14,660
<i>Koong, koong... da.</i>

429
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,500
Koong, koong, da.

430
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,420
Koong, koong.

431
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,860
What's going on with me?

432
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,270
Koong, koong, da.

433
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,670
Koong, koong... whoa!

434
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,640
- Aunt.
- Ah...

435
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,230
Where is Dae Han?

436
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:16,190
Can we talk for a moment... please?

437
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,690
You went out of your way
to drive me out that night.

438
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,850
Since then, I've learned and
come to realize many things.

439
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,970
What is it that you wanted
to talk to me about?

440
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,440
I'm saying this as a member
of this Choi family.

441
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,720
About Director Jung Yi Gun...

442
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,180
Director Jung.

443
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,310
It seems that Choi Shin Hyung
might have forged his identity.

444
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,180
- What?
- Here.

445
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,240
He may have used
that man's identity.

446
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,840
- Who is this guy?
- I'm not sure yet.

447
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,200
I'll look into it some more.

448
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,270
It rather seems like he's trying
to push our family out

449
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,800
and take over Daehan for himself.

450
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,120
What do you mean by that?

451
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,450
I'm just worried that
we might end up...

452
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,350
getting my late father's entire
fortune taken away from us.

453
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,180
It seems like you don't know
what you're talking about.

454
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,030
Despite my brother offering Director Jung
the CEO position and stock options...

455
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,140
He didn't take it.
You don't know anything.

456
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,160
Why didn't he accept the offer, though?

457
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,880
It was such a tempting offer.

458
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,020
Probably because...

459
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,290
He's very proper and
has a clear conscience.

460
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,680
He probably didn't want to work
with someone like Young Dal.

461
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,180
Are you sure you're willing
to exchange this for that?

462
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:29,390
My father left me with some
very important business when he died.

463
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,130
The Cruise Hotel.

464
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,030
From the planning, funds,
staffing, and construction...

465
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,410
Everything is already complete.

466
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,870
You can see it as the prime jewel
of my father's life.

467
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,100
If we're trying to achieve the same goal

468
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,590
we have to make it
a win-win situation.

469
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,540
It's up to you on whether
we can switch it or not.

470
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,210
Okay. You trust me, right?

471
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,360
After you asked me last time...

472
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,610
I did my research to find
any other similar cases.

473
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,070
Africa...

474
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:20,850
He's the head of the village in Zimbabwe.

475
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,640
In 1984, he was in an accident
at the age of 78.

476
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,660
He was about your age.

477
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,260
But one day, he woke up...

478
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,740
and suddenly found himself
transformed into a young man.

479
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,540
The villagers believed that
he'd been by the gods.

480
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:49,230
So they celebrated for
three months and ten days.

481
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,210
Gosh, and our chairman
became homeless.

482
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,170
Shut it. So?

483
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:00,570
A doctor from America presented
this amazing case at a conference.

484
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,570
He was completely ignored.

485
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,060
It was called pure nonsense
without medical reasoning.

486
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,310
But the more surprising truth...

487
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:17,890
Do you know what happened
near the scene of the accident?

488
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,860
A meteor.

489
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,870
There were a lot of falling stars, huh?

490
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,130
At that time, near the village...

491
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,990
a mysterious giant hole appeared.

492
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,750
The head of the village
fell into it, didn't he?

493
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,840
The same thing happened to you, sir.

494
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,760
So...

495
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,950
What happened to him, huh?

496
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,700
- We have no idea.
- What? How come?

497
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,340
That American doctor couldn't
withstand the ridicule...

498
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,360
and left the medical world.

499
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,690
- Manager Sung.
- Yes?

500
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,820
Book a ticket to America.

501
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,230
- To Africa, too.
- Will you go there yourself?

502
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,690
How can I possibly go
without my passport?

503
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,580
Dr. Kim should go instead.

504
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,490
Of course, I should go.

505
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,170
Me?

506
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,060
If you write up a thesis
on what happened to me.

507
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,190
you're sure to earn a Nobel Prize.

508
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,150
No, no way.

509
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,380
- Nobel Prize in Medicine?
- Yes.

510
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,650
Besides, I really need to know.

511
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,990
Whether I'll suddenly
become an old man again

512
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,600
or if I have to continue
living in this body.

513
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,260
What would you prefer, sir?

514
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,480
What do you mean?

515
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,330
Do you wish to go back
to being an old man

516
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:59,730
and take back your title and fortune?

517
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,030
Hurry up and get on the bus.

518
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

519
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,010
Are we going for fun?

520
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,170
We're going for work.

521
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,810
- Just try this.
- Gosh.

522
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,030
Let's go.

523
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,400
Wait up!

524
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Open up.

525
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,610
Gosh, I almost missed it.

526
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,300
Isn't that Choi Shin Hyung?

527
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,420
- You're here, too.
- You're coming with us?

528
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,310
Of course. I'm an employee, too.

529
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,690
I can't miss a day like this.

530
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,290
- Can't you get up?
- What?

531
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,010
Don't you see that
I'm carrying a bag, young man?

532
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,980
Here we go!

533
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,200
Gosh, I'm pretty hungry.

534
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,350
- Want something to eat?
- What?

535
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,840
You always carry snacks
with you, don't you?

536
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,000
Try some.

537
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:33,240
But your taste seems
to be similar with mine.

538
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,520
Mung bean pancakes
sweet potatoes, boiled eggs...

539
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,890
You're an old soul.

540
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,690
My taste in food is usually
like an old person. Here.

541
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,330
Would you like this one, too?

542
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,500
What is it?

543
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,140
It's a peppermint candy.

544
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,150
Look.

545
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,030
Do you give these out
to just anybody, huh?

546
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,980
What do you mean?

547
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,940
Such spineless woman...

548
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,110
Spineless?

549
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,420
Have you been giving out candy
to any man out there?

550
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,470
You're being ridiculous.

551
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,860
How can you go around
giving candy, huh?

552
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,750
What's wrong with giving candy, huh?

553
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:32,940
Don't bother.

554
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,020
If you don't want it,
just give it back.

555
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,100
Don't bother!

556
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,480
Seriously.

557
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,550
It's your first time here, right?

558
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,860
That's right.

559
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,560
This is where I met the late
Chairman Choi for the first time.

560
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,100
You see that over there?

561
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,880
I even washed his hands there.

562
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,810
Why don't you just wash
your hands at least?

563
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,130
Don't bother.

564
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,390
Stay still, will you?

565
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,230
Hands!

566
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,230
There you go.

567
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,950
<i>He was a bit grumpy that day...</i>

568
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,260
<i>but he held out his hands.</i>

569
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,190
<i>Considering he did everything
that I asked of him...</i>

570
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,590
<i>he seemed to have a soft heart.</i>

571
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,310
Hurry up and get the food ready.

572
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,600
Let's get going.

573
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,870
What brings you here?

574
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,680
What do you mean?

575
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,690
Here. Open it.

576
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,010
<i>[Application for Wrongful Termination]</i>

577
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,900
How did you do this?

578
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,960
I ran around to put that together.

579
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,350
We can't just sit back
and suffer like idiots.

580
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,920
I'll see you at work then.

581
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,420
Are you going somewhere?

582
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,080
I'm going to work.

583
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,890
I'm going to see Chairman Choi Young Dal.

584
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,180
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

585
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,290
There no galbi.
Bring some more here.

586
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,930
Please enjoy.

587
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,860
We have galbi here.

588
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,670
Hello.

589
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,540
You didn't have to prepare this much.

590
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,620
Let us know if you need anything else.

591
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,250
- We will.
- Isn't it tasty?

592
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,360
Enjoy.

593
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:45,910
Here it is.

594
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:51,250
- What brings you here?
- I just stopped by.

595
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,660
I wanted to see you, too.

596
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,660
- Me?
- Well...

597
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,660
I came by because I wanted to see you.

598
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,710
Something wrong with that?

599
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,690
Well, you might want
to start working, too.

600
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,740
What?

601
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,300
You told me to trust you that
you'd take care of the interns.

602
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,490
You're being just another chairman, huh?

603
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,950
Do I have to hear something
like that from you?

604
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,160
I'm just worried.

605
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,720
You don't know much about
employment instability, do you?

606
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,280
Gosh, employment instability?

607
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,610
Seriously.

608
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,850
Did you just hit me?

609
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,710
- Did you just give me the look?
- Hey.

610
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,450
I blocked it, didn't I?

611
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,330
- Did you just duck?
- Hey.

612
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,460
What are you doing?

613
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,870
What is it?

614
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,090
Seriously.

615
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,090
What were you doing back there?

616
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,950
What do you mean?
We were just talking.

617
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,550
Talking? Please.

618
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,170
Why are you doing this to me?

619
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,190
Do you like me, by any chance?

620
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,500
What are you doing here?

621
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,240
Go on. Go back to work.

622
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,270
- Why did you come here?
- I came to work.

623
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,180
Chasing after a girl is work?

624
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,290
And you didn't come
chasing after Eun Ha Soo, huh?

625
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,670
Nonsense.

626
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,940
Forget it then.

627
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,850
How wrong is this, huh?

628
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,200
Oh my, I'm sorry.

629
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,280
Ready, set, go!

630
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,590
One, two. Slowly.

631
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,760
What are you doing? Hurry up.
You're a young man.

632
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,630
I'm coming.

633
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,680
Oh my, I've got a leg cramp.

634
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,290
We have to be in sync
to get something done.

635
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,940
Then shall we try to be in sync?

636
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,140
I have a secret accounting ledger.

637
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,030
Shall I talk about it while
the reporters are here?

638
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,220
What do you mean
a secret accounting ledger?

639
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,100
It's the ledger you used
as an emergency fund.

640
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,330
What are you?

641
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:26,120
Let's go before we're too late.

642
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,390
Oh my, Chairman Choi.

643
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,730
What is he doing when
he was so athletic with me?

644
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,960
We should keep going. Let's go.

645
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,680
What is it that you want?

646
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,640
Do you really have it?

647
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:15,060
How could that possibly
be in your hands?

648
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:30,450
Why don't you give it to me now?

649
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:35,990
The Cruise Hotel that my brother
worked on as his final project.

650
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,210
Amazing.

651
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,990
As expected of Go Bong.

652
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,670
Why so important about
how I acquired it?

653
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,130
My life is pathetic,
but so is yours.

654
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,410
Both your sister and your wife...

655
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,270
What are you talking about?

656
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,160
Give it. Give it!

657
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,470
How much money did you
steal all these years, huh?

658
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,940
For building Silver Town, you took
the entire construction cost, huh?

659
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,490
I'll go public with this.

660
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,370
Don't do this, and
tell me what you want.

661
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,090
What do I want?

662
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:30,290
If you give up all your shares
and step down as chairman...

663
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,240
- I'll hand this over.
- What did you say?

664
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:37,250
Give it. Now.

665
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,030
Here we go.

666
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,560
Ma'am, you're tired, aren't you?

667
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,690
I'm almost done, so you can go ahead
and enjoy your dinner later.

668
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:58,540
Oh my. How can you be
so pretty and kind?

669
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,970
I'm a bit pretty and kind, aren't I?

670
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,760
You're so pretty, ma'am.

671
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:12,730
All the men must have been
chasing after you when you were young.

672
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:20,490
I heard this song on the radio.

673
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,250
It goes like this.

674
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:28,070
'When I was young,
I didn't know about youth.'

675
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:31,930
<i>When I was in love, I didn't see love.</i>

676
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,130
- That's the one, right?
- That's right.

677
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,620
That's what getting older is like.

678
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,850
Only after time passes

679
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:48,310
do you learn about
so many things in life.

680
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:53,520
So if there's anything
you'd like to do, do it all.

681
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,350
If you meet someone you like,
fall in love and live happily together.

682
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,810
If you live that way
when you're young

683
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,780
you won't come to regret things
when you're older.

684
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:11,590
I will. I will keep that in mind.

685
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,330
Why did Chairman Choi Young Dal
step down as CEO?

686
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,170
- Who is going to take the job now?
- Are you going to take the job?

687
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,900
- Did you do it yourself?
- Look this way, please.

688
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:56,900
- Please look this way.
- A comment, please.

689
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,350
I will be in charge from now on.

690
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:07,280
I will be in charge of Daehan
and move it forward.

691
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,230
Wait a second.

692
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,150
Look.

693
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,260
What brings you here?

694
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,290
What do you mean?

695
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:36,670
- I came to talk to you about something.
- About what?

696
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,440
Do you want to get in first?

697
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,480
- Get in.
- Okay.

698
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,990
What is it?

699
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,080
I...

700
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,810
It's just that...

701
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,440
How frustrating.

702
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,520
- What is it? Tell me.
- Well...

703
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,270
Remember how you asked me
something yesterday...

704
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,710
At Silver Town.

705
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:27,730
I... wanted to give you an answer.

706
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,050
Ah, I see.

707
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:46,140
Actually...

708
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,450
I don't know if I can do this, but...

709
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,390
So what I'm trying to say is...

710
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,190
To be honest...

711
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:06,990
Look over there.

713
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,750
- That's his car.
- That's right.

714
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,860
Hurry, take pictures.

715
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,160
How do you know her?
Did that take place?

716
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,570
Are you going to sue her?

717
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:25,530
- Please answer.
- Make a comment, please.

718
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,230
The man in the picture...

719
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,080
Is me!

720
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,970
It wasn't Choi Dae Han!
But me, Choi Shin Hyung!
