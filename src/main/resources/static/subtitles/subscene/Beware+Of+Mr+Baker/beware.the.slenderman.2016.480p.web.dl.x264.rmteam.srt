855
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,200

is not the one...

856

857

about the situation.

So, if I'm angry about it...

860
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:12,380
you know, this other family sure as
hell has a right to be angry about it.

861
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:15,300
You know, they could...

862
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:21,970
you know, slam the door
in my face, or, you know,

863
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,980
punch me in the face and knock
me on my ass and you know...

864
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:28,980
they would probably
be justified in doing so.

865
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:32,900
I'm sure they have a lot
of the same questions I do.

866
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:40,620
Did you come to any conclusions about
Anissa, as far as a diagnosis?

867
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:44,950
The predisposing
characteristics that...

868
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,330
made her susceptible
to the delusional disorder...

869
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,590
is what's referred
to as a schizotypy.

870
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:55,380

Snape.

966
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,560
- Who is that?
- A "Harry Potter" character.

967
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:10,270
She also will say not just
that she's heard things,

968
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,030
but that since
as early as three,

969
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:15,570

sensory-perceptual distortions.

970
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:19,570

change slightly or see colors.

971

have much concern

972
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,910
about whether she gets
a long prison sentence,

973
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,500
because, wherever she is,
she will use Vulcan mind control

974
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:33,710

herself believe whatever she likes.

977

to be Vulcan mind control.

979
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,480

980
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,730
She has papers scattered
about the floor.

981
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:54,030
Have you ever suggested
picking them up?

982
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:59,610
Yes, I have. And she stated
that she liked the papers there

983
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:02,870
because they made it feel
less empty.

984
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:05,160
- And she is in the room alone?
- Correct.

985
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,830
She said, "Seeing my friends",

986
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:09,580
"none of these things
are dangerous.

987
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,540
These friends can't disappear.
They're important to me."

988
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:15,630
Was she referring to real world
friends or fictional friends?

989
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:17,170
Fictional, I believe.

990
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:20,510

to hug her family or touch them?

991
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:24,220
- Not in our facility.
- Right.

992
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:27,730
She made clear
that her primary concern

993
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:30,650
was with her relationship
with Slenderman,

994
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:34,230
and she felt like
if she says the wrong thing,

995
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,650
if she somehow
upsets Slenderman,

996
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,700
not only hers but her family's
lives could be in danger.

develops, eventually,

999

negative symptoms
and cognitive symptoms.

1000
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:55,960
What's unique
about Morgan's circumstance

1001
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:59,010
is that a severe course
is so predictable.

1002
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:19,820
Well, we knew her diagnosis before we
went to meet them at the hospital.

1003
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:23,530
We had a conference call
with two of the doctors,

1004
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,330
so we were...
we were prepared.

1005
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:28,410
And the reason that
we all went up there, actually,

1006
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,870
was so that we could tell Morgan

1007
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,000
what her diagnosis was.

1008
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,500
And we thought that it would
be helpful for her to know

1009
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:38,710
that her father also...

1010
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,880
had the same mental illness,

1011
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:45,890
because we had never told her
previously that Matt had schizophrenia.

1012
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:50,230
We were very worried about
the way that she might react

1013
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:53,350
to learning that
she has schizophrenia

1014
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,810
because Morgan...
Morgan's a very smart girl,

1015
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,530
and she's been reading... Which
makes me think that she knew.

1016
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:02,610
Yeah. I think when they told
her, she was probably like...

1017
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:04,941
Not surprised..."Well, that's
what I would've guessed...

1018
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,080
if I had
to diagnose myself."

1019
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:12,660
What I think is
that Morgan knows

1020
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:15,920
that other people
don't see her hallucinations,

1021
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,250
but they're still
very real to her.

1022
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,130
Like, in her head they are real,

1023
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:22,050
and they're there with her.

1024
