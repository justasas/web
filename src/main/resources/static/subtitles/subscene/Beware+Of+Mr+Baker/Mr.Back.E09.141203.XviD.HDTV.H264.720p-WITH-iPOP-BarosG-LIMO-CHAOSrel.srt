1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mr. Back

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:16,520
<i>In the blue Tumen River...</i>

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,590
<i>A boatman is rowing a boat.</i>

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:32,100
<i>A lover from my past is riding on it.</i>

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:48,260
<i>Where did the boat that left go?</i>

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,560
Father.

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,150
<i>My lover I miss so much.</i>

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,340
<i>My lover that I miss so much.</i>

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,160
<i>When will she come back?</i>

10
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:27,860
<i>My lover that I miss so much.</i>

11
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,580
Who are you?

12
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,060
- Stop singing that song.
- What is it?

13
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,240
I said stop singing it!

14
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,530
I know I saw him.
Where did he go?

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,140
Choi Shin Hyung.

16
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,330
What are you doing out here?
You should have come inside.

17
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,040
Why would you stay out here?

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,350
I was just passing by.

19
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,220
I didn't want to
interrupt your conversation.

20
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,530
Come inside with me, will you?

21
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,110
- Let's go.
- Well...

22
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,810
Eun Ha Soo, step away from him.

23
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,450
Director Choi, what's the matter?

24
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,990
Because he's someone who is
eventually going to leave soon.

25
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,270
Don't fall for him.

26
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,460
What do you know to say that?

27
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,490
I think I have a good idea who you are.

28
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,270
- What?
- Chairman Choi Go Bong.

29
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,420
Father.

30
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,050
What nonsense is that?

31
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,380
The reed pipe.

32
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,740
You won't say you learned that
from my late father, too, right?

33
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,610
I learned it from him.

34
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,520
Why do you doubt that?

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,960
As to who you really are...

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,710
- That you could be my father...
- Does that even make sense?

37
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,540
Of course it makes no sense...

38
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,800
but then how can I explain
this strange feeling?

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,880
Stop the nonsense. I'm leaving.

40
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,620
Come on, why are you doing this again?

41
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,370
I thought you two were
becoming close lately.

42
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,130
You give me no choice. Here.

43
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,540
Hold each other's hands.

44
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,890
Leave together, okay? I'll get going.

45
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,990
Goodbye.

46
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,890
<i>[Episode 9]</i>

47
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,690
Dae Han almost figured it out.

48
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,730
He was so close.

49
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,550
Then just tell him
that you're his father.

50
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,010
Why can't you say that?

51
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,370
That's because...

52
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,110
Hey you, where are you taking me, huh?

53
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,210
What are you doing?

54
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,800
I asked what you were doing!

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,810
Thanks to the creature who claims
he was in his 70s and is now in his 30s

56
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,270
we now see the possibility of
discovering the fountain of youth.

57
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,770
No! No!

58
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,560
Let go of me! Let go!

59
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,730
What are you doing? Let go of me!

60
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,180
You bastards! I will kill you all
when I get out of here.

61
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,950
If people find out what happened to me

62
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,080
they'll try to do experiments on me.

63
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,300
What kind of imagination is that?

64
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,640
You've become quite weak, haven't you?

65
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,610
What I was saying is that
you're still his family.

66
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,780
You should tell him one day.

67
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,220
The family I used to know has changed.

68
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,140
I'm looking into this as
Choi Shin Hyung, not Choi Go Bong.

69
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,780
You scared me.

70
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,880
I left you two alone so you could talk.
Why are you here?

71
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,620
How flustered must it have
made Choi Shin Hyung?

72
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,460
How could you possibly say that
he was someone already deceased?

73
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,220
I don't know what it all
might sound like to you...

74
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,070
But he resembles him so much
that I had to say it.

75
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,800
But still, how could you possibly
land on such an absurd conclusion?

76
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,710
Forget it. I'm hungry,
so let's just go and eat.

77
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,930
Have you ever been to
a pojangmacha before?

78
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,840
Of course, I have.

79
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,080
I really like places like this.

80
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,180
Don't they have a menu here?

81
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,060
- Here they have...
- Oh my.

82
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,670
Chicken feet, stir-fried cartilage,
chicken gizzard, stir-fried eel, and cockles.

83
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:58,310
Today, I can recommend
the fresh cockles.

84
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,120
Other than that, we have healthy items
like ginkgo nuts, steamed pupa...

85
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,140
If you are hungry,
there's udon and ramen.

86
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,520
What do you think?

87
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,060
Will you drink with me?

88
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,230
Slow down.
No one is hurrying you.

89
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,790
I see that you can drink.

90
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,970
I'm just like my late father.

91
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,020
- No one has ever beat me in drinking.
- Is that right?

92
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,710
Then should we bet on it?

93
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,960
I'm Chairman Choi Go Bong's son, too.

94
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,960
What's wrong? Not feeling confident?

95
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,140
Fine.

96
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,260
I'll fix your drinking habits tonight.

97
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,620
- Please stop.
- Come on.

98
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,000
Drink some liquor and work it out.

99
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,420
Bring more liquor!

100
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,840
You still have some here.

101
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,550
There's something about me
that you should know.

102
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,820
I'd drink from my late father's
hard liquor cabinet

103
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,510
without him knowing
when I was in middle school.

104
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,890
I'd fill the empty bottles
with barley tea afterward.

105
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,580
I bet my father never knew
about that until he passed away.

106
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,540
Our late father knew about that.

107
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,110
You drank three bottles of
hard liquor he treasured.

108
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,970
Those were 30-year-old liquors.

109
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,110
He also knew that you even
consumed a bottle of wild ginseng wine.

110
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,920
Father...

111
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,330
Are you my father?

112
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,580
Father. I think you're my father.

113
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,640
Father, Father! Father!

114
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,620
Father, I've missed you.

115
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,850
Father, Father.

116
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:53,310
Father, Father.

117
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,460
Father.

118
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,530
I'm... I'm your father, okay?

119
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,640
Don't be ridiculous.

120
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,160
My late father, you see...

121
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,450
he was very cool.

122
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,830
He was very intelligent, too.

123
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,030
And his nose was pointier than yours.

124
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,160
He didn't have deep wrinkles
around his mouth like you do.

125
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,980
Well, he had a nasty temper...

126
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,580
I'm the one who's crazy
for thinking that you were him.

127
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,740
Father.

128
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,430
How did he figure it out?

129
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,610
Could it be that he can
recognize his father or what?

130
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,240
<i>[Choi Go Bong, you have 22 days
to return on your payment.]</i>

131
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,630
The days... have dwindled again.

132
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,250
Does this mean that
I only have this long to live?

133
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,470
If not...

134
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,240
My youth will last...

135
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,150
48 days?

136
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,760
What does this mean?

137
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,960
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

138
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,910
How did I get home last night?

139
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,180
Man, why did you drink
so much last night?

140
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,320
Here it is. Catch.

141
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,500
Shin Hyung gave it to me.
It must be yours.

142
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,000
Hello there.

143
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,610
Oh my.

144
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,240
He's just like my late father
who puts on too much toner.

145
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,320
He looks like he's in his thirties.

146
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,260
It's completely nuts.

147
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,120
<i>Step away from Choi Shin Hyung.</i>

148
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,900
Because he's someone who is
eventually going to leave soon.

149
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,610
<i>Don't fall for him.</i>

150
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,250
He's going to leave soon?

151
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,280
What did he mean that
he's going to leave?

152
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,840
I have no idea what he meant by that.

153
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,740
This week

154
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,380
we'll be evaluating you based on
the comments from our guests.

155
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,020
Try your best to keep the guests happy.

156
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,020
- Smile.
- Smile!

157
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,230
Now, things we should
never say to our guests.

158
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,800
Shout out three things we never say.

159
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,330
'You cannot do that.'
'We don't have it.' 'I don't know.'

160
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,940
Three things that
all employees should do!

161
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,820
Smile on our faces,
kindness in our hearts

162
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,600
- and satisfaction for our guests.
- Good, now back to work!

163
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,520
Thank you.

164
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,910
What do I do?

165
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,280
If we receive negative feedback,
we won't be hired as full-time employees.

166
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,770
That's completely up to chance.

167
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,980
Let's hope to get nice guests. Fighting!

168
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,190
- Fighting!
- Let's go.

169
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,230
Welcome.
How may I help you?

170
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,710
Are you certain that Manager Sung
helped him in changing his identity?

171
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,240
It seems that way.

172
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,460
Why would he have
to steal someone else's identity?

173
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,270
Shall I have lunch with my brother?

174
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,970
I'll have the same thing, please.

175
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,240
Isn't it enough to see you at home?
Now you want to eat with me here?

176
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,470
Can you imagine how jealous
others are of us?

177
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,030
Don't you think so, Manager Hong?

178
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,780
- Then...
- Stick around for a bit.

179
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,300
One of the branch hotels
of our resort...

180
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,540
I'm talking about Seohae Hotel.

181
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,570
If you let me take it over

182
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,000
- I'll revive it.
- Do you even know what it is?

183
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,230
It's a headache that has pulled in
no profits for the past three years.

184
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,580
It's not profitable,
but a waste to abandon.

185
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,720
It's our late father's inheritance.

186
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,730
- Don't even think about it.
- How come?

187
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,710
The Cruise Hotel from our late father
wasn't enough for you?

188
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,600
To revive Seohae Hotel,
you need a special team.

189
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,010
Did you have anything planned?

190
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,610
About Seohae Hotel...

191
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,750
It may look like a headache
and a lousy hotel chain...

192
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,890
but actually, it was
our late father's hidden card.

193
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,990
I thought I told you not to
butt in on my business again.

194
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,470
And Seohae Hotel is not
something for you to talk about.

195
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,940
Seriously.

196
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,510
Hey, Choi Dae Han.

197
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,550
A premium outlet where
Seohae Hotel is located?

198
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,890
- Push forward with it.
- Are you serious?

199
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,770
Bravo. Great. Good decision.

200
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,660
As expected, your hegemony
is smart and elite.

201
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,040
Honey, why are you suddenly
in speaking English lately?

202
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,630
Was my pronunciation okay?

203
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,370
Yi Hye humiliated me because of it.

204
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,280
I decided to speak in English
from now on.

205
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,020
It's great that you two think alike.

206
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,140
Of course.

207
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,700
If anybody works like we do,
there's nothing they can't do.

208
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,270
No problem. You can do it!

209
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,570
Enough.

210
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,040
Director Jung, I hope things will
work out with Manager Hong.

211
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,270
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- No, it's okay.

212
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,610
Manager Hong? Wait a minute.

213
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,680
She seems to have feelings
for Dae Han, though.

214
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,110
No. Don't act like an amateur.

215
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:04,300
Anyway, the bottom line is that
we have to make this work, right?

216
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,270
That's right.

217
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,480
No problem.

218
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,490
Mission Impossible.

219
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,450
Miss, can I talk to you?

220
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,260
- Yes, ma'am.
- About this resort...

221
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,830
I designed this resort myself.
How do you like it?

222
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,240
- Did you really?
- Yes, I did.

223
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,940
- Can I have an espresso?
- Yes.

224
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,820
This espresso isn't hot enough.

225
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,550
- Did you expect me to drink this?
- I'm sorry. I will bring another one.

226
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,330
And what's wrong with this blanket?

227
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,840
- Don't you have cotton?
- Pardon?

228
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,980
Also, how come my name isn't on here?

229
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,310
I'm the one who designed this place!
How come my name isn't in here?

230
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,680
Did you do that?

231
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,910
- How come my name isn't on it?
- Please, ma'am.

232
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,320
I designed this place.
Why isn't my name on it, huh?

233
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,000
- Tell me why my name isn't on it. Why?
- Ma'am.

234
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,860
- Why not?
- What are you doing now?

235
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,400
Let go of me!

236
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,140
Go Bong.

237
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,230
Go Bong.

238
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,940
Go Bong. You're Go Bong, right?

239
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,990
- What's going on?
- Ma'am.

240
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,130
This is Chairman Choi Go Bong's son.

241
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,280
What do you mean?
I can tell that he's Choi Go Bong.

242
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,090
You may fool other people,
but you can't fool me.

243
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,560
Excuse me, what are you doing?

244
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,490
Can you let go of me?

245
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,650
- Do something, will you?
- Go Bong.

246
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,790
It's me.

247
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,390
It's me, Go Bong...

248
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,790
Go Bong.

249
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,590
Go Bong.

250
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,570
Hi there.

251
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,180
Director Choi, no, President Choi.

252
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,740
Is everything okay?

253
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,100
Yes.

254
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,160
Can I ask you something?

255
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,630
Yes. What is it?

256
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,430
There's something I can't throw away.

257
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,140
But if I had to throw it away

258
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,980
what should I do?

259
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,840
Well, I'm not sure.

260
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,430
If the reality is different
from what you pictured

261
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,590
shouldn't you make
the reality work for you?

262
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,850
You're an idealist, aren't you?

263
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,020
Could I also ask you a question?

264
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,010
Everyone is worried because
of the guests' evaluation.

265
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,170
I want to try my best
to do a good job...

266
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,550
but if a person doesn't know what
my intentions are, what should I do?

267
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,060
That must be very upsetting.

268
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,870
Then you should let the person know.

269
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,550
No matter what it takes.

270
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,320
- You're a realist, huh?
- Am I?

271
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,570
What was that about?

272
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,850
Should we pick and choose
the guests from now on?

273
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,030
What are you mumbling about?

274
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,710
Let's go. Hurry.

275
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:50,180
<i>Do you have a different plan
for Seohae Hotel?</i>

276
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,440
The only way for President Choi Dae Han
to persuade the board of directors

277
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,080
is if he proves himself in
handling Seohae Hotel.

278
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,150
When did you start to have feelings
for him, Manager Hong?

279
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:09,400
I understand it was an order from
the late Chairman Choi, however...

280
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,810
Could you take this away?

281
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,010
He doesn't eat peanut sauce.

282
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,810
Aren't I right?

283
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,290
Chairman Choi Go Bong.

284
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,180
I saw Director Jung earlier.

285
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,560
I think he was asking Kang Gi Chun
to do something in secret.

286
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,770
Do you have any idea what that might be?

287
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,380
There will be a lot of people
coming to see you soon.

288
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,190
Pardon?

289
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,870
In preparation for that day,
I'll write something for you.

290
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,100
What will you write?

291
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,200
You have a gallstone.

292
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,110
- Gallstone?
- Yes.

293
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,780
Can you see it over there?

294
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,670
Inside the heart artery

295
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,270
there's something that
looks like a small rock.

296
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,790
A small rock?

297
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,740
Why would it be in there?

298
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,600
Could t be the meteor?

299
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,100
Meteor?

300
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,630
What should I do then?

301
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,110
You can get it surgically removed,
or use other non-surgical methods, too.

302
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,870
Would you like me to schedule
the surgery then?

303
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,630
No, I'll come by again
at a later time.

304
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,880
How come Dr. Kim hasn't
called from Africa yet?

305
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,370
It may take a long time.

306
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,850
He said he'd definitely win
the Nobel Prize this time.

307
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,490
- I have sweet potatoes!
- Great to have them here!

308
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,490
- Ta-da.
- Hey.

309
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,350
Don't eat them here
Move them away!

310
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,630
How picky is your customer this time?

311
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:16,140
He's as picky as the late Chairman Choi
I met at Silver town.

312
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,690
Oh my.

313
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,120
But he didn't have Alzheimer's.

314
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,800
- Alzheimer's?
- Yes.

315
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,890
- He was close.
- It's coming along.

316
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,120
<i>Eun Ha Soo, what are you up to?</i>

317
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,650
That's fine.

318
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,750
I'll eat some later.

319
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,430
I'm not an idiot, am I?

320
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,110
What kind of moron am I?

321
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,200
Why would you call?

322
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,660
Did you mean to ask
what I was up to?

323
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,160
Did you understand that?

324
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,560
How could someone not able
to text in this day and age?

325
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,750
Well, I just never had
a reason to text.

326
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,190
I'll make sure to teach you
when I see you tomorrow.

327
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,480
Oh, will you?

328
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,400
Did you text me wondering
what I was up to?

329
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,230
Well...

330
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,310
If you're free tomorrow,
will you go somewhere with me?

331
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,250
Sure.

332
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,300
The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo!

333
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,170
Wow!

334
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,660
Wow. For me, too?

335
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,300
- Get in!
- Let's go!

336
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,230
What is this place?

337
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,240
Just come down. Hello.

338
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,870
Are you two a couple?

339
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,140
Yes, but we prefer to get
our massages separately.

340
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,010
Can I check your skin types first?
Sir, please come this way.

341
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,220
I can't do that. I won't do it.

342
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,920
Seriously. Sit down.
I don't want to waste the coupons.

343
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,710
A lot of men come to places
like these nowadays.

344
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,190
- Don't they?
- Of course.

345
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,020
That's amazing.

346
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,370
This is it.

347
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,750
Here, go in and have a good time.

348
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,060
This is so wrong.

349
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,930
Are there any male employees here?

350
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,820
How long do I have to be here for?

351
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,930
- What's the matter?
- What?

352
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,830
- It's nothing. I'm okay.
- One second. I'll be right over.

353
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,960
No way. Don't come over!

354
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,970
Don't you come over!

355
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,210
I feel like I've just
experienced the afterlife.

356
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,650
Your skin has become
all plump and rested.

357
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,450
What am I supposed to do?

358
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,360
Why does she keep getting more beautiful?

359
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,100
- What is this?
- You don't know what this is?

360
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,560
This is what a date should be.

361
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
It's the main menu at a cafe.

362
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,560
An herb tonic tea with egg drops.

363
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,490
I see. A herb tonic tea
with egg drops...

364
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,200
But I'm not so sure about the yolk.

365
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,030
Shh. Just try some.

366
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,240
You may not have tried it yet...

367
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,960
but you can never stop with one sip.

368
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,710
That's what this herb tonic tea
with egg drops is all about.

369
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,930
Oh, it's tasty.

370
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,790
See? What did I say?

371
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,470
By the way, about the woman
from yesterday...

372
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,600
she said she designed
Daehan Resort herself.

373
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,730
What? Did she?

374
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,380
She said she designed the building
and asked if I liked it.

375
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:43,200
She was mad at me because
her name wasn't in the pamphlet.

376
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,330
Was she Designer Park then?

377
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,420
Then did she really design the place?

378
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,800
Come to think of it,
she does resemble her.

379
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,260
But she seems to have dementia.

380
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,830
She walks around the hotel barefoot.

381
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,110
I might have heard that
she had Alzheimer's.

382
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,000
My word. She was so
smart and pretty, too.

383
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,120
- How could she have dementia?
- You knew her well?

384
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:28,660
- No, I heard about her from my father.
- I see.

385
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:34,100
She must have been confused
since you two look so much alike.

386
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,970
Seeing her act that way, she must've been
very close to the late Chairman Choi.

387
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,810
No, she wasn't.

388
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:45,360
She was just a business partner.

389
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:54,130
I have a feeling that I'll like
this herb tonic tea with egg drops.

390
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,310
You will, right? I thought so.

391
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,590
Seohae Hotel?

392
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,830
If you spend tons of money
in renovating the place

393
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,840
- Do you think it will revive itself?
- Director Jung.

394
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,250
Don't you know that
we're in a financial crisis?

395
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,190
It's supposed to be a busy season now.

396
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,320
But the profit isn't even close
to 30 percent of what it was last year.

397
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,760
We'll find more investors.

398
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,320
How much damage will you bring upon
again using someone else's money?

399
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,810
Why would you act this way
when you want me to fail so badly?

400
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,970
What?

401
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,020
I haven't even started
any kind of construction yet.

402
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,880
Why? Because if I borrow money
from the resort

403
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,360
you think you'll be the one
to suffer the consequences?

404
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,950
President Choi.

405
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,600
Bring me something innovative

406
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
instead of this hideous business plan.

407
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,190
Since that's the only way
you'll receive any funding.

408
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,580
This is how anything gets started.

409
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,850
Don't be discouraged.

410
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,550
If my father were here...

411
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,590
What would he do right now?

412
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,920
I'm telling you that's not right.

413
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,930
The characters for Choi
for your name is over here.

414
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,810
- You add this dot here.
- Okay.

415
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,490
- What is this?
- How can you not press it properly?

416
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,200
I won't do it. I won't do it!

417
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,300
I'd rather not do it.

418
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,450
You're impossible.

419
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,760
Here, look at it.

420
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,480
If you want to add something,
press this, okay?

421
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,010
I know that.
I told you I knew that.

422
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,170
Gosh, what is this?
Choi Shin Nyeo?

423
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,460
You wouldn't listen to me
and are so impatient.

424
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,660
How mean. Give it to me.
I'll learn it by myself.

425
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,630
- Give it to me.
- Don't bother.

426
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,800
- I'll do it by myself.
- You're so stubborn.

427
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,310
Listen carefully now.

428
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,900
This is the last time
I'm going to teach you.

429
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,620
- Okay, then do it slowly.
- Okay.

430
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,540
If you want to write Choi Shin Hyung,
you have to press here...

431
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,370
There you go! Then continue
with the other dot.

432
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,840
There you go again. And then?

433
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,200
S, right?

434
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,630
That's right.
I knew you would be good at this.

435
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,340
And then? Keep going.

436
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,050
O. You're so good!

437
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,540
You're a quick learner!

438
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,220
Next...

439
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,890
Oh my.

440
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,360
Ma'am.

441
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,770
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, you're the one from last time.

442
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,830
By the way, where is the entrance?

443
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,320
It's that way.

444
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,490
That's right. I came from that way.

445
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,420
I'm so forgetful these days.

446
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,480
I don't know if I was being rude
to you, by any chance.

447
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,640
No, you weren't.

448
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,500
Ma'am, please take this.

449
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,150
You dropped it last time,
and it was ruined, so I made a new one.

450
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,810
I don't know if you will like it.

451
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,240
Oh my, it's so pretty.

452
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,530
Thank you.

453
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Hello there.

454
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,210
Designer Park.

455
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,060
I'm Choi Go Bong.

456
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,290
Oh my, what a bad man you are.

457
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:38,610
Do you know how long I waited for you
at Seoul Station that day?

458
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:43,090
I told you not to wait for me
because I was seeing someone else.

459
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,240
How pretty was she for you
to reject someone like me?

460
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,330
Oh my.

461
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,090
Designer Park.

462
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:58,320
It was good seeing you.
I thought you were dead.

463
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,710
I just stopped by to confirm.

464
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,720
I have no regrets now that
I've seen you before I die.

465
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,080
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

466
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,010
At the time...

467
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,330
I didn't know much about all this.

468
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:22,840
I know how you feel. I know.

469
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,890
For as long as you live

470
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:33,590
I wish you a long and healthy life.

471
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,840
Thank you.

472
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:00,710
You two look good together.

473
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,500
Don't let go of this hand,
and care for each other.

474
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,830
live happily ever after...

475
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,650
until the very end.

476
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,130
You don't have to help me.

477
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,750
Two heads are always better than one.

478
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,090
How were you supposed
to finish this on your own?

479
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,650
Thank you.

480
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,480
Unlike your appearance,
you do have some designer sense.

481
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,980
I'm good at picking the pretty ones.

482
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,290
- Does that include me?
- What?

483
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,670
Does it sound like that to you?

484
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,460
No, I was asking if
I dressed this up well.

485
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,340
Well, it's bearable.

486
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,890
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

487
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,950
I'll make the best Christmas tree ever.

488
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,880
Whee...

489
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,790
We need to hang this in order
to complete this tree.

490
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,380
Hold on.

491
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,220
What is this? Is it a back scratcher?

492
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,230
- Will you hang it, too?
- You're so old-fashioned.

493
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,900
This is not a back scratcher,
but a selfie stick.

494
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,360
- What stick?
- Since you've worked hard

495
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,920
we should take a selfie together.

496
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,280
Here, hold this for a second.

497
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,180
Put this on.

498
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,400
Here we go now.

499
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,320
Smile, will you? Tree.

500
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,830
- Tree.
- Tree.

501
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,000
- That's amazing.
- Isn't it?

502
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,840
Let's take one more.
Get closer to make us seem close.

503
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,510
Here. One, two...

504
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,780
Where have you been?

505
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,400
What is this? Did you buy it?

506
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,420
Why do you care?

507
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,910
What is he up to, huh?

508
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,450
Is he really dating or what?

509
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,570
Oh my.

510
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,370
<i>This is the photo we took earlier.</i>

511
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,470
<i>If you click the photo,
it will enlarge.</i>

512
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,390
Oh my.

513
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,020
How can we look so young?

514
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:14,020
She's so pretty. So pretty.

515
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,330
It sounds like you two
went out on a date, huh?

516
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,170
What do you mean a date?

517
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,400
How long has it been
since you met him?

518
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,860
How many days? I don't know.

519
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,110
Women are supposed to
keep track of those things.

520
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,530
That way, you guys can celebrate
your 100th day of being together.

521
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,040
- 100th day?
- It will be here before you know it.

522
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,940
There are lots of couples who break up
even before their 100th day.

523
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:59,010
Gosh, why are you
talking about break-ups?

524
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,550
It won't happen.

525
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,500
What is that?
You're so into him, aren't you?

526
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,150
- You're falling in love, aren't you?
- What are you talking about? Go away.

527
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,170
How far did you go with him, huh?

528
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,620
What do you mean how far
Go to bed.

529
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,460
- You did, didn't you?
- Go to bed.

530
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,660
- Something happened, didn't it?
- Go to bed now!

531
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,620
Are you seeing Eun Ha Soo these days?

532
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,250
- What nonsense.
- You're not dating, right?

533
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,390
Okay.

534
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:52,250
Why does he keep poking me like that?

535
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:02,630
Congratulations on being chosen
as the employee of the week.

536
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:06,340
Thank you.

537
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,120
If you become a full-time employee

538
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,770
which department would
you choose to work at?

539
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,480
A full-time employee?

540
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,860
Oh my, I'm not sure.

541
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,620
- How about the Management Support team?
- Pardon?

542
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,580
If you do dispatched work for
the Management Support team now

543
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,660
you'll receive a higher score
to be hired on staff.

544
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,040
I think it's a good idea since
the salary is good and the job is secure.

545
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,620
You're going to send her to work
for the Management Support team?

546
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,290
Yes, I was considering that.

547
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,050
You'll be working on accounting.
Is that okay?

548
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:45,330
I truly appreciate your consideration...

549
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:50,210
But I think it will be better to give
that opportunity to somebody else.

550
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,110
It's a good opportunity.
Why not take it?

551
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,870
I actually have something else in mind.

552
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,020
If possible, I'd like to try to pursue it.

553
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,330
What kind of work is that?

554
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,150
So what did you tell them?

555
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,690
A job where I can make people
happy and smile.

556
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,550
You should have become a comedienne.

557
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:20,330
When it comes to comedy,
Nam Chul and Nam Sung Nam are the best.

558
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,490
- Pardon?
- Well...

559
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,250
If you want to make people laugh,
that's what a comedian does.

560
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,430
It's not about making people laugh...

561
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:31,960
What do you call it, someone who
creates memories for other people?

562
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,350
What are you saying?

563
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,980
Women shouldn't act cheap.

564
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,290
Why would you want to create
something like that for some man?

565
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,450
That's not what I meant.

566
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:46,230
Gosh, forget I said anything.

567
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:51,890
Anyhow, you chose
your dream over money, huh?

568
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:55,300
I envy your youth.

569
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,980
Choi Shin Hyung, do you have a dream?

570
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,960
My dream?

571
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,430
I can't even remember
the last time I've had a dream.

572
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:10,410
Is it your dream to make money?
It can't be, right?

573
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,860
My dream, huh?

574
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,480
Ta-da. I have movie tickets.

575
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,590
This is the prize for being chosen
as the employee of the week.

576
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:29,670
Wow, you are doing really well.

577
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,310
Congrats.

578
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:35,900
By the way, who would you
go to the movies with?

579
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:40,000
I have someone to go with.
Are you done?

580
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,730
What is it? Are you disappointed?

581
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,900
What disappointment?

582
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,710
So who are you going with?

583
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,590
Oh, I have a call.

584
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,170
Hi, Woo Young.

585
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,230
You want to go to the movies with me?

586
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,090
No.

587
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:08,840
I've already decided to go
with Choi Shin Hyung.

588
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,520
A movie...

589
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,810
With me?

590
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,840
When will we go?

591
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,310
Tonight.

592
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,110
I got it.

593
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,470
See you later.

594
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,180
<i>Do you have a dream, Choi Shin Hyung?</i>

595
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,270
<i>Is it your dream to make money?</i>

596
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,530
<i>It can't be, right?</i>

597
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,490
Welcome.

598
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,490
- Any flowers you're looking for?
- Well...

599
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,800
This is my first time buying flowers...

600
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,510
I want to give them to someone.

601
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:30,440
A present for a lady, right?

602
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,630
We should know what she might like.

603
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,690
What is she like?

604
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:41,750
Well, it's hard to describe her
in one word.

605
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,080
She's very slender...

606
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,310
But she's very full of energy.

607
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:52,760
She's cheerful, tough,
and energetic...

608
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,370
so she makes others feel good
just by watching her.

609
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,800
She's plain-looking...

610
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,130
but I can somehow spot her
right away in a crowd.

611
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,460
She's quite cute, too.

612
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,100
I don't ever get tired
of looking at her.

613
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,480
She's one pretty woman.

614
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,060
What do you mean?

615
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,410
Why would I help steal an identity
for Choi Shin Hyung?

616
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,200
What is this?

617
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,310
How did you get a hold of this?

618
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:42,560
There will be a lot of people
coming to see you soon.

619
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,060
Of course you could misunderstand.

620
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,940
The late Chairman Choi
asked me in such a hurry...

621
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:05,930
<i>I hope that no one suspects my son,
Choi Shin Hyung's identity.</i>

622
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,030
<i>Even if I wasn't the one
who took care of him</i>

623
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:13,560
<i>he was in a difficult position
to live in hiding for my reputation.</i>

624
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,730
<i>I don't want anyone
to ask questions about that.</i>

625
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,340
After Choi Shin Hyung
lost his mother in an accident

626
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,480
he had his identity stolen.

627
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,850
He was living wandering around
for a while and had a tough life.

628
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,200
What are you doing?

629
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,060
No need to know. It's nothing.

630
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,440
Are you writing your bucket list?

631
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,500
You bastard.

632
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,760
By the way, why 48 days?

633
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,360
It's not like 49 days when
a dead soul can wander afterward...

634
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,070
48...

635
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,820
48...

636
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:28,970
- By any chance...
- What is it?

637
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,850
Four Noble Truths, Eight Sufferings?

638
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,640
- Eun Ha Soo.
- You scared me.

639
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,230
I heard you were chosen to be
the employee of the week.

640
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:48,500
Can we have some tea and celebrate?

641
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,690
I already have plans for tonight.

642
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,850
It won't take long.

643
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,160
Really? What is it?

644
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,990
It's just this and that, you know.

645
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:05,180
Eun Ha Soo.

646
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,820
I told you this would help
make a dream come true.

647
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,040
Why give this to me?

648
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,090
You said you'd become someone who
will create memories for others, right?

649
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,440
I hope it comes true.

650
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,440
But this is a keepsake
from your late mother.

651
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,580
- I can't accept this.
- Don't take it off.

652
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:43,780
If it's too much, then wear it
for one week and give it back.

653
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,460
You can't just give it back now.

654
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:19,790
Get out of the car, so we can talk.

655
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,080
What's up with him?

656
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,890
What do you want to talk about?

657
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,130
- Eun Ha Soo...
- What about her?

658
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:39,750
Do you really like her?

659
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,660
Why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

660
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,270
Do you like her too?

661
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:48,450
- I asked if you liked her.
- Yes.

662
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,210
I think I like her.

663
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,610
I don't remember being loved much

664
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:58,610
so I didn't know how to
love someone else.

665
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:04,250
I suddenly felt like
being sincere to someone.

666
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,620
I want to fix things for her

667
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,450
and I want to treat her well.

668
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:12,510
If that's what people call
to like someone...

669
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,420
it might be true then.

670
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,410
I understand.

671
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,280
But why would you ask about that?

672
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,630
What is it? What's wrong?

673
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:54,150
What's wrong, Choi Shin Hyung?
Choi Shin Hyung.

674
00:57:55,010 --> 00:58:00,100
<i>The Four Noble Truths,
Eight Sufferings...</i>

675
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,710
<i>According to the sacred book</i>

676
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:07,630
<i>there are eight sufferings
that humans go through.</i>

677
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:11,910
<i>Birth, aging, sickness, and death.</i>

678
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:14,260
<i>These are the four of them.</i>

679
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:22,270
No. Don't.

680
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:25,450
Why do you keep saying no?
I'll go get her.

681
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:29,550
- I'll go get her!
- Who will you go get?

682
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:32,340
- Manager Sung.
- This is crazy.

683
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,900
I will go get her!

684
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:38,250
Gosh, seriously!

685
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,530
<i>I've arrived here and
am waiting for you now.</i>

686
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,550
<i>You say goodbye to your loved ones.</i>

687
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:51,970
<i>The pain of saying goodbye
to your loved ones.</i>

688
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,110
<i>The pain of not getting
what you want.</i>

689
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,140
- I will start the anesthesia.
- Okay.

690
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:06,840
<i>The pain of not getting
what you desire.</i>

691
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,100
- What happened? Did he go into surgery?
- Yes.

692
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,450
He shouldn't have surgery.
We should stop the surgery right now.

693
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:27,860
<i>And the pain you get from your desires.</i>

694
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:33,180
<i>It's the pain you get from
