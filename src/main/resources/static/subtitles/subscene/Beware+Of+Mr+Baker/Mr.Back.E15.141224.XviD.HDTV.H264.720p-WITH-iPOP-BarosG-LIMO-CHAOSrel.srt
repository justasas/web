00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mr. Back

2
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,970
Eun Ha Soo.

3
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,550
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,560
I have something to tell you.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,390
Actually, about who I really am...

6
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,010
What do you mean who you are?
You're Choi Shin Hyung.

7
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,790
On the day when the meteor fell

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,320
I was involved in an accident here
with the late Chairman Choi Go Bong.

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,040
Funny thing is...

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,470
I don't know if
it's because you're his son...

11
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,550
but it was amazing that your pain
stopped when I was with you.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,230
If that's the case...

13
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,890
I could be of your help.

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,730
Thank you for holding his hand
at that time.

15
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,710
I think that was the reason
why I was able to survive.

16
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,900
And...

17
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,160
That Choi Go Bong is...

18
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,040
What is it?

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,090
Who are you? Go away!

20
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,710
- Choi Shin Hyung.
- I said go!

21
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,340
- What is it? Are you okay?
- I said go away! Go!

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,260
- Choi Shin Hyung.
- Go away!

23
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,440
- I said go away!
- Are you okay?

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,080
- I still have time!
- Choi Shin Hyung!

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,810
What is it all of a sudden?

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,570
- Are you okay?
- What?

27
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,830
Yes, I'm fine.

28
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,850
What did you see?

29
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,010
- What was that about?
- It's just that...

30
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,670
I felt dizzy...

31
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,920
Can you drive?

32
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,600
Yes, I'll be fine.

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,060
This is where the late
Chairman Choi's accident took place...

34
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,820
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,230
I'm saying I'm fine now.

36
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,710
Gosh, now that I got some cold air

37
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,770
I feel much better.

38
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,850
Did you buy that for me?

39
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,310
I'm not good at coming up
with long answers...

40
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,650
but I'm good with short answers.

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,690
So don't try to beat around the bush,
but just tell me yes or no.

42
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,590
- What do you mean?
- You're very unwell.

43
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,278
It's because you have a meteor
in your heart, isn't it?

44
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,460
Was it Manager Sung
or Dae Han who told you?

45
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,130
If it made you see hallucinations,
it's quite serious.

46
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,360
Why are you being stubborn
when you need surgery?

47
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,130
'Shik Ja Woo Whan.'

48
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,490
It means, 'the unknown is the cure-all.'

49
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,620
Don't you know 'Yuk Ji Sa Ji' if you like
four-character proverbs that much?

50
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,090
- What?
- That means, 'put yourself in my shoes.'

51
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,500
If I were that sick

52
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,140
would you be able to not care?

53
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,770
Would you be able to
just let me take care of myself?

54
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,920
Why would you be that sick?

55
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,280
I'm worried sick right now!

56
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,020
I... no matter how much
I try, I can't sleep.

57
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,690
Even if I manage to fall asleep,
I wake up in nightmares.

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,900
Do you have any idea how scared
I am because of you right now?

59
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,660
Eun Ha Soo.

60
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,510
I was... scared, too.

61
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,780
Wondering if something would go wrong...

62
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,460
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

63
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,010
Wonder if even that wish
will leave a scar...

64
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,790
I was afraid of that.

65
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,170
Choi Shin Hyung.

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,640
You told me to answer
yes or no, right?

67
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,860
Can you ask me again?

68
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,270
Will you have the surgery?

69
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,370
Yes.

70
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,360
I will have the surgery.

71
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,290
Now... can you relax
and sleep at night?

72
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,280
- Would you like to try this?
- Sure.

73
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,690
Here it is.

74
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,980
<i>[The results confirm that these two sets
of fingerprints belong to the same person.]</i>

75
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,870
How can this be?

76
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,110
How can this be possible?

77
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,960
What do you think about my offer?

78
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,390
It's not bad.

79
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,960
Chairman Choi received a promotion
that day of the sinkhole accident.

80
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,020
Why did he have to get into
an accident on such a nice day?

81
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,920
Wait.

82
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,080
- Is that?
- That is...

83
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,440
someone putting money in
Director Cho Young Dal's car.

84
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,870
He was taking it out,
not putting the money in.

85
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,540
The one who took the money
from him that day...

86
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,030
put the money in
the late Chairman's car.

87
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,490
- Is that perhaps?
- Jung Yi Gun?

88
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,040
We need solid evidence.

89
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,510
Wait, what is this?

90
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,110
Isn't he Prosecutor Yang?

91
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,320
Why was he there?

92
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,600
- Where is this place?
- It's the street near the sinkhole.

93
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,970
If you look at the time

94
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,050
that's right before the accident.

95
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,060
Then he was waiting there
expecting an accident?

96
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,070
No way. It was a natural disaster.

97
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,260
Wait a second. Does this mean...

98
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,440
that he knew there was money in the car.

99
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,270
He was already waiting
for my father there.

100
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,970
We don't have much time, so hurry up.

101
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,330
Bring Choi Shin Hyung in for questioning.

102
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,190
I can't bring him in
without any charges.

103
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,920
I can't start an investigation

104
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,046
just because their fingerprints
are identical.

105
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:48,470
It's likely that he stole
the late Chairman Choi's fingerprints.

106
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,470
He may have needed them to
get access to the Chairman's safe.

107
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,180
- When is the deal finalized?
- Soon.

108
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,720
When they sign the contract
for the buyout

109
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,530
it will be Daehan Group's foundation day.

110
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,390
Are these all the reports?

111
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:08,620
President Choi will bring
more evidence soon.

112
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,210
You do look very much like
the late Chairman Choi.

113
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,390
Do I?

114
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:25,750
I appreciate you working to find
the truth about my father's case.

115
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,020
With his position, malignant people
are usually nearby.

116
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,510
Director Jung is close
to Prosecutor Yang.

117
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,990
No wonder.

118
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,100
- I'd appreciate it then.
- Don't worry.

119
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,800
As for the case involving
the late Chairman Choi's five billion won

120
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,610
we'll find a lead soon enough.

121
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,010
- What is this?
- Do you know Prosecutor Gu?

122
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,220
Choi Shin Hyung asked to gather
the evidence on him and go see him.

123
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,520
He's saying we should pressure
Director Jung with evidence, huh?

124
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,460
Then Director Jung will end up
having to give up his takeover.

125
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,030
But we still don't have
definitive evidence yet.

126
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,700
We have to find it.

127
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,880
That way, we can clear my father's name.

128
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,920
We should.

129
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,720
What's up with you?

130
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,510
What business do you
possibly have to call me?

131
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,034
I can't believe your nerve for calling me.

132
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,860
What is this?

133
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,600
The records of the money
I've received from Director Jung so far.

134
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,980
When we went to
the casinos in Las Vegas

135
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,490
I have the recorded phone
conversation from then, too.

136
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,100
Why did you decide to hand this to me?

137
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,960
Would I hand it over for free?

138
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,970
Ask Choi Shin Hyung.

139
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,980
Wow, really?

140
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,270
I'm pissed off at Jung Yi Gun, too.

141
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,270
Ever since the photo incident

142
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,920
I haven't been paid.

143
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,270
So how much did you get offered for this?

144
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,920
That's a secret.

145
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,810
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so I wish you luck.

146
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,940
Hey, hey!

147
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,080
Live a honest life out there.

148
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,640
How rude.

149
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,400
Okay, I got it now.

150
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,340
What are you doing in here?

151
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,800
Get up.

152
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,420
You asked me to wait.

153
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,220
Yet you announced your engagement?

154
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,830
You sure know how to
backstab people, don't you?

155
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,690
That was for the business.

156
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,120
You really think you've got
Hong Ji Yoon's heart?

157
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,660
No way.

158
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,070
Do you even know that
she's Choi Dae Han's spy?

159
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,810
It doesn't matter.

160
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,950
It'll be all resolved
once the resort is sold.

161
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,480
After I added your name as a joint owner
for the New York department store

162
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,640
now you'd sell it off without
even consulting me first?

163
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,450
Are you trying to end things
with me now?

164
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,740
I'm saying that's not what it is!

165
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,830
What happened with this article?

166
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,880
I guess she had no idea either, huh?

167
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,200
- Could you excuse us?
- You underestimated me.

168
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,560
Do you think I'm going to stand idly by?

169
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
Can we talk about it later?

170
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,890
Please retract the engagement announcement.

171
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,600
- Ji Yoon, it was about...
- And about the terms for the buyout

172
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,400
will you reconsider them?

173
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,580
- Is that because of the employees?
- Of course.

174
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,910
The damage would be too great.

175
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,490
Stop worrying about other people.

176
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,040
I secured your position...

177
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,250
so can't we set the date
for our engagement first?

178
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,390
- Yi Gun...
- I...

179
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:40,300
I don't want you because of work
like somebody else does.

180
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,550
Don't you know how I feel?

181
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,060
I'm sorry, Yi Gun.

182
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,880
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

183
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,590
But I'll make things clear.

184
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,020
About Daehan Resort...

185
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,920
I know that you've contributed
a lot for Daehan's growth.

186
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,090
But don't try to take it over
in the wrong way.

187
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,280
What?

188
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,130
Even if you were to get your way,
it still wouldn't satisfy you.

189
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,720
You acting this way...

190
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,040
speaks to your sense of inferiority,
not your ambition.

191
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,230
Hong Ji Yoon.

192
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,660
Why don't you quit now?

193
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,680
I haven't even gotten started yet.

194
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,160
- You might end up really hurting yourself.
- Who do you think will get hurt?

195
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,080
- I guess we'll know when the game is over.
- Sure about that?

196
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,570
Who would have put five billion won
in my late father's car?

197
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,030
Did you get some advice
from Choi Shin Hyung?

198
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,670
- On this and that.
- Funny.

199
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,080
He's not even Chairman Choi Go Bong.

200
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,920
But he has that kind of ability...

201
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,510
Wait and see who's going to stand
on stage at the foundation ceremony.

202
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,030
Would you mind taking a photo of us?

203
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,370
- A photo?
- Yes, please.

204
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,900
- I'm such a good photographer.
- Thank you.

205
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,040
Here we go. Where?

206
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,670
Get closer together.

207
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,850
One, two, three.

208
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,580
It came out well.

209
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,870
- Thank you.
- Sure.

210
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,100
- They look good together.
- Not as good as we do.

211
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,300
Oh my. Are you okay?

212
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,240
- Gosh, I almost fell in this skirt.
- Oh my.

213
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,420
What happened all of a sudden, huh?

214
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,240
Choi Shin Hyung.

215
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,670
Huh? He was here a minute ago.

216
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,030
Man, where did she go?

217
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,280
- Boo!
- Jeez.

218
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,860
You scared me!

219
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,770
You scared me.

220
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,190
It's cold, isn't it?

221
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,610
Give me ten thousand won.

222
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,200
- No, I won't.
- Seriously. Please just give it.

223
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,280
Gosh.

224
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,970
Wow.

225
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,310
Put it all in.

226
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,690
- Pardon?
- I'll be fine with this one bill.

227
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,540
Do you really want me
to put it all in there?

228
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,710
I'll be right back.

229
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,510
Seriously, what are you doing?

230
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,770
No wonder why people aren't coming over...

231
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,550
You should shake this bell
up and down hard like this.

232
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:42,580
Let's help the less unfortunate!

233
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,460
Let's help the poor! Thank you.

234
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,140
You should shake
this bell loudly!

235
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,030
Thank you.

236
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,900
Shake it hard like this.

237
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,350
We don't need a lot of money
to be happy.

238
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,510
Thank you.

239
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,130
Thank you.

240
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:17,720
<i>Blue mountains...</i>

241
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,684
You made a fuss about
going somewhere important

242
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:20,867
and it was a bathhouse?

243
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:25,930
<i>Water in blue stream...</i>

244
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,870
Gosh, it's too noisy.

245
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,520
Stop moving.

246
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,410
- You haven't been scrubbed off yet.
- You're going to scrub me off?

247
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,070
I take showers in the morning
and at night.

248
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,200
Showering a hundred times won't be
as good as taking a bath.

249
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,390
No matter how often
you take a shower

250
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,770
they say one scrub is better
than hundreds of showers.

251
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,630
Then do that as much as
you want, by yourself.

252
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,870
You said there were a lot of things
you wanted to do with your father.

253
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,010
I did, too.

254
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,830
I wanted to sit in
a warm bathtub with my son.

255
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,880
I wanted to sweat it out,
and scrub each other's backs.

256
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,630
Your father wanted to do that, too...

257
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,080
What's the big deal?

258
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,740
Usually the trivial things build up

259
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,840
and they stay right here.

260
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,620
So you can never forget them.

261
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,930
<i>Blue mountains...</i>

262
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,880
It's hot.

263
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,440
Wait a second.

264
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,900
Why are you scrubbing so hard?

265
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,060
What's all this, huh?

266
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,420
Are these thin noodles
or thick noodles, huh?

267
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,030
You might as well
open up a noodle shop.

268
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,410
Let's switch! Change!

269
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,420
Take it easy, kid!

270
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,410
Come over here!

271
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,710
That felt good.

272
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,220
It was nice, wasn't it?

273
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,980
Let's do it again.
Scrubbing each other's backs.

274
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,990
I'll go easy on you next time.

275
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,840
Let's do it again.

276
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,540
Oh my.

277
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,580
Wow, it's a Christmas tree!

278
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,230
- It's so big.
- What do you think?

279
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,720
Wouldn't it be really nice
once it's finished?

280
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:48,010
It was my dream to decorate
a tree with my father.

281
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,750
Was it?

282
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,530
What kind of man
has such a small dream?

283
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,430
Wow, there's a star, too.

284
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,940
What are you doing?

285
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,180
I'm trying to make a wish.

286
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,850
Tomorrow's Christmas.

287
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,020
I wish my father wouldn't leave.

288
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,529
I wish I could decorate
a tree with him next year

289
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:40,405
and the year after that.

290
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,670
Gosh, man.

291
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,740
I'll have to make another wish.

292
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,490
This necklace is said
to make miracles come true.

293
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,890
To my father...

294
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,230
I wish for a miracle for my father.

295
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,910
On the day of the next meteor shower

296
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,850
take this to where the accident took place.

297
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,800
- You're okay, right, sir?
- Yes.

298
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,710
Now Christmas... is only two days away.

299
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,110
Yes, by the way...

300
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,060
should we set the surgery date now?

301
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,610
- Manager Sung.
- Yes, Chairman Choi.

302
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,220
- What Chairman?
- Well...

303
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,320
To me, you're always Chairman Choi
whether you're dead or alive.

304
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,670
I've worked for you for thirty years.

305
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,410
Thirty is only a number.

306
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,080
It seems to have been
much longer than that.

307
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,370
- Have a seat.
- Yes, Chairman Choi.

308
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,820
What is this?

309
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,360
Manager Sung, now...

310
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,430
With your wife and kids

311
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,900
you should all live happily together.

312
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,280
Return to your wife.

313
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,530
All this time, because of me...

314
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,930
you had to live your life
according to mine.

315
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,390
It must have been tough for you.

316
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,790
Why are you saying that?

317
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,900
You're making me nervous.

318
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,040
Come on.

319
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,370
You should let me go now.

320
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,230
You should be mentally prepared.

321
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,180
How am I supposed to do that?

322
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,840
Even if everyone can do that...

323
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,020
I won't be able to.

324
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,830
All this time...

325
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,210
you've been separated
from your family...

326
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,010
I'm sorry for not understanding
how it was for you.

327
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,520
Chairman Choi.

328
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:42,780
I'm sorry that I made you
worry about me, too.

329
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:55,460
Sung Gyung Bae was
Choi Go Bong's best partner.

330
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,280
Where would I go without you?

331
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:11,340
I will protect you until the end,
Chairman Choi.

332
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,660
Chairman Choi.

333
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,690
Okay.

334
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,710
Truly...

335
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,070
- I'm grateful to you.
- Oh my, Chairman Choi.

336
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,830
Oh my, Chairman Choi.

337
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,240
What are we going to do?

338
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,380
What are we going to do
with Chairman Choi, huh?

339
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
Shouldn't we try to do something, huh?

340
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,480
He won't listen to me.

341
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,890
I just don't understand why
he won't have the surgery.

342
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,850
Can you go and try to
talk him into it again?

343
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,150
I don't think he'll listen to me,
Manager Sung.

344
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,200
According to the text messages,
the 25th is the last day.

345
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,690
We'll go ahead and
request surgery for that day...

346
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,750
and we'll drag him in, and force him
to have the operation.

347
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,570
We should at least do that...

348
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,570
We can't just let him go like this.

349
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,610
Let's try to do everything we can.

350
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,500
Please help me, Manager Sung.

351
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,660
I'll try everything I can think of.

352
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,200
Gosh...

353
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,950
What are you doing when
you're supposed to be working?

354
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,320
Well, my hands are
so chapped these days...

355
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,330
- Should I get one of these?
- Go ahead.

356
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,370
Really?

357
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,540
- They come as a set, too.
- I said go ahead.

358
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,900
- Buy it for me then.
- What?

359
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,020
We can use it together.

360
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,150
Move over.

361
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,490
What am I doing...

362
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,260
Sir. Sir.

363
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,460
Gosh, rumor has it that
there will be a staff layoff.

364
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,300
Is that true?

365
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,820
If our resort gets sold
to a foreign corporation

366
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,630
it may be true.

367
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,740
The resort is being sold
to a foreign corporation?

368
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,500
Then we can't just sit around
and let that happen.

369
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,770
How about we petition the employees?

370
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,690
Young Dal.

371
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,586
Did you get a call from the
prosecution's office too?

372
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:40,640
I did.

373
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,570
Son of a bitch.
We have no choice.

374
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,710
- I'll go and see Director Jung.
- Wait.

375
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,000
Can you hold on a bit?

376
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,700
He's talking with your sister-in-law
about a business deal...

377
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,490
So let's wait a bit, shall we?

378
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,800
Do you still trust your wife?

379
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,842
What is this?

380
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,460
It's the account ledgers
she sneaked out to Germany.

381
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,280
What?

382
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,950
What's all this, huh?

383
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,130
That damned woman.

384
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,690
She set this all up for
her family under my nose?

385
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,120
You said I was tricked
when I got married...

386
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,990
What kind of married couple are you two?

387
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,070
I won't leave her alone.

388
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,660
Young Dal, you can't get worked up now.

389
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,850
What do you want me to do then?

390
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,310
We should first find a way to survive!

391
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,420
- What brings you here?
- Can you two help me?

392
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,420
I'll help you, whatever it is. Tell me.

393
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,120
It seems that you're both victims.

394
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,430
Us? How come?

395
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,660
In your case, it's because of your wife.

396
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,540
And aunt, it's because of Director Jung.

397
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,270
Who's saying that?
What did I do?

398
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,950
You should find a way to survive
before it's too late.

399
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,510
Don't you think?

400
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,520
This should be enough.

401
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,560
Please clear my father's name.

402
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,320
Bringing Director Jung down...

403
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,620
It won't be easy.

404
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,210
We know that.

405
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,210
That's why we've brought
all these documents to you.

406
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,460
I'll review them and be in touch.

407
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,860
Why did you get out?
It's cold. You can go.

408
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,090
Thanks for being by my side.

409
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,881
Don't mention it.

410
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:00,075
I'm just doing my job.

411
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,280
No, when I think about how hard
it must've been for you because of me...

412
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,910
Gosh, it gives me chills.

413
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,210
I'm sorry.

414
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,130
Things aren't over yet...

415
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,360
so you can't relax just yet.
You know that, right?

416
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,020
Yes, ma'am.

417
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,480
<i>Happy Christmas!</i>

418
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,890
<i>Today's Christmas Eve.</i>

419
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,640
<i>The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.</i>

420
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,620
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

421
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,960
He worked for Daehan Resort
for thirty years.

422
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,280
He didn't get a proper retirement ceremony.

423
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,180
It bothers me that
he had to go like that.

424
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,200
I see.

425
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,750
The late Chairman Choi was
always in the back of my mind.

426
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,160
So I'd like to make him
an appreciation plaque.

427
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,190
I want my brother
to receive it on his behalf.

428
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,750
That's a very good idea.

429
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,970
Then how about a video clips
to show his accomplishments?

430
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,260
Wow, that would be great.

431
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,020
Thanks, Eun Ha Soo.

432
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,210
<i>[Appreciation Plaque]</i>

433
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,410
Hello?

434
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:59,070
I'll send you the word file for
the appreciation plaque in an hour.

435
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,230
You can make it
by tomorrow morning, right?

436
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,010
Okay. Thank you.

437
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,100
- They're coming.
- They're coming!

438
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,510
Statement, please.

439
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,640
Can you just say one statement?

440
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,830
Do you have anything
to say about the investigation?

441
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,170
Do you acknowledge
the embezzlement charges?

442
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,800
Why didn't you bring my car?

443
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,210
Does it matter who picked us up?

444
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,670
Why did I get in this car?

445
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,550
How was it?

446
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,640
Prosecutor Yang must have
been after you aggressively.

447
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,430
He tried to accuse me of frivolous charges.

448
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,970
I thought my blood pressure
would drive me to the edge.

449
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,740
I didn't understand why he'd go over
my family's bank accounts.

450
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,040
You dare to say that in front of me?

451
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,820
Why can't I say that
when everything's out in the open?

452
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,580
How noisy.
Can't we leave in silence?

453
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,700
This is all because
you were played by Jung Yi Gun.

454
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,940
If you committed a crime,
you should pay for it.

455
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,750
Hey, can you help us?

456
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,370
There has to be a way, right?

457
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,330
Can you help us with Dae Han's help?

458
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,090
Gosh, how can you ask for help now?

459
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,690
I'll think about it
after I see how you behave.

460
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,980
What do you need to see?

461
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,920
We'll be on our best behavior
from now on.

462
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,400
Can you take care of
my matters first?

463
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:32,080
Things aren't going well.

464
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,490
Choi Young Dal, Lee In Ja...

465
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,120
On top of it, Choi Yi Hye stepped up, too.

466
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,430
- They even submitted evidence.
- What evidence?

467
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,430
For Choi Young Dal
it was the premium outlets.

468
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,900
For Lee In Ja, it was a video file
of the late Chairman Choi's will.

469
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,490
Choi Yi Hye must have submitted
the New York department store then.

470
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,970
Yes, sir.

471
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,510
Things are getting complicated.

472
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,190
Furthermor, Prosecutor Gu is investigating
into the five billion won case.

473
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,620
It might be better to give up now
and wrap things up.

474
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,040
Quitting now would be
to admit to the crimes.

475
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,720
Continue with it.

476
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,820
Hello. We're collecting signatures
as a petition to retain Daehan Resort.

477
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,680
You know what's going on, right?

478
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,400
Thank you.

479
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,540
Hello.

480
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,140
We're against the takeover
by a foreign company.

481
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,180
Can you sign here?

482
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,410
Choi Shin Hyung, can you sign here?

483
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,430
How did you come up with this idea?

484
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,810
I thought it could help a little
if we worked together.

485
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,280
The employees have changed
their minds about President Choi.

486
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,420
He helped revive Seohae Hotel, too.

487
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,560
Everybody seems to be counting on him now.

488
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,310
If he overcomes this crisis,
he'll do even better in the future.

489
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,210
Wait, are you free tonight?

490
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,900
Of course.

491
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,440
<i>[Terms of Takeover]</i>

492
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,670
- Did you get all the paperwork ready?
- Yes.

493
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,730
I can't believe we're doing this
on Christmas Eve.

494
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,480
If everything works out,
it'll be a very memorable day.

495
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,510
How are things on their side?

496
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,760
It seems to be a good side that
they've agreed to meet with us...

497
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,400
I'll know for sure when we meet.

498
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,160
I'm afraid I won't be able
to see you today.

499
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Something urgent came up.

500
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,990
I'll call you again.

501
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,150
What is this?

502
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,060
Can we talk now?

503
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,860
- Let's talk later.
- Come on.

504
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,870
Why are you in such a hurry?

505
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,320
Who are you?

506
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,880
Your fingerprints match those
of the late Chairman Choi.

507
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,290
Shall I call the police to look into it?

508
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,950
Now you're performing
a background check on me?

509
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,540
How can you possibly do this to me?

510
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,470
After your parents passed away...

511
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,780
I thought of you like a son.

512
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:54,060
I supported you financially,
and even helped you go study abroad.

513
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,260
So you repay grace with evildoings?

514
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,790
Who are you?

515
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,180
While we were managing Daehan

516
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,670
how many places did we go
together all these years?

517
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,520
I wanted to teach you many things.

518
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:19,760
Didn't you work so hard, too?

519
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,190
If I had known that
you'd turn out this way

520
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,290
I don't know why
I spent all that time with you.

521
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,790
What's the use?

522
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,850
The bottom line is that
I was never his son.

523
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,930
I could never become Choi Dae Han!

524
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,130
I understand how you feel.

525
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,840
Enough!

526
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,640
That's enough.

527
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,680
Please check this document.

528
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,370
- It's for me?
- It's very important document.

529
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,870
We will wait for your evaluation.

530
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,040
Our agreement...

531
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,760
Just pick one.

532
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,450
I'm okay, so buy one for yourself.

533
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,660
But still it's your birthday.

534
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,460
This color's pretty.
What do you think?

535
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,200
- It's pretty.
- Okay.

536
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,030
Can you gift wrap this?

537
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,430
- Ha Soo, do you want to try that?
- What?

538
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,810
On a day like today, you can
get a complete makeover

539
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,940
- and go see Choi Shin Hyung.
- It's okay.

540
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,830
Why not?

541
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,760
<i>Everything is ready.</i>

542
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,000
Wow.

543
00:46:52,990 --> 00:47:02,610
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

544
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:08,080
<i>Happy birthday, dear Eun Ha Soo.</i>

545
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:14,840
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

546
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,540
The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

547
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,890
Happy birthday to you.

548
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,200
Wow.

549
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,240
Wow.

550
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,790
What's all this?

551
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,310
Wow.

552
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,390
Unbelievable.

553
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,160
Once upon a time...

554
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:08,070
there lived a very rich old man
with a lump in his face.

555
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:19,210
The old coot thought he was living
a good life compared to anybody else.

556
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,260
Okay.

557
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:28,800
I guess you can say that
I succeeded in life.

558
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,610
Of course.

559
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,710
One day...

560
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,170
there was a storm with
strong winds and thunderous rain.

561
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,950
He was hit by lightning.

562
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,810
He passed out.

563
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,770
Oh no.

564
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,170
Oh no, please help me.

565
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:59,000
Help me.

566
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,370
I want to live longer.

567
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:15,850
The old man thought making money
meant living a successful life.

568
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,041
It was only at death's
door did he realize that

569
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:25,275
he wanted another chance at life.

570
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,360
Oh, save me.

571
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:38,020
Somebody help me.

572
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,870
Just like that, when he was about
to breathe his last...

573
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,980
All of a sudden...

574
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:56,290
an angel came down
from the sky.

575
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:16,320
Sir, sir!

576
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,100
Yes...

577
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:26,740
Hold my hand.

578
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,380
Who... who are you?

579
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,610
Do you still think
you've lived a good life?

580
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,080
No.

581
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,990
I... didn't live a good life.

582
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,210
I didn't know what happiness was.

583
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:15,200
I didn't spend a lot of time
with my family, either.

584
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,640
I never really said that I loved anybody.

585
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,400
What a pity.

586
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:29,190
What have you been doing
all these years then?

587
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:35,410
I don't even know.

588
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:43,980
I don't know why I lived like that.

589
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,010
It's the angel's birthday today.

590
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,240
What do I do?

591
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,470
I don't...

592
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:48,375
have much time left now.

593
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:57,430
I might not be able
to see you ever again.

594
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,620
Then...

595
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,770
we should say our farewells first.

596
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:21,090
I don't know
how to say farewell, though.

597
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,200
Then I'll teach you how.

598
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,260
Repeat after me.

599
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,950
Even when I'm gone...

600
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:42,660
Even when I'm gone...

601
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,040
Take care of yourself.

602
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:52,130
Take care of yourself.

603
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,330
Make sure you don't skip meals.

604
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,430
This is annoying,
do the rest on your own.

605
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,960
Even when I'm gone...

606
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:13,230
make sure you don't skip meals.

607
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,200
If you eat the spicy ddukbokki

608
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,050
make sure that you're the winner.

609
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,160
When it's cold...

610
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,750
don't wait outside too long.

611
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,740
When you're not feeling well

612
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,790
say this spell, 'Koong koong da.'

613
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:49,870
Make people happy and smile.

614
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,477
Make sure you that
you achieve your dream

615
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:57,965
of creating memories for others.

616
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,720
And...

617
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:10,790
Meet someone and fall in love, too.

618
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:21,510
Live happily ever after.

619
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:32,420
I sincerely wish that for you.

620
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh no, you can't cry.

621
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,460
Your pretty nose will turn red.

622
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:59,060
And...

623
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,220
I wish you a happy birthday.

624
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:13,150
Thank you for being born.

625
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:21,450
I am happy to have met you.

626
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:40,820
I still didn't tell you
my final wish yet.

627
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,870
Okay.

628
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:47,080
Tell me.

629
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,600
Let's not break up.

630
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,770
No matter what happens.

631
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,570
Do you understand?

632
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,710
I love you.
