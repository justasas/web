1
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:09,510
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving
force behind Catholicism Wow!...

2
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:11,345
...Cardinal Glick.

3
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,436
Thank you, thank you.

4
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:21,397
Now, we all know
how the majority...

5
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:23,649
...and the media in this country...

6
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:25,943
...view the Catholic Church.

7
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,238
They think of us as a passé,
archaic institution.

8
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:32,491
People find the Bible obtuse...

9
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:34,076
...even hokey.

10
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:36,245
Now, in an effort
to disprove all that...

11
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:39,999
...the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

12
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,126
...both of faith and of style.

13
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,170
For example, the crucifix.

14
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:47,965
While it has been a time-honored
symbol of our faith...

15
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:51,010
...Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

16
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,678
...this highly recognizable...

17
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:55,139
...yet wholly depressing image...

18
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:57,349
...of our Lord, crucified.

19
00:02:57,516 --> 00:03:00,769
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

20
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:02,688
He came to help us out.

21
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:06,483
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

22
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,361
...that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring sigil.

23
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:13,365
So it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

24
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,035
...of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! campaign...

25
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:19,621
...will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

26
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:20,914
... "The Buddy Christ."

27
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:33,552
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

28
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,138
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

29
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:37,681
But look at it.

30
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,641
Doesn't it pop?

31
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,351
Buddy Christ.

32
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:43,479
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

33
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,439
Let me get this straight.

34
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:48,734
You don't believe in God
because of <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>

35
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,235
No, <i>Through the Looking Glass.</i>

36
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,405
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

37
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:55,491
...is an indictment
of organized religion.

38
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,743
The Walrus, with his girth
and good nature...

39
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,870
...he obviously represents
either Buddha...

40
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:02,831
...or with his tusks, the Hindu
elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

41
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:04,917
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

42
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,753
Now, the Carpenter,
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,006
...who was raised a carpenter's son,
represents Western religions.

44
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,926
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

45
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,595
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

46
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:20,432
...then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

47
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,435
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

48
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:27,272
...that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

49
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,066
...destroys one's inner being.

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,277
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

51
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:35,280
...by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

52
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:38,575
...out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

53
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:41,620
...who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

54
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:45,624
...and says, "Do it...
Do it and I'll fucking spank you!"

55
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,042
Oh, Jesus!

56
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,754
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

57
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:54,133
What have I been doing
with my life?

58
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:57,636
- What am I...?
- Yeah, I know.

59
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:59,471
Listen, my advice to you...

60
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:02,266
...take this money you've
collected for your parish...

61
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:05,394
...go get yourself a nice dress,
you know? Fix yourself up.

62
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:08,772
Find some man, some woman, you
can connect with, even for a moment...

63
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,693
...because that's really all life is,
Sister, it's a series of moments.

64
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,987
Why don't you seize yours?

65
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,826
Attagirl. Attagirl.

66
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,501
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

67
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:32,379
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

68
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:35,257
You've been in his presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

69
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:38,677
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy.

70
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:42,097
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

71
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:43,932
Here's what I don't get about you.

72
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,935
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

73
00:05:47,102 --> 00:05:49,521
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

74
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:50,731
Look at them.

75
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:54,693
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

76
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,697
...forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

77
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:00,032
See those two?

78
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,452
That guy doesn't know that the girl
cheated on him while she was away.

79
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,370
- She did?
- Twice.

80
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:07,623
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

81
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,043
...because they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

82
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:13,003
I like that.

83
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,380
I wish they could all
feel that way more often.

84
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:18,550
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

85
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:21,136
You call me, you tell me
it's important, you know?

86
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:24,431
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

87
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,725
We're going home.

88
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:29,144
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

89
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:37,069
Take it and quit leering at me.
People will think I broke up with you.

90
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:40,530
- You did just say we're going home?
- Read.

91
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:44,576
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

92
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:46,203
And?

93
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:49,915
You have to keep reading.

94
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:52,167
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church"...

95
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:53,919
<i>Is the kickoff of
a new campaign...</i>

96
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:56,505
<i>...which seeks to bring
Catholicism into the mainstream.</i>

97
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:58,924
<i>With a papal sanction,
the archway entrance...</i>

98
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:01,593
...of <i>the century-old Jersey Shore</i>
<i>house of worship...</i>

99
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,096
<i>...will serve as a passageway
of plenary indulgence...</i>

100
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:07,599
...a <i>little-known Catholic belief</i>
<i>offering all that passes through</i> it...

101
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,434
...a <i>morally clean slate.</i>

102
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,688
<i>For</i> Sunday News Brief,
<i>I'm Grant Hicks.</i>

103
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:16,316
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

104
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:19,778
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

105
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:22,531
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

106
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:26,326
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

107
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:29,496
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

108
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,248
What then, hell? Fuck that.

109
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:33,375
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

110
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,878
...and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

111
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,423
If we die with clean souls,
they can't keep us out.

112
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,634
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

113
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:46,013
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

114
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:49,308
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

115
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:50,976
He can't keep us out anymore.

116
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:53,395
Once we're back in,
he'll just forgive and forget.

117
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:57,357
But this thing, this is Church law.
It's not divine mandate.

118
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:01,028
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:04,531
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:08,160
...by the son of God
before he left was:

121
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:09,995
"Whatever you hold true on Earth..."

122
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:11,455
"I'll hold true in heaven."

123
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:14,499
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

124
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,293
This thing has a papal sanction...

125
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,338
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

126
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:21,131
...never yielded positive results.

127
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,800
You can't be anal retentive
if you don't have an anus.

128
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,844
Outstanding work!

129
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,764
There's just one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

130
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,932
This will help us get back
on his good side.

131
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,184
What?

132
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:35,145
I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

133
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:36,688
"Mooby, the Golden Calf.

134
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:39,524
Creating an empire
out of simplicity."

135
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,485
I wanna hit them.

136
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:44,071
You really are
just a simple creature.

137
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:46,615
We find a way back
and you wanna jeopardize that...

138
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:48,825
...because you yearn
for the good old days.

139
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:52,371
What better way to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

140
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:53,914
...thanks to you?

141
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:57,084
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

142
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,878
Killing spree?
I'm talking about divine justice here.

143
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:03,423
I'm talking about raining down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

144
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,134
He's all about that.
I know he'd want this done.

145
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:08,804
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
since you quit.

146
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,555
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

147
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:13,517
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

148
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:16,228
If I'm wrong, which I'm not,
it's not gonna matter.

149
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,563
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

150
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,525
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

151
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:25,237
Well, he does hate competition.
I will say that.

152
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:27,572
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

153
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,699
Where is this church
we have to go to?

154
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:33,078
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

155
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:35,080
Last four days on Earth?

156
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:37,457
If I had a dick, I'd go get laid.

157
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,751
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

158
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:41,670
Let's kill people.

159
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,422
Oh, not you.

160
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,973
The Illinois Chapter
of the Right to Life Foundation...

161
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:56,560
...will be holding its
biannual softball game...

162
00:09:56,726 --> 00:10:00,230
...against the Cook County
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2.

163
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:02,649
Today's second collection
will be donated...

164
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:05,569
...to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.

165
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:08,029
For those of you
who haven't followed the news...

166
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:11,032
...an unidentified homeless man
who was accosted...

167
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:14,369
...and severely beaten at
the New Jersey Shore last Tuesday...

168
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:18,623
...lies in critical but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

169
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,459
He lacks identification...

170
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:24,045
...and police have had no luck
tracking down any possible family.

171
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:28,467
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

172
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:31,803
...to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

173
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,181
...asking that Catholics
all over the country...

174
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:37,809
...join in this protest
against euthanasia.

175
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,313
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

176
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:47,819
We believe in one god,
the Father Almighty...

177
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,488
...maker of heaven and earth.

178
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:52,657
<i>We believe in Jesus Christ,
his only son, our Lord...</i>

179
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:55,535
Hey, choose life!

180
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:59,080
You're gonna burn in hell,
you fucking baby killer!

181
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:01,166
Holy shit, it's the pope.

182
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,417
Where?

183
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:03,835
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:16,806
Jesus. You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

185
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:18,975
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

186
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,937
You have an excuse. You're Jewish.
You don't know any better.

187
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:25,482
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

188
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,692
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

189
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,152
I went to church.

190
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,071
That still kills me, you and church.

191
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:34,699
If only they knew your tithing came
from a Planned Parenthood check.

192
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:37,410
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

193
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:42,082
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

194
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:45,460
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

195
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:47,963
I don't think I have any faith left.

196
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:52,175
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

197
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:57,639
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have babysat for in high school.

198
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:00,016
Well, the point is,
he told me something.

199
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,644
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

200
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:05,730
When you're young, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

201
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:07,732
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

202
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,818
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it.

203
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:12,737
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

204
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,698
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

205
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:15,991
In more ways than one.

206
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:17,867
You need to get laid,
Bethany Sloane.

207
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:20,495
You need a man,
if only for 10 minutes.

208
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:23,373
My experience is that
the average male is never a man...

209
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,875
...not even for 10 minutes
in his entire life span.

210
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:28,878
That sounds militant.
You thinking of joining the other side?

211
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,880
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

212
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:34,092
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

213
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,094
I think God is dead.

214
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,597
The sign of a true Catholic.

215
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:52,444
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

216
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:54,237
I'm from the EPA.

217
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:58,158
We're checking on possible
Freon leaks.

218
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,619
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

219
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,412
Yes, we have central air.

220
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,080
In every room?

221
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:05,957
Except the bathroom. Why?

222
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:08,043
Well, you know
what that means, don't you?

223
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,014
Move.

224
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:31,274
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

225
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,277
...than central air.

226
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:37,155
Pick that up.

227
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:44,454
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

228
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:47,415
Now, if I remember
the protocol correctly...

229
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:52,337
...the powers will attempt
to contact the last scion.

230
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,547
I need you three...

231
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,801
...to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

232
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,972
Go.

233
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:39,634
Behold the Metatron!

234
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,470
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

235
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:45,223
Behold the Metatron!

236
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,394
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

237
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:50,770
Behold the Metatron!

238
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:54,566
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true...

239
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,872
Sweet Jesus!
Do you have to use the whole can?

240
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,916
Who the fuck are you and what
the fuck are you doing in my room?

241
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,836
I'm soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

242
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:16,838
Stubbed my fucking...

243
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,257
Get the fuck out of here, now!

244
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:21,926
Or you'll do what exactly?

245
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:24,262
Hit me with that fish?

246
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:32,103
Now, just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

247
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,773
Jesus wept!

248
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:36,608
Look at my suit.

249
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,570
Take what you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

250
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:45,033
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

251
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:48,787
See?

252
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:54,209
I'm as anatomically impaired
as a Ken doll.

253
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:57,462
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

254
00:15:58,588 --> 00:16:00,924
Honestly, you bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

255
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,760
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

256
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:05,428
What are you?

257
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:07,472
I'm pissed off is what I am.

258
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,601
Do you drench everyone who comes in
here with flame-retardant chemicals?

259
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:14,229
No wonder you're single.

260
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,485
Stand back.

261
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:31,162
As I was saying...

262
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:34,457
...prior to your
fire-fighting episode...

263
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,002
...I am the Metatron.

264
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,508
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell.

265
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:46,761
You people.

266
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:51,015
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

267
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:54,018
I am a seraphim.

268
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:58,690
The highest choir of angels.

269
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,985
You do know what an angel is,
don't you?

270
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,615
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

271
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:11,911
Any occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

272
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:13,705
...they're speaking to me.

273
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:16,040
Or they're talking to themselves.

274
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,211
Why doesn't God speak for himself?

275
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:24,424
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

276
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:27,927
...human beings have neither the aural
nor the psychological capacity...

277
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:32,223
...to withstand the awesome power
of God's true voice.

278
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,810
Were you to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

279
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,730
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

280
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:42,650
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

281
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:47,655
What, aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?

282
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:51,743
You want more proof?

283
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,453
Fine.

284
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,746
How about tequila?

285
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,421
Where the hell are we?

286
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:05,965
Only place you can go
for a good tequila.

287
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:09,218
<i>Dos tequilas, por favor,</i>
and an empty glass.

288
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:12,931
We're in Mexico?

289
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:15,600
Actually, we're in the franchised
Mexican eatery...

290
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,769
...down the street
from your apartment...

291
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:19,687
...but it's impressive nonetheless.

292
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,357
You don't mind I lost the wings,
do you?

293
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,442
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

294
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,277
What do you want with me?

295
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:32,784
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

296
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:36,120
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

297
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,539
Noah was a drunk.
Look what he accomplished.

298
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:40,583
And no one's asking you
to build an ark.

299
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,585
All you gotta do is go
to New Jersey...

300
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:45,213
...and visit a small church
on a very important day.

301
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:50,969
New Jersey?

302
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,263
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

303
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,808
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

304
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,977
What's the fine print?

305
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:02,981
Stop a couple angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

306
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,274
Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.

307
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,528
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

308
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:11,656
...and thus negating all existence.

309
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:14,158
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

310
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,119
You might want to clarify that.

311
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:21,499
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

312
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,668
And his wrath was bore...

313
00:19:23,835 --> 00:19:27,005
...by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

314
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:29,257
When Sodom and Gomorrah
was destroyed...

315
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:30,842
...that was Loki.

316
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:34,929
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

317
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:37,765
...that was Loki.
And he was good at what he did.

318
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:42,645
But one day he refused to
bear God's wrath any longer.

319
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:46,107
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

320
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:48,359
...a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

321
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:49,527
Grigori?

322
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:52,822
One of the choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

323
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:54,365
Guess what they do.

324
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:58,870
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt...

325
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,456
The Tenth Plague.

326
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:04,125
Tell a person you're the Metatron,
they stare blankly.

327
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,419
Mention something in
a Charlton Heston movie...

328
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,713
...and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

329
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,715
May I continue uninterrupted?

330
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:12,842
Once he's done with the firstborn...

331
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:17,597
...Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

332
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:20,016
And over many rounds...

333
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:22,226
...they get into
this discussion about...

334
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:24,228
...whether murder
in God's name is okay.

335
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:25,646
And in the end...

336
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:29,692
...Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

337
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,070
...and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

338
00:20:32,236 --> 00:20:33,738
So...

339
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,575
...very inebriated...

340
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:40,286
...Loki tells God he quits...

341
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:42,663
...throws down his fiery sword...

342
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,707
...and gives him the finger.

343
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,919
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

344
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:51,089
...God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

345
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:52,673
Hence all the spitting.

346
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:55,176
So for their insolence...

347
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:58,179
...God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

348
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:00,890
...would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

349
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:02,767
- Were they sent to hell?
- Worse.

350
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,769
Wisconsin...

351
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:07,563
...for the entire span
of human history.

352
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,192
And when the world ends, they'll have
to sit outside the gates for eternity.

353
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,111
And this has what to do with me?

354
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:17,657
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

355
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:20,368
...that would allow them
to reenter heaven.

356
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:23,121
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

357
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:25,123
It's not that simple.

358
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:29,669
If they get in, they will have
reversed God's decree.

359
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:34,298
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

360
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:39,095
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

361
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:42,807
...functions solely on one principle:

362
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:45,935
God is infallible.

363
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:47,937
To prove him wrong...

364
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:50,982
...would undo reality
and everything that is.

365
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:53,943
Up would become down,
black would become white.

366
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,988
Existence would
become nothingness.

367
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:58,698
In essence...

368
00:21:59,782 --> 00:22:02,243
...if they're allowed to enter
that church...

369
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:06,998
...they'll unmake the world.

370
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:10,001
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

371
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:12,003
Why doesn't God
do something about it?

372
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,007
He could. But he'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

373
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:17,758
Why me?

374
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:20,136
Because of who you are.

375
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:22,013
And who am I?

376
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:24,223
The girl in the p.j.'s!

377
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,019
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

378
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:30,146
I'm gonna have to pass.

379
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:32,190
I beg your pardon?

380
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:36,694
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

381
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:38,362
When my husband decided...

382
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,115
...he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear children...

383
00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:42,325
...where was God?

384
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:45,995
To hell with him.

385
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:50,208
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

386
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:52,627
...just because of a grudge
against your creator.

387
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:55,129
So you lost the ability
to make life.

388
00:22:55,296 --> 00:22:58,716
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

389
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:01,052
...by acting like one
and protecting it.

390
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:03,137
Saving it!

391
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:07,600
But I can't make you.

392
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:11,270
However, if you should decide
to stop being selfish...

393
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,856
...and accept your responsibility...

394
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:15,816
...you won't be alone.

395
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:17,235
You'll have support.

396
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:19,403
What? More angels?

397
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,155
Prophets.

398
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:26,118
In a manner of speaking.
Two of them.

399
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:31,123
The one who speaks...

400
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,627
And he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not.

401
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:36,879
...will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

402
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:38,422
The other one...

403
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:41,175
...well, he's the quiet type.

404
00:23:41,342 --> 00:23:42,510
Look, I've gotta go.

405
00:23:42,677 --> 00:23:44,929
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

406
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:48,766
Hey.

407
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:51,602
- What's he like?
- God?

408
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:55,314
Lonely...

409
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:57,275
...but funny.

410
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,360
He's got a great sense of humor.

411
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:01,529
Sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

412
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:04,282
...than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

413
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:06,284
Sex is a joke in heaven?

414
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,162
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

415
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:11,539
I'll see you.

416
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:17,415
Snootch to
the motherfucking nootch!

417
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:56,996
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

418
00:26:58,122 --> 00:27:00,541
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

419
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:04,795
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pubeless asses!

420
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:12,595
I don't know what to say
or think, except...

421
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:14,597
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

422
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,933
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

423
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,853
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

424
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,647
I don't know those kids,
but they would have kicked yours...

425
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:26,484
...and Lunchbox's asses
if I hadn't represented.

426
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,361
Well, thanks for being
out here so late.

427
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:31,655
Wait a minute. Are you protestors?

428
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:34,742
You mean those dickheads with signs
and pictures of dead babies?

429
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:37,161
Shit, no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

430
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:39,288
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

431
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:41,332
But what are you doing
hanging around?

432
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,459
We're here to pick up chicks.

433
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,294
Excuse me?

434
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:48,506
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

435
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:51,342
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

436
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:54,345
Right.

437
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:57,181
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

438
00:27:57,348 --> 00:27:59,058
- I think.
- Wait a second.

439
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:01,810
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

440
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:03,020
What the shit is that?

441
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:06,982
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

442
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:10,027
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

443
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:14,740
Now, how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

444
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:17,535
I'm going back to Jersey
and starting the business again.

445
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:21,372
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

446
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,958
<i>Prophets. Two of them.</i>

447
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:25,834
You know what I'm saying,
Silent Bob?

448
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,836
You gotta be kidding me.

449
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:30,548
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

450
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:33,259
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

451
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:34,843
Try it on.

452
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:38,013
It's a lot more compact
than the flaming sword...

453
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,140
...but it's not nearly as impressive.

454
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:43,519
It doesn't have that
"wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

455
00:28:43,686 --> 00:28:47,731
How am I supposed to strike fear into
the hearts of the wicked with this?

456
00:28:47,898 --> 00:28:48,899
Look at this.

457
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,654
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

458
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:56,657
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

459
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:59,034
You got to stand and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

460
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:01,036
I had to do all the work.

461
00:29:01,203 --> 00:29:04,331
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

462
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:07,042
I rained down sulfur, man.
There's a subtle difference.

463
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,794
Okay, I'm sure.

464
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:12,756
Fuck you, man. Any moron with
a pack of matches can set a fire.

465
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:14,800
Raining down sulfur
is an endurance trial.

466
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:17,678
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can do...

467
00:29:17,845 --> 00:29:19,346
...next to soccer.

468
00:29:20,764 --> 00:29:22,558
I'll take this one.

469
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:39,450
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or you gonna do us both?

470
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:41,910
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

471
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:44,038
You're a man of principle.

472
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:47,750
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

473
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,294
Some fuck named John Hughes.

474
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:52,046
<i>Sixteen Candles</i> John Hughes?

475
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:56,300
You know that guy too?
That fucking guy.

476
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:59,136
He made this flick <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>
Not bad.

477
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:01,221
There's tits in it, but no bush.

478
00:30:01,388 --> 00:30:04,141
But Ebert here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

479
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:06,644
...because he's in love
with this John Hughes guy.

480
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,896
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

481
00:30:09,063 --> 00:30:13,400
Fucking <i>Breakfast Club,</i> where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

482
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:17,279
Fucking <i>Weird Science,</i> where this
babe wants to undress and get down...

483
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:20,491
...but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

484
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:24,745
And then <i>Pretty in Pink,</i> which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

485
00:30:24,912 --> 00:30:28,165
...because when the redhead
hooks up with her dream guy...

486
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:31,794
...he starts sobbing like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

487
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,130
And there's nothing worse
than watching a fucking fat man weep.

488
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:37,132
What exactly brought you
to Illinois?

489
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:41,095
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

490
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:45,307
...where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

491
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:48,352
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fucking harsh.

492
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,687
But best of all...

493
00:30:49,853 --> 00:30:51,897
...there was no one dealing, man.

494
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:54,316
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

495
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,027
...if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

496
00:30:57,194 --> 00:31:00,030
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

497
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:03,200
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

498
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:06,203
There is no Shermer in Illinois.

499
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,205
Movies are fucking bullshit.

500
00:31:08,372 --> 00:31:09,873
When are you going
to New Jersey?

501
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,292
Jeez, this broad asks
a lot of questions.

502
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:15,546
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

503
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:17,464
Yeah. So you do anal?

504
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:20,050
Is it true chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

505
00:31:20,217 --> 00:31:22,052
I didn't ask you out for sex.

506
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:24,096
I'll take head.

507
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,060
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this...

508
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:34,565
...but I think I should go with you.

509
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:37,901
What, like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

510
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:41,655
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

511
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:44,533
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

512
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,701
Really?

513
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,870
You're going to
lead me somewhere.

514
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,496
Me lead you?

515
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:52,458
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

516
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:55,711
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

517
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:59,882
Someone said I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I'm supposed to go.

518
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:01,925
What the hell are
you babbling about?

519
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:04,678
We saved your ass from
some angry fucking dwarves...

520
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:08,557
...and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

521
00:32:10,517 --> 00:32:12,227
Do you believe in God?

522
00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:16,899
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

523
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,484
...and we get the Jesus freak?

524
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,277
- Let's get out of here.
- No, wait.

525
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:22,070
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

526
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,490
Pay?

527
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:29,077
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

528
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:33,248
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

529
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:36,794
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

530
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,296
...and we're in that fucked-up bar!

531
00:32:39,463 --> 00:32:40,881
What about sex?

532
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:42,299
No sex.

533
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:48,222
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

534
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:51,809
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

535
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:53,936
In that highly unlikely situation?

536
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:58,482
Yeah, sure.

537
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:01,652
Yeah? She's a slut.

538
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:05,572
All right.

539
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:09,076
But I get to drive.

540
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:20,462
What gear are you in?

541
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:21,922
Gear?

542
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:33,517
Well, what do I know
about shifting?

543
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:38,814
Like I ever drove before.

544
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:45,487
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

545
00:33:45,654 --> 00:33:46,989
...New Jersey.

546
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,074
Maybe you're wrong
on the slaughter thing.

547
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:52,035
How can you be sure what incurs
the Lord's wrath these days?

548
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:53,370
Times change.

549
00:33:53,537 --> 00:33:57,165
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a hell-worthy trespass.

550
00:33:57,332 --> 00:33:59,751
The major sins never change.

551
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:03,589
And besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker...

552
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:05,883
...from, like, a mile away.

553
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,801
Bet on it.

554
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:10,762
This from the guy who still owes me
10 bucks over that bet...

555
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:14,057
...about which was gonna be the
bigger movie, <i>E. T.</i> or <i>Krush Groove.</i>

556
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:17,394
You know, fuck you, man,
because time's gonna tell on that one.

557
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:24,192
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

558
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,819
Insinuating, no.

559
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,530
Flat-out telling you.

560
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,577
Right there. Right there.
There's one.

561
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:35,871
So? They're kissing.

562
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:37,080
Adultery.

563
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,416
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

564
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,501
You are just a simple creature.

565
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:44,129
- Am I right or what?
- I happen to know the truth.

566
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:47,257
I'm not gonna tell. I wanna see
how boned up on the job you are.

567
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,093
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

568
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,888
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

569
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:55,265
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

570
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:58,101
Okay. Well, it's a good thing
you were never...

571
00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:01,146
...the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

572
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:05,108
"No married man kisses his wife
like that"? Are you stoned?

573
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:06,276
Excuse me.

574
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:10,530
Are you married?

575
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:12,407
Why?

576
00:35:12,574 --> 00:35:13,951
I'm just curious.

577
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:16,370
What do you think?

578
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:27,339
- What?
- To her?

579
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:29,466
- What?
- Are you married to her?

580
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:32,970
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

581
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,888
Why?

582
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:21,685
<i>Whose house?</i>

583
00:36:21,852 --> 00:36:24,229
<i>Run's house</i>

584
00:36:24,396 --> 00:36:26,940
<i>I said, whose house?</i>

585
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:28,942
<i>Run's house</i>

586
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:31,153
<i>Whose house
Say what?</i>

587
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:33,530
<i>Run's house
Say what?</i>

588
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:35,365
<i>Martin</i>

589
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:37,159
<i>Martin</i>

590
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:42,372
She's fucking pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

591
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,458
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

592
00:36:44,624 --> 00:36:46,710
Let me know how she is.

593
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:49,629
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

594
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:52,799
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

595
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:56,053
...but being that I've decided to
go home, and not to New Jersey...

596
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:58,680
...sorry for the inconvenience,
and goodbye.

597
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:00,891
You're breaking up with us?

598
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:04,561
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

599
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:07,647
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

600
00:37:07,814 --> 00:37:10,984
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

601
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:14,237
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fucking sky, you know.

602
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:25,874
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky, you know.

603
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:41,264
No heartbeat.

604
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:44,226
Think someone threw him out a plane
with a message on him...

605
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:45,769
...like in <i>Con Air?</i>

606
00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:48,563
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

607
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,274
<i>- Con Air? Con Shit.</i>
- Kill it! Kill it!

608
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:54,444
- Sounds familiar.
- Jesus, are you okay?

609
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:56,613
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

610
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,949
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!

611
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:01,910
Hey! What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

612
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:06,081
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

613
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:08,625
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

614
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:11,461
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

615
00:38:11,628 --> 00:38:15,966
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand.

616
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:19,386
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find threads?

617
00:38:21,304 --> 00:38:23,557
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

618
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:27,978
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside of your armor.

619
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:30,438
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

620
00:38:31,648 --> 00:38:33,692
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

621
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:36,319
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

622
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:39,322
...the impact with which you hit
would have liquefied you.

623
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:41,158
Death is a worry of the living.

624
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:44,786
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

625
00:38:44,953 --> 00:38:47,581
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

626
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:48,790
I died.

627
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:51,126
Christ told me the secret
to resurrection once.

628
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:54,754
We were at this wedding in Canaan.
And I got drunk and forgot it.

629
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,590
Wait, wait, wait.

630
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:58,550
Christ?

631
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:00,677
You knew Christ?

632
00:39:00,844 --> 00:39:02,846
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

633
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,764
Let me guess.

634
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,350
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

635
00:39:07,517 --> 00:39:10,270
I'm a man, just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

636
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:11,980
At least I was a man.

637
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:15,233
Been dead nearly 2000 years.
Here, check this out.

638
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:19,529
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rocking the ganj.

639
00:39:19,696 --> 00:39:21,781
It's not a joint.

640
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:24,159
I can't read this.

641
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:29,289
It's Aramaic. It says,
"Rufus, see you in two years. Jesus."

642
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:32,542
Freaked me out because he basically
told me when my number was up.

643
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:35,462
Took all the flavor out of
the remaining years. We gotta go.

644
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:39,174
Let's say we continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit.

645
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:41,843
I'm starving. Back off, Kato.

646
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,178
Wait a second!

647
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:47,015
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

648
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:49,059
...and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

649
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:52,187
...I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

650
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:55,649
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where you came from.

651
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:57,692
Me? I came from heaven.

652
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:59,236
Now let's start walking.

653
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:02,197
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

654
00:40:02,364 --> 00:40:06,451
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

655
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:08,870
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

656
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,752
What the hell's an apostle?

657
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:40,694
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

658
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,071
She's already met the prophets...

659
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:45,240
...and the apostle's with them?

660
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:50,453
I think that our best course
of action...

661
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,040
...is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

662
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:58,753
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

663
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:02,966
...well, I'm left with no choice...

664
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:07,178
...but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

665
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:12,642
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

666
00:41:15,812 --> 00:41:18,148
I appreciate the loan.
You can have that back.

667
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:21,609
I remember when all we had
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

668
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:24,154
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

669
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:27,407
Now, how about you start
explaining things, like for starters...

670
00:41:27,574 --> 00:41:28,908
...how did you find us?

671
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:31,328
You know what the dead do
with most of their time?

672
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:34,164
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

673
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:35,832
I can't wait to die.

674
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,751
And why are you watching me?

675
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:40,170
Because you're gonna help me
get changes made...

676
00:41:40,337 --> 00:41:42,172
...in that book
you put so much stock in.

677
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:44,632
<i>- Hustler?</i>
- The Bible!

678
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:48,011
- What's your beef with the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

679
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:50,680
Neither are we. You don't
hear us bitching and moaning.

680
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:54,184
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th apostle.

681
00:41:55,852 --> 00:41:59,856
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th apostle.

682
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:02,692
Yeah, but you heard of
the other 12 apostles.

683
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:06,363
Yeah, all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

684
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:08,990
And why is that?
Because I'm a black man.

685
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:11,159
But you know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

686
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:15,663
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing the faith on.

687
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,292
- What's that?
- Jesus wasn't white. Jesus was black.

688
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:20,543
I don't buy it.

689
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,798
If that's true, why did he get
written about and you were left out?

690
00:42:24,964 --> 00:42:26,925
Well, he is the son of God.

691
00:42:27,092 --> 00:42:29,386
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

692
00:42:29,552 --> 00:42:32,222
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

693
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:35,892
Leaving me out's okay because you
still got 12 white boys to choose from.

694
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,394
You gonna listen to this shit?

695
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,646
That's what the good people
of Antioch said...

696
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:41,523
...right before they stoned my ass.

697
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:42,732
You were martyred?

698
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:44,734
That's one way of putting it.

699
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:47,862
Another way is to say I was
bludgeoned by big fucking rocks.

700
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:50,740
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit:

701
00:42:50,907 --> 00:42:53,076
Life eternal,
a place in God's heaven.

702
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:55,829
But as soon as you hear
you're getting this good shit...

703
00:42:55,995 --> 00:42:57,539
...from a black Jesus, you freak.

704
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,833
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

705
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:04,587
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't be your savior.

706
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:06,047
Gonna eat that hash brown?

707
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:09,008
So you went to heaven?

708
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:12,178
Damn right I went to heaven!
Shit, that's the least he could do.

709
00:43:12,345 --> 00:43:15,849
In the three years I followed his ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

710
00:43:16,015 --> 00:43:18,893
Hell, no. And I was in my prime.

711
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,604
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

712
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:24,274
...not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

713
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:26,276
She had a thing for dark meat.

714
00:43:26,443 --> 00:43:29,404
Maybe this is just me talking,
but if I were in heaven...

715
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:32,574
...I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as the message was right.

716
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,784
The message is what counts.

717
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:38,621
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be colorblind.

718
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:41,791
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

719
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,668
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

720
00:43:43,835 --> 00:43:47,589
That's why I'm gonna help stop those
angels from getting into that church...

721
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:50,258
...in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

722
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:53,094
How do you know about that,
the angels?

723
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:56,306
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

724
00:43:56,473 --> 00:44:00,643
When you were 5, you let a kid
from next door piss in your hand.

725
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,147
You did that shit? You're nasty.

726
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:06,733
I never told anybody about that.

727
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,485
Neither did he.

728
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:11,404
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

729
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:14,157
- His name was Brian Johnson.
- Brian Johnson.

730
00:44:14,324 --> 00:44:16,409
See, your exploits,
no matter how inane...

731
00:44:16,576 --> 00:44:18,495
...are well documented in heaven.

732
00:44:18,661 --> 00:44:20,413
Probably hell too.

733
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:27,295
Where are you going?

734
00:44:27,462 --> 00:44:29,172
Yo, man, tell me
something about me.

735
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:32,217
You masturbate more
than anyone on the planet.

736
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,178
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

737
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:37,680
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

738
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,978
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

739
00:44:47,148 --> 00:44:51,027
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

740
00:44:51,194 --> 00:44:53,696
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
if God even existed.

741
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:57,283
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

742
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,204
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

743
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:06,334
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

744
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:11,965
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

745
00:45:14,926 --> 00:45:17,262
Where did those two assholes go?

746
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:37,073
What are you doing?

747
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,158
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

748
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:41,244
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

749
00:45:41,411 --> 00:45:43,663
We gotta get moving.
How can we get to Jersey?

750
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,748
The train. I'll call for reservations.

751
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,516
I thought she looked familiar.

752
00:46:45,683 --> 00:46:47,226
- Who?
- Serendipity.

753
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:01,658
Morning, shoppers.

754
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:03,493
Good morning.

755
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:06,829
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

756
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:09,791
- We creamed them.
- All right.

757
00:47:12,502 --> 00:47:15,129
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me...

758
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:19,634
Do I smell onions?

759
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,392
Excuse me.

760
00:47:30,853 --> 00:47:33,314
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

761
00:47:34,273 --> 00:47:37,193
You may proceed, <i>mon ami.</i>

762
00:47:40,697 --> 00:47:42,782
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

763
00:47:42,949 --> 00:47:45,785
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

764
00:47:45,952 --> 00:47:47,537
Oh, come on!

765
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:52,750
Would you just relax? I'm doing it.

766
00:47:54,544 --> 00:47:57,004
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

767
00:47:57,171 --> 00:48:01,467
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher, in 1989.

768
00:48:01,634 --> 00:48:04,303
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991.

769
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,141
Broadcast nationally
as the <i>Mooby Fun-Time Hour.</i>

770
00:48:08,307 --> 00:48:12,729
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

771
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:16,774
...16 records,
eight prime-time specials...

772
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:21,446
...and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

773
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:25,491
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

774
00:48:25,658 --> 00:48:28,119
...dubbed "Mooby World."

775
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:30,538
Did I miss anything?

776
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:32,373
You forgot <i>Mooby Magazine.</i>

777
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,875
Damn it!

778
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:35,668
Now, is there a point to this?

779
00:48:35,835 --> 00:48:39,505
You and your board are idolaters.

780
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:44,427
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

781
00:48:46,596 --> 00:48:48,097
That's you.

782
00:48:49,432 --> 00:48:51,559
Do you know much about voodoo?

783
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:56,314
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

784
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:59,108
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

785
00:48:59,275 --> 00:49:01,194
...the most well-known of which...

786
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,779
...is the voodoo doll.

787
00:49:02,945 --> 00:49:04,405
You see...

788
00:49:12,747 --> 00:49:15,708
...a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

789
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,919
...to various pokes and prods.

790
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:22,131
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

791
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:23,758
- Call security, now!
- Yes, sir.

792
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:31,140
All lines are currently down.

793
00:49:31,307 --> 00:49:33,601
- I have to apologize...
- Would you knock it off?

794
00:49:33,768 --> 00:49:36,145
You're doing it again. Stop.
What did we talk about?

795
00:49:37,355 --> 00:49:40,650
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

796
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:42,693
...which draws worship
from the Lord.

797
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,112
You have broken
the First Commandment.

798
00:49:45,571 --> 00:49:48,157
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one of you...

799
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:50,993
...passes for a decent human being.

800
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,498
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

801
00:49:55,665 --> 00:49:57,500
Like you, Mr. Burton.

802
00:49:57,667 --> 00:50:01,087
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years eight times.

803
00:50:01,254 --> 00:50:03,339
You even had sex
with her best friend...

804
00:50:03,506 --> 00:50:07,760
...while you were supposed to
be home watching the kids.

805
00:50:07,927 --> 00:50:11,347
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

806
00:50:11,514 --> 00:50:12,515
Mr. Newman.

807
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:15,351
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

808
00:50:15,518 --> 00:50:17,687
...and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

809
00:50:17,854 --> 00:50:20,314
...to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

810
00:50:20,481 --> 00:50:23,025
...just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

811
00:50:23,192 --> 00:50:25,444
...when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

812
00:50:26,988 --> 00:50:29,699
She killed herself
three months later.

813
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:32,702
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

814
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:34,704
Very compassionate, Mr. Brace.

815
00:50:34,871 --> 00:50:37,874
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

816
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,294
...and used the profits
from the sale of her home...

817
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,214
...to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

818
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:47,008
Heavens.

819
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:49,802
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

820
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:53,556
...to have sex with
an 11 -year-old boy.

821
00:50:53,723 --> 00:50:56,684
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

822
00:50:56,851 --> 00:50:59,520
...from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

823
00:50:59,687 --> 00:51:02,023
...because it was, survey says...

824
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:05,318
...less costly.

825
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:08,404
You, on the other hand...

826
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:10,740
...are an innocent.

827
00:51:10,907 --> 00:51:12,700
You lead a good life.

828
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:13,910
Good for you.

829
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:17,788
But you, Mr. Whitland...

830
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:21,834
...you have more skeletons in
your closet than this assembled party.

831
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:24,670
I cannot even mention them aloud.

832
00:51:28,507 --> 00:51:32,136
You're his father, you sick fuck.

833
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:36,766
- Good.
- Not bad, right?

834
00:51:36,933 --> 00:51:38,809
That's great work. Very good.

835
00:51:40,186 --> 00:51:41,687
Well...

836
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:44,941
...alone at last.

837
00:51:45,107 --> 00:51:47,568
With the exception of
Miss Pryce here...

838
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:51,447
...there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

839
00:51:51,614 --> 00:51:53,282
Not one.

840
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:56,953
Do you know what makes
a human being decent?

841
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,287
Fear.

842
00:51:58,454 --> 00:52:00,456
And therein lies the problem.

843
00:52:00,623 --> 00:52:03,459
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

844
00:52:03,626 --> 00:52:06,963
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

845
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:10,299
...hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

846
00:52:10,466 --> 00:52:13,970
...lives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

847
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:17,348
But not from God.

848
00:52:22,353 --> 00:52:24,480
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

849
00:52:26,565 --> 00:52:30,152
Man, it really looks
just like you, doesn't it?

850
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,990
Look, if I believed enough in this...

851
00:52:34,156 --> 00:52:35,700
...I wonder...

852
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:55,845
Come on. I don't believe in voodoo.

853
00:52:59,974 --> 00:53:01,851
Voodoo.

854
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:11,444
But I do believe in this.

855
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,904
Don't run! Don't run!

856
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:17,783
Fakes! Fakes! All of you, fakes!
Oh, and you!

857
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:21,537
"But I do believe in this."

858
00:53:21,704 --> 00:53:23,039
What does that mean?

859
00:53:23,205 --> 00:53:24,540
And one to grow on.

860
00:53:30,713 --> 00:53:31,714
Gum?

861
00:53:33,132 --> 00:53:35,676
Go on. It's okay.

862
00:53:35,843 --> 00:53:37,803
You've done nothing wrong.

863
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,973
These guys were fakes.

864
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,392
You're a pure soul.

865
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:47,563
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

866
00:53:48,731 --> 00:53:50,524
Loki!

867
00:53:52,234 --> 00:53:53,569
You're getting off light.

868
00:53:53,736 --> 00:53:56,072
- Loki!
- I know. I'm coming.

869
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:01,494
You're so lucky.

870
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,375
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

871
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:09,877
Three years this August.

872
00:54:10,044 --> 00:54:13,589
Let me guess, 14th apostle, left out
of the Bible because she's a woman?

873
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:14,924
This girl's no woman.

874
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:18,010
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

875
00:54:18,177 --> 00:54:19,804
What, these?

876
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:24,100
You should know better than anyone
here that tits don't make a woman.

877
00:54:24,266 --> 00:54:26,560
The tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

878
00:54:26,727 --> 00:54:30,147
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things:

879
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:31,941
Her legs.

880
00:54:32,108 --> 00:54:34,443
But as you can see...

881
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,278
...I lack definition.

882
00:54:36,445 --> 00:54:40,074
Hey, they're getting a free show!
Let me see that shit!

883
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:43,160
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

884
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:45,913
How do you know...?
How does she know Metatron?

885
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,957
This is the last scion.

886
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,001
You're kidding.

887
00:54:53,504 --> 00:54:54,505
I'm confused.

888
00:54:54,672 --> 00:54:58,634
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

889
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:02,429
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

890
00:55:02,596 --> 00:55:06,267
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

891
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:07,893
I'm a muse, stupid.

892
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:11,564
I can't take much more of this.

893
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,315
So you, what, inspire people?

894
00:55:13,482 --> 00:55:15,651
What just went down
with your friends there...

895
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:19,113
It doesn't take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

896
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,157
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

897
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:26,745
For example, I'm responsible for 19 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

898
00:55:26,912 --> 00:55:29,415
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

899
00:55:29,582 --> 00:55:32,418
The one about the kid
by himself in his house...

900
00:55:32,585 --> 00:55:35,504
...burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off...

901
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:37,840
...I had nothing to do
with that one.

902
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,261
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to
get grosses up on that piece of shit.

903
00:56:00,696 --> 00:56:02,990
What are you doing stripping?

904
00:56:03,157 --> 00:56:04,491
You remember why I left?

905
00:56:04,658 --> 00:56:07,995
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

906
00:56:08,162 --> 00:56:11,207
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

907
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:15,211
I gave my two weeks' notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

908
00:56:15,377 --> 00:56:18,339
...and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

909
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:20,049
So, what happened?

910
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:22,801
Writer's block.

911
00:56:22,968 --> 00:56:25,721
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

912
00:56:25,888 --> 00:56:29,850
I can inspire anyone I meet and give
out a zillion and nine ideas a second...

913
00:56:30,017 --> 00:56:31,852
...but I can't keep any for myself.

914
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,856
Her quirky sense of humor.

915
00:56:36,023 --> 00:56:38,150
- Whose?
- God's.

916
00:56:38,317 --> 00:56:41,195
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there a doubt in your mind?

917
00:56:41,362 --> 00:56:43,072
He's always referred to as "him."

918
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,782
Well, that's not how I wrote it.

919
00:56:44,949 --> 00:56:47,076
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

920
00:56:47,243 --> 00:56:49,745
...is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

921
00:56:49,912 --> 00:56:52,915
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

922
00:56:53,082 --> 00:56:55,501
...and all the penholders were men.

923
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:59,505
So she became a he.
Doesn't stop with God either.

924
00:56:59,672 --> 00:57:01,632
The whole book's gender-biased.

925
00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:03,926
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

926
00:57:04,093 --> 00:57:06,220
A woman cuts Samson's
coif of power.

927
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:09,682
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

928
00:57:09,848 --> 00:57:11,225
Read that book again.

929
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:14,436
Women are bigger antagonists than
Egyptians and Romans combined.

930
00:57:14,603 --> 00:57:15,771
It stinks.

931
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:23,904
Why is the last scion here?

932
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:26,949
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

933
00:57:27,116 --> 00:57:30,202
- Not the plenary-indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?

934
00:57:30,369 --> 00:57:32,871
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

935
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:35,207
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

936
00:57:35,374 --> 00:57:37,793
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

937
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,463
I have issues with those who treat God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

938
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,881
...like some Catholics.

939
00:57:43,048 --> 00:57:45,926
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

940
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:50,222
- If we're wrong, what religion is right?
- It's not about who's right or wrong.

941
00:57:50,389 --> 00:57:52,224
No denomination's nailed it yet...

942
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:54,935
...because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

943
00:57:55,102 --> 00:57:59,940
...that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in, just that you have faith.

944
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:04,445
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

945
00:58:06,905 --> 00:58:09,408
Look, they made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

946
00:58:15,372 --> 00:58:17,333
Who fucking farted?

947
00:58:18,834 --> 00:58:22,004
Not born. Shit into existence.

948
00:58:25,507 --> 00:58:28,260
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

949
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:30,846
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

950
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:33,182
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

951
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:34,641
A shit demon!

952
00:58:34,808 --> 00:58:38,354
No man of woman born!

953
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:42,316
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

954
00:58:42,483 --> 00:58:44,026
It came for Bethany!

955
00:58:44,193 --> 00:58:47,029
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thing!

956
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:49,531
Damn! I knew I was gonna
whack somebody today!

957
00:58:49,698 --> 00:58:51,533
Yo, get your fucking hand back.

958
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,868
Represent!

959
00:58:54,328 --> 00:58:56,705
Go! Go! Go!

960
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,396
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

961
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:23,315
Over the bar! Come on!

962
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:36,245
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

963
00:59:36,412 --> 00:59:38,288
The hill where Christ
was crucified?

964
00:59:38,455 --> 00:59:41,166
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

965
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:44,753
Christ excluded, they were criminals.
Killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

966
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,006
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

967
00:59:48,173 --> 00:59:50,592
...spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

968
00:59:50,759 --> 00:59:53,512
...the result of which is
that walking pile of crap there.

969
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:56,682
The Golgothan shit demon,
hell's chief assassin.

970
00:59:56,849 --> 00:59:58,559
And it's here for you, girlie.

971
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:06,233
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

972
01:00:38,307 --> 01:00:40,809
- You the man.
- How?

973
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:44,271
"Knocks strong odors out."

974
01:00:44,897 --> 01:00:47,900
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

975
01:00:49,943 --> 01:00:51,069
What?

976
01:00:51,236 --> 01:00:53,071
Whoever sent this might send more.

977
01:00:53,238 --> 01:00:57,117
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

978
01:00:57,284 --> 01:00:59,745
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

979
01:00:59,912 --> 01:01:02,664
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

980
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:06,168
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

981
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:08,962
- Jersey's sold out, sir.
- What?

982
01:01:09,129 --> 01:01:10,631
There's one same time tomorrow.

983
01:01:10,797 --> 01:01:14,635
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State...

984
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:17,012
...and show up
two hours in advance.

985
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:20,724
Nice.

986
01:01:20,891 --> 01:01:23,727
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

987
01:01:23,894 --> 01:01:27,940
...what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

988
01:01:28,106 --> 01:01:29,691
Bus, schmus.

989
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:34,363
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

990
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:36,865
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

991
01:01:37,032 --> 01:01:38,534
Fuck, let's use them!

992
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,078
I wouldn't suggest that.

993
01:01:42,496 --> 01:01:44,248
You see, kids...

994
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:48,043
...you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

995
01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:55,509
Look at this pimp.
How'd you get out of hell?

996
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:57,803
I said I was coming up
on a routine possession.

997
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:01,181
I don't have much time. They figure
out my ruse, they'll come for me.

998
01:02:01,348 --> 01:02:04,935
- What's with bringing us in here?
- You're inches from getting caught.

999
01:02:05,102 --> 01:02:08,522
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

1000
01:02:08,689 --> 01:02:10,524
Don't you know what's going on?

1001
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:12,526
Well, we're going home.

1002
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:17,072
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into heaven?

1003
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:19,700
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

1004
01:02:19,866 --> 01:02:22,703
Both sides. Above and below.

1005
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:25,080
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

1006
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:26,540
- Really?
- Why?

1007
01:02:26,707 --> 01:02:28,792
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

1008
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:32,754
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1009
01:02:32,921 --> 01:02:36,091
...and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you might make him look bad...

1010
01:02:36,258 --> 01:02:38,093
...by succeeding where he's failed.

1011
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:41,263
- So they're just gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1012
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,266
That's why you have to
travel incognito.

1013
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:47,394
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1014
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:49,438
Quit killing people.
That's high-profile.

1015
01:02:49,605 --> 01:02:52,399
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1016
01:02:52,566 --> 01:02:54,443
Oh, believe it, boys.

1017
01:02:55,694 --> 01:02:57,904
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1018
01:02:58,071 --> 01:02:59,740
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1019
01:02:59,906 --> 01:03:02,784
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1020
01:03:02,951 --> 01:03:04,786
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1021
01:03:05,037 --> 01:03:08,123
Meanwhile, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1022
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,292
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1023
01:03:10,459 --> 01:03:13,545
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1024
01:03:13,712 --> 01:03:16,548
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1025
01:03:16,715 --> 01:03:20,302
And remember, incognito.

1026
01:03:25,265 --> 01:03:27,309
How you coping, kid?

1027
01:03:27,476 --> 01:03:29,102
It's weird.

1028
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:31,772
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1029
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:35,108
...something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1030
01:03:35,275 --> 01:03:37,736
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1031
01:03:37,903 --> 01:03:40,489
You sound like the man.

1032
01:03:40,656 --> 01:03:41,948
What's he like?

1033
01:03:42,115 --> 01:03:44,576
He likes to listen to people talk.

1034
01:03:44,743 --> 01:03:48,080
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1035
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:50,666
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1036
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:52,793
...he always had a smile
on his face.

1037
01:03:52,959 --> 01:03:54,920
His only real beef with mankind...

1038
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:58,256
...is the shit that gets carried out
in his name.

1039
01:03:58,423 --> 01:04:01,718
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1040
01:04:01,885 --> 01:04:05,472
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1041
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:07,474
He said mankind got it all wrong...

1042
01:04:07,641 --> 01:04:11,019
...by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1043
01:04:11,186 --> 01:04:13,772
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1044
01:04:13,939 --> 01:04:15,941
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1045
01:04:16,108 --> 01:04:19,152
You can change an idea.
Changing a belief is trickier.

1046
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:21,697
People die for it. People kill for it.

1047
01:04:21,863 --> 01:04:24,199
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1048
01:04:24,366 --> 01:04:29,413
...because of the Catholic beliefs
regarding this plenary-indulgence shit.

1049
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:31,873
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1050
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,792
...are exploiting that belief...

1051
01:04:33,959 --> 01:04:35,502
...and if they're successful...

1052
01:04:35,669 --> 01:04:39,589
...you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1053
01:04:39,756 --> 01:04:41,675
All over a belief.

1054
01:04:43,969 --> 01:04:47,889
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1055
01:04:48,056 --> 01:04:51,017
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1056
01:04:51,184 --> 01:04:54,521
...and he went flying through the air,
fucking crashed through the wall.

1057
01:04:54,688 --> 01:04:55,939
It was fucked up.

1058
01:04:56,106 --> 01:04:58,442
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1059
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:02,279
No. We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1060
01:05:02,446 --> 01:05:05,657
...who just got on at the last stop.
This is Larry and Barry.

1061
01:05:05,824 --> 01:05:07,075
- Hi.
- Hey.

1062
01:05:07,242 --> 01:05:09,745
So Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1063
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,294
Hit this shit, man. It's good stuff.

1064
01:05:18,336 --> 01:05:20,005
Oh, fuck.

1065
01:05:23,341 --> 01:05:25,719
That's some bad shit, dude.

1066
01:05:25,886 --> 01:05:27,763
You hit that?

1067
01:05:30,182 --> 01:05:32,100
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1068
01:05:35,312 --> 01:05:36,730
Bad shit.

1069
01:05:37,773 --> 01:05:40,233
So why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1070
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,737
It's just this thing I have to do.

1071
01:05:43,904 --> 01:05:45,280
We're going home.

1072
01:05:45,447 --> 01:05:48,116
Oh. Do you two live together?

1073
01:05:48,283 --> 01:05:50,076
Unfortunately, yes.

1074
01:05:52,788 --> 01:05:55,457
So how long have you two
been together?

1075
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:58,585
A while.

1076
01:05:58,752 --> 01:06:02,380
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1077
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:04,049
How'd you meet?

1078
01:06:04,216 --> 01:06:05,717
We were stationed together.

1079
01:06:05,884 --> 01:06:08,136
See, that's beautiful.

1080
01:06:08,303 --> 01:06:12,098
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1081
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:14,309
Pardon?

1082
01:06:14,476 --> 01:06:18,647
There's all that macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1083
01:06:18,814 --> 01:06:20,982
And you two meet there, hook up...

1084
01:06:22,025 --> 01:06:25,153
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1085
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,656
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1086
01:06:27,823 --> 01:06:30,826
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1087
01:06:31,368 --> 01:06:33,578
- No.
- All right.

1088
01:06:33,745 --> 01:06:36,832
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1089
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:39,501
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1090
01:06:39,668 --> 01:06:41,169
I call it being dumped.

1091
01:06:41,336 --> 01:06:43,213
I was...

1092
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,965
...dumped once.

1093
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:47,968
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1094
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:50,679
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1095
01:06:50,846 --> 01:06:54,349
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1096
01:06:54,516 --> 01:06:55,851
...and call you back.

1097
01:06:56,017 --> 01:06:59,354
And they always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1098
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:01,523
When actually...

1099
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,316
...it hurts more.

1100
01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:08,947
You know what we need?

1101
01:07:09,114 --> 01:07:10,866
What do we need?

1102
01:07:11,032 --> 01:07:12,450
We need drinks.

1103
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:15,996
We need a lot of drinks.

1104
01:07:17,664 --> 01:07:19,541
Garçon.

1105
01:07:26,256 --> 01:07:27,966
You're saying you still
go to church?

1106
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:30,218
Every Sunday.

1107
01:07:30,385 --> 01:07:32,679
Does it...? I mean, does it
do anything for you?

1108
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,891
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook every week.

1109
01:07:36,057 --> 01:07:40,061
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1110
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:42,397
They go to church and feel bored...

1111
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:45,859
...but they keep going every week
just out of habit.

1112
01:07:46,026 --> 01:07:48,236
I am so buzzed.

1113
01:07:49,905 --> 01:07:52,741
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1114
01:07:52,908 --> 01:07:55,118
I remember the exact moment.

1115
01:07:57,746 --> 01:08:01,416
I was on the phone
with my mother...

1116
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:05,545
...and she was trying to counsel me
through this...

1117
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:08,423
This thing.

1118
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:14,596
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1119
01:08:14,763 --> 01:08:16,598
...she said:

1120
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:18,558
"Bethany...

1121
01:08:18,725 --> 01:08:20,936
...God has a plan."

1122
01:08:24,022 --> 01:08:27,734
I was... I was so angry with her.

1123
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,363
I was like:

1124
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:33,365
"What about my plans?"

1125
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:35,283
You know?

1126
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,411
I had planned to have a family...

1127
01:08:38,578 --> 01:08:40,121
...with my husband.

1128
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:43,208
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1129
01:08:47,128 --> 01:08:48,964
Apparently not.

1130
01:08:52,342 --> 01:08:56,346
How about you?
When did you lose your faith?

1131
01:08:57,514 --> 01:08:59,683
A long time ago.

1132
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:03,269
One day God just stopped listening.

1133
01:09:03,436 --> 01:09:04,729
I kept talking...

1134
01:09:04,896 --> 01:09:07,899
...but I got the distinct impression
he wasn't listening anymore.

1135
01:09:08,066 --> 01:09:11,319
How did you know she was listening
in the first place?

1136
01:09:14,614 --> 01:09:16,241
Well, I guess I don't.

1137
01:09:16,408 --> 01:09:19,327
I hate thoughts like that.

1138
01:09:19,744 --> 01:09:22,747
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1139
01:09:22,914 --> 01:09:27,919
Because when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1140
01:09:28,795 --> 01:09:31,506
God's in heaven, and he's...

1141
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:35,051
She's always got her eye on you.

1142
01:09:39,556 --> 01:09:42,434
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1143
01:09:47,605 --> 01:09:50,775
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1144
01:09:59,034 --> 01:10:01,202
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1145
01:10:01,369 --> 01:10:04,456
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1146
01:10:04,622 --> 01:10:06,875
All right, but I warned you.

1147
01:10:07,042 --> 01:10:08,626
Okay.

1148
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:12,297
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1149
01:10:12,839 --> 01:10:14,174
Really?

1150
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:18,678
<i>Kerwood Mandel to car three.
Kerwood Mandel to car three.</i>

1151
01:10:18,845 --> 01:10:22,223
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1152
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:24,225
...from going into the church.

1153
01:10:26,186 --> 01:10:27,979
They're trying...

1154
01:10:28,146 --> 01:10:29,564
Shit.

1155
01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:34,110
They're trying
to get back into heaven.

1156
01:10:37,155 --> 01:10:39,699
See, they got tossed
out of heaven...

1157
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:41,826
...years ago, right?

1158
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:44,496
And if they get back in...

1159
01:10:44,662 --> 01:10:46,414
...it proves God wrong...

1160
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:49,667
...and since God is infallible...

1161
01:10:49,834 --> 01:10:51,503
...to prove her wrong...

1162
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:55,340
...would, you know,
unmake existence.

1163
01:10:56,716 --> 01:10:58,760
<i>May I have your attention, please.</i>

1164
01:10:58,927 --> 01:11:03,098
<i>The dining car will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.</i>

1165
01:11:03,264 --> 01:11:05,767
I feel so stupid...

1166
01:11:05,934 --> 01:11:07,852
...just saying it.

1167
01:11:09,312 --> 01:11:11,606
The thing I don't get is, I mean...

1168
01:11:11,773 --> 01:11:14,359
...how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1169
01:11:14,526 --> 01:11:15,944
Two, even!

1170
01:11:21,116 --> 01:11:24,369
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1171
01:11:24,536 --> 01:11:26,579
Maybe you're supposed to
kill them.

1172
01:11:26,746 --> 01:11:30,375
Oh, yeah, right. Kill them.

1173
01:11:31,251 --> 01:11:35,463
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1174
01:11:36,965 --> 01:11:39,968
...how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1175
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:47,225
I don't suppose it's much different
from killing a human.

1176
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:51,271
Where the hell is everybody?
I wake up and...

1177
01:11:53,314 --> 01:11:55,150
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1178
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:58,236
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1179
01:12:01,656 --> 01:12:03,575
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1180
01:12:03,741 --> 01:12:06,411
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1181
01:12:06,578 --> 01:12:08,746
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1182
01:12:08,913 --> 01:12:12,417
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1183
01:12:12,584 --> 01:12:15,336
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1184
01:12:15,503 --> 01:12:18,339
Save it, lady. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1185
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:19,924
Loki!

1186
01:12:20,508 --> 01:12:21,676
Holy shit. The apostle.

1187
01:12:21,843 --> 01:12:23,845
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1188
01:12:24,012 --> 01:12:25,138
What are you doing here?

1189
01:12:25,305 --> 01:12:27,932
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1190
01:12:28,099 --> 01:12:30,185
- She means us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1191
01:12:30,351 --> 01:12:33,688
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1192
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:36,524
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1193
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:38,318
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1194
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:41,321
We're going home, okay?
No matter whose pride it may hurt.

1195
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:43,865
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1196
01:12:44,032 --> 01:12:46,701
Are you high? I can't kill her
if she hasn't done anything.

1197
01:12:46,868 --> 01:12:48,161
Fine. I'll kill her myself.

1198
01:12:48,328 --> 01:12:50,538
What, I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1199
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:53,208
- These guys are fucking flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1200
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:04,886
Oh, shit!

1201
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:07,722
Jay!

1202
01:13:09,015 --> 01:13:10,141
Biggie!

1203
01:13:10,308 --> 01:13:12,685
The door! The door!

1204
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:18,733
Can't we talk about this?

1205
01:13:24,322 --> 01:13:27,242
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1206
01:14:07,282 --> 01:14:09,284
No ticket.

1207
01:14:11,995 --> 01:14:14,622
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1208
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:16,874
Then you know who the chick was,
don't you?

1209
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:18,251
The scion, I imagine!

1210
01:14:19,127 --> 01:14:21,129
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1211
01:14:21,296 --> 01:14:24,382
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1212
01:14:24,549 --> 01:14:26,467
And Azrael tells us we're marked?

1213
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:28,428
There's more to this
than we thought of.

1214
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:30,513
I was close.

1215
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,766
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1216
01:14:35,101 --> 01:14:38,271
You know how I felt? Righteous.

1217
01:14:38,438 --> 01:14:39,939
Justified. Eager, even.

1218
01:14:40,315 --> 01:14:42,066
You all right?
Your eyes are kind of...

1219
01:14:42,233 --> 01:14:44,277
My eyes are open.

1220
01:14:44,444 --> 01:14:46,279
For the first time I get it.

1221
01:14:46,446 --> 01:14:50,158
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1222
01:14:50,325 --> 01:14:53,995
See, in the beginning it was
just us and him, angels and God.

1223
01:14:54,162 --> 01:14:55,830
Then he created humans.

1224
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:58,916
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1225
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:02,253
...and bowing and scraping
and adoration.

1226
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,714
He gave them more
than he ever gave us.

1227
01:15:04,881 --> 01:15:06,758
He gave them a choice.

1228
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:10,136
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore him.

1229
01:15:10,303 --> 01:15:12,138
All this time
we've been down here...

1230
01:15:12,305 --> 01:15:14,807
...I've felt the absence
of the divine presence...

1231
01:15:14,974 --> 01:15:18,186
...and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1232
01:15:18,353 --> 01:15:21,981
And why?
Because of the way he made us.

1233
01:15:22,148 --> 01:15:25,693
Had we been given free will, we could
choose to ignore the pain like they do.

1234
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,487
But no, we're servants.

1235
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:29,572
Okay.

1236
01:15:29,739 --> 01:15:33,159
You know, all I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1237
01:15:33,326 --> 01:15:34,327
Wake up!

1238
01:15:34,494 --> 01:15:37,163
Humans have besmirched
everything he's bestowed on them.

1239
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:39,165
They were given paradise,
they threw it away.

1240
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:41,667
They were given this planet,
they destroyed it.

1241
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:44,295
They were favored best
among all his endeavors...

1242
01:15:44,462 --> 01:15:47,715
...and some of them
don't even believe he exists!

1243
01:15:47,882 --> 01:15:49,884
And in spite of it all...

1244
01:15:50,051 --> 01:15:53,679
...he has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1245
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:55,556
...at every turn.

1246
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:57,225
What about us?

1247
01:15:58,393 --> 01:16:01,229
I asked you once...

1248
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:04,232
...to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1249
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:06,150
What was the result?

1250
01:16:06,317 --> 01:16:08,486
Our expulsion from paradise.

1251
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:11,155
Where was his
infinite fucking patience then?

1252
01:16:11,322 --> 01:16:14,075
It's not right! It's not fair!

1253
01:16:14,242 --> 01:16:16,119
We've paid our debt!

1254
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:20,289
Don't you think it's time?

1255
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:23,292
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1256
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:29,924
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1257
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:32,677
Wait. Wait, wait. Kill them?

1258
01:16:33,886 --> 01:16:36,514
You're talking about the last scion,
for chrissake.

1259
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:39,517
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1260
01:16:39,684 --> 01:16:41,144
Don't. Don't, my friend.

1261
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:44,856
See, don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1262
01:16:45,022 --> 01:16:46,441
They did me once.

1263
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,401
Scion or not...

1264
01:16:48,568 --> 01:16:49,902
...she's just a human...

1265
01:16:50,069 --> 01:16:53,114
...and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1266
01:16:53,281 --> 01:16:55,283
No harm, no foul.

1267
01:16:56,451 --> 01:16:59,287
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1268
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:02,206
What did you say?

1269
01:17:02,373 --> 01:17:05,376
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1270
01:17:05,543 --> 01:17:08,463
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking mouth!

1271
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:11,632
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1272
01:17:11,799 --> 01:17:14,302
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1273
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:16,971
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1274
01:17:18,431 --> 01:17:19,974
Well, fuck that.

1275
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:24,395
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the throne.

1276
01:17:25,938 --> 01:17:27,482
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1277
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:30,776
We're going home, Loki...

1278
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:34,906
...and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty himself...

1279
01:17:35,072 --> 01:17:36,908
...is gonna make that otherwise.

1280
01:17:43,498 --> 01:17:44,916
Shit.

1281
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:49,670
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1282
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:51,506
Very basic strategy.

1283
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:55,009
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1284
01:17:55,176 --> 01:17:56,177
Why are we enemies?

1285
01:17:56,344 --> 01:17:59,639
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1286
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:03,100
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1287
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:06,854
I'm tired of
all this cryptic bullshit.

1288
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:09,524
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1289
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,818
...and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1290
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:15,279
...unless you come clean right now.

1291
01:18:15,446 --> 01:18:17,448
Why me?

1292
01:18:17,615 --> 01:18:21,035
Out of all the people on the
goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1293
01:18:21,202 --> 01:18:24,413
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1294
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:29,293
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1295
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,964
How long would it take to come
to grips with something that huge?

1296
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,716
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1297
01:18:35,883 --> 01:18:40,888
In the Bible, Jesus suddenly goes
from age 12 to 30. Twelve to 30.

1298
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:43,182
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1299
01:18:43,349 --> 01:18:46,185
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1300
01:18:46,352 --> 01:18:47,562
I'll tell you where.

1301
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:52,400
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1302
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:55,486
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1303
01:18:55,653 --> 01:18:58,322
...to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1304
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:02,076
Oh, bullshit.

1305
01:19:02,243 --> 01:19:04,161
Any important material
about Christ...

1306
01:19:04,328 --> 01:19:06,831
...would give people
a better understanding of God.

1307
01:19:06,998 --> 01:19:10,918
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with his family.

1308
01:19:11,085 --> 01:19:14,046
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1309
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:18,384
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1310
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:22,805
Mary gave birth to Christ without
knowing a man's touch. This is true.

1311
01:19:22,972 --> 01:19:24,807
But she did have a husband.

1312
01:19:24,974 --> 01:19:28,603
Do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1313
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:30,271
...if he wasn't getting laid?

1314
01:19:30,438 --> 01:19:33,774
The nature of God and the virgin birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1315
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:38,112
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1316
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:39,280
Meaning?

1317
01:19:39,447 --> 01:19:41,282
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1318
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:44,076
...shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1319
01:19:44,243 --> 01:19:45,911
...with the one you call Jesus.

1320
01:19:47,038 --> 01:19:48,873
Bethany, you are...

1321
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,335
...the great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great...

1322
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:55,963
...great-great-grandniece
of Jesus Christ.

1323
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:03,888
So that would make Bethany
part black?

1324
01:20:08,643 --> 01:20:10,603
I can't do this anymore.

1325
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:18,986
Bethany, where you gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1326
01:20:19,153 --> 01:20:20,821
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1327
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:22,782
It's bullshit!

1328
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:28,537
Let her go, man.

1329
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:30,122
Give her time.

1330
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:39,465
Why?!

1331
01:20:39,632 --> 01:20:42,468
What the fuck do you want
from me?

1332
01:20:42,635 --> 01:20:44,929
I fucking hate you!

1333
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:47,515
I hate you.

1334
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:49,850
He can't hear you, you know.

1335
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:57,692
That's why we needed you.

1336
01:20:57,858 --> 01:21:00,027
Why didn't you tell me?

1337
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:01,821
Would you...?

1338
01:21:02,405 --> 01:21:04,657
Could you have believed me?

1339
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:07,952
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1340
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:11,664
Only after everything you've seen...

1341
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:13,457
...everything you've heard...

1342
01:21:15,459 --> 01:21:18,504
...could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1343
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:21,173
I don't want this.

1344
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:25,886
It's too big.

1345
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:27,638
That's what Jesus said.

1346
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,809
I had to tell him.

1347
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:38,065
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1348
01:21:39,108 --> 01:21:41,402
...not to be able
to tell the son himself...

1349
01:21:41,569 --> 01:21:44,572
...because one word from his lips
would destroy the boy's human form.

1350
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:47,742
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1351
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:50,536
...who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1352
01:21:50,703 --> 01:21:54,415
I had to tell this little boy
that he was God's only son...

1353
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:57,418
...and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1354
01:21:57,585 --> 01:22:00,713
...at the hands of the very people
he'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1355
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,134
He begged me to take it all back.

1356
01:22:06,552 --> 01:22:08,095
As if I could.

1357
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:12,600
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1358
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:17,104
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
it's something I've never told anyone.

1359
01:22:19,023 --> 01:22:21,108
If I had the power...

1360
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:23,360
...I would have.

1361
01:22:24,153 --> 01:22:25,279
It's unfair.

1362
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:29,033
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1363
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,410
...and to ask you
to do the same now.

1364
01:22:31,577 --> 01:22:35,331
I sympathize. I do.
I wish I could take it all back.

1365
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,835
But I can't.

1366
01:22:42,713 --> 01:22:44,131
This...

1367
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,468
...is who you are.

1368
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:51,931
Everything I am has been a lie?

1369
01:22:53,432 --> 01:22:55,309
No, no, no.

1370
01:22:56,018 --> 01:23:00,564
Knowing what you now know doesn't
mean you're not who you were.

1371
01:23:00,731 --> 01:23:03,442
You are Bethany Sloane.

1372
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:07,029
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1373
01:23:08,364 --> 01:23:13,035
All this means is
a redefinition of that identity.

1374
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:16,747
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1375
01:23:16,914 --> 01:23:18,999
Be who you've always been.

1376
01:23:20,084 --> 01:23:21,252
Just...

1377
01:23:22,253 --> 01:23:24,296
...be this as well...

1378
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:28,092
...from time to time.

1379
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,598
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1380
01:23:34,765 --> 01:23:36,934
To say the least.

1381
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,653
Do you mind if we adjourn
to somewhere...

1382
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:50,364
...a tad more habitable...

1383
01:23:50,531 --> 01:23:52,491
...and a bit warmer?

1384
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:09,550
Fuck, man, I think this shit
just kicked in.

1385
01:24:09,717 --> 01:24:12,511
Weren't we just in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1386
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:14,555
Going out in style.

1387
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:17,224
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1388
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:19,143
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1389
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,395
It's the voice of God.
Show some respect.

1390
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:23,898
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of him?

1391
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:26,233
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1392
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,069
- What?
- Come on. Didn't it ever occur to you...

1393
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:33,198
...that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of his control?

1394
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:35,034
Yes, but then why was she tapped?

1395
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,079
You know those constitutionals
that he likes to take?

1396
01:24:39,246 --> 01:24:40,414
"Constitutionals"?

1397
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:43,000
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1398
01:24:43,167 --> 01:24:45,002
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1399
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:49,340
The Lord has a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it for years.

1400
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:52,092
He assumes a human form
once a month and indulges.

1401
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:55,179
Doesn't say where he's playing,
just goes away for a couple hours.

1402
01:24:55,346 --> 01:24:58,766
And he always gives his free points
away to neighborhood children.

1403
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:00,267
Isn't that sweet?

1404
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:03,938
But she hasn't come back from
one of these day trips, is that it?

1405
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:06,398
No, she hasn't...

1406
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:09,276
...and we've been
unable to locate her.

1407
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:12,696
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1408
01:25:12,863 --> 01:25:17,117
No, there's a different sort
of foul play afoot, children.

1409
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:21,288
Whomever has set
the renegade angels on their path...

1410
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:23,791
...and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1411
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:26,835
...is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1412
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:29,171
Were he to be killed
in human form...

1413
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:31,924
...he'd have returned
immediately to heaven.

1414
01:25:32,091 --> 01:25:33,968
Someone knew enough...

1415
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:36,178
...to keep him biologically alive...

1416
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:39,223
...but incapacitate him
in another fashion.

1417
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:42,059
And as omnipotent
as we are above...

1418
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:45,604
...I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without his presence.

1419
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:47,606
We've looked everywhere for him.

1420
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:52,528
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind it.

1421
01:25:52,695 --> 01:25:55,906
But whoever he is was clever enough
to send some lackeys after you...

1422
01:25:56,073 --> 01:25:58,075
...as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1423
01:25:58,242 --> 01:25:59,910
Could it be Lucifer?

1424
01:26:00,077 --> 01:26:01,370
Not Lucifer.

1425
01:26:01,537 --> 01:26:04,999
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1426
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:08,002
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1427
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:11,296
...because he has just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1428
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:12,840
So, what do we do now?

1429
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:15,759
Well, I say we get drunk,
because I'm all out of ideas.

1430
01:26:15,926 --> 01:26:18,804
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?

1431
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:20,681
I beg your pardon?

1432
01:26:20,848 --> 01:26:22,766
It's the guy in charge
of the church thing.

1433
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:27,438
Cardinal Glick?

1434
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:29,690
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1435
01:26:29,857 --> 01:26:33,110
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1436
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:34,486
Good Lord.

1437
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:36,613
The little stoner's got a point.

1438
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:41,285
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
canceling the rededication ceremony.

1439
01:26:41,452 --> 01:26:43,370
"We"?

1440
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:46,540
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. I Can't Do This Anymore?

1441
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:54,214
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now, would I?

1442
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:59,178
Well...

1443
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:03,057
...the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1444
01:27:03,599 --> 01:27:06,310
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1445
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:10,898
...but if we can let them know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1446
01:27:11,065 --> 01:27:14,026
...we can win them back,
even get some new ones.

1447
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:15,694
Excuse me.

1448
01:27:17,821 --> 01:27:19,364
Fill them pews, people.

1449
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:22,367
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1450
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:24,912
Hook them while they're young.

1451
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:29,166
- Kind of like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1452
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,377
We really appreciate you seeing us
so late in the day, Your Eminence.

1453
01:27:32,544 --> 01:27:36,048
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1454
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:38,592
...about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1455
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:41,178
So you looking to help out
in some way, I take it?

1456
01:27:41,345 --> 01:27:44,056
We'd like you to cancel
the ceremony.

1457
01:27:45,182 --> 01:27:46,767
I beg your pardon.

1458
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:50,854
There's gonna be a world of trouble
if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward.

1459
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,775
Are you pro-choice?

1460
01:27:54,942 --> 01:27:56,443
No, no. The trouble's not from us.

1461
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:59,863
It's from renegade angels that have
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1462
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:05,119
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1463
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,412
See, padre, it goes down like this.

1464
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:10,207
These guys think that
by passing through that archway...

1465
01:28:10,374 --> 01:28:12,209
...they can go straight to heaven.

1466
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:15,921
You want me to call off
the ceremony for that.

1467
01:28:17,047 --> 01:28:18,132
Who sent you?

1468
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,262
We were sent
by him who is called I Am!

1469
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:25,931
Cute. Really cute.

1470
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:28,392
Kids, playtime with the cardinal
is over.

1471
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:31,103
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1472
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:32,813
Your Eminence, it's not a joke.

1473
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:35,983
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1474
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:38,986
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1475
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:42,030
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1476
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:44,658
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?

1477
01:28:44,825 --> 01:28:47,161
All right, mistakes were made.

1478
01:28:47,327 --> 01:28:50,455
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1479
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:52,416
...responsible for
the oversights of old.

1480
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:56,253
I'm an important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1481
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,838
...so if you please...

1482
01:28:58,005 --> 01:29:00,674
- But tomorrow...
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1483
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:02,092
Do I make myself clear?

1484
01:29:02,259 --> 01:29:06,847
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God himself...

1485
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:09,850
...is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1486
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,873
I can see the headlines now...

1487
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:34,875
...if there were gonna be any.

1488
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:36,543
"Existence Erased."

1489
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,879
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1490
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:41,298
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1491
01:29:43,884 --> 01:29:44,968
What up?

1492
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,304
You stole the cardinal's driver?

1493
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:51,391
That's what he gets for messing with
our girlfriend. Cross-dressing fuck.

1494
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:54,269
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1495
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,565
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1496
01:29:58,732 --> 01:30:01,860
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill them.

1497
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:04,071
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1498
01:30:05,739 --> 01:30:08,408
They won't be killed.

1499
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:11,536
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1500
01:30:11,703 --> 01:30:15,958
...right here, until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1501
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:19,753
Hey. There's only
one idiot here, Azrael...

1502
01:30:22,547 --> 01:30:24,633
...and I'm looking right at him.

1503
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,260
Muse!

1504
01:30:27,636 --> 01:30:30,722
Just in time to join us for a drink.

1505
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:33,267
Hey. Where'd you come from?

1506
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:37,062
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1507
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:38,647
Nothingness.

1508
01:30:38,814 --> 01:30:42,442
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1509
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:46,113
All right, Plato, sounds like
you've had enough already.

1510
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,657
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1511
01:30:48,824 --> 01:30:52,411
Come on, barkeep, just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1512
01:30:52,577 --> 01:30:55,831
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1513
01:30:55,998 --> 01:30:57,416
Is that who I think it is?

1514
01:30:57,582 --> 01:30:58,792
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1515
01:30:58,959 --> 01:31:01,628
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1516
01:31:01,795 --> 01:31:03,880
Give me a...

1517
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:06,425
...Holy Bartender.

1518
01:31:06,591 --> 01:31:08,385
Never heard of it.

1519
01:31:08,552 --> 01:31:12,306
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1520
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:14,308
You do, don't you, Muse?

1521
01:31:14,474 --> 01:31:15,475
Don't.

1522
01:31:16,643 --> 01:31:19,313
Anybody? No?

1523
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:22,899
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1524
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:32,576
Get it?

1525
01:31:32,743 --> 01:31:34,911
Sweet Jesus, Azrael! Why?

1526
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:38,498
Come on, demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1527
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:42,002
Oh, apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1528
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:45,130
...and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1529
01:31:45,297 --> 01:31:47,341
The Christ bitch will join you.

1530
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:50,594
Are you really that stupid?

1531
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:54,181
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1532
01:31:54,348 --> 01:31:56,641
I'm actually counting on it.

1533
01:31:57,934 --> 01:32:00,020
And if my calculations
are correct...

1534
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:02,856
...the pawns are moving
into checkmate as we speak.

1535
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:11,365
"Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1536
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:15,660
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1537
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:17,371
...for coming here this morning.

1538
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:20,540
True, she's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1539
01:32:22,584 --> 01:32:26,880
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1540
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:29,633
...hundred-years-young
house of God.

1541
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,009
God's house?

1542
01:32:32,469 --> 01:32:35,097
God doesn't live here anymore.

1543
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:37,974
He's grown weary
of your superficial faith.

1544
01:32:38,141 --> 01:32:40,977
He's turned a deaf ear
to your lip-service prayers.

1545
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:43,397
- He has abandoned you...
- Sorry.

1546
01:32:43,563 --> 01:32:46,400
...his favorites,
to the whim of judgment.

1547
01:32:46,566 --> 01:32:48,985
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1548
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:53,240
...prepare to taste God's wrath.

1549
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:54,616
Maybe we should just leave.

1550
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:56,451
You wanted your body count.
You got it.

1551
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:58,995
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1552
01:32:59,162 --> 01:33:00,330
Officer McGhee.

1553
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:02,916
All right, mouthpiece...

1554
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:05,752
...let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1555
01:33:05,919 --> 01:33:08,255
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1556
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:10,257
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

1557
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:12,175
Is that so?

1558
01:33:16,555 --> 01:33:18,223
Ladies and gentlemen...

1559
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:23,770
...you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1560
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:26,273
...and this very day...

1561
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,110
...I assure you, you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1562
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:31,945
...in blood.

1563
01:33:32,112 --> 01:33:34,281
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1564
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:35,449
Do it!

1565
01:33:36,741 --> 01:33:39,369
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1566
01:33:41,121 --> 01:33:44,458
He was kicked out.

1567
01:33:44,624 --> 01:33:46,960
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1568
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:48,128
Then what happened?

1569
01:33:48,295 --> 01:33:50,380
Yes, what?

1570
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:54,426
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1571
01:33:54,593 --> 01:33:57,053
Heaven became divided
into two factions...

1572
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:59,306
...the faithful and the renegades.

1573
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:02,225
Oh, the ethereal plains
were chaotic with battle.

1574
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:05,103
Angel against angel.

1575
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:08,607
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1576
01:34:08,773 --> 01:34:10,567
But Azrael refused to fight.

1577
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:14,154
He remained in the middle, waiting
to see who came out victorious.

1578
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:16,323
What are you,
some kind of fucking chicken?

1579
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:17,824
No.

1580
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:21,828
I was an artist, stupid!

1581
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:23,538
I was inspiration!

1582
01:34:23,705 --> 01:34:26,124
A muse has no place in battle.

1583
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:28,752
So after the fallen
were banished to hell...

1584
01:34:28,919 --> 01:34:30,921
...God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1585
01:34:31,087 --> 01:34:33,340
...and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1586
01:34:33,507 --> 01:34:36,218
...something he considers
a great injustice.

1587
01:34:36,384 --> 01:34:38,470
Oh, come on.

1588
01:34:38,637 --> 01:34:41,598
Don't tell me you never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1589
01:34:41,765 --> 01:34:44,434
No. It never bothered me.

1590
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:46,520
So you were an artist.

1591
01:34:46,686 --> 01:34:48,355
Big deal!

1592
01:34:48,522 --> 01:34:50,524
Elvis was an artist...

1593
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:53,944
...but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time of war.

1594
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:55,946
That's why he is the king...

1595
01:34:56,112 --> 01:34:57,948
...and you're a schmuck.

1596
01:34:58,114 --> 01:34:59,199
Nice.

1597
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:01,159
So all this is about revenge.

1598
01:35:01,326 --> 01:35:04,204
You're gonna unmake existence
because of a grudge against God?

1599
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:08,041
After the first million years? No.

1600
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:11,962
Escape from hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1601
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:16,550
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1602
01:35:16,716 --> 01:35:18,134
...which it finally did...

1603
01:35:18,301 --> 01:35:20,178
...in Catholicism.

1604
01:35:20,345 --> 01:35:21,513
Plenary indulgence.

1605
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,473
But I couldn't exercise it.

1606
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,017
Demons can't become human.

1607
01:35:26,184 --> 01:35:28,228
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1608
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:31,189
But angels can.

1609
01:35:32,524 --> 01:35:33,733
Bartleby and Loki.

1610
01:35:35,569 --> 01:35:38,488
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1611
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:40,365
...to celebrate their centennial...

1612
01:35:40,532 --> 01:35:46,079
...and when it finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1613
01:35:46,246 --> 01:35:48,081
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1614
01:35:48,248 --> 01:35:50,250
...kept them cloaked
and off heaven's radars.

1615
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:53,503
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1616
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:57,382
...no soul in hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1617
01:35:57,549 --> 01:36:00,427
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1618
01:36:00,594 --> 01:36:04,014
...so I dispatched him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1619
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:06,516
Her. And how?

1620
01:36:06,683 --> 01:36:09,185
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1621
01:36:09,352 --> 01:36:12,188
Oh, no, I've seen way too many
Bond movies to know...

1622
01:36:12,355 --> 01:36:15,191
...that you never reveal
all the details of your plan...

1623
01:36:15,358 --> 01:36:18,695
...no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1624
01:36:18,862 --> 01:36:21,948
The only X factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1625
01:36:22,782 --> 01:36:27,412
But fat lot of good that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1626
01:36:30,248 --> 01:36:33,376
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1627
01:36:33,543 --> 01:36:37,547
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1628
01:36:37,714 --> 01:36:41,551
...but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1629
01:36:41,718 --> 01:36:44,596
Human, have you ever
been to hell?

1630
01:36:44,763 --> 01:36:46,806
I think not.

1631
01:36:46,973 --> 01:36:49,142
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1632
01:36:49,309 --> 01:36:53,605
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1633
01:36:53,772 --> 01:36:56,149
Still thinking only about yourself...

1634
01:36:56,316 --> 01:36:58,151
...you fucking child!

1635
01:36:58,318 --> 01:37:00,403
Now, now, now.

1636
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:04,282
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1637
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:06,910
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1638
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:08,995
Yo, put on Channel 9.
<i>Davey and Goliath.</i>

1639
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:14,751
Actually, I was thinking more
along the lines of current events.

1640
01:37:14,918 --> 01:37:17,253
<i>Keep rolling! Keep rolling!</i>

1641
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:20,173
<i>I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...</i>

1642
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,384
<i>...have laid waste to St. Michael's!</i>

1643
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:24,886
<i>Bullets don't seem to affect them!</i>

1644
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,556
<i>The remainder of the crowd
have dropped to their knees...</i>

1645
01:37:28,723 --> 01:37:31,017
<i>...identifying this
as the fabled apocalypse.</i>

1646
01:37:31,184 --> 01:37:33,978
<i>Now, I'm not a man of faith,
but I'm inclined to agree.</i>

1647
01:37:34,145 --> 01:37:38,274
<i>God, please, don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer! God, no!</i>

1648
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:40,110
<i>No!</i>

1649
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:49,536
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1650
01:37:49,703 --> 01:37:53,206
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not gonna matter anyway.

1651
01:37:59,963 --> 01:38:02,298
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1652
01:38:02,465 --> 01:38:03,967
What?

1653
01:38:04,134 --> 01:38:06,553
Oh, nothing.

1654
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,805
I had something in my eye.

1655
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:11,641
Now who's the fucking child?

1656
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:16,020
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1657
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:18,440
Are you serious?
I'm a fucking demon.

1658
01:38:18,606 --> 01:38:20,358
You'd have him assault me
with a putter?

1659
01:38:21,484 --> 01:38:23,486
You want to play? Then we'll play.

1660
01:38:23,653 --> 01:38:25,363
One side, Red.

1661
01:38:26,114 --> 01:38:29,033
Go ahead, then. Pick it up.
Call it a gift.

1662
01:38:30,535 --> 01:38:32,454
Come on.

1663
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:34,038
That's it.

1664
01:38:35,832 --> 01:38:37,083
Take a shot.

1665
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:40,754
Take your best fucking shot.

1666
01:38:42,297 --> 01:38:45,258
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1667
01:38:45,884 --> 01:38:48,136
Come on, bright boy.

1668
01:38:55,977 --> 01:38:58,396
Don't you know anything?

1669
01:39:13,912 --> 01:39:15,789
Bethany, bless the sink!

1670
01:39:15,955 --> 01:39:17,749
- What?
- Just do it!

1671
01:39:17,916 --> 01:39:19,793
Bless the sink, damn it!

1672
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:46,277
That's what you get, motherfucker.

1673
01:39:48,905 --> 01:39:50,990
But I'm a fucking demon.

1674
01:39:58,331 --> 01:39:59,582
What just happened?

1675
01:39:59,749 --> 01:40:02,293
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1676
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:06,756
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side will do the most damage.

1677
01:40:06,923 --> 01:40:08,842
Holy shit!
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1678
01:40:09,008 --> 01:40:12,846
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1679
01:40:13,012 --> 01:40:16,015
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1680
01:40:16,182 --> 01:40:18,268
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1681
01:40:18,434 --> 01:40:20,979
Remind me to try the water-to-wine
thing at my next party.

1682
01:40:21,145 --> 01:40:23,940
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about 10 miles.

1683
01:40:24,107 --> 01:40:26,109
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1684
01:40:26,276 --> 01:40:28,444
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1685
01:40:28,611 --> 01:40:31,865
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1686
01:40:43,585 --> 01:40:45,295
Oh, my God.

1687
01:40:58,057 --> 01:41:00,727
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1688
01:41:00,894 --> 01:41:02,061
Are we too late?

1689
01:41:02,228 --> 01:41:04,731
To save these poor schmucks?

1690
01:41:06,566 --> 01:41:07,609
Yeah.

1691
01:41:07,775 --> 01:41:10,361
But we still exist.

1692
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,238
Where are they?

1693
01:41:12,405 --> 01:41:14,824
They could already be
in the church.

1694
01:41:14,991 --> 01:41:17,035
So if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1695
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:18,411
Are you fucking shitting me?

1696
01:41:18,578 --> 01:41:21,414
The brother is gonna shred them
with his angel-be-good special...

1697
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:22,582
...ain't you, homey?

1698
01:41:22,749 --> 01:41:24,751
If they pass through that arch,
they're clean.

1699
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:26,836
And if they die, they go straight up.

1700
01:41:27,003 --> 01:41:29,339
And, hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1701
01:41:29,505 --> 01:41:31,758
- Why don't they kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1702
01:41:31,925 --> 01:41:34,761
Die with a mortal sin and you burn.
They don't wanna go to hell.

1703
01:41:34,928 --> 01:41:38,598
Then what are we supposed to do,
wait for a solution to fall from the sky?

1704
01:41:42,894 --> 01:41:44,187
Friend of yours?

1705
01:41:44,354 --> 01:41:46,230
No, that was a cardinal.

1706
01:41:46,397 --> 01:41:50,109
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1707
01:41:50,276 --> 01:41:52,779
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1708
01:41:52,946 --> 01:41:54,113
Don't you listen?

1709
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:57,200
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1710
01:41:57,367 --> 01:41:59,535
He's been at it for a while now.

1711
01:41:59,702 --> 01:42:01,287
Please! Please!

1712
01:42:02,455 --> 01:42:04,290
We ran out of parishioners...

1713
01:42:04,457 --> 01:42:08,753
...so he just started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping them.

1714
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:12,048
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1715
01:42:13,091 --> 01:42:15,134
If only they'd let us jerk off,
you know?

1716
01:42:17,053 --> 01:42:18,304
Take a step back.

1717
01:42:22,684 --> 01:42:24,102
Let me go!

1718
01:42:25,311 --> 01:42:27,480
Why? What are you trying to prove?

1719
01:42:27,647 --> 01:42:30,984
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1720
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:33,444
Jesus Christ!

1721
01:42:34,821 --> 01:42:36,656
I just wanted to go home.

1722
01:42:36,823 --> 01:42:38,616
But him, you know...

1723
01:42:38,783 --> 01:42:41,077
...he just lost it.

1724
01:42:41,244 --> 01:42:44,330
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1725
01:42:44,497 --> 01:42:45,915
He just snapped.

1726
01:42:46,082 --> 01:42:49,585
And the funny thing is, this guy could
never even stand to see me work.

1727
01:42:49,752 --> 01:42:52,797
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1728
01:42:53,923 --> 01:42:55,341
Now look at him.

1729
01:42:55,508 --> 01:42:57,510
This guy's fucking drunker
than hell.

1730
01:42:57,677 --> 01:43:00,096
Which means he's human now.

1731
01:43:01,514 --> 01:43:03,599
His wings have been cut off.

1732
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,685
Loki...

1733
01:43:08,312 --> 01:43:10,023
Loki.

1734
01:43:10,189 --> 01:43:12,066
The muse?

1735
01:43:12,233 --> 01:43:14,277
Oh, no way!

1736
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:17,155
I haven't seen you...
You look terrific.

1737
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:19,365
What's with the tits? Can I...

1738
01:43:19,532 --> 01:43:21,701
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1739
01:43:25,121 --> 01:43:28,624
Tell me. Have you gone in and
come out through the archway yet?

1740
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:30,043
No!

1741
01:43:35,465 --> 01:43:36,549
He's back.

1742
01:43:59,947 --> 01:44:01,866
We were awaiting your arrival.

1743
01:44:02,033 --> 01:44:04,994
Bartleby, wait. Stop. Listen to me.

1744
01:44:05,161 --> 01:44:07,747
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1745
01:44:07,914 --> 01:44:09,082
If you go back...

1746
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:11,793
I've become aware
of the repercussions.

1747
01:44:11,959 --> 01:44:13,002
I know what I'm doing.

1748
01:44:14,545 --> 01:44:16,089
You sick, twisted fuck!

1749
01:44:17,757 --> 01:44:18,925
Bethany.

1750
01:44:22,178 --> 01:44:25,431
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1751
01:44:25,598 --> 01:44:28,434
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1752
01:44:28,601 --> 01:44:31,604
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1753
01:44:31,771 --> 01:44:34,190
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1754
01:44:34,357 --> 01:44:36,442
And while you never see
your ex-husband...

1755
01:44:36,609 --> 01:44:39,946
...or how blissful he is
with his new wife...

1756
01:44:40,905 --> 01:44:42,115
And he is.

1757
01:44:45,326 --> 01:44:50,039
...seeing you people every day on this
perfect world he created for you...

1758
01:44:50,206 --> 01:44:51,791
...is a constant reminder...

1759
01:44:51,958 --> 01:44:54,961
...that though my kind came first...

1760
01:44:55,128 --> 01:44:57,713
...your kind was most revered.

1761
01:44:58,422 --> 01:45:00,716
And while you know forgiveness...

1762
01:45:00,883 --> 01:45:02,802
...we know only regret.

1763
01:45:04,262 --> 01:45:05,638
The lesson must be taught.

1764
01:45:05,805 --> 01:45:07,557
All are accountable...

1765
01:45:07,723 --> 01:45:08,975
...even God.

1766
01:45:10,309 --> 01:45:12,436
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1767
01:45:12,603 --> 01:45:16,315
...just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1768
01:45:17,066 --> 01:45:20,486
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1769
01:45:20,653 --> 01:45:22,071
...will cease to be.

1770
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:23,739
No. Hey. Hey!

1771
01:45:24,407 --> 01:45:26,325
No. No.

1772
01:45:26,492 --> 01:45:28,327
I can't let you do that, Bartleby.

1773
01:45:28,828 --> 01:45:30,496
This has gone too far.

1774
01:45:32,623 --> 01:45:35,001
I might have to take you down.

1775
01:45:36,502 --> 01:45:38,296
It's okay.

1776
01:45:38,462 --> 01:45:40,006
I'll do it.

1777
01:45:44,802 --> 01:45:46,679
My compatriot.

1778
01:45:48,139 --> 01:45:50,558
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1779
01:45:50,725 --> 01:45:51,934
He's weakened.

1780
01:45:52,101 --> 01:45:53,436
You're weak.

1781
01:45:53,603 --> 01:45:56,355
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1782
01:45:56,522 --> 01:45:58,649
...a condition which carries
two liabilities.

1783
01:46:00,484 --> 01:46:02,278
A conscience...

1784
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:04,530
...and...

1785
01:46:07,533 --> 01:46:10,036
...a short life span.

1786
01:46:10,203 --> 01:46:12,955
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1787
01:46:40,733 --> 01:46:42,652
Oh, my God. He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1788
01:46:42,818 --> 01:46:45,029
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1789
01:46:46,489 --> 01:46:47,823
I can't believe this shit.

1790
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:50,576
We're on the brink of nonexistence
and God's still missing.

1791
01:46:50,743 --> 01:46:53,704
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1792
01:47:00,586 --> 01:47:02,713
What the hell are you doing?

1793
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,259
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1794
01:47:10,429 --> 01:47:13,266
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1795
01:47:13,432 --> 01:47:16,936
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1796
01:47:17,103 --> 01:47:19,939
- ...or we can get making with the love.
- What did you say?

1797
01:47:20,106 --> 01:47:22,108
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1798
01:47:22,275 --> 01:47:23,734
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1799
01:47:27,613 --> 01:47:30,449
That guy they won't take off
life support, John Doe Jersey.

1800
01:47:30,616 --> 01:47:32,618
This is where he's at,
St. Michael's Hospital.

1801
01:47:34,287 --> 01:47:35,621
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1802
01:47:35,788 --> 01:47:38,374
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1803
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:40,918
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1804
01:47:41,085 --> 01:47:42,962
- Have you been there?
- Once, with a chick.

1805
01:47:43,129 --> 01:47:46,132
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1806
01:47:46,299 --> 01:47:48,092
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1807
01:47:51,595 --> 01:47:53,472
That's what I'm talking about.

1808
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:04,483
Whatever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1809
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:06,736
Bob, come with me. Come on!

1810
01:48:06,902 --> 01:48:09,488
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1811
01:48:09,655 --> 01:48:11,824
I already did, but it takes two of us!

1812
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,910
<i>I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

1813
01:48:15,077 --> 01:48:16,746
<i>This is the apocalypse.</i>

1814
01:48:16,912 --> 01:48:19,582
<i>Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.</i>

1815
01:48:19,749 --> 01:48:21,417
<i>Thank you.</i>

1816
01:48:36,849 --> 01:48:38,476
Hey, Big Bird!

1817
01:48:39,435 --> 01:48:41,020
Ready for the counting game?

1818
01:48:41,187 --> 01:48:42,772
No!

1819
01:48:45,858 --> 01:48:47,777
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1820
01:49:16,013 --> 01:49:17,890
No more bullets.

1821
01:49:18,057 --> 01:49:20,184
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1822
01:49:20,351 --> 01:49:23,187
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1823
01:49:23,354 --> 01:49:25,356
You just did him a favor, stupid!

1824
01:50:12,111 --> 01:50:14,780
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1825
01:50:55,946 --> 01:50:58,324
Oh, Bartleby.

1826
01:50:58,491 --> 01:51:02,077
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1827
01:51:02,244 --> 01:51:04,246
Bow down, stupid!

1828
01:51:22,848 --> 01:51:24,767
I'm sorry.

1829
01:51:47,623 --> 01:51:50,292
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1830
01:51:50,459 --> 01:51:54,171
...would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1831
01:51:54,338 --> 01:51:56,298
What the fuck?

1832
01:52:02,471 --> 01:52:04,473
Thank you.

1833
01:52:36,297 --> 01:52:38,257
It never ends!

1834
01:52:57,985 --> 01:53:00,070
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1835
01:53:00,613 --> 01:53:02,615
What the fuck is this shit?

1836
01:53:02,781 --> 01:53:04,408
Who the fuck are you, lady?

1837
01:53:04,575 --> 01:53:06,952
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1838
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:09,955
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1839
01:53:10,122 --> 01:53:12,958
What the fuck is this, <i>The Piano?</i>
Why ain't this broad talking?

1840
01:53:13,125 --> 01:53:18,422
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1841
01:53:18,589 --> 01:53:21,759
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fucking nuts?

1842
01:53:21,925 --> 01:53:24,803
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head? I want some...

1843
01:53:42,446 --> 01:53:44,114
Where was she?

1844
01:53:44,823 --> 01:53:46,742
Imprisoned in a body.

1845
01:53:46,909 --> 01:53:50,245
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1846
01:53:51,288 --> 01:53:52,831
Hang on a minute.

1847
01:54:27,366 --> 01:54:29,284
You missed a bit.

1848
01:54:30,828 --> 01:54:33,706
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1849
01:54:33,872 --> 01:54:36,208
You ready to make those changes
I been talking about?

1850
01:54:36,542 --> 01:54:39,128
We'll see. Muse?

1851
01:54:39,294 --> 01:54:41,755
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1852
01:54:41,922 --> 01:54:44,133
...you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1853
01:54:44,299 --> 01:54:47,094
First I gotta say goodbye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1854
01:54:47,261 --> 01:54:48,679
Oh, no.

1855
01:55:09,908 --> 01:55:12,369
Metatron, is she...?

1856
01:55:12,536 --> 01:55:14,747
Afraid so.

1857
01:55:14,913 --> 01:55:18,792
One of the drawbacks to being
a martyr is that you have to die.

1858
01:55:18,959 --> 01:55:20,919
But no matter.

1859
01:55:31,013 --> 01:55:33,348
All is being taken care of.

1860
01:55:34,099 --> 01:55:35,809
How so?

1861
01:55:36,602 --> 01:55:39,730
Wax on, wax off.

1862
01:56:03,295 --> 01:56:04,379
How did I...?

1863
01:56:04,546 --> 01:56:06,131
She can rebuild you.

1864
01:56:06,298 --> 01:56:07,800
She has the technology.

1865
01:56:07,966 --> 01:56:11,970
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1866
01:56:17,976 --> 01:56:19,311
That's...

1867
01:56:20,354 --> 01:56:23,148
A very relieved deity.

1868
01:56:24,483 --> 01:56:27,236
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come around.

1869
01:56:27,778 --> 01:56:29,738
Your kind always does.

1870
01:56:30,989 --> 01:56:33,408
So you might wanna
take good care of yourself.

1871
01:56:33,575 --> 01:56:36,245
We're gonna need you
down the road.

1872
01:56:36,411 --> 01:56:39,289
I know. I'm the last scion.

1873
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:44,586
Well, you're half right.

1874
01:56:44,753 --> 01:56:47,673
You were the last scion.

1875
01:56:49,466 --> 01:56:51,176
But now...

1876
01:56:51,885 --> 01:56:53,428
...this...

1877
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:56,181
...is the last scion.

1878
01:56:59,309 --> 01:57:01,228
I'm pregnant?

1879
01:57:03,772 --> 01:57:05,691
Can't put anything past you.

1880
01:57:09,027 --> 01:57:11,530
Take care of that parcel for us.

1881
01:57:11,697 --> 01:57:15,534
She has a world of work
ahead of her.

1882
01:57:27,045 --> 01:57:29,006
Thank you for...

1883
01:57:29,172 --> 01:57:31,049
...I don't know...

1884
01:57:31,216 --> 01:57:32,384
...everything.

1885
01:57:36,221 --> 01:57:39,558
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1886
01:57:39,725 --> 01:57:41,727
...most of it questioning
your great plan...

1887
01:57:41,894 --> 01:57:43,729
...and that'd be arrogant of me,
I know.

1888
01:57:44,563 --> 01:57:46,648
But there is one I need to ask.

1889
01:57:46,815 --> 01:57:50,360
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1890
01:57:52,404 --> 01:57:54,239
Why are we here?

1891
01:58:11,256 --> 01:58:13,842
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1892
01:58:20,724 --> 01:58:23,268
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1893
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:26,188
It was an honor.

1894
01:58:30,901 --> 01:58:34,154
You did so well.

1895
01:58:38,617 --> 01:58:41,370
I told you she was a woman.

1896
01:58:43,372 --> 01:58:45,666
She's not really a woman.

1897
01:58:45,832 --> 01:58:48,210
She's not really anything.

1898
01:58:48,377 --> 01:58:50,462
She's something, all right.

1899
01:58:51,213 --> 01:58:53,382
Crisis of faith over?

1900
01:58:53,548 --> 01:58:56,385
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1901
01:58:56,551 --> 01:58:58,387
When it rains, it pours.

1902
01:58:58,553 --> 01:59:00,764
Are you saying you believe?

1903
01:59:00,931 --> 01:59:03,976
No. But I have a good idea.

1904
01:59:04,142 --> 01:59:05,727
Yes.

1905
01:59:09,564 --> 01:59:11,358
The man was right about you.

1906
01:59:11,525 --> 01:59:14,528
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell him so.

1907
01:59:15,445 --> 01:59:17,322
And if you clean up your language...

1908
01:59:17,489 --> 01:59:19,825
...I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1909
01:59:20,492 --> 01:59:21,910
Thanks.

1910
01:59:23,453 --> 01:59:25,998
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1911
01:59:28,375 --> 01:59:30,127
Rufus.

1912
01:59:56,611 --> 01:59:58,989
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1913
02:00:03,827 --> 02:00:05,704
You guys wanna
hear something sick?

1914
02:00:05,871 --> 02:00:08,707
- I got half a stalk when she kissed me.
- Jay!

1915
02:00:08,874 --> 02:00:11,209
I couldn't help it. The bitch was hot.

1916
02:00:11,376 --> 02:00:15,839
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1917
02:00:16,006 --> 02:00:17,466
You're pregnant?

1918
02:00:19,134 --> 02:00:22,596
Yo, I heard pregnant women can
have sex into their third trimester.

1919
02:00:22,763 --> 02:00:24,681
I'll keep that in mind.

1920
02:08:04,682 --> 02:08:08,603
<i>So that would make Bethany
part black?</i>
