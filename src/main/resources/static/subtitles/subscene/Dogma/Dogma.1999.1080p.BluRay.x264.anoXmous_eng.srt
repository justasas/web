2
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,162
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving force
behind Catholicism WOW!, Cardinal Glick.

3
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:19,405
Thank you.

4
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,441
Now we all know
how the majority...

5
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:23,777
and the media in this country...

6
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,112
view the Catholic church.

7
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,248
They think of us as a passé,
archaic institution.

8
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:32,586
People find the Bible obtuse...

9
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,119
even hokey.

10
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,288
Now, in an effort to disprove
all that...

11
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:40,126
the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

12
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,162
both of faith and of style.

13
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,297
For example, the crucifix.

14
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:47,966
While it has been a time-honored symbol
of our faith...

15
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,103
Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

16
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:52,772
this highly recognizable...

17
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,174
yet wholy depressing image...

18
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,410
of our Lord, crucified.

19
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,879
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

20
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:02,814
He came to help us out.

21
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:06,584
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

22
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:09,422
that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring Sigil.

23
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:13,425
So, it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

24
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:16,161
of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! campaign...

25
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:19,664
will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

26
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:20,966
"The Buddy Christ."

27
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:33,812
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

28
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,315
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

29
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,782
But look at it.

30
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,685
Doesn't it pop?

31
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,352
Buddy Christ.

32
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,555
Well, there you have it.

33
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,557
Let me get this straight.

34
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:49,194
You don't believe in God
because of Alice in Wonderland?

35
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:51,296
No, Through the Looking Glass.

36
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:53,331
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

37
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:55,634
that's an indictment
of organized religion.

38
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,703
The Walrus, with his girth
and his good nature...

39
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,804
he obviously represents either Buddha...

40
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:02,907
or with his tusks,
the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

41
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:04,976
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

42
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:07,812
Now, the Carpenter, which is
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

43
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,482
who was raised a carpenter's son,
he represents the Western religions.

44
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:14,052
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

45
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:16,654
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

46
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:20,525
and then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

47
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:23,528
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

48
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:27,364
that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

49
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:30,168
ensures the destruction
ofone's inner-being.

50
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:32,303
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

51
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:35,240
by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

52
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:38,676
out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

53
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:41,713
who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

54
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:45,716
and says, " Do it--
Do it and I'll fuckin´ spank you!"

55
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:47,150
Oh,Jesus!

56
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:50,787
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

57
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,191
What have I been doing
with my life?

58
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:57,662
- What am I?
- Yeah, I know.

59
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:59,564
Listen, my advice to you...

60
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,165
you take this money that you've
been collecting for your parish...

61
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:05,468
go get yourself a nice dress,
fix yourself up.

62
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:08,772
Find some man-- find some woman--you
can connect with, even for a moment...

63
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:11,909
'cause that's really all life is,
Sister-- a series of moments.

64
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:15,012
Why don't you seize yours?

65
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:19,649
That a girl.

66
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,592
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

67
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:32,496
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

68
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:35,399
You've been in His presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

69
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,702
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy, man.

70
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:42,205
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

71
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,207
Here's what I don't get about you.

72
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:47,043
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

73
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,580
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

74
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:50,848
Look at them.

75
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:54,785
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

76
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:58,788
forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

77
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,123
See those two?

78
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,493
What that guy doesn't know is that the
girl cheated on him while she was away.

79
00:06:03,560 --> 00:00:00,-900
- She did?
- Twice.

80
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:07,697
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

81
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:10,733
'cause they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

82
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,068
I like that.

83
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:15,439
I wish they all could
feel that way more often.

84
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:18,675
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

85
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:21,177
You call me, you tell me
it's important.

86
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:24,680
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

87
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,816
We're going home.

88
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,185
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

89
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,127
Take it and quit leering at me. People
will think I just broke up with you.

90
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:40,630
- You said we're going home, didn't you?
- Read.

91
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:44,667
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

92
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,236
And?

93
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:50,005
You have to keep reading.

94
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,175
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church..."

95
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:54,677
...is the kick off of a new campaign
which seeks to bring...

96
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:56,578
Catholicism into the mainstream.

97
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:59,148
With a papal sanction,
the arch way entrance...

98
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:01,717
of the century-old Jersey shore
house of worship...

99
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:04,187
will serve as a passage way
of plenary indulgence--

100
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:07,590
a little-known Catholic belief offering
all that passes throug hits arches...

101
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:09,525
a morally cleans late.

102
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:12,728
For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

103
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:16,298
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

104
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,869
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

105
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:22,570
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

106
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,441
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

107
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:29,578
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

108
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:31,479
What then, Hell?
Fuck that.

109
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:33,482
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

110
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:36,985
and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

111
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:39,522
If we die with clean souls,
there's no way they can keep us out.

112
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,691
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

113
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,195
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

114
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:49,331
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loop hole.

115
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:51,365
He can't keep us out anymore.

116
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:53,368
Once we're back in,
it'll be forgive and forget.

117
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:55,503
But this thing,
this is Church law.

118
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:57,473
It's not Divine Mandate.

119
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,109
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

120
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:04,646
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

121
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:08,250
by the Son of God
before He left was...

122
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,553
- "Whatever you hold true on Earth--"
- "I'll hold true in Heaven."

123
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:14,657
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

124
00:08:14,757 --> 00:08:16,391
This thing has a papal sanction--

125
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:19,393
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

126
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,396
never yielded positive results.

127
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:23,531
You can't be anal retentive
ifyou don't have an anus.

128
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:25,901
Outstanding work!

129
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,871
There'sjust one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

130
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:31,039
This is gonna help us get back
on His good side.

131
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:32,274
What?

132
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:35,243
Here. I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

133
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,777
" Mooby, the Golden Calf.

134
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:39,614
Creating an Empire
Out of Simplicity."

135
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,582
I wanna hit 'em.

136
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,385
You really are
just a simple creature.

137
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:46,754
We finally find a way back
and you want to jeopardize that...

138
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,890
because you've got a soft spot
for the good old days.

139
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,427
What betterway to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

140
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:53,995
thanks to you?

141
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:57,131
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

142
00:08:57,231 --> 00:09:00,133
Killing spree?
I'm talking about Divine Justice here.

143
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,538
I'm talking about reigning down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

144
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:06,207
He's all about that.
I know He'd want this done.

145
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:09,009
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
sinceyou quit.

146
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:10,644
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

147
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:13,613
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

148
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,283
If i'm wrong-- which I'm not--
it's not gonna matter.

149
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,652
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

150
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,555
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

151
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:25,325
Well, He does hate competition.
I will say that.

152
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:27,694
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

153
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:29,763
Where is this church
we have to go to?

154
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:33,167
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

155
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,202
Last four days on Earth?

156
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,639
If I had a dick,
I'd go get laid.

157
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,806
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

158
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:41,775
Let's kill people.

159
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,409
Oh, not you.

160
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:53,887
The greater Illinois Chapter
of the Right to Life Foundation...

161
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,289
will be holding its
biannual softball game...

162
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:57,824
against the Cook County...

163
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,294
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2:00.

164
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,763
Today's second collection
will be donated...

165
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,666
to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.

166
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:08,101
For those of you
who haven't been following the news...

167
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:10,237
an unidentified homeless man...

168
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:14,441
who was accosted and severely beaten
at the NewJersey shore last Tuesday...

169
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,644
lies in critical, but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

170
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,546
He lacks identification...

171
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:24,084
and police have had no luck tracking
down any possible family.

172
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:28,588
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

173
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,892
to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

174
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,694
asking that Catholics
all over the country...

175
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:37,863
join in this protest against euthanasia.

176
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,367
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

177
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:47,907
We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty...

178
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,509
Maker of Heaven and Earth.

179
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,679
We believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, Our Lord--

180
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,648
Choose life!

181
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:59,151
You're gonna burn in Hell,
ya fuckin´ baby killer!

182
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,053
Holy shit. It's the pope.

183
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,522
- Huh?
- Where?

184
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:03,923
What are you talking about?

185
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:16,869
Jesus! You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

186
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,071
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

187
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:22,041
At least you have an excuse. You're
Jewish. You don't know any better.

188
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:25,578
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

189
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:27,713
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

190
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,182
I went to church.

191
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:31,183
That still kills me,
you and church.

192
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,753
If only they knew your weekly tithing
came from a Planned Parenthood check.

193
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:37,289
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

194
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:42,160
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

195
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:45,497
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

196
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,999
I don't think I have any faith left.

197
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:52,204
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

198
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:57,676
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have baby-sat for in high school.

199
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:00,111
The point is,
he told me something.

200
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,715
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

201
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:05,785
When you'reyoung, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

202
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,785
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

203
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,854
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it anymore.

204
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:12,791
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

205
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,759
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

206
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:16,061
In more ways than one.

207
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:20,565
You need to get laid, Bethany Sloane.
You need a man, if only for 10 minutes.

208
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:23,468
It's been my experience that
the average male is never a man...

209
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,937
not even for ten minutes
in his entire life span.

210
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:28,940
That sounds militant. are you thinking
of joining the other side?

211
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:30,909
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

212
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:34,179
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

213
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:36,180
I think God is dead.

214
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:38,683
The sign of a true Catholic.

215
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:52,497
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

216
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,231
I'm from the EPA.

217
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,269
We're checking on possible
freon leaks.

218
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,672
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

219
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,406
Yes, we have central air.

220
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:04,108
In every room?

221
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,009
Except the bathroom.
Why?

222
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,079
Well, you do know
what that means, don't you?

223
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,025
Move!

224
00:13:27,664 --> 00:13:31,268
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

225
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,338
than central air.

226
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,174
Pick that up.

227
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,481
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

228
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:47,451
Now, ifl remember
the protocol correctly...

229
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:48,952
the powers...

230
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:52,423
will attempt to contact
the last scion.

231
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,624
I need you three...

232
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:57,828
to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

233
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:02,967
Go.

234
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:39,669
Behold the Metatron!

235
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,539
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true God!

236
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:45,308
Behold the Metatron!

237
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,412
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true God!

238
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,897
Sweet Jesus!
do you have to use the whole can?

239
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:11,968
Who the fuck are you and
what the fuck are you doing in my room?

240
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,904
I'm the one that's soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

241
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,940
Stupid fucking--

242
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:19,341
Get the fuck out of here,
now!

243
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:22,011
Or you'll do what exactly?

244
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,280
Hit me with that fish?

245
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,154
Now,just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

246
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:34,824
Jesus wept!

247
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,692
Look at my suit.

248
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,596
Just take whatever you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

249
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:45,067
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are il-equipped.

250
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:48,737
See?

251
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,277
I'm as anatomically-impaired
as a Ken doll.

252
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:57,512
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

253
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,016
You bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

254
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,753
You think everybody'sjust trying
to get in your knickers.

255
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:05,420
What are you?

256
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,523
I'm pissed off is what I am.

257
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:11,660
Do you drench everyone who comes in your
room with flame-retardant chemicals?

258
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,630
No wonder you're single.

259
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,834
Stand back.

260
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,179
As I was sayin´...

261
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,516
prior to your fire-fighting episode...

262
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:38,052
I am the Metatron.

263
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:43,558
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell?

264
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,795
You people.

265
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:50,064
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

266
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,068
I am a seraphim.

267
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,773
The highest choir ofangels.

268
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:02,011
You do know what an angel is,
don'tyou?

269
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:07,681
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

270
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:12,019
Any documented occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

271
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,821
they're speaking to me.

272
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,057
Or they're talking to themselves.

273
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:20,261
Why doesn't God speak for Himself?

274
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:24,532
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

275
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,835
human beings have neither the aural,
nor the psychological capacity...

276
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:32,340
to with stand the awesome power
ofGod's true voice.

277
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,876
Wereyou to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

278
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:38,813
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

279
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:42,717
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

280
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:47,121
Aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wing span?

281
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,859
You want more proof?

282
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,595
Fine.

283
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:54,794
How about tequila?

284
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:06,073
-Where the hell are we?
-Only place you can go for good tequila.

285
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:09,208
Dos tequilas, por favor,
and an empty glass.

286
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:13,013
We're in Mexico?

287
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,515
Actually, we're in a franchised
Mexican family eatery...

288
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:17,818
down the street
from your apartment, but...

289
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:19,753
it's impressive none the less.

290
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:24,458
You don't mind I lost the wings, do you?
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

291
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:26,359
What do you want with me?

292
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:32,833
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

293
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:36,202
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

294
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,638
Noah was a drunk.
Lookwhat he accomplished.

295
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:42,609
And no one's asking you to build an ark.
All you gotta do is go to New Jersey...

296
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:45,211
and visit a small church
on a very important day.

297
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:50,984
New Jersey?

298
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:54,254
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

299
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:56,856
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

300
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:58,991
What's the fine print?

301
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:03,029
Stop a couple of angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

302
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:05,264
Wait, wait, wait.
Repeat that.

303
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:08,634
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

304
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:11,838
and thus negating all existence.

305
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:14,240
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

306
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:16,142
You might want to clarify that.

307
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:21,580
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

308
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:23,750
And His wrath was bore...

309
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,087
by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

310
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:29,288
When Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed...

311
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,857
that was Loki.

312
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:34,994
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

313
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:37,830
that was Loki--
and he was good at what he did.

314
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:39,665
But one day...

315
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:42,702
he refused to bear God's wrath
any longer.

316
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:46,272
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

317
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:48,374
a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

318
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:49,575
Grigori?

319
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:52,911
One of the choirs  of angels.
They're called Watchers.

320
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:54,413
Guess what they do.

321
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,918
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the first born of Egypt--

322
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:01,453
The Tenth Plague.

323
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:04,356
Tell a person that you're the Metatron
and they stare at you blankly.

324
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:06,491
Mention something out of
a Charlton Heston movie...

325
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:08,727
and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

326
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:10,763
May I continue uninterrupted?

327
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,898
Once he's done with the first born...

328
00:20:12,998 --> 00:20:17,703
Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

329
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,105
And over many rounds...

330
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,274
they get into
this discussion about...

331
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:24,277
whether or not murder
in the name of God is okay.

332
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:25,710
And in the end...

333
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:29,715
Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

334
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:32,117
and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

335
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:33,751
So...

336
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:37,656
very inebriated...

337
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:40,358
Loki tells God he quits...

338
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,761
throws down his fiery sword...

339
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:44,763
and gives Him the finger.

340
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:48,032
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

341
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:51,136
God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

342
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:52,704
Hence all the spitting.

343
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:55,173
So, for their insolence...

344
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:58,243
God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

345
00:20:58,343 --> 00:21:00,879
would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

346
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:02,847
- Were they sent to Hell?
- Worse.

347
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:04,849
Wisconsin...

348
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,852
for the entire span
of human history.

349
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,056
And when the world ends, they'll have to
sit outside the gates for all eternity.

350
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:13,124
And this has what to do with me?

351
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:17,729
Someone has clued them in
to a loop hole in Catholic dogma...

352
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:20,397
that would allow them
to reenter Heaven.

353
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:23,167
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

354
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,170
It's not that simple.

355
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:29,307
If they get in,
they will have reversed God's decree.

356
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:33,944
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

357
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:39,117
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

358
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:42,853
function solely on one principle--

359
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,956
God is infallible.

360
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,992
To prove Him wrong...

361
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,029
would undo reality
and everything that is.

362
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:53,998
Up would become down,
blackwould become white.

363
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:57,034
Existence would become nothingness.

364
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,669
In essence...

365
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,240
if they're allowed to enter
that church...

366
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:07,044
they'll unmake the world.

367
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:10,046
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

368
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:12,883
- Why doesn't God do something about it?
- He could.

369
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,054
But He'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

370
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:17,754
Why me?

371
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:20,157
Because of who you are.

372
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:22,092
And who am I?

373
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,261
The girl in the pj's!

374
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:28,032
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

375
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:30,134
I'm gonna have to pass.

376
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:32,202
I beg your pardon?

377
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:36,740
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

378
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:38,408
When my husband decided...

379
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,944
he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear his children...

380
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,312
where was God?

381
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:46,016
To Hell with Him.

382
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:50,320
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

383
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:52,689
just because you've got a grudge
against your Creator.

384
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:55,192
So you lost the ability
to make life.

385
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:58,728
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

386
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:01,131
by acting like one
and protecting it--

387
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:03,133
saving it!

388
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:07,604
But I can't make you.

389
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:11,308
However, ifyou should decide
to stop being selfish...

390
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,877
and accept your responsibility...

391
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:15,879
you won't be alone.

392
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:17,313
You'll have support.

393
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,449
What? More angels?

394
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:21,117
Prophets.

395
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:26,089
In a manner of speaking.
Two of'em.

396
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:31,160
The one who speaks...

397
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:34,797
and he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not...

398
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:36,899
will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

399
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,468
The other one...

400
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:41,236
well, he's the quiet type.

401
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,539
Look, I've gotta go.

402
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,974
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

403
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:50,580
What's He like?

404
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,647
God?

405
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,351
Lonely...

406
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:57,354
but funny.

407
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,554
He's got a great sense of humor.

408
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:01,590
Take sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

409
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,294
than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

410
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:06,328
Sex is a joke in Heaven?

411
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:10,232
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

412
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:11,567
I'll see ya.

413
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:17,458
Snootch to the motherfucking nootch!

414
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:56,996
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

415
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:00,600
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

416
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:04,304
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pube-less asses!

417
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:12,612
I don't know what to say
or think, except--

418
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,647
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

419
00:27:14,714 --> 00:27:17,950
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

420
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:20,920
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

421
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,490
I don't know who those kids were,
but they would have kicked yours...

422
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,526
and Lunchbox's asses
ifl hadn't represented.

423
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:29,429
Thanks for being
out here so late.

424
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:31,664
Wait a minute.
Are you protestors?

425
00:27:31,765 --> 00:27:34,735
You mean those dick heads with the signs
and pictures of dead babies?

426
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:37,304
Shit no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

427
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:39,338
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

428
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,375
But what are you doing
hanging around?

429
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:43,475
We're here to pick up chicks.

430
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:45,311
Excuse me?

431
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:48,515
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

432
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:51,384
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

433
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:54,353
Right.

434
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:57,256
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

435
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:59,226
- I think.
- Wait a second.

436
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:01,860
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

437
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:03,029
What the shit is that?

438
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:07,032
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

439
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,070
I think I should go home,
take some Perco sets and lay down.

440
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:14,873
Now how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

441
00:28:14,974 --> 00:28:17,477
I'm goin´ back to Jersey
and startin´ up the business again.

442
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:21,414
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

443
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,050
Prophets. Two of'em.

444
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,820
- You know what I'm sayin´, Silent Bob?
- You gotta be kidding me.

445
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:30,589
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

446
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:33,292
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

447
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:34,827
Try it on.

448
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:40,198
It's a lot more compact than the flaming
sword, but not nearly as impressive.

449
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:43,569
It doesn't have that
"Wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

450
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:47,739
How am I supposed to strike fear into
hearts of the wicked with this thing?

451
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,907
Look at this.

452
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:53,712
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

453
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,749
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

454
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:59,018
You got to stand there and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

455
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,052
I had to do all the work.

456
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,390
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

457
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:07,025
I rained down sulfur.
There's a subtle difference.

458
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,827
Okay, I'm sure.

459
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:12,964
Fuck you. Any moron with a pack
of matches can set a fire.

460
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:15,000
Raining down sulfur
is like an endurance trial.

461
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,702
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can engage in...

462
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:19,337
next to soccer.

463
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:22,574
I'll take this one.

464
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:39,457
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or are you gonna do us both?

465
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,960
lf so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

466
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:44,029
You're a man of principle.

467
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:47,733
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

468
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:50,301
Some fuck named John Hughes.

469
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:52,070
Sixteen Candles John Hughes?

470
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:56,374
You know that guy too?
That fuckin´ guy.

471
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:59,210
He made this flick Sixteen Candles.
Not bad.

472
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:01,513
There's tits in it, but no bush.

473
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:04,181
But Ebert over here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

474
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:06,685
because he's like in love
with this John Hughes guy.

475
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,886
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

476
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:13,424
Fuckin´ Breakfast Club, where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

477
00:30:13,524 --> 00:30:17,295
Fuckin´ WeirdScience, where this babe
wants to undress and get down...

478
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:20,531
but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

479
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:24,769
And then Prettyin Pink, which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

480
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:28,239
because when the redhead hooks up
with her dream guy...

481
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:31,809
he starts sobbin´ like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

482
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:35,146
And there's nothing worse
than watchin´ a fuckin´ fat man weep.

483
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:37,181
What exactly brought you
to Illinois?

484
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:41,151
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

485
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:45,323
where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

486
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:48,392
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fuckin´ harsh.

487
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:49,760
But best of all...

488
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,929
there was no one dealin´, man.

489
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:54,498
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

490
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,867
if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

491
00:30:56,934 --> 00:31:00,070
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

492
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,240
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

493
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,243
There is no Shermer, Illinois.

494
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,278
Movies are fuckin´ bullshit.

495
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:12,316
- When are you going back to New Jersey?
- This broad asks a lot of questions.

496
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:15,552
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

497
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:17,521
Yeah. So you do anal?

498
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:20,089
Is it true that chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

499
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:22,092
I didn't ask you out for sex.

500
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,094
I'll take head.

501
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:30,066
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this.

502
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:34,604
I think I should go with you.

503
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,607
Like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

504
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:41,677
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

505
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:44,581
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

506
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:45,715
Really?

507
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:47,884
You're going to lead me somewhere.

508
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,619
Me lead you?

509
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:52,688
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

510
00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:55,725
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

511
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:59,862
Someone told me I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I was supposed to go.

512
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,931
What the hell are you babbling about?

513
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:04,701
We saved your ass from
some angry fuckin´ dwarves...

514
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:08,572
and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

515
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:12,276
Do you believe in God?

516
00:32:13,743 --> 00:32:17,012
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

517
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,015
and we gotta get the oneJesus freak?

518
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:20,317
- Let's get the fuck out ofhere.
- Wait.

519
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,084
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

520
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:24,487
Pay?

521
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:29,125
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

522
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:33,262
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

523
00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:36,832
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

524
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:39,335
and we're in that fucked-up bar!

525
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:40,904
What about sex?

526
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,337
No sex.

527
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:48,277
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

528
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:51,814
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

529
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:53,915
In that highly unlikely situation?

530
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,487
Yeah, sure.

531
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:01,624
She's a slut.

532
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,527
All right.

533
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:09,131
But I get to drive.

534
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:20,710
What gear are you in?

535
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:21,943
Gear?

536
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:33,488
What do I know about shiftin´?

537
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,761
Like I ever drove before.

538
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:45,534
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

539
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,002
New Jersey.

540
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,171
Maybe you're wrong
about this slaughter thing.

541
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:53,375
How can you be sure what incurs the
Lord's wrath these days? Times change.

542
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:57,178
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a Hell-worthy trespass.

543
00:33:57,278 --> 00:33:59,748
The major sins never change.

544
00:34:01,216 --> 00:34:05,921
Besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker from a mile away.

545
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:07,856
Bet on it.

546
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,625
This from the guy who still owes me
ten bucks over that bet...

547
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:13,895
about which was gonna be the bigger
movie-- ET or Krush Groove.

548
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:17,064
Fuck you, man,
'cause time's gonna tell on that one.

549
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:24,204
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

550
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:25,840
Insinuating, no.

551
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,475
Flat-out telling you.

552
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:33,581
Right there.
There's one.

553
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,084
So? They're kissing.

554
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,118
Adultery.

555
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,487
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

556
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:41,521
You are just a simple creature.

557
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:44,158
- Am I right?
- I happen to know the truth.

558
00:34:44,258 --> 00:34:47,261
I'm not gonna tell you. I want to see
how boned up on the job you are.

559
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:50,164
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

560
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,900
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

561
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,302
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

562
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:58,139
Okay. It's a good thing
you were never...

563
00:34:58,206 --> 00:35:01,175
the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

564
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:05,146
" No married man kisses
his wife like that"? Are you stoned?

565
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:06,280
Excuse me.

566
00:35:09,084 --> 00:35:10,551
Are you married?

567
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,453
Why?

568
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,987
I'm just curious.

569
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:16,357
What do you think?

570
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,367
- What?
- To her?

571
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:29,502
- What?
- are you married to her?

572
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:33,039
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

573
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:34,942
Why?

574
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,721
Whose house

575
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:24,290
Run's house

576
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:26,959
I said, whose house

577
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,995
Run's house

578
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,163
Whose house
Say what

579
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:33,599
Run's house
Say what

580
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,501
Martin

581
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:42,375
She's fuckin´ pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

582
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:44,443
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

583
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:46,713
Let me know how she is.

584
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:49,682
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

585
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,785
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

586
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:56,121
but being that I've decided to go home,
and not to NewJersey...

587
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:58,657
sorry for the inconvenience
and good-bye.

588
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,927
You're breaking up with us?

589
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:04,597
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

590
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:07,633
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

591
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:11,036
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

592
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,206
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fuckin´ sky.

593
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,885
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky.

594
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:41,533
No heartbeat.

595
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:44,203
Think someone threw him out of a plane
with a message written on him...

596
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,804
like in Con Air?

597
00:37:45,904 --> 00:37:48,574
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

598
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:51,310
- Con Air? Con Shit.
- Kill it!

599
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,479
- Sounds familiar.
-Jesus, are you okay?

600
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:56,648
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

601
00:37:56,748 --> 00:37:59,017
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!.

602
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:01,954
What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

603
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,091
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

604
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:08,660
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

605
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:11,496
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

606
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:16,000
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand?

607
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,403
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find my own threads?

608
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:23,541
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

609
00:38:24,676 --> 00:38:28,012
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside ofyour armor.

610
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,415
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

611
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:33,784
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

612
00:38:33,885 --> 00:38:36,354
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

613
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,390
the impact with which you hit
the asphalt would have liquefied you.

614
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:41,192
Death is a worry of the living.

615
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:44,761
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

616
00:38:44,862 --> 00:38:47,732
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

617
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:48,799
I died.

618
00:38:48,899 --> 00:38:51,102
Christ told me the secret
to the resurrection once.

619
00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:54,772
We were at this wedding in Caanan.
I got drunk and forgot it.

620
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:56,641
Wait, wait, wait.

621
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,609
Christ?

622
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,745
You knew Christ?

623
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:02,880
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

624
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,815
Let me guess.

625
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:07,385
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

626
00:39:07,485 --> 00:39:10,321
I'm a man,just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

627
00:39:10,387 --> 00:39:11,989
At least I was a man.

628
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,192
Been dead nearly 2,000 years.
Here, check this out.

629
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,530
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rockin´ the ganj.

630
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,799
It's not a joint.

631
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:24,201
I can't read this.

632
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:29,339
It's Aramaic. It says,
" Rufus, see you in two years.Jesus."

633
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:32,543
Freaked me out because He basically
told me when my number was up.

634
00:39:32,643 --> 00:39:35,479
Took all the flavor out of the
remaining years. We gotta get moving.

635
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:39,183
Let's saywe continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit. Come on.

636
00:39:39,283 --> 00:39:41,819
I'm starvin´.
Back off, Kato.

637
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,153
Wait a second!

638
00:39:44,455 --> 00:39:46,957
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

639
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:49,092
and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

640
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:52,161
I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

641
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:55,698
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where the hell you came from.

642
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:57,701
Me? I came from Heaven.

643
00:39:57,768 --> 00:39:59,268
Now let's start walkin´.

644
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:02,206
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

645
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:06,475
Hey, man, back in the old days
withJ.C., we used to walk everywhere.

646
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:08,846
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

647
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,686
What the hell's an apostle?

648
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:40,744
Let me get this straight.

649
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,079
She's already met the prophets...

650
00:40:43,146 --> 00:40:45,247
and the apostle's with them?

651
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:50,453
I think that our best course
of action...

652
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:54,056
is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

653
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:58,728
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

654
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:02,999
well, I'm left with no choice...

655
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:07,136
but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

656
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:12,641
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

657
00:41:15,778 --> 00:41:18,214
I appreciate the loan, brother.
You can have that back.

658
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:21,650
Man, I remember when all we used to have
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

659
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:24,186
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

660
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:27,389
Now, how ´bout you start explaining
some things, like for starters...

661
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:28,924
how did you know
where to find us?

662
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:31,227
Do you know what the dead do
with most of their time?

663
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:34,196
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

664
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:35,864
I can't wait to die.

665
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:37,799
And why are you watching me?

666
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:40,435
Because you're the one who's gonna
help me get some changes made...

667
00:41:40,535 --> 00:41:42,204
in that book
you put so much stock in.

668
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:44,640
- Hustler?
- The Bible!

669
00:41:44,707 --> 00:41:48,043
- What's your beefwith the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

670
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,679
Neither are any of us, but you
don't hear us bitchin´ and moanin´.

671
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,216
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th Apostle.

672
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:59,854
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th Apostle.

673
00:41:59,954 --> 00:42:02,691
But you heard of
the other 12 Apostles.

674
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:06,395
They were all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

675
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:08,997
And why is that?
'cause I'm a black man.

676
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:11,133
Butyou know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

677
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:15,670
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing your faith on.

678
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,307
- What's that?
-Jesus wasn't white.Jesus was black.

679
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:20,542
I don't buy it.

680
00:42:20,642 --> 00:42:24,812
If that's true, why did He get
written about and you were left out?

681
00:42:24,912 --> 00:42:27,115
Well, He is the Son ofGod.

682
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,351
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

683
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:32,253
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

684
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,923
Leaving me out is okay 'cause you
still got 1 2 white boys to choose from.

685
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:39,627
- are you gonna listen to this shit?
- That's what people of Antioch said...

686
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:41,563
right before they stoned my ass.

687
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,763
You were martyred?

688
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:44,799
That's one way of puttin´ it.

689
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:47,870
Anotherway is to say I was bludgeoned
to shit by big fucking rocks.

690
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:50,739
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit--

691
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:53,141
life eternal,
a place in God's Heaven.

692
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:55,743
But as soon as you hear
that you're gettin´ this good shit...

693
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:57,511
from a black Jesus, ya freak.

694
00:42:57,612 --> 00:42:59,847
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

695
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:04,585
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't beyour savior.

696
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:06,021
You gonna eat that hash brown?

697
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,023
So, you went to Heaven?

698
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,326
Damn right I went to Heaven!
That's the least He could do.

699
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,863
In the three years I followed His ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

700
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,066
Hell no.
And I was in my prime.

701
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,635
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds´ daughters...

702
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:24,272
not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

703
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:26,306
She had a thing for dark meat,
if you follow me.

704
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:29,576
Maybe this is just me talking,
but ifl were in Heaven...

705
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:32,613
I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as they got the message right.

706
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,783
The message is what counts.

707
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:38,686
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be color blind.

708
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:41,789
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

709
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,824
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

710
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:47,594
That's why I'm gonna help you stop those
angels from gettin´ into that church...

711
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:50,264
in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

712
00:43:50,363 --> 00:43:53,100
How do you know about that,
the angels?

713
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,304
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

714
00:43:56,404 --> 00:44:00,707
When you were five, you let a kid
from next door piss on your hand.

715
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:04,178
You did that shit?
You're nasty.

716
00:44:04,244 --> 00:44:06,747
I never told anybody about that.

717
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:08,515
Neither did he.

718
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:11,451
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

719
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:14,187
His name was Brian Johnson.

720
00:44:14,287 --> 00:44:16,390
Your exploits,
no matter how inane...

721
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,525
are well documented in Heaven.

722
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:20,459
Probably Hell too.

723
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:27,267
Where are you going?

724
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,202
Tell me somethin´ about me.

725
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:32,238
You masturbate more than anyone
on the planet.

726
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:35,208
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

727
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:37,743
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

728
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,017
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

729
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,057
Two-thirds ofme wants to
forget about this and go home.

730
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:53,727
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
God even existed.

731
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:57,296
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

732
00:44:57,397 --> 00:45:01,268
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

733
00:45:01,334 --> 00:45:06,039
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

734
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:11,710
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

735
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,483
Where did those two assholes go?

736
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,069
What are you doing?

737
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:39,171
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

738
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:41,240
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

739
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,675
We gotta get movin´.
How can we get to Jersey?

740
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:45,745
We'll take the train.
I'll call for reservations.

741
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:45,570
I thought she looked familiar.

742
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,239
- Who?
- Serendipity.

743
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:01,653
Morning, shoppers.

744
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,488
Good morning.

745
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,857
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

746
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,761
We creamed 'em.

747
00:47:12,464 --> 00:47:15,100
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me--

748
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,604
Do I smell onions?

749
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,411
Excuse me.

750
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,284
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

751
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:37,188
You may proceed, monami.

752
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:42,793
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

753
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,829
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

754
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:47,465
Oh, come on!

755
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,736
Relax. I'm doing it.

756
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,007
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

757
00:47:57,107 --> 00:48:01,511
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarden teacher in 1989.

758
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:04,314
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991 .

759
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:08,185
Broadcast nationally
as the " Mooby Fun-Time Hour."

760
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:12,723
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

761
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:16,793
16 records,
8 prime-time specials...

762
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:21,464
and a library
of priced-to-own video cassettes.

763
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:25,502
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

764
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,138
dubbed " Mooby World."

765
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,574
Did I miss anything?

766
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,376
You forgot Mooby Magazine.

767
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,910
Damn it!

768
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,678
Is there a point to this?

769
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:39,515
You and your board are idolaters.

770
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,454
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

771
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:48,124
That's you.

772
00:48:49,392 --> 00:48:51,561
do you know much about voodoo?

773
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:56,333
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

774
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:59,135
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

775
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:01,204
the most well-known ofwhich...

776
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:02,806
is the voodoo doll.

777
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,374
You see...

778
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:15,718
a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

779
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:17,921
to various pokes and prods.

780
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:22,125
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

781
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,759
Call security, now!

782
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:31,200
All lines are currently down.

783
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:33,669
- I'm gonna have to apologize--
- Would you knock it off?

784
00:49:33,735 --> 00:49:36,205
You're doing it again.
Stop. What did we talk about?

785
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:40,709
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

786
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:42,745
which draws worship
from the Lord.

787
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:45,114
You have broken
the First Commandment.

788
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,150
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one ofyou...

789
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,987
passes for a decent human being.

790
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:55,524
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

791
00:49:55,591 --> 00:49:57,526
Like you, Mr. Burton.

792
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:01,064
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years 8 times.

793
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,364
You even had sex
with her best friend...

794
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:07,803
while you were supposed to be home
watching the kids.

795
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:11,340
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

796
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,541
Mr. Newman.

797
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:15,344
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

798
00:50:15,444 --> 00:50:17,746
and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

799
00:50:17,812 --> 00:50:20,316
to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

800
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:23,019
just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

801
00:50:23,118 --> 00:50:25,487
when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

802
00:50:26,921 --> 00:50:29,758
She killed herself
three months later.

803
00:50:29,825 --> 00:50:32,760
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

804
00:50:32,828 --> 00:50:34,763
Very compassionate.

805
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:37,900
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

806
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,336
and used the profits
from the sale ofher home...

807
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:45,240
to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

808
00:50:45,307 --> 00:50:46,974
Heavens.

809
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:49,811
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

810
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:53,548
to have sex
with an eleven-year-old boy.

811
00:50:53,648 --> 00:50:56,684
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

812
00:50:56,784 --> 00:50:59,521
from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

813
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:02,023
because it was-- survey says--

814
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,360
less costly.

815
00:51:05,426 --> 00:51:08,395
You, on the other hand...

816
00:51:08,496 --> 00:51:10,732
are an innocent.

817
00:51:10,832 --> 00:51:12,700
You lead a good life.

818
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,834
Good for you.

819
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:17,806
But you, Mr. Whitland...

820
00:51:17,906 --> 00:51:19,874
you have more skeletons
in your closet...

821
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:21,875
than this assembled party.

822
00:51:21,943 --> 00:51:24,612
I cannot even mention them aloud.

823
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:32,086
You're his father,
you sick fuck!

824
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:36,757
- Good.
- Not bad, man.

825
00:51:36,857 --> 00:51:38,793
That's great work.
Very good.

826
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,629
Well...

827
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,965
alone at last.

828
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:47,568
With the exception of Miss Pryce here...

829
00:51:47,668 --> 00:51:51,472
there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

830
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:53,275
Not one.

831
00:51:53,374 --> 00:51:56,945
do you know what makes
a human being decent?

832
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:58,278
Fear.

833
00:51:58,379 --> 00:52:00,448
And therein lies the problem.

834
00:52:00,548 --> 00:52:03,484
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

835
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:06,987
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

836
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:10,290
hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

837
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,627
ives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

838
00:52:15,395 --> 00:52:17,331
But not from God.

839
00:52:22,336 --> 00:52:24,404
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

840
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,144
Man, it really looks
just likeyou, doesn't it?

841
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:33,980
Look, if i believed enough in this...

842
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,648
I wonder--

843
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:55,168
Come on.
I don't believe in voodoo.

844
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:01,475
Voodoo.

845
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:11,450
But I do believe in this.

846
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,953
Don't run! Don't run!

847
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,790
Fakes! Fakes!
All of you, fakes!

848
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:21,527
" But I do believe in this."

849
00:53:21,628 --> 00:53:23,063
What does that mean?

850
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:24,597
And one to grow on.

851
00:53:30,671 --> 00:53:31,738
Gum?

852
00:53:33,105 --> 00:53:35,675
Go on. It's okay.

853
00:53:35,775 --> 00:53:37,811
You've done nothing wrong.

854
00:53:37,911 --> 00:53:40,980
These guys were fakes.

855
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:43,416
You're a pure soul.

856
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:47,586
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

857
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:50,122
Loki!

858
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,626
You're getting off light.

859
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:55,695
- Loki!
- I know. I'm comin´.

860
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:01,167
You're so lucky.

861
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:08,407
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

862
00:54:08,474 --> 00:54:09,909
Three years this August.

863
00:54:09,976 --> 00:54:13,612
Let me guess-- the 14th Apostle, left
out of the Bible because she's a woman?

864
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:14,914
This girl's no woman.

865
00:54:15,014 --> 00:54:18,017
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

866
00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:19,818
What, these?

867
00:54:19,918 --> 00:54:24,089
You should know better than anyone here
that tits don't make a woman.

868
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,592
Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

869
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:30,162
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things--

870
00:54:30,262 --> 00:54:31,931
her legs.

871
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:34,466
But as you can see...

872
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:36,268
I lack definition.

873
00:54:36,368 --> 00:54:40,072
Hey, they're gettin´ a free show!
Let me see that shit!

874
00:54:40,172 --> 00:54:43,175
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

875
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:45,911
How do you--
How does she know Metatron?

876
00:54:46,011 --> 00:54:47,979
This is the last scion.

877
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:51,650
You're kidding.

878
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,385
Wow.

879
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:54,486
I'm confused.

880
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:58,656
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

881
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:02,427
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

882
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:06,264
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

883
00:55:06,364 --> 00:55:07,900
I'm a muse, stupid.

884
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,570
I can't take much more of this.

885
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,338
So you, what, inspire people?

886
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:16,141
Whatjust went down
with your friends over there--

887
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:19,144
It doesn't really take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

888
00:55:19,211 --> 00:55:21,179
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

889
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:26,751
For example, I'm responsible for 1 9 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

890
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:29,421
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

891
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:32,456
The one about the kid
by himselfin his house...

892
00:55:32,524 --> 00:55:35,525
burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off--

893
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:37,862
I had nothing to do
with that one.

894
00:55:37,962 --> 00:55:42,300
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.

895
00:56:00,618 --> 00:56:03,020
What are you doing stripping?

896
00:56:03,087 --> 00:56:04,521
Remember why I left?

897
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:08,024
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

898
00:56:08,092 --> 00:56:11,228
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

899
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:15,231
I gave my two weeks notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

900
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:18,335
and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

901
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:19,971
So what happened?

902
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:22,806
Writer's block.

903
00:56:22,906 --> 00:56:25,776
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

904
00:56:25,842 --> 00:56:29,846
I can inspire anyone I meet and give out
a zillion and nine ideas a second...

905
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:31,882
but I can't keep any for myself.

906
00:56:33,483 --> 00:56:35,887
Her quirky sense ofhumor.

907
00:56:35,953 --> 00:56:38,189
- Whose?
- God's.

908
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:41,224
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there ever a doubt in your mind?

909
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:43,060
He's always referred to as " Him."

910
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,961
That's not how I wrote it.

911
00:56:45,062 --> 00:56:46,997
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

912
00:56:47,063 --> 00:56:49,766
is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

913
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:52,903
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

914
00:56:53,003 --> 00:56:55,505
and all the penholders were men.

915
00:56:55,605 --> 00:56:59,543
So She became a He.
Doesn't stop with God either.

916
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:01,645
The whole book's gender-biased.

917
00:57:01,745 --> 00:57:03,947
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

918
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:06,216
A woman cuts Samson coif of power.

919
00:57:06,316 --> 00:57:09,719
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

920
00:57:09,785 --> 00:57:11,254
Read that book again.

921
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:14,425
Women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the Egyptians and Romans combined.

922
00:57:14,525 --> 00:57:15,758
It stinks.

923
00:57:22,165 --> 00:57:23,899
Why is the last scion here?

924
00:57:23,999 --> 00:57:26,969
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

925
00:57:27,037 --> 00:57:30,206
- Not the plenary indulgence loop hole.
- You know about that?

926
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:33,242
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

927
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,244
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

928
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:37,813
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

929
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:41,451
I have issues with anyone who treats God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

930
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:42,919
like some Catholics.

931
00:57:42,985 --> 00:57:45,955
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

932
00:57:46,022 --> 00:57:50,226
-lf we're wrong, what religion is right?
-It's not about who's right orwrong.

933
00:57:50,326 --> 00:57:52,261
No denomination's nailed it yet...

934
00:57:52,328 --> 00:57:54,931
because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

935
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:59,968
that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in,just that you have faith.

936
00:58:00,035 --> 00:58:04,473
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

937
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:09,411
They made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

938
00:58:15,351 --> 00:58:17,285
Who fuckin´ farted?

939
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:21,990
Not born.
Shit into existence.

940
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,297
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

941
00:58:28,364 --> 00:58:30,833
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

942
00:58:30,933 --> 00:58:33,169
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

943
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:34,670
A shit demon!

944
00:58:34,737 --> 00:58:38,374
No man of woman born!

945
00:58:39,174 --> 00:58:42,311
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

946
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,012
It came for Bethany!

947
00:58:44,112 --> 00:58:47,048
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thang!

948
00:58:47,115 --> 00:58:49,585
I knew I's gonna
whack somebody today!

949
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,587
Get your fuckin´ hand back.

950
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,855
Represent!

951
00:58:54,255 --> 00:58:56,692
Go! Go! Go!

952
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:20,448
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

953
00:59:21,816 --> 00:59:23,317
Over the bar!

954
00:59:32,827 --> 00:59:36,264
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

955
00:59:36,331 --> 00:59:38,333
The hill where Christ
was crucified.

956
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:41,168
It wasn'tjust Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

957
00:59:41,268 --> 00:59:44,772
Christ excluded, theywere criminals--
killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

958
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,976
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

959
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:50,578
spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

960
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:53,548
the result of which
is that walking pile of crap--

961
00:59:53,615 --> 00:59:56,685
the Golgothan shit demon,
Hell's chief assassin.

962
00:59:56,785 --> 00:59:58,552
It's here for you, girlie.

963
01:00:03,157 --> 01:00:05,360
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

964
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:40,495
- Hey, man.
- How?

965
01:00:42,629 --> 01:00:44,265
" Knocks strong odors out."

966
01:00:44,364 --> 01:00:47,301
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

967
01:00:49,403 --> 01:00:51,071
What?

968
01:00:51,171 --> 01:00:53,107
Whoever sent this might send more.

969
01:00:53,173 --> 01:00:57,110
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

970
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,746
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

971
01:00:59,846 --> 01:01:02,583
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

972
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:06,186
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

973
01:01:06,286 --> 01:01:07,954
Jersey's sold out, sir.

974
01:01:08,054 --> 01:01:10,623
- What?
- There's one at the same time tomorrow.

975
01:01:10,724 --> 01:01:14,661
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State.

976
01:01:14,728 --> 01:01:17,063
Show up two hours in advance.

977
01:01:19,332 --> 01:01:20,767
Nice.

978
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:23,771
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

979
01:01:23,837 --> 01:01:27,941
what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

980
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,675
Bus, schmuss.

981
01:01:29,776 --> 01:01:34,347
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

982
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:36,883
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

983
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:38,518
Fuck, let's use 'em!

984
01:01:38,618 --> 01:01:41,054
I wouldn't suggest that.

985
01:01:42,455 --> 01:01:44,257
You see, kids...

986
01:01:44,357 --> 01:01:47,794
you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

987
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:55,501
How'd you get out of Hell?

988
01:01:55,601 --> 01:01:57,837
I told them I was coming up
on a routine possession.

989
01:01:57,937 --> 01:02:01,140
I don't have much time. If they figure
out my ruse, they'll come after me.

990
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,944
-What's with bringing us in here?
-You two are inches from getting caught.

991
01:02:05,044 --> 01:02:08,514
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

992
01:02:08,614 --> 01:02:10,550
Don't you know what's going on?

993
01:02:10,617 --> 01:02:12,551
Well, we're going home.

994
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:17,056
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into Heaven?

995
01:02:17,156 --> 01:02:19,692
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

996
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:22,728
Both sides.
Above and below.

997
01:02:22,795 --> 01:02:25,065
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

998
01:02:25,165 --> 01:02:26,565
- Really?
- Why?

999
01:02:26,632 --> 01:02:28,768
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

1000
01:02:30,136 --> 01:02:32,771
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1001
01:02:32,872 --> 01:02:36,109
and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you assholes might make him look bad...

1002
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:38,143
by succeeding
where he's failed so many times.

1003
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,280
- So they'rejust gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1004
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:44,317
That's why you have to travel
incognito.

1005
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:47,419
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1006
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,455
Quit killing people.
That's high profile.

1007
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:52,425
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1008
01:02:52,491 --> 01:02:54,426
Oh, believe it, boys.

1009
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:57,897
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1010
01:02:57,996 --> 01:02:59,731
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1011
01:02:59,831 --> 01:03:02,801
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1012
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:04,837
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1013
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:08,140
In the meantime, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1014
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,275
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1015
01:03:10,376 --> 01:03:13,545
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1016
01:03:13,645 --> 01:03:16,582
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1017
01:03:16,648 --> 01:03:20,285
And remember, incognito.

1018
01:03:24,722 --> 01:03:27,326
How you coping, kid?

1019
01:03:27,426 --> 01:03:29,093
It's weird.

1020
01:03:29,193 --> 01:03:31,763
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1021
01:03:31,863 --> 01:03:35,100
something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1022
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,736
Sometimes I wish
i'd just stayed home.

1023
01:03:37,836 --> 01:03:40,472
You sound like the Man.

1024
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:41,974
What's he like?

1025
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,576
He likes to listen to people talk.

1026
01:03:44,676 --> 01:03:48,113
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1027
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:50,548
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1028
01:03:50,614 --> 01:03:52,784
he always had a smile
on his face.

1029
01:03:52,884 --> 01:03:54,920
His only real beefwith mankind...

1030
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,256
is the shit that gets carried out
in His name.

1031
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:01,759
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1032
01:04:01,826 --> 01:04:05,463
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1033
01:04:05,563 --> 01:04:07,498
He said mankind
got it all wrong...

1034
01:04:07,565 --> 01:04:11,036
by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1035
01:04:11,135 --> 01:04:13,771
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1036
01:04:13,871 --> 01:04:15,940
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1037
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,144
You can change an idea.
Changing a beliefis trickier.

1038
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:21,712
People die for it.
People kill for it.

1039
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:24,249
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1040
01:04:24,316 --> 01:04:29,453
because of the Catholic belief structure
regarding this plenary indulgence shit.

1041
01:04:29,554 --> 01:04:31,790
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1042
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:33,823
are exploiting that belief...

1043
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:35,360
and if they're successful...

1044
01:04:35,426 --> 01:04:39,597
you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1045
01:04:39,697 --> 01:04:41,665
All over a belief.

1046
01:04:43,934 --> 01:04:47,872
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1047
01:04:47,972 --> 01:04:51,041
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1048
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:54,478
and he went flying through the air,
fuckin´ crashed through the wall.

1049
01:04:54,544 --> 01:04:55,980
It was fucked up.

1050
01:04:56,046 --> 01:04:58,982
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1051
01:04:59,049 --> 01:05:02,286
We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1052
01:05:02,386 --> 01:05:05,589
who just got on at the last stop--
Larry and Barry.

1053
01:05:07,225 --> 01:05:09,759
So,Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1054
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:16,934
Hit this shit, man.
It's good stuff.

1055
01:05:18,302 --> 01:05:19,736
Oh, fuck.

1056
01:05:23,306 --> 01:05:25,743
That's some bad shit, dude.

1057
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:27,744
You hit that?

1058
01:05:30,147 --> 01:05:32,081
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1059
01:05:35,284 --> 01:05:36,753
Bad shit.

1060
01:05:37,754 --> 01:05:40,224
Why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1061
01:05:40,324 --> 01:05:43,760
It's just this thing I have to do.

1062
01:05:43,828 --> 01:05:45,295
We're going home.

1063
01:05:45,395 --> 01:05:48,131
Oh.
do you two live together?

1064
01:05:48,231 --> 01:05:50,066
Unfortunately, yes.

1065
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:55,472
So, how long haveyou two
been together?

1066
01:05:56,772 --> 01:05:58,575
A while.

1067
01:05:58,675 --> 01:06:02,378
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1068
01:06:02,479 --> 01:06:04,046
How'd you meet?

1069
01:06:04,146 --> 01:06:05,716
We were stationed together.

1070
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:08,184
See, that's beautiful.

1071
01:06:08,251 --> 01:06:12,121
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1072
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:14,290
Pardon?

1073
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:18,661
You know, there's all the macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1074
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:20,997
You two meet there, hook up--

1075
01:06:21,997 --> 01:06:25,134
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1076
01:06:25,234 --> 01:06:27,670
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

1077
01:06:27,737 --> 01:06:30,841
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1078
01:06:33,676 --> 01:06:36,845
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1079
01:06:36,945 --> 01:06:39,481
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1080
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:41,150
I call it being dumped.

1081
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:43,219
I was...

1082
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:44,954
dumped once.

1083
01:06:45,055 --> 01:06:47,990
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1084
01:06:48,057 --> 01:06:50,660
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1085
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,329
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1086
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,865
and call you back.

1087
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:59,368
They always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1088
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:01,537
When actually...

1089
01:07:01,637 --> 01:07:03,306
it hurts more.

1090
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:08,944
You know what we need?

1091
01:07:09,044 --> 01:07:10,846
What do we need?

1092
01:07:10,946 --> 01:07:12,448
We need drinks.

1093
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:16,018
We need a lot ofdrinks.

1094
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,555
Garcon.

1095
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:27,963
You still go to church?

1096
01:07:28,063 --> 01:07:30,198
Every Sunday.

1097
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:32,701
Does it do anything for you?

1098
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:35,905
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook everyweek.

1099
01:07:36,005 --> 01:07:40,042
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1100
01:07:40,142 --> 01:07:42,377
They go to church and feel bored...

1101
01:07:42,478 --> 01:07:45,881
but they keep going everyweek
just out of habit.

1102
01:07:45,947 --> 01:07:48,216
I am so buzzed.

1103
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:52,787
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1104
01:07:52,854 --> 01:07:55,056
I remember the exact moment.

1105
01:07:57,725 --> 01:08:01,429
I was on the phone with my mother...

1106
01:08:01,529 --> 01:08:05,467
and she was trying to counsel me
through this--

1107
01:08:06,634 --> 01:08:08,070
this thing.

1108
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:14,609
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1109
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:16,611
she said...

1110
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:18,580
" Bethany...

1111
01:08:18,646 --> 01:08:20,582
God has a plan."

1112
01:08:23,985 --> 01:08:27,655
I was-- I was so angry with her.

1113
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:31,358
I was like...

1114
01:08:31,459 --> 01:08:33,395
"What about my plans?"

1115
01:08:33,461 --> 01:08:35,296
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

1116
01:08:35,396 --> 01:08:38,399
I had planned
to have a family...

1117
01:08:38,499 --> 01:08:40,134
with my husband.

1118
01:08:40,234 --> 01:08:43,170
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1119
01:08:47,074 --> 01:08:49,010
Apparently not.

1120
01:08:52,313 --> 01:08:56,284
How about you?
How'd you lose your faith?

1121
01:08:57,484 --> 01:08:59,687
A long time ago.

1122
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:03,257
One day Godjust stopped listening.

1123
01:09:03,358 --> 01:09:07,895
I kept talking, but I got the distinct
impression He wasn't listening anymore.

1124
01:09:07,995 --> 01:09:11,465
How did you know She was listening
in the first place?

1125
01:09:14,335 --> 01:09:16,270
Well, I guess I don't.

1126
01:09:16,336 --> 01:09:18,539
I hate thoughts like that.

1127
01:09:19,707 --> 01:09:22,742
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1128
01:09:22,842 --> 01:09:27,214
'cause when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1129
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:31,486
God's in Heaven, and He's--

1130
01:09:31,586 --> 01:09:35,022
She's always got her eye on you.

1131
01:09:39,527 --> 01:09:42,462
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1132
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:50,770
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1133
01:09:58,978 --> 01:10:01,181
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1134
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:04,451
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1135
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:06,853
All right, but I warned you.

1136
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,621
Okay.

1137
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:12,291
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1138
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:14,160
Really.

1139
01:10:14,261 --> 01:10:18,698
Kerwood Mandel to carthree.
Kerwood Mandel to carthree.

1140
01:10:18,765 --> 01:10:22,202
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1141
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:24,236
from going into the church.

1142
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:27,973
They're trying--

1143
01:10:28,073 --> 01:10:29,509
Shit.

1144
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,747
They're trying
to get back into Heaven.

1145
01:10:37,116 --> 01:10:39,686
See, they got tossed
out of Heaven...

1146
01:10:39,786 --> 01:10:41,253
years ago, right?

1147
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,491
And if they get back in...

1148
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:46,425
it proves God wrong...

1149
01:10:46,526 --> 01:10:49,662
and since God is infallible...

1150
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:51,498
to prove Herwrong...

1151
01:10:51,598 --> 01:10:54,833
would, you know, unmake existence.

1152
01:10:56,635 --> 01:10:58,738
May i have your attention, please.

1153
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:03,075
The diningc ar will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

1154
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,778
I feel so stupid...

1155
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:07,813
just saying it.

1156
01:11:09,281 --> 01:11:11,583
The thing I don't get is...

1157
01:11:11,683 --> 01:11:14,353
how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1158
01:11:14,453 --> 01:11:15,888
Two, even!

1159
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:24,363
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1160
01:11:24,462 --> 01:11:26,565
Maybe you're supposed to kill them.

1161
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:29,835
Oh, yeah, right.
Kill them.

1162
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:35,674
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1163
01:11:36,942 --> 01:11:39,944
how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1164
01:11:40,746 --> 01:11:42,748
Oh...

1165
01:11:42,848 --> 01:11:44,750
I don't suppose
it's much different from...

1166
01:11:45,818 --> 01:11:47,251
killing a human.

1167
01:11:48,688 --> 01:11:51,256
Where is everybody?
I wake up and--

1168
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,160
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1169
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,229
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1170
01:12:01,599 --> 01:12:03,569
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1171
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:06,405
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1172
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:08,739
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1173
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,409
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1174
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,413
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1175
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,383
Save it. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1176
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:19,384
Loki!

1177
01:12:20,452 --> 01:12:21,686
Holy shit. The apostle.

1178
01:12:21,786 --> 01:12:23,854
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1179
01:12:23,955 --> 01:12:25,923
What are you doing here?

1180
01:12:26,023 --> 01:12:27,959
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1181
01:12:28,026 --> 01:12:29,961
- Us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1182
01:12:30,027 --> 01:12:33,665
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1183
01:12:33,765 --> 01:12:36,535
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1184
01:12:36,635 --> 01:12:38,302
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1185
01:12:38,402 --> 01:12:41,339
We're going home,
no matter whose pride it may hurt.

1186
01:12:41,405 --> 01:12:43,875
- It's not a matter ofpride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1187
01:12:43,974 --> 01:12:46,644
What are you, high? I can't kill her
ifshe hasn't done anything.

1188
01:12:46,744 --> 01:12:48,179
Fine.
I'll kill her myself.

1189
01:12:48,246 --> 01:12:50,548
I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1190
01:12:50,648 --> 01:12:53,184
- These guys are fuckin´ flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1191
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,828
Oh, shit!

1192
01:13:06,297 --> 01:13:07,766
Jay!

1193
01:13:08,933 --> 01:13:10,133
Biggie!

1194
01:13:10,233 --> 01:13:12,703
The door! The door!

1195
01:13:16,506 --> 01:13:18,743
Can't we talk about this?

1196
01:13:24,248 --> 01:13:27,218
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1197
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:08,658
No ticket.

1198
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:14,631
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1199
01:14:14,731 --> 01:14:18,201
- Then you know who she was, don't you?
- The scion, I imagine!

1200
01:14:19,102 --> 01:14:21,105
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1201
01:14:21,205 --> 01:14:24,374
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1202
01:14:24,474 --> 01:14:28,412
And Azrael tells us we're marked?
There's more to this than we thought of.

1203
01:14:28,512 --> 01:14:30,513
I was close.

1204
01:14:30,613 --> 01:14:33,749
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1205
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:34,918
Whoa.

1206
01:14:35,018 --> 01:14:38,255
You know how I felt?
Righteous.

1207
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:39,922
Justified.
Eager, even.

1208
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:42,058
You all right?
Your eyes are kinda--

1209
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,259
My eyes are open.

1210
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,295
For the first time I get it.

1211
01:14:46,363 --> 01:14:50,133
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1212
01:14:50,233 --> 01:14:53,969
See, in the beginning it was
just us and Him-- angels and God.

1213
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:55,805
Then He created humans.

1214
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:58,907
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1215
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:02,244
and bowing and scraping and adoration.

1216
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:06,782
He gave them more than He ever gave us.
He gave them a choice.

1217
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:10,119
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore Him.

1218
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,154
All this time
we've been down here...

1219
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:14,790
I've felt the absence
of the Divine Presence...

1220
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:18,161
and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1221
01:15:18,261 --> 01:15:22,198
And why?
Because of the way He made us.

1222
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:25,601
Had we been given free will we could
choose to ignore the pain, like they do.

1223
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:27,469
But no, we're servants.

1224
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:29,572
Okay.

1225
01:15:29,672 --> 01:15:33,175
All I'm saying here is that
one ofus might need a little nap.

1226
01:15:33,276 --> 01:15:37,180
Wake up! These humans have besmirched
everything He's bestowed upon them.

1227
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:39,181
Theywere given paradise;
they threw it away.

1228
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:41,683
Theywere given this planet;
they destroyed it.

1229
01:15:41,751 --> 01:15:44,287
Theywere favored best
among all His endeavors...

1230
01:15:44,387 --> 01:15:47,690
and some of them
don't even believe He exists!

1231
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:49,858
And in spite ofit all...

1232
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:53,662
He has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1233
01:15:53,763 --> 01:15:55,530
at every turn.

1234
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:57,132
What about us?

1235
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:01,270
I asked you once...

1236
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:04,273
to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1237
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:06,142
What was the result?

1238
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:08,477
Our expulsion from paradise.

1239
01:16:08,577 --> 01:16:11,146
Where was His
infinite fucking patience then?

1240
01:16:11,246 --> 01:16:14,082
It's not right!
It's not fair!

1241
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:16,085
We've paid our debt!

1242
01:16:17,552 --> 01:16:20,289
Don't you think it's time?

1243
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:23,259
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1244
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,898
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1245
01:16:29,998 --> 01:16:32,667
Wait. Wait, wait.
Kill them?

1246
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:36,504
You're talking about the last scion,
for Christ's sake.

1247
01:16:36,604 --> 01:16:39,541
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1248
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:41,143
Don't.
Don't, my friend.

1249
01:16:41,243 --> 01:16:44,846
Don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1250
01:16:44,946 --> 01:16:46,414
They did me once.

1251
01:16:46,514 --> 01:16:48,417
Scion or not...

1252
01:16:48,483 --> 01:16:49,917
she's just a human...

1253
01:16:49,984 --> 01:16:53,121
and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1254
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,190
No harm, no foul.

1255
01:16:56,391 --> 01:16:59,328
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1256
01:17:00,861 --> 01:17:02,229
What did you say?

1257
01:17:02,297 --> 01:17:05,366
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1258
01:17:05,466 --> 01:17:08,470
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking face!

1259
01:17:08,569 --> 01:17:11,639
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1260
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:14,309
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1261
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:16,945
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1262
01:17:18,379 --> 01:17:19,947
Well, fuck that.

1263
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:24,418
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the Throne.

1264
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,488
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1265
01:17:28,555 --> 01:17:30,758
We're going home, Loki...

1266
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:34,896
and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty Himself...

1267
01:17:34,996 --> 01:17:36,930
is gonna make that otherwise.

1268
01:17:43,437 --> 01:17:44,872
Shit.

1269
01:17:46,073 --> 01:17:49,677
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1270
01:17:49,777 --> 01:17:51,478
Very basic strategy.

1271
01:17:51,578 --> 01:17:55,015
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1272
01:17:55,082 --> 01:17:56,183
Why are we enemies?

1273
01:17:56,283 --> 01:17:59,620
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1274
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,123
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1275
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:06,827
I'm tired
of all this cryptic bullshit.

1276
01:18:06,927 --> 01:18:09,463
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1277
01:18:09,563 --> 01:18:12,799
and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1278
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:15,269
unless you come clean right now.

1279
01:18:15,368 --> 01:18:17,437
Why me?

1280
01:18:17,537 --> 01:18:21,007
Out of all the people
on the goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1281
01:18:21,107 --> 01:18:24,044
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1282
01:18:25,278 --> 01:18:29,282
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1283
01:18:29,383 --> 01:18:32,953
How long do you think it would take to
come to grips with something that huge?

1284
01:18:33,054 --> 01:18:35,688
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1285
01:18:35,789 --> 01:18:40,860
In the Bible,Jesus suddenly
goes from age 12 to 30. 12 to 30.

1286
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,162
Now, that's some pretty bad
story telling.

1287
01:18:43,263 --> 01:18:46,199
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1288
01:18:46,265 --> 01:18:47,568
I'll tell you where.

1289
01:18:47,668 --> 01:18:52,372
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1290
01:18:52,472 --> 01:18:55,475
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1291
01:18:55,575 --> 01:18:58,312
to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1292
01:19:00,679 --> 01:19:02,116
Oh, bullshit.

1293
01:19:02,182 --> 01:19:04,150
Any important material
about Christ...

1294
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,819
would give people a better understanding
of the nature ofGod.

1295
01:19:06,919 --> 01:19:10,924
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with His family.

1296
01:19:11,024 --> 01:19:14,026
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1297
01:19:14,127 --> 01:19:18,364
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1298
01:19:18,465 --> 01:19:22,835
Mary gave birth to Christ without having
known a man's touch. This is true.

1299
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:24,837
But she did have a husband.

1300
01:19:24,903 --> 01:19:28,574
do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1301
01:19:28,674 --> 01:19:30,243
ifhe wasn't gettin´ laid?

1302
01:19:30,343 --> 01:19:33,779
The nature of God and the Virgin Birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1303
01:19:33,846 --> 01:19:38,084
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1304
01:19:38,184 --> 01:19:39,285
Meaning?

1305
01:19:39,385 --> 01:19:41,320
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1306
01:19:41,387 --> 01:19:44,056
shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1307
01:19:44,156 --> 01:19:45,891
with the one you call Jesus.

1308
01:19:46,992 --> 01:19:48,895
Bethany, you are...

1309
01:19:48,961 --> 01:19:53,965
the great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandniece...

1310
01:19:54,065 --> 01:19:56,002
of Jesus Christ.

1311
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:03,876
So, that would make Bethany
part black?

1312
01:20:08,613 --> 01:20:10,549
I can't do this anymore.

1313
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:18,958
Whereyou gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1314
01:20:19,057 --> 01:20:20,826
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1315
01:20:20,926 --> 01:20:22,494
It's bullshit!

1316
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:28,534
Let her go, man.

1317
01:20:28,634 --> 01:20:30,101
Give her time.

1318
01:20:37,442 --> 01:20:39,445
Why?

1319
01:20:39,545 --> 01:20:42,480
What the fuck do You want from me?

1320
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:44,950
I fucking hate You!

1321
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:47,519
I hate You.

1322
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:49,855
He can't hear you, you know.

1323
01:20:55,626 --> 01:20:57,663
That's why we needed you.

1324
01:20:57,763 --> 01:21:00,031
Why didn't you tell me?

1325
01:21:00,131 --> 01:21:01,266
Would you--

1326
01:21:02,366 --> 01:21:04,636
Could you have believed me?

1327
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,939
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1328
01:21:08,873 --> 01:21:11,142
Only after everything you've seen...

1329
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:13,377
everything you've heard...

1330
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:18,483
could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1331
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:20,551
I don't want this.

1332
01:21:23,822 --> 01:21:25,856
It's too big.

1333
01:21:25,957 --> 01:21:27,625
That's what Jesus said.

1334
01:21:29,827 --> 01:21:31,763
I had to tell Him.

1335
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:37,968
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1336
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:41,372
not to be able
to tell the Son Himself...

1337
01:21:41,472 --> 01:21:44,442
because one word from His lips would
destroy the boy's frail human form.

1338
01:21:44,542 --> 01:21:47,879
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1339
01:21:47,979 --> 01:21:50,181
who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1340
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:54,385
I had to tell this little boy
that He was God's only son...

1341
01:21:54,485 --> 01:21:57,421
and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1342
01:21:57,487 --> 01:22:00,691
at the hands of the very people
He'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1343
01:22:02,926 --> 01:22:05,062
He begged me to take it all back.

1344
01:22:06,496 --> 01:22:08,065
As if i could.

1345
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,569
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1346
01:22:12,669 --> 01:22:17,075
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
something I've never told anyone before.

1347
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:20,478
If I had the power...

1348
01:22:21,945 --> 01:22:23,379
I would have.

1349
01:22:24,114 --> 01:22:25,282
It's unfair.

1350
01:22:25,383 --> 01:22:29,019
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1351
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:31,388
and to ask you to do the same now.

1352
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,190
I sympathize. I do.

1353
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,726
I wish I could take it all back.

1354
01:22:38,195 --> 01:22:39,763
But I can't.

1355
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,100
This...

1356
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,403
is who you are.

1357
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,908
Everything I am has been a lie?

1358
01:22:55,979 --> 01:23:00,551
Knowing what you now know
doesn't mean you're not who you were.

1359
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:01,751
You are...

1360
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,419
Bethany Sloane.

1361
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,455
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1362
01:23:08,325 --> 01:23:13,029
All this means is
a redefinition ofthat identity.

1363
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:16,733
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1364
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:19,001
Be who you've always been.

1365
01:23:20,103 --> 01:23:21,237
Just...

1366
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,806
be this as well...

1367
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:28,077
from time to time.

1368
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,617
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1369
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:36,919
To say the least.

1370
01:23:45,093 --> 01:23:47,630
Do you mind if we ad journ
to somewhere...

1371
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:50,332
a tad more habitable...

1372
01:23:50,433 --> 01:23:52,001
and a bit warmer?

1373
01:24:06,882 --> 01:24:09,551
Fuck, I think this shit
just kicked in.

1374
01:24:09,652 --> 01:24:12,522
Weren't wejust in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1375
01:24:12,588 --> 01:24:14,557
Going out in style.

1376
01:24:14,657 --> 01:24:17,226
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1377
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:19,128
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1378
01:24:19,228 --> 01:24:21,396
The voice of God.
Show some respect.

1379
01:24:21,496 --> 01:24:23,932
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of Him?

1380
01:24:23,999 --> 01:24:26,235
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1381
01:24:26,335 --> 01:24:29,071
- What?
- Didn't it ever occur to you...

1382
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:33,174
that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of His control?

1383
01:24:33,274 --> 01:24:35,010
Yes, but then whywas she tapped?

1384
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:39,080
You know those constitutionals
that He likes to take?

1385
01:24:39,181 --> 01:24:40,415
"Constitutionals"?

1386
01:24:40,515 --> 01:24:42,984
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1387
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:45,020
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1388
01:24:46,287 --> 01:24:49,324
The Lord has quite a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it foryears.

1389
01:24:49,424 --> 01:24:51,426
He assumes a human form once a month
and indulges.

1390
01:24:51,526 --> 01:24:55,029
Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing.
Hejust goes away for a couple of hours.

1391
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:58,733
And He always gives His free points away
to neighbor hood children.

1392
01:24:58,834 --> 01:25:00,268
Isn't that sweet?

1393
01:25:00,335 --> 01:25:03,905
But She hasn't come back
from one of these day trips?

1394
01:25:04,006 --> 01:25:06,375
No, "She" hasn't...

1395
01:25:06,475 --> 01:25:09,276
and we've been unable to locate " Her."

1396
01:25:09,377 --> 01:25:12,680
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1397
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,651
No, there's a different sort
of foul play a foot, children.

1398
01:25:17,786 --> 01:25:21,256
Whomever has set the renegade angels
on their path...

1399
01:25:21,356 --> 01:25:23,791
and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1400
01:25:23,858 --> 01:25:26,828
is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1401
01:25:26,927 --> 01:25:29,164
Were He to be killed in human form...

1402
01:25:29,264 --> 01:25:31,900
He'd have returned
immediately to Heaven.

1403
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,968
Someone knew enough...

1404
01:25:34,069 --> 01:25:36,170
to keep Him biologically alive...

1405
01:25:36,271 --> 01:25:39,241
but incapacitate Him
in another fashion.

1406
01:25:39,307 --> 01:25:42,042
And as omnipotent as we are above...

1407
01:25:42,143 --> 01:25:45,579
I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without His presence.

1408
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:47,615
We've looked everywhere for Him.

1409
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:52,520
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind this.

1410
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,889
But whoever he is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys afteryou...

1411
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:58,059
as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1412
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,893
Could it be Lucifer?

1413
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:01,361
Not Lucifer.

1414
01:26:01,462 --> 01:26:04,965
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1415
01:26:05,066 --> 01:26:08,002
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1416
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:11,272
because he's hadjust as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1417
01:26:11,372 --> 01:26:12,840
What do we do now?

1418
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:15,743
I say we get drunk,
'cause I'm all out of ideas.

1419
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:18,813
Why don't wejust ask this guy
to close the church?

1420
01:26:18,879 --> 01:26:20,680
I beg your pardon?

1421
01:26:20,781 --> 01:26:22,717
The guy in charge
of the church thing.

1422
01:26:25,552 --> 01:26:27,454
Cardinal Glick?

1423
01:26:27,521 --> 01:26:29,657
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1424
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:33,093
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1425
01:26:33,194 --> 01:26:34,462
Good Lord.

1426
01:26:34,562 --> 01:26:36,597
The little stoner's got a point.

1427
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:41,268
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
cancelling the rededication ceremony.

1428
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:43,370
"We"?

1429
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:46,539
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. l-Don't-Think-l-Can-Do-This-Anymore?

1430
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:54,181
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now would I?

1431
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:58,018
Well...

1432
01:26:59,252 --> 01:27:03,056
the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1433
01:27:03,156 --> 01:27:06,293
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1434
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:10,864
but if we can let 'em know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1435
01:27:10,964 --> 01:27:14,000
we can win 'em back,
even get some new ones.

1436
01:27:14,101 --> 01:27:15,668
Excuse me.

1437
01:27:17,738 --> 01:27:19,339
Fill them pews, people.

1438
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:22,375
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1439
01:27:22,442 --> 01:27:24,911
Hook 'em while they're young.

1440
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:29,148
- Kinda like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1441
01:27:29,248 --> 01:27:32,352
We really appreciate you seeing us
this late in the day, Your Eminence.

1442
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:36,022
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1443
01:27:36,122 --> 01:27:38,591
about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1444
01:27:38,692 --> 01:27:41,160
You looking to help out in some way?

1445
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:44,030
We'd likeyou to cancel the ceremony.

1446
01:27:45,131 --> 01:27:46,733
I beg your pardon.

1447
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:50,836
There's gonna be a world of trouble if
tomorrow's ceremony goes on as planned.

1448
01:27:51,938 --> 01:27:54,740
are you pro-choice?

1449
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,409
The trouble's not from us.

1450
01:27:56,509 --> 01:27:59,846
It's from these renegade angels that've
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1451
01:28:02,614 --> 01:28:05,117
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1452
01:28:05,217 --> 01:28:07,387
See, Padre, it goes down like this.

1453
01:28:07,487 --> 01:28:12,191
These guys think that by passing through
that archway, they can go to Heaven.

1454
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:15,894
You want me to call offthe ceremony
for that.

1455
01:28:16,995 --> 01:28:18,097
Who sent you?

1456
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:23,235
We were sent
by Him who is called I Am!

1457
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:25,904
Cute. Really cute.

1458
01:28:26,005 --> 01:28:28,373
Playtime with the cardinal is over.

1459
01:28:28,473 --> 01:28:31,077
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1460
01:28:31,176 --> 01:28:32,779
It's not a joke.

1461
01:28:32,879 --> 01:28:35,948
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1462
01:28:36,048 --> 01:28:39,017
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1463
01:28:39,084 --> 01:28:42,020
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1464
01:28:42,086 --> 01:28:44,623
And its platform of non involvement
during the Holocaust?

1465
01:28:44,722 --> 01:28:47,159
All right, mistakes were made.

1466
01:28:47,227 --> 01:28:50,296
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1467
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:52,397
responsible for the oversights of old.

1468
01:28:52,498 --> 01:28:56,235
I'm a very important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1469
01:28:56,335 --> 01:28:57,803
so if you please--

1470
01:28:57,903 --> 01:29:00,638
- But tomorrow--
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1471
01:29:00,738 --> 01:29:02,074
Do I make myself clear?

1472
01:29:02,174 --> 01:29:06,811
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God Himself...

1473
01:29:06,912 --> 01:29:09,848
is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1474
01:29:30,835 --> 01:29:32,837
I can see the headlines now...

1475
01:29:32,937 --> 01:29:34,873
if there were gonna be any.

1476
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,541
" Existence Erased."

1477
01:29:36,641 --> 01:29:38,842
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1478
01:29:38,943 --> 01:29:41,279
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1479
01:29:43,814 --> 01:29:44,950
What up.

1480
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:47,285
You stole the cardinal's driver?

1481
01:29:47,385 --> 01:29:49,521
That's what he gets
for messin´ with our girlfriend.

1482
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:51,355
Cross-dressin´ fuck.

1483
01:29:51,455 --> 01:29:53,891
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1484
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,596
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1485
01:29:58,663 --> 01:30:01,833
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill 'em.

1486
01:30:01,933 --> 01:30:04,035
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1487
01:30:05,669 --> 01:30:08,372
They won't be killed.

1488
01:30:08,472 --> 01:30:11,508
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1489
01:30:11,608 --> 01:30:12,843
right here...

1490
01:30:12,943 --> 01:30:15,979
until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1491
01:30:17,115 --> 01:30:19,149
There's only one idiot here,
Azrael...

1492
01:30:22,486 --> 01:30:24,622
and I'm looking right at him.

1493
01:30:24,722 --> 01:30:26,223
Muse!

1494
01:30:27,591 --> 01:30:30,694
Just in time to join us
for a drink.

1495
01:30:32,196 --> 01:30:33,263
Hey.
Where'd you come from?

1496
01:30:35,132 --> 01:30:37,068
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1497
01:30:37,134 --> 01:30:38,636
Nothingness.

1498
01:30:38,736 --> 01:30:42,440
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1499
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:46,077
All right, Plato,
sounds like you've had enough already.

1500
01:30:46,177 --> 01:30:48,645
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1501
01:30:48,745 --> 01:30:52,382
Come on, barkeep,just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1502
01:30:52,482 --> 01:30:55,585
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1503
01:30:55,685 --> 01:30:57,421
Is that who I think it is?

1504
01:30:57,521 --> 01:30:58,789
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1505
01:30:58,889 --> 01:31:01,625
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1506
01:31:01,725 --> 01:31:03,860
Give me a...

1507
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,429
Holy Bartender.

1508
01:31:06,495 --> 01:31:08,398
Never heard of it.

1509
01:31:08,465 --> 01:31:12,303
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1510
01:31:12,403 --> 01:31:14,337
You do, don't you, Muse?

1511
01:31:14,404 --> 01:31:15,439
Don't.

1512
01:31:16,572 --> 01:31:17,707
Anybody?

1513
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:19,276
No?

1514
01:31:19,376 --> 01:31:22,879
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1515
01:31:31,488 --> 01:31:32,556
Get it?

1516
01:31:32,656 --> 01:31:34,891
Sweet Jesus, Azrael!
Why?

1517
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:38,495
Come on, Demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1518
01:31:38,595 --> 01:31:42,031
Oh, Apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1519
01:31:42,098 --> 01:31:45,102
and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1520
01:31:45,202 --> 01:31:47,337
The Christ bitch will join you.

1521
01:31:47,437 --> 01:31:50,573
are you really that stupid?

1522
01:31:50,673 --> 01:31:54,177
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1523
01:31:54,277 --> 01:31:56,612
I'm actually counting on it.

1524
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,016
And if my calculations
are correct...

1525
01:32:00,116 --> 01:32:02,819
the pawns are moving into checkmate
as we speak.

1526
01:32:07,823 --> 01:32:11,327
" Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1527
01:32:11,426 --> 01:32:15,631
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1528
01:32:15,731 --> 01:32:17,500
for coming this morning.

1529
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,536
She's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1530
01:32:22,205 --> 01:32:26,876
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1531
01:32:26,976 --> 01:32:29,611
hundred-years-young house of God.

1532
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:30,980
God's house?

1533
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:35,084
God doesn't live here anymore.

1534
01:32:35,184 --> 01:32:37,954
He's grown weary
ofyour superficial faith.

1535
01:32:38,054 --> 01:32:40,989
He's turned a deafear
to your lip-service prayers.

1536
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:44,359
- He has abandoned you, his favorites...
- Sorry.

1537
01:32:44,459 --> 01:32:46,395
to the whim of judgment.

1538
01:32:46,462 --> 01:32:48,965
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1539
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:53,268
prepare to taste God's wrath.

1540
01:32:53,368 --> 01:32:56,306
-Maybe we should just leave.
-You wanted your body count. You got it.

1541
01:32:56,372 --> 01:32:58,974
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1542
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:00,309
Officer McGhee.

1543
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:02,878
All right, mouth piece...

1544
01:33:02,978 --> 01:33:05,747
let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1545
01:33:05,847 --> 01:33:08,216
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1546
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,252
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

1547
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:12,153
Is that so?

1548
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:18,193
Ladies and gentlemen...

1549
01:33:18,293 --> 01:33:23,765
you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1550
01:33:23,865 --> 01:33:26,235
and this very day...

1551
01:33:26,335 --> 01:33:30,071
I assure you you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1552
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:31,906
in blood.

1553
01:33:32,007 --> 01:33:34,276
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1554
01:33:34,376 --> 01:33:35,410
Do it!

1555
01:33:36,645 --> 01:33:39,347
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1556
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:44,419
He was kicked out.

1557
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:46,989
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1558
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:48,122
Then what happened?

1559
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:50,358
Yes, what?

1560
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:54,395
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1561
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:57,031
Heaven became divided
into two factions--

1562
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,300
the faithful and the renegades.

1563
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,204
Oh, the Ethereal Plains
were chaotic with battle.

1564
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:05,074
Angel against angel.

1565
01:34:05,174 --> 01:34:08,610
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1566
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:10,578
But Azrael refused to fight.

1567
01:34:10,644 --> 01:34:14,115
He remained in the middle,
waiting to see who came out victorious.

1568
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:16,284
What are you,
some kind of fuckin´ chicken?

1569
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:17,652
No.

1570
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:19,588
I was an artist...

1571
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,788
stupid!

1572
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:23,524
I was inspiration!

1573
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:26,094
A muse has no place in battle.

1574
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:28,895
So after the fallen
were banished to Hell...

1575
01:34:28,995 --> 01:34:30,932
God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1576
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:33,334
and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1577
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,202
something he considers
a great injustice.

1578
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:38,439
Oh, come on.

1579
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:41,576
Don't tell meyou never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1580
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:44,412
No.
It never bothered me.

1581
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,513
Soyou were an artist.

1582
01:34:46,613 --> 01:34:48,349
Big deal!

1583
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:50,484
Elvis was an artist...

1584
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:53,921
but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time o fwar.

1585
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:55,956
That's why he is the king...

1586
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,957
and you're a schmuck.

1587
01:34:58,025 --> 01:34:59,160
Nice.

1588
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:01,161
So all this is about revenge.

1589
01:35:01,227 --> 01:35:04,198
You're gonna unmake existence
because you have a grudge against God?

1590
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:08,034
After the first million years?
No.

1591
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:11,939
Escape from Hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1592
01:35:12,038 --> 01:35:16,510
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1593
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:18,111
which it finally did...

1594
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:20,180
in Catholicism.

1595
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:21,482
Plenary indulgence.

1596
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:23,483
But I couldn't exercise it.

1597
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:26,019
Demons can't become human.

1598
01:35:26,085 --> 01:35:28,222
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1599
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:31,191
But angels can.

1600
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:33,726
Bartleby and Loki.

1601
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:38,465
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1602
01:35:38,565 --> 01:35:40,333
to celebrate their centennial...

1603
01:35:40,433 --> 01:35:46,039
and when that finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1604
01:35:46,139 --> 01:35:48,074
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1605
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:50,243
kept them cloaked
and off Heaven's radars.

1606
01:35:50,343 --> 01:35:53,480
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1607
01:35:53,579 --> 01:35:57,350
no soul in Hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1608
01:35:57,450 --> 01:36:00,420
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1609
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:03,990
so I dispatched Him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1610
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:06,525
Her. And how?

1611
01:36:06,592 --> 01:36:09,161
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1612
01:36:09,262 --> 01:36:12,198
Oh, no, I've seen
way too many Bond movies to know...

1613
01:36:12,265 --> 01:36:15,202
that you never reveal
all the details ofyour plan...

1614
01:36:15,268 --> 01:36:18,705
no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1615
01:36:18,772 --> 01:36:21,941
The only "X" factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1616
01:36:23,309 --> 01:36:27,380
But fat lot ofgood that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1617
01:36:30,182 --> 01:36:33,319
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1618
01:36:33,419 --> 01:36:37,523
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1619
01:36:37,623 --> 01:36:41,493
but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1620
01:36:41,594 --> 01:36:44,564
Human, haveyou ever been to Hell?

1621
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:46,799
I think not.

1622
01:36:46,899 --> 01:36:49,135
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1623
01:36:49,235 --> 01:36:53,538
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1624
01:36:53,638 --> 01:36:56,141
Still thinking only about yourself...

1625
01:36:56,242 --> 01:36:58,178
you fucking child!

1626
01:36:58,244 --> 01:37:00,312
Now, now, now.

1627
01:37:01,213 --> 01:37:04,216
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1628
01:37:04,316 --> 01:37:06,852
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1629
01:37:06,952 --> 01:37:08,921
Yo, put on channel 9.
Davey and Goliath.

1630
01:37:10,321 --> 01:37:14,727
Actually, I was thinking
more along the lines of current events.

1631
01:37:14,793 --> 01:37:17,195
Keep rolling!Keep rolling!

1632
01:37:17,296 --> 01:37:20,133
I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...

1633
01:37:20,232 --> 01:37:22,367
have laid waste toSt. Michael's!

1634
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:24,803
Bullets don't seem to affect them!

1635
01:37:25,638 --> 01:37:28,573
The remainder of the crowd
have dropped to theirknees...

1636
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,977
identifying this
as the fable da pocalypse.

1637
01:37:31,076 --> 01:37:33,912
Now, I'm notaman of faith,
butl'm inclined to agree.

1638
01:37:34,012 --> 01:37:38,184
Oh, God, please, don't come any closer!
God, no!

1639
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:49,494
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1640
01:37:49,594 --> 01:37:53,164
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not going to matter anyway.

1641
01:37:57,335 --> 01:37:58,336
Oh?

1642
01:37:59,839 --> 01:38:02,240
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1643
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,942
What?

1644
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:06,511
Oh, nothing.

1645
01:38:06,611 --> 01:38:08,747
I had something in my eye.

1646
01:38:08,847 --> 01:38:11,583
Now who's the fucking child?

1647
01:38:12,784 --> 01:38:15,954
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1648
01:38:16,654 --> 01:38:20,291
are you serious? I'm a fucking demon.
You'd have him assault me with a putter?

1649
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,428
You want to play?
Then we'll play.

1650
01:38:23,527 --> 01:38:25,296
One side, Red.

1651
01:38:26,064 --> 01:38:27,732
Go ahead, then.
Pick it up.

1652
01:38:27,832 --> 01:38:28,966
Call it a gift.

1653
01:38:30,468 --> 01:38:32,437
Come on.

1654
01:38:32,536 --> 01:38:33,938
That's it.

1655
01:38:35,506 --> 01:38:37,074
Take a shot.

1656
01:38:37,174 --> 01:38:40,744
Take your best fucking shot.

1657
01:38:42,246 --> 01:38:44,615
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1658
01:38:45,816 --> 01:38:47,752
Come on, bright boy.

1659
01:38:55,592 --> 01:38:58,329
Don't you know anything?

1660
01:39:13,844 --> 01:39:15,780
Bethany, bless the sink!

1661
01:39:15,845 --> 01:39:17,680
- What?
-Just do it!

1662
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:19,750
Bless the sink, damn it!

1663
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:46,209
That's what you get,
motherfucker.

1664
01:39:48,779 --> 01:39:50,948
But I'm a fucking demon.

1665
01:39:58,288 --> 01:39:59,523
What just happened?

1666
01:39:59,623 --> 01:40:02,259
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1667
01:40:02,359 --> 01:40:06,696
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side so it'll do some damage.

1668
01:40:06,796 --> 01:40:08,831
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1669
01:40:08,931 --> 01:40:12,869
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1670
01:40:12,936 --> 01:40:15,972
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1671
01:40:16,072 --> 01:40:18,307
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1672
01:40:18,408 --> 01:40:20,843
Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing
at my next party.

1673
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:24,080
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about ten miles.

1674
01:40:24,181 --> 01:40:26,115
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1675
01:40:26,183 --> 01:40:28,384
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1676
01:40:28,484 --> 01:40:31,687
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1677
01:40:43,532 --> 01:40:45,201
Oh, my God.

1678
01:40:58,013 --> 01:41:00,716
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1679
01:41:00,816 --> 01:41:02,051
Are we too late?

1680
01:41:02,151 --> 01:41:04,720
To save these poor schmucks?

1681
01:41:06,522 --> 01:41:07,590
Yeah.

1682
01:41:07,691 --> 01:41:10,326
But we still exist.

1683
01:41:10,426 --> 01:41:12,228
Where are they?

1684
01:41:12,327 --> 01:41:14,798
They could already be
in the church.

1685
01:41:14,898 --> 01:41:16,965
Which means if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1686
01:41:17,065 --> 01:41:18,468
are you shitting me?

1687
01:41:18,568 --> 01:41:22,571
The brother here is gonna shred 'em with
his angel-be-good special. Huh, homey?

1688
01:41:22,671 --> 01:41:24,606
If they pass through that arch,
they come out clean.

1689
01:41:24,673 --> 01:41:26,775
And if they die,
they go straight up.

1690
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:29,278
And hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1691
01:41:29,378 --> 01:41:31,747
- Why don't theyjust kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1692
01:41:31,847 --> 01:41:34,650
Die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They don't want to go to hell.

1693
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:38,586
Then what, are we supposed to just wait
for a solution to fall from the sky?

1694
01:41:42,824 --> 01:41:44,159
Friend of yours?

1695
01:41:44,259 --> 01:41:46,194
No, that was a cardinal.

1696
01:41:46,261 --> 01:41:50,064
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1697
01:41:50,165 --> 01:41:52,734
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1698
01:41:52,834 --> 01:41:54,069
Don't you listen?

1699
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:57,139
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1700
01:41:57,239 --> 01:41:59,507
He's been at it for a while now.

1701
01:41:59,607 --> 01:42:01,176
Please! Please!

1702
01:42:02,377 --> 01:42:04,278
We ran out of parishioners...

1703
01:42:04,378 --> 01:42:08,684
so hejust started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping 'em.

1704
01:42:08,784 --> 01:42:11,987
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1705
01:42:13,021 --> 01:42:15,122
If only they'd let us jerk off.

1706
01:42:16,524 --> 01:42:18,259
Whoops.
Take a step back.

1707
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:24,032
Let me go!

1708
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,469
Why?
What are you trying to prove?

1709
01:42:27,569 --> 01:42:30,938
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1710
01:42:31,972 --> 01:42:33,374
Jesus Christ!

1711
01:42:34,742 --> 01:42:36,677
I just wanted to go home.

1712
01:42:36,744 --> 01:42:38,546
But him, you know...

1713
01:42:38,646 --> 01:42:41,015
he just lost it.

1714
01:42:41,115 --> 01:42:44,318
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1715
01:42:44,418 --> 01:42:45,854
He just snapped.

1716
01:42:45,954 --> 01:42:49,558
The funny thing is, this guy
could never even stand to see me work.

1717
01:42:49,658 --> 01:42:52,727
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1718
01:42:53,794 --> 01:42:55,329
Now look at him.

1719
01:42:55,429 --> 01:42:57,464
This guy's fuckin´ drunker than hell.

1720
01:42:57,565 --> 01:43:00,034
Which means he's human now.

1721
01:43:01,436 --> 01:43:03,504
His wings have been cut off.

1722
01:43:10,145 --> 01:43:12,079
The muse?

1723
01:43:12,146 --> 01:43:14,214
Oh, no way!

1724
01:43:14,314 --> 01:43:17,084
I haven't seen you--
You look terrific. Wow!

1725
01:43:17,184 --> 01:43:19,319
What's with the tits?
Can l--

1726
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:21,655
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1727
01:43:25,058 --> 01:43:28,596
Tell me. Have you gone in
and come out through the archway yet?

1728
01:43:28,695 --> 01:43:30,030
No!

1729
01:43:35,135 --> 01:43:36,537
He's back.

1730
01:43:59,893 --> 01:44:01,829
We were awaiting your arrival.

1731
01:44:01,895 --> 01:44:04,931
Bartleby, wait. Stop.
Listen to me.

1732
01:44:05,032 --> 01:44:07,734
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1733
01:44:07,834 --> 01:44:09,069
If you go back--

1734
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:12,939
I've become aware of the repercussions.
I know what I'm doing.

1735
01:44:14,407 --> 01:44:16,076
You sick, twisted fuck!

1736
01:44:17,676 --> 01:44:18,913
Bethany.

1737
01:44:22,115 --> 00:00:00,-900
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1738
01:44:25,518 --> 01:44:28,420
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1739
01:44:28,521 --> 01:44:31,558
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1740
01:44:31,658 --> 01:44:34,727
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1741
01:44:34,827 --> 01:44:39,265
While you never see your ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his new wife--

1742
01:44:40,834 --> 01:44:42,068
and he is--

1743
01:44:45,271 --> 01:44:49,975
seeing you people every day on this
perfect world He created for you...

1744
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:51,777
is a constant reminder...

1745
01:44:51,877 --> 01:44:54,914
that though my kind came fiirst...

1746
01:44:55,015 --> 01:44:57,083
your kind was most revered.

1747
01:44:58,351 --> 01:45:00,686
And while you know forgiveness...

1748
01:45:00,786 --> 01:45:02,722
we know only regret.

1749
01:45:03,789 --> 01:45:05,592
The lesson must be taught.

1750
01:45:05,692 --> 01:45:07,627
All are accountable...

1751
01:45:07,693 --> 01:45:08,928
even God.

1752
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:12,398
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1753
01:45:12,498 --> 01:45:15,734
just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1754
01:45:17,002 --> 01:45:20,473
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1755
01:45:20,574 --> 01:45:22,041
will cease to be.

1756
01:45:22,141 --> 01:45:23,676
No. Hey. Hey!

1757
01:45:26,412 --> 01:45:28,314
I can't let you do that,
Bartleby.

1758
01:45:28,414 --> 01:45:30,482
This has gone too far.

1759
01:45:32,484 --> 01:45:34,888
I might have to take you down.

1760
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:38,257
It's okay. Shh.

1761
01:45:38,357 --> 01:45:39,924
I'll do it.

1762
01:45:44,729 --> 01:45:46,666
My compatriot.

1763
01:45:47,999 --> 01:45:50,535
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1764
01:45:50,635 --> 01:45:51,870
He's weakened.

1765
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:53,405
You're weak.

1766
01:45:53,505 --> 01:45:56,308
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1767
01:45:56,408 --> 01:45:58,576
a condition which carries
two liabilities--

1768
01:46:00,411 --> 01:46:02,180
a conscience...

1769
01:46:03,015 --> 01:46:04,416
and...

1770
01:46:07,453 --> 01:46:10,021
a short life span.

1771
01:46:10,122 --> 01:46:12,891
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1772
01:46:40,685 --> 01:46:42,621
He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1773
01:46:42,687 --> 01:46:44,956
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1774
01:46:46,357 --> 01:46:47,759
I can't believe this.

1775
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:50,462
We're on the brink of non existence,
and God's still nowhere to be found.

1776
01:46:50,562 --> 01:46:53,631
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1777
01:47:00,538 --> 01:47:02,640
What the hell are you doing?

1778
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:06,243
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1779
01:47:10,314 --> 01:47:13,217
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1780
01:47:13,317 --> 01:47:16,888
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1781
01:47:16,988 --> 01:47:19,923
- or we can get makin´ with the love.
- What did you say?

1782
01:47:19,991 --> 01:47:22,059
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1783
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:23,661
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1784
01:47:27,498 --> 01:47:30,468
That guy, the one they won't take
off life support--John Doe Jersey.

1785
01:47:30,568 --> 01:47:32,603
This is where he's at--
St. Michael's Hospital.

1786
01:47:34,172 --> 01:47:35,605
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1787
01:47:35,706 --> 01:47:38,309
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1788
01:47:38,409 --> 01:47:40,845
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1789
01:47:40,945 --> 01:47:42,980
- Have you ever been there?
- Once, with this chick.

1790
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,083
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1791
01:47:46,183 --> 01:47:48,018
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1792
01:47:51,455 --> 01:47:53,356
That's what I'm talkin´ about.

1793
01:48:01,397 --> 01:48:04,467
What ever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1794
01:48:04,568 --> 01:48:06,704
Bob, come with me.
Come on!

1795
01:48:06,803 --> 01:48:09,472
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1796
01:48:09,573 --> 01:48:11,775
I already did,
but it takes two of us!

1797
01:48:12,642 --> 01:48:14,845
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1798
01:48:14,945 --> 01:48:16,713
This is the apocalypse.

1799
01:48:16,813 --> 01:48:19,516
Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.

1800
01:48:19,616 --> 01:48:21,351
Thank you.

1801
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,402
Hey, Big Bird!

1802
01:48:39,302 --> 01:48:40,971
Ready for the counting game?

1803
01:48:45,775 --> 01:48:47,744
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1804
01:49:15,938 --> 01:49:17,907
No more bullets.

1805
01:49:17,974 --> 01:49:20,142
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1806
01:49:20,242 --> 01:49:23,145
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1807
01:49:23,246 --> 01:49:25,281
You just did him a favor,
stupid!

1808
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:14,730
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1809
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:58,273
Oh, Bartleby.

1810
01:50:58,372 --> 01:51:02,009
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1811
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:04,178
Bow down, stupid!

1812
01:51:22,763 --> 01:51:24,665
I'm sorry.

1813
01:51:47,087 --> 01:51:50,258
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1814
01:51:50,358 --> 01:51:54,095
would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1815
01:51:54,195 --> 01:51:56,230
What the fuck?

1816
01:52:02,402 --> 01:52:04,405
Thank you.

1817
01:52:36,236 --> 01:52:37,871
It never ends!

1818
01:52:57,923 --> 01:52:59,993
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1819
01:53:00,093 --> 01:53:02,563
What the fuck is this shit?

1820
01:53:02,663 --> 01:53:04,364
Who the fuck are you, lady?

1821
01:53:04,464 --> 01:53:06,900
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1822
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,903
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1823
01:53:10,003 --> 01:53:12,973
What the fuck is this, The Piano?
Why ain't this broad talkin´?

1824
01:53:13,039 --> 01:53:18,344
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1825
01:53:18,444 --> 01:53:21,714
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fuckin´ nuts?

1826
01:53:21,815 --> 01:53:24,784
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head?

1827
01:53:24,851 --> 01:53:26,819
Shh.

1828
01:53:42,369 --> 01:53:44,036
Where was she?

1829
01:53:44,136 --> 01:53:46,672
Imprisoned in a body.

1830
01:53:46,772 --> 01:53:49,676
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1831
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:52,778
Hang on a minute.

1832
01:54:27,278 --> 01:54:29,181
You missed a bit.

1833
01:54:30,749 --> 01:54:33,652
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1834
01:54:33,752 --> 01:54:36,188
You ready to make some of those
changes I been talking about?

1835
01:54:36,288 --> 01:54:37,423
We'll see.

1836
01:54:37,523 --> 01:54:39,056
Muse?

1837
01:54:39,157 --> 01:54:41,726
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1838
01:54:41,826 --> 01:54:44,062
you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1839
01:54:44,162 --> 01:54:47,065
First I gotta say good-bye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1840
01:54:47,166 --> 01:54:48,566
Oh, no.

1841
01:55:09,854 --> 01:55:12,290
Metatron, is she--

1842
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:14,693
Afraid so.

1843
01:55:14,792 --> 01:55:18,762
One of the drawbacks to being a martyr
is that you have to die.

1844
01:55:18,862 --> 01:55:21,399
But no matter.

1845
01:55:30,943 --> 01:55:32,843
All is being taken care of.

1846
01:55:33,978 --> 01:55:35,380
How so?

1847
01:55:36,547 --> 01:55:39,617
Wax on, wax off.

1848
01:56:03,207 --> 01:56:04,308
How did l--

1849
01:56:04,407 --> 01:56:06,076
She can rebuild you.

1850
01:56:06,177 --> 01:56:07,745
She has the technology.

1851
01:56:07,845 --> 01:56:11,915
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1852
01:56:17,722 --> 01:56:18,822
That's...

1853
01:56:19,923 --> 01:56:22,693
A very relieved deity.

1854
01:56:24,495 --> 01:56:27,164
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come 'round.

1855
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,667
Your kind always does.

1856
01:56:30,901 --> 01:56:33,337
You might want to
take good care of yourself.

1857
01:56:33,437 --> 01:56:36,206
We're gonna need you down the road.

1858
01:56:36,307 --> 01:56:38,742
I know.
I'm the last scion.

1859
01:56:41,444 --> 01:56:44,548
Well, you're half right.

1860
01:56:44,648 --> 01:56:47,551
You were the last scion.

1861
01:56:49,319 --> 01:56:50,721
But now...

1862
01:56:51,821 --> 01:56:53,323
this...

1863
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:56,159
is the last scion.

1864
01:56:59,229 --> 01:57:01,132
I'm pregnant?

1865
01:57:03,499 --> 01:57:05,635
Can't put anything past you.

1866
01:57:08,972 --> 01:57:11,474
Take care of that parcel for us.

1867
01:57:11,574 --> 01:57:15,479
She has a world ofwork
ahead ofher.

1868
01:57:26,923 --> 01:57:28,958
Thank you for...

1869
01:57:29,058 --> 01:57:31,027
I don't know...

1870
01:57:31,126 --> 01:57:32,361
everything.

1871
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:39,535
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1872
01:57:39,635 --> 01:57:43,673
most of it questioning your great plan,
and that'd be arrogant of me, I know.

1873
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:46,575
But there is one I need to ask.

1874
01:57:46,675 --> 01:57:50,279
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1875
01:57:52,282 --> 01:57:54,216
Why are we here?

1876
01:58:10,832 --> 01:58:13,736
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1877
01:58:20,643 --> 01:58:23,211
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1878
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:26,115
It was an honor.

1879
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:33,721
You did so well.

1880
01:58:38,394 --> 01:58:41,296
I told you She was a woman.

1881
01:58:43,265 --> 01:58:45,634
She's not really a woman.

1882
01:58:45,734 --> 01:58:48,169
She's not really anything.

1883
01:58:48,269 --> 01:58:49,905
She's something, all right.

1884
01:58:51,139 --> 01:58:53,341
Crisis of faith over?

1885
01:58:53,441 --> 01:58:56,345
I think I'm now burdened
with an over abundance.

1886
01:58:56,445 --> 01:58:58,346
When it rains, it pours.

1887
01:58:58,446 --> 01:59:00,649
are you saying you believe?

1888
01:59:01,983 --> 01:59:03,952
But I have a good idea.

1889
01:59:04,053 --> 01:59:05,453
Yes!

1890
01:59:09,424 --> 01:59:11,326
The Man was right about you.

1891
01:59:11,426 --> 01:59:14,430
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell Him so.

1892
01:59:15,363 --> 01:59:17,265
And if you clean up your language...

1893
01:59:17,365 --> 01:59:19,801
I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1894
01:59:19,901 --> 01:59:21,469
Thanks.

1895
01:59:23,037 --> 01:59:25,440
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1896
01:59:28,309 --> 01:59:30,045
Rufus.

1897
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:58,873
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1898
02:00:03,744 --> 02:00:05,646
Youse guys
wanna hear something sick?

1899
02:00:05,746 --> 02:00:08,650
I got half a stalk
when she kissed me.

1900
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:11,151
I couldn't help it.
The bitch was hot.

1901
02:00:11,251 --> 02:00:15,790
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1902
02:00:15,890 --> 02:00:17,358
You're pregnant?

1903
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:22,563
You know, when you're pregnant you can
have sex until the third trimester.

1904
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:24,565
I'll keep that in mind.

1905
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:58,091
