1
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:17,726
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving force
behind Catholicism WOW! Cardinal Glick.

2
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:26,591
Thank you.

3
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:28,519
Now we all know
how the majority...

4
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,755
and the media in this country...

5
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:32,994
view the Catholic church.

6
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:36,031
They think of us as a passé,
archaic institution.

7
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:39,202
People find the Bible obtuse...

8
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:40,700
even hokey.

9
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:42,782
Now, in an effort to disprove
all that...

10
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:46,433
the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

11
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:48,391
both of faith and of style.

12
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:51,395
For example, the crucifix.

13
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:53,984
While it has been a time-honored symbol
of our faith...

14
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:56,990
Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

15
00:02:57,063 --> 00:02:58,590
this highly recognizable...

16
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:00,867
yet wholly depressing image...

17
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:03,040
of our Lord, crucified.

18
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:06,340
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

19
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,196
He came to help us out.

20
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:11,809
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

21
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,530
that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring Sigil.

22
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:18,369
So, it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

23
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,992
of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! Campaign...

24
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:24,359
will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

25
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:25,601
"The Buddy Christ."

26
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:37,950
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

27
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:40,325
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

28
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,733
But look at it.

29
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,556
Doesn't it pop?

30
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,183
Buddy Christ.

31
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,293
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

32
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:49,189
Let me get this straight.

33
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:52,703
You don't believe in God
because of <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>

34
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,717
No, <i>Through the Looking Glass.</i>

35
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,646
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

36
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,850
that's an indictment
of organized religion.

37
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,862
The Walrus, with his girth
and his good nature...

38
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:02,878
he obviously represents either Buddha...

39
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,854
or with his tusks,
the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

40
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:07,837
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

41
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:10,530
Now, the Carpenter, which is
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,080
who was raised a carpenter's son,
he represents the Western religions.

43
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,518
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

44
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,038
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

45
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:22,723
and then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

46
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,606
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

47
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:29,283
that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

48
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,969
ensures the destruction
of one's inner-being.

49
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,046
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

50
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,836
by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

51
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:40,133
out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,069
who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

53
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:46,885
and says, " Do it...
Do it and I'll fuckin' spank you!"

54
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:48,260
Oh, Jesus!

55
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:51,775
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

56
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:55,036
What have I been doing
with my life?

57
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:58,365
- What am I?
- Yeah, I know.

58
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,163
Listen, my advice to you...

59
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:02,686
you take this money that you've
been collecting for your parish...

60
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,825
go get yourself a nice dress,
fix yourself up.

61
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:08,994
Find some man... find some woman... you
can connect with, even for a moment...

62
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:12,030
'cause that's really all life is,
Sister... a series of moments.

63
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:14,982
Why don't you seize yours?

64
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:19,429
That a girl.

65
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,966
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

66
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:31,748
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

67
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:34,532
You've been in His presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

68
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:37,698
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy, man.

69
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:41,062
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

70
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,982
Here's what I don't get about you.

71
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:45,698
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

72
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:48,134
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

73
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,345
Look at them.

74
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,125
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

75
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:56,966
forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

76
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,242
See those two?

77
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:01,475
What that guy doesn't know is that the
girl cheated on him while she was away.

78
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:03,398
- She did?
- Twice.

79
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,536
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

80
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:08,422
'cause they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

81
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:10,657
I like that.

82
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,931
I wish they all could
feel that way more often.

83
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,033
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

84
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:18,438
You call me, you tell me
it's important.

85
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,820
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

86
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,870
We're going home.

87
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:26,114
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

88
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:33,730
Take it and quit leering at me. People
will think I just broke up with you.

89
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:37,094
- You said we're going home, didn't you?
- Read.

90
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,989
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

91
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:42,471
And?

92
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:46,080
You have to keep reading.

93
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:48,191
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church..."

94
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:50,565
<i>... is the kickoff of a new campaign</i>
<i>which seeks to bring...</i>

95
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:52,387
<i>Catholicism into the mainstream.</i>

96
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,877
<i>With a papal sanction,</i>
<i>the archway entrance...</i>

97
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:57,319
<i>of the century-old Jersey shore</i>
<i>house of worship...</i>

98
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,685
<i>will serve as a passageway</i>
<i>of plenary indulgence...</i>

99
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,948
<i>a little-known Catholic belief offering</i>
<i>all that passes through its arches...</i>

100
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:04,804
<i>a morally clean slate.</i>

101
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:07,904
<i>For Sunday News Brief,</i>
<i>I'm Grant Hicks.</i>

102
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:11,324
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

103
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,748
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

104
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:17,343
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

105
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:21,027
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

106
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:24,062
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

107
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:25,859
What then, Hell?
Fuck that.

108
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,782
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

109
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,143
and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

110
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:33,574
If we die with clean souls,
there's no way they can keep us out.

111
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,639
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

112
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:39,973
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

113
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,006
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

114
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,934
He can't keep us out anymore.

115
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,854
Once we're back in,
it'll be forgive and forget.

116
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,926
But this thing,
this is Church law.

117
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,788
It's not Divine Mandate.

118
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:54,303
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:57,671
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:07:57,735 --> 00:08:01,150
by the Son of God
before He left was...

121
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:04,289
- "Whatever you hold true on Earth..."
- "I'll hold true in Heaven."

122
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,294
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

123
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,960
This thing has a papal sanction...

124
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,814
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

125
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,734
never yielded positive results.

126
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,806
You can't be anal retentive
if you don't have an anus.

127
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,051
Outstanding work!

128
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,902
There's just one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

129
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,007
This is gonna help us get back
on His good side.

130
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,192
What?

131
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:27,013
Here. I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

132
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,486
"Mooby, the Golden Calf.

133
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,202
Creating an Empire
Out of Simplicity."

134
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:33,093
I wanna hit 'em.

135
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,778
You really are
just a simple creature.

136
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,051
We finally find a way back
and you want to jeopardize that...

137
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,127
because you've got a soft spot
for the good ol' days.

138
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,516
What better way to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

139
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:45,021
thanks to you?

140
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:48,030
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

141
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:50,885
Killing spree?
I'm talking about Divine Justice here.

142
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:54,148
I'm talking about reigning down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

143
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:56,735
He's all about that.
I know He'd want this done.

144
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:59,393
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
since you quit.

145
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:00,990
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

146
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:03,813
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

147
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,400
If I'm wrong... which I'm not...
it's not gonna matter.

148
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,643
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

149
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,428
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

150
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:15,041
Well, He does hate competition.
I will say that.

151
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:17,315
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

152
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:19,326
Where is this church
we have to go to?

153
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,563
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

154
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:24,519
Last four days on Earth?

155
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,852
If I had a dick,
I'd go get laid.

156
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,959
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

157
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:30,820
Let's kill people.

158
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:32,414
Oh, not you.

159
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,462
<i>The greater Illinois Chapter</i>
<i>of the Right to Life Foundation...</i>

at the New Jersey shore last Tuesday...

168
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:06,208
lies in critical, but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

169
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,003
He lacks identification...

170
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:11,421
and police have had no luck tracking
down any possible family.

171
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:15,718
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

172
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,882
to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

173
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,569
asking that Catholics
all over the country...

174
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,639
join in this protest against euthanasia.

175
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,998
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

176
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:34,271
We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty...

177
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:35,805
Maker of Heaven and Earth.

178
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,846
<i>We believe in Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>His only Son, Our Lord...</i>

179
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,668
Choose life!

180
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:45,051
You're gonna burn in Hell,
ya fuckin' baby killer!

181
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,851
Holy shit. It's the pope.

182
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,261
- Huh?
- Where?

183
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:49,604
What are you talking about?

184
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:02,049
Jesus! You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

185
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,159
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

186
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,981
At least you have an excuse. You're
Jewish. You don't know any better.

187
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:10,396
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

188
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:12,446
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

189
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,828
I went to church.

190
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:15,750
That still kills me,
you and church.

191
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:19,198
If only they knew your weekly tithing
came from a Planned Parenthood check.

192
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,605
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

193
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:26,304
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

194
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:29,474
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

195
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:31,878
I don't think I have any faith left.

196
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:35,910
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

197
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:41,158
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have baby-sat for in high school.

198
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:43,493
The point is,
he told me something.

199
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,015
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

200
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:48,935
When you're young, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

201
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,854
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

202
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,861
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it anymore.

203
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:55,652
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

204
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,541
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

205
00:11:57,608 --> 00:11:58,785
In more ways than one.

206
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:03,111
You need to get laid, Bethany Sloane.
You need a man, if only for 10 minutes.

207
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:05,892
It's been my experience that
the average male is never a man...

208
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,261
not even for ten minutes
in his entire life span.

209
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,142
That sounds militant. Are you thinking
of joining the other side?

210
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:13,029
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

211
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:16,161
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

212
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:18,086
I think God is dead.

213
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:20,486
The sign of a true Catholic.

214
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,732
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

215
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,425
I'm from the EPA.

216
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,269
We're checking on possible
freon leaks.

217
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:41,572
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

218
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,265
Yes, we have central air.

219
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:44,896
In every room?

220
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,690
Except the bathroom.
Why?

221
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,702
Well, you do know
what that means, don't you?

222
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:01,118
Move!

223
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:10,944
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

224
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:13,858
than central air.

225
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,608
Pick that up.

226
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,586
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

227
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:26,438
Now, if I remember
the protocol correctly...

228
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:27,877
the powers...

229
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:31,205
will attempt to contact
the last scion.

230
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:33,344
I need you three...

231
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:36,415
to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

232
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:41,343
Go.

233
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,517
Behold the Metatron!

234
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,267
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true God!

235
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,921
Behold the Metatron!

236
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:25,886
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true God!

237
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,549
Sweet Jesus!
Do you have to use the whole can?

238
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:47,517
Who the fuck are you and
what the fuck are you doing in my room?

239
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:50,308
I'm the one that's soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

240
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,262
Stupid fucking...

241
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:54,564
Get the fuck out of here,
now!

242
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:57,152
Or you'll do what exactly?

243
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:59,329
Hit me with that fish?

244
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:06,877
Now, just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

245
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:09,439
Jesus wept!

246
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:11,203
Look at my suit.

247
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,947
Just take whatever you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

248
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:19,238
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

249
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,780
See?

250
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:28,068
I'm as anatomically-impaired
as a Ken doll.

251
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,200
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

252
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:34,532
You bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

253
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,185
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

254
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:38,782
What are you?

255
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,798
I'm pissed off is what I am.

256
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:44,766
Do you drench everyone who comes in your
room with flame-retardant chemicals?

257
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,589
No wonder you're single.

258
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,606
Stand back.

259
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,485
As I was sayin'...

260
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,658
prior to your fire-fighting episode...

261
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,050
I am the Metatron.

262
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,360
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell?

263
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:18,438
You people.

264
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:21,569
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

265
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:25,440
I am a seraphim.

266
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,924
The highest choir of angels.

267
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:33,030
You do know what an angel is,
don't you?

268
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:38,496
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

269
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:42,626
Any documented occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

270
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:44,353
they're speaking to me.

271
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:46,528
Or they're talking to themselves.

272
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,559
Why doesn't God speak for Himself?

273
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,628
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

274
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:57,794
human beings have neither the aural,
nor the psychological capacity...

275
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:02,141
to withstand the awesome power
of God's true voice.

276
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:05,511
Were you to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

277
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:08,324
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

278
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,069
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

279
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:16,292
Aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?

280
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:20,838
You want more proof?

281
00:17:20,903 --> 00:17:22,529
Fine.

282
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,680
How about tequila?

283
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:34,470
- Where the hell are we?
- Only place you can go for good tequila.

284
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:37,502
<i>Dos tequilas, por favor,</i>
and an empty glass.

285
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:41,122
We're in Mexico?

286
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,526
Actually, we're in a franchised
Mexican family eatery...

287
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:45,730
down the street
from your apartment, but...

288
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,588
it's impressive nonetheless.

289
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:52,129
You don't mind I lost the wings, do you?
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

290
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,923
What do you want with me?

291
00:17:56,392 --> 00:18:00,134
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

292
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:03,363
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

293
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:05,700
Noah was a drunk.
Look what he accomplished.

294
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:09,509
And no one's asking you to build an ark.
All you gotta do is go to New Jersey...

295
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:12,031
and visit a small church
on a very important day.

296
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,538
New Jersey?

297
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:20,702
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

298
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:23,197
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

299
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:25,246
What's the fine print?

300
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:29,091
Stop a couple of angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

301
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,264
Wait, wait, wait.
Repeat that.

302
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:34,466
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

303
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:37,569
and thus negating all existence.

304
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:39,843
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

305
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,667
You might want to clarify that.

306
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,881
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

307
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,991
And His wrath was bore...

308
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:52,162
by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

309
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,304
When Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed...

310
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,804
that was Loki.

311
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:59,774
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

312
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,466
that was Loki...
and he was good at what he did.

313
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:04,226
But one day...

314
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:07,143
he refused to bear God's wrath
any longer.

315
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:10,565
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

316
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:12,606
a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

317
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:13,759
Grigori?

318
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:16,930
One of the choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

319
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,373
Guess what they do.

320
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:22,695
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt...

321
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,148
The Tenth Plague.

322
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:27,907
Tell a person that you're the Metatron
and they stare at you blankly.

323
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:29,982
Mention something out of
a Charlton Heston movie...

324
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:32,128
and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

325
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,055
May I continue uninterrupted?

326
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,127
Once he's done with the firstborn...

327
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:40,706
Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

328
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:43,012
And over many rounds...

329
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,119
they get into
this discussion about...

330
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:47,013
whether or not murder
in the name of God is okay.

331
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,388
And in the end...

332
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:52,230
Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

333
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:54,532
and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

334
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,126
So...

335
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:59,845
very inebriated...

336
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:02,464
Loki tells God he quits...

337
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,739
throws down his fiery sword...

338
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:06,662
and gives Him the finger.

339
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:09,793
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

340
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:12,798
God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

341
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:14,279
Hence all the spitting.

342
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,672
So, for their insolence...

343
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:19,613
God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

344
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:22,143
would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

345
00:20:22,216 --> 00:20:24,004
- Were they sent to Hell?
- Worse.

346
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:25,926
Wisconsin...

347
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,806
for the entire span
of human history.

348
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:31,905
And when the world ends, they'll have to
sit outside the gates for all eternity.

349
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:33,884
And this has what to do with me?

350
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:38,302
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

351
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:40,863
that would allow them
to reenter Heaven.

352
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:43,521
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

353
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,414
It's not that simple.

354
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:49,407
If they get in,
they will have reversed God's decree.

355
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,830
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

356
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:58,814
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

357
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:02,400
function solely on one principle...

358
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:05,374
God is infallible.

359
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,302
To prove Him wrong...

360
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,215
would undo reality
and everything that is.

361
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,061
Up would become down,
black would become white.

362
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:15,975
Existence would become nothingness.

363
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,566
In essence...

364
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,967
if they're allowed to enter
that church...

365
00:21:22,727 --> 00:21:25,597
they'll unmake the world.

366
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:28,454
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

367
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,170
- Why doesn't God do something about it?
- He could.

368
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
But He'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

369
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:35,872
Why me?

370
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:38,147
Because of who you are.

371
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,004
And who am I?

372
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:42,111
The girl in the pj's!

373
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:45,729
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

374
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,741
I'm gonna have to pass.

375
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:49,728
I beg your pardon?

376
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:54,054
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

377
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,680
When my husband decided...

378
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:58,085
he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear his children...

379
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,395
where was God?

380
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:02,946
To Hell with Him.

381
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:07,074
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

382
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:09,347
just because you've got a grudge
against your Creator.

383
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:11,750
So you lost the ability
to make life.

384
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:15,164
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

385
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,444
by acting like one
and protecting it...

386
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,366
saving it!

387
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,654
But I can't make you.

388
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,231
However, if you should decide
to stop being selfish...

389
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:29,692
and accept your responsibility...

390
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:31,589
you won't be alone.

391
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:32,965
You'll have support.

392
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:35,039
What? More angels?

393
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,638
Prophets.

394
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:41,405
In a manner of speaking.
Two of 'em.

395
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:46,268
The one who speaks...

396
00:22:46,343 --> 00:22:49,758
and he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not...

397
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:51,773
will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

398
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:53,276
The other one...

399
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:55,906
well, he's the quiet type.

400
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,185
Look, I've gotta go.

401
00:22:57,255 --> 00:22:59,492
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

402
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:04,897
What's He like?

403
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:05,894
God?

404
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,472
Lonely...

405
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:11,366
but funny.

406
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,504
He's got a great sense of humor.

407
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:15,430
Take sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

408
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:18,048
than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

409
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,974
Sex is a joke in Heaven?

410
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,716
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

411
00:23:23,783 --> 00:23:24,994
I'll see ya.

412
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:25,732
Snootch to the motherfucking nootch!

413
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,653
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

414
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:07,110
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

415
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:10,688
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pube-less asses!

416
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:18,630
I don't know what to say
or think, except...

417
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:20,582
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

418
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:23,746
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

419
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,598
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

420
00:26:26,664 --> 00:26:29,085
I don't know who those kids were,
but they would have kicked yours...

421
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,974
and Lunchbox's asses
if I hadn't represented.

422
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,756
Thanks for being
out here so late.

423
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:36,928
Wait a minute.
Are you protestors?

424
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,869
You mean those dickheads with the signs
and pictures of dead babies?

425
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:42,310
Shit no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

426
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:44,263
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

427
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:46,237
But what are you doing
hanging around?

428
00:26:46,312 --> 00:26:48,254
We're here to pick up chicks.

429
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:49,986
Excuse me?

430
00:26:50,056 --> 00:26:53,089
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

431
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,810
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

432
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,687
Right.

433
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,442
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

434
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:03,334
- I think.
- Wait a second.

435
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,888
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

436
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,007
What the shit is that?

437
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,822
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

438
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:13,734
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

439
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:18,364
Now how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

440
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,861
I'm goin' back to Jersey
and startin' up the business again.

441
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:24,612
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

442
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,167
<i>Prophets. Two of em.</i>

443
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,785
- You know what I'm sayin', Silent Bob?
- You gotta be kidding me.

444
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:33,441
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

445
00:27:33,512 --> 00:27:36,032
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

446
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:37,477
Try it on.

447
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:42,627
It's a lot more compact than the flaming
sword, but not nearly as impressive.

448
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:45,859
It doesn't have that
"Wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

449
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:49,888
How am I supposed to strike fear into
hearts of the wicked with this thing?

450
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,007
Look at this.

451
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,586
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

452
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:58,525
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

453
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,704
You got to stand there and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

454
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:02,630
I had to do all the work.

455
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:05,827
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

456
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:08,383
I rained down sulfur.
There's a subtle difference.

457
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:10,114
Okay, I'm sure.

458
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:14,078
Fuck you. Any moron with a pack
of matches can set a fire.

459
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,006
Raining down sulfur
is like an endurance trial.

460
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,624
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can engage in...

461
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:20,189
next to soccer.

462
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,268
I'll take this one.

463
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,483
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or are you gonna do us both?

464
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,861
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

465
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:43,869
You're a man of principle.

466
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:47,424
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

467
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:49,884
Some fuck named John Hughes.

468
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,585
<i>Sixteen Candles</i> John Hughes?

469
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:55,686
You know that guy too?
That fuckin' guy.

470
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:58,402
He made this flick <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>
Not bad.

471
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,610
There's tits in it, but no bush.

472
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:03,199
But Ebert over here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

473
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:05,573
because he's like in love
with this John Hughes guy.

474
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:07,712
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

475
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:12,061
Fuckin' <i>Breakfast Club,</i> where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

476
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:15,747
Fuckin' <i>Weird Science,</i> where this babe
wants to undress and get down...

477
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:18,882
but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

478
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:22,945
And then <i>Pretty in Pink,</i> which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

479
00:29:23,015 --> 00:29:26,244
because when the redhead hooks up
with her dream guy...

480
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:29,694
he starts sobbin' like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

481
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,866
And there's nothing worse
than watchin' a fuckin' fat man weep.

482
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:34,823
What exactly brought you
to Illinois?

483
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:38,629
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

484
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,656
where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

485
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,575
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fuckin' harsh.

486
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,884
But best of all...

487
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,992
there was no one dealin', man.

488
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:51,430
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

489
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:53,700
if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

490
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:56,801
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

491
00:29:56,871 --> 00:29:59,838
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

492
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:02,693
There is no Shermer, Illinois.

493
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,647
Movies are fuckin' bullshit.

494
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:08,541
- When are you going back to New Jersey?
- This broad asks a lot of questions.

495
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:11,649
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

496
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,508
Yeah. So you do anal?

497
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:15,997
Is it true that chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

498
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:17,893
I didn't ask you out for sex.

499
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,814
I'll take head.

500
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:25,566
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this.

501
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,894
I think I should go with you.

502
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,774
Like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

503
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:36,678
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

504
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:39,460
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

505
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:40,575
Really?

506
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:42,655
You're going to lead me somewhere.

507
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,321
Me lead you?

508
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:47,239
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

509
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,173
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

510
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:54,142
Someone told me I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I was supposed to go.

511
00:30:54,215 --> 00:30:56,125
What the hell are you babbling about?

512
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:58,785
We saved your ass from
some angry fuckin' dwarves...

513
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:02,467
and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

514
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:06,018
Do you believe in God?

515
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,563
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

516
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:12,486
and we gotta get the one Jesus freak?

517
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,761
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Wait.

518
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,457
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

519
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,734
Pay?

520
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,183
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

521
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:26,175
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

522
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:29,596
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

523
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:31,973
and we're in that fucked-up bar!

524
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,501
What about sex?

525
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:34,852
No sex.

526
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,549
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

527
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:43,964
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

528
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,981
In that highly unlikely situation?

529
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:50,369
Yeah, sure.

530
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:53,374
She's a slut.

531
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,119
All right.

532
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:00,550
But I get to drive.

533
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:11,654
What gear are you in?

534
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,864
Gear?

535
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,935
What do I know about shiftin'?

536
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:28,992
Like I ever drove before.

537
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:35,460
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

538
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:36,869
New Jersey.

539
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:38,975
Maybe you're wrong
about this slaughter thing.

540
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:43,008
How can you be sure what incurs the
Lord's wrath these days? Times change.

541
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,658
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a Hell-worthy trespass.

542
00:32:46,727 --> 00:32:49,094
The major sins never change.

543
00:32:50,504 --> 00:32:55,010
Besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker from a mile away.

544
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,868
Bet on it.

545
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,553
This from the guy who still owes me
ten bucks over that bet...

546
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:02,689
about which was gonna be the bigger
movie... <i>ET</i> or <i>Krush Groove.</i>

547
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,726
Fuck you, man,
'cause time's gonna tell on that one.

548
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,575
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

549
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:14,141
Insinuating, no.

550
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,670
Flat-out telling you.

551
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,567
Right there.
There's one.

552
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,941
So? They're kissing.

553
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:24,935
Adultery.

554
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:27,203
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

555
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,159
You are just a simple creature.

556
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:31,711
- Am I right?
- I happen to know the truth.

557
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:34,686
I'm not gonna tell you. I want to see
how boned up on the job you are.

558
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:37,443
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

559
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:40,097
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

560
00:33:40,168 --> 00:33:42,371
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

561
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,090
Okay. It's a good thing
you were never...

562
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:48,029
the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

563
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:51,813
"No married man kisses
his wife like that"? Are you stoned?

564
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:52,927
Excuse me.

565
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:57,021
Are you married?

566
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:58,819
Why?

567
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:00,294
I'm just curious.

568
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,563
What do you think?

569
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:13,151
- What?
- To her?

570
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:15,198
- What?
- Are you married to her?

571
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:18,567
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

572
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:20,388
Why?

573
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,280
<i>Whose house</i>

574
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:07,718
<i>Run's house</i>

575
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:10,304
<i>I said, whose house</i>

576
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,230
<i>Run's house</i>

577
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:14,335
<i>Whose house</i>
<i>Say what</i>

578
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:16,644
<i>Run's house</i>
<i>Say what</i>

579
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,467
<i>Martin</i>

580
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:25,086
She's fuckin' pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

581
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,069
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

582
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:29,249
Let me know how she is.

583
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,069
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

584
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:35,042
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

585
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:38,243
but being that I've decided to go home,
and not to New Jersey...

586
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:40,701
sorry for the inconvenience
and good-bye.

587
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:42,854
You're breaking up with us?

588
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:46,373
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

589
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,309
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

590
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:52,547
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

591
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:55,615
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fuckin' sky.

592
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:06,787
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky.

593
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,825
No heartbeat.

594
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:24,383
Think someone threw him out of a plane
with a message written on him...

595
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:25,917
like in <i>Con Air?</i>

596
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:28,577
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

597
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,200
<i>- Con Air?</i> Con Shit.
- Kill it!

598
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:34,238
- Sounds familiar.
- Jesus, are you okay?

599
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:36,318
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

600
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:38,563
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!

601
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:41,381
What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

602
00:36:41,447 --> 00:36:45,376
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

603
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:47,814
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

604
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,530
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

605
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,877
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand?

606
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:58,115
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find my own threads?

607
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:02,083
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

608
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:06,372
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside of your armor.

609
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:08,675
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

610
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:11,936
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

611
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:14,374
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

612
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:17,287
the impact with which you hit
the asphalt would have liquefied you.

613
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:19,042
Death is a worry of the living.

614
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,461
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

615
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:25,285
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

616
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,333
I died.

617
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,546
Christ told me the secret
to the resurrection once.

618
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:32,063
We were at this wedding in Caanan.
I got drunk and forgot it.

619
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:33,826
Wait, wait, wait.

620
00:37:33,895 --> 00:37:35,718
Christ?

621
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,791
You knew Christ?

622
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:39,838
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

623
00:37:39,911 --> 00:37:41,667
Let me guess.

624
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:44,157
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

625
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:46,948
I'm a man, just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

626
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,575
At least I was a man.

627
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:51,647
Been dead nearly 2,000 years.
Here, check this out.

628
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:55,809
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rockin' the ganj.

629
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,985
It's not a joint.

630
00:37:58,056 --> 00:38:00,259
I can't read this.

631
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:05,216
It's Aramaic. It says,
"Rufus, see you in two years. Jesus."

632
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:08,288
Freaked me out because He basically
told me when my number was up.

633
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:11,076
Took all the flavor out of the
remaining years. We gotta get moving.

634
00:38:11,144 --> 00:38:14,657
Let's say we continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit. Come on.

635
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:17,183
I'm starvin'.
Back off, Kato.

636
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,466
Wait a second!

637
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:22,109
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

638
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,158
and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

639
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:27,101
I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

640
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:30,470
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where the hell you came from.

641
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:32,390
Me? I came from Heaven.

642
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:33,917
Now let's start walkin'.

643
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:36,709
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

644
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:40,834
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

645
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,075
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

646
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:49,666
What the hell's an apostle?

647
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:13,667
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

648
00:39:13,735 --> 00:39:15,907
She's already met the prophets...

649
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:18,016
and the apostle's with them?

650
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:23,010
I think that our best course
of action...

651
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,462
is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

652
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:30,943
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

653
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,040
well, I'm left with no choice...

654
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:39,006
but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

655
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,287
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

656
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:49,605
I appreciate the loan, brother.
You can have that back.

657
00:39:49,672 --> 00:39:52,901
Man, I remember when all we used to have
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

658
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:55,334
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

659
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:58,432
Now, how 'bout you start explaining
some things, like for starters...

660
00:39:58,503 --> 00:39:59,878
how did you know
where to find us?

661
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:02,114
Do you know what the dead do
with most of their time?

662
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:04,933
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

663
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,559
I can't wait to die.

664
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,387
And why are you watching me?

665
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:10,943
Because you're the one who's gonna
help me get some changes made...

666
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:12,641
in that book
you put so much stock in.

667
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:14,948
<i>- Hustler?</i>
- The Bible!

668
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:18,212
- What's your beef with the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

669
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,768
Neither are any of us, but you
don't hear us bitchin' and moanin'.

670
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:24,156
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th Apostle.

671
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:29,568
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th Apostle.

672
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,290
But you heard of
the other 12 Apostles.

673
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:35,840
They were all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

674
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:38,333
And why is that?
'Cause I'm a black man.

675
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:40,382
But you know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

676
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:44,733
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing your faith on.

677
00:40:44,807 --> 00:40:48,222
- What's that?
- Jesus wasn't white. Jesus was black.

678
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:49,407
I don't buy it.

679
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:53,505
If that's true, why did He get
written about and you were left out?

680
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:55,714
Well, He is the Son of God.

681
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:57,856
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

682
00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:00,611
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

683
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:04,159
Leaving me out is okay 'cause you
still got 12 white boys to choose from.

684
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:07,712
- Are you gonna listen to this shit?
- That's what people of Antioch said...

685
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:09,540
right before they stoned my ass.

686
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:10,720
You were martyred?

687
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,646
That's one way of puttin' it.

688
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:15,613
Another way is to say I was bludgeoned
to shit by big fucking rocks.

689
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:18,370
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit...

690
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:20,643
life eternal,
a place in God's Heaven.

691
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,167
But as soon as you hear
that you're gettin' this good shit...

692
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,865
from a black Jesus, ya freak.

693
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:27,106
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

694
00:41:27,175 --> 00:41:31,648
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't be your savior.

695
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:32,996
You gonna eat that hash brown?

696
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:35,878
So, you went to Heaven?

697
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:39,074
Damn right I went to Heaven!
That's the least He could do.

698
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:42,439
In the three years I followed His ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

699
00:41:42,504 --> 00:41:45,537
Hell no.
And I was in my prime.

700
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:47,974
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

701
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,527
not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

702
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,454
She had a thing for dark meat,
if you follow me.

703
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,618
Maybe this is just me talking,
but if I were in Heaven...

704
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:58,502
I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as they got the message right.

705
00:41:58,568 --> 00:42:00,608
The message is what counts.

706
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:04,324
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be colorblind.

707
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:07,326
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

708
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,254
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

709
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,898
That's why I'm gonna help you stop those
angels from gettin' into that church...

710
00:42:12,968 --> 00:42:15,455
in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

711
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:18,178
How do you know about that,
the angels?

712
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:21,247
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

713
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:25,443
When you were five, you let a kid
from next door piss on your hand.

714
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:28,773
You did that shit?
You're nasty.

715
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,261
I never told anybody about that.

716
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:32,961
Neither did he.

717
00:42:33,032 --> 00:42:35,749
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

718
00:42:35,815 --> 00:42:38,400
His name was Brian Johnson.

719
00:42:38,471 --> 00:42:40,511
Your exploits,
no matter how inane...

720
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,558
are well documented in Heaven.

721
00:42:42,632 --> 00:42:44,388
Probably Hell too.

722
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:50,944
Where are you going?

723
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:52,772
Tell me somethin' about me.

724
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,709
You masturbate more than anyone
on the planet.

725
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:58,533
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

726
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,967
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

727
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:06,982
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

728
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,734
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

729
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,320
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
God even existed.

730
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:19,740
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

731
00:43:19,816 --> 00:43:23,525
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

732
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:28,131
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

733
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,567
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

734
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:39,103
Where did those two assholes go?

735
00:43:55,944 --> 00:43:57,886
What are you doing?

736
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,902
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

737
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:01,885
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

738
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,196
We gotta get movin'.
How can we get to Jersey?

739
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:06,205
We'll take the train.
I'll call for reservations.

740
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:03,559
I thought she looked familiar.

741
00:45:03,623 --> 00:45:05,184
- Who?
- Serendipity.

742
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:19,006
<i>Morning, shoppers.</i>

743
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:20,770
Good morning.

744
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,974
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

745
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,782
We creamed 'em.

746
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,904
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me...

747
00:45:34,343 --> 00:45:36,198
Do I smell onions?

748
00:45:41,896 --> 00:45:43,684
Excuse me.

749
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,341
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

750
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,062
You may proceed, <i>mon ami.</i>

751
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:58,464
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

752
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:01,350
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

753
00:46:01,415 --> 00:46:02,942
Oh, come on!

754
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,974
Relax. I'm doing it.

755
00:46:09,703 --> 00:46:12,092
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

756
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:16,390
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher in 1989.

757
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:19,106
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991.

758
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:22,787
Broadcast nationally
as the "Mooby Fun-Time Hour."

759
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:27,165
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

760
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:31,069
16 records,
8 prime-time specials...

761
00:46:31,143 --> 00:46:35,551
and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

762
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:39,420
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

763
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,951
dubbed "Mooby World."

764
00:46:42,024 --> 00:46:44,260
Did I miss anything?

765
00:46:44,327 --> 00:46:46,018
You forgot <i>Mooby Magazine.</i>

766
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:47,461
Damn it!

767
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:49,186
Is there a point to this?

768
00:46:49,255 --> 00:46:52,867
You and your board are idolaters.

769
00:46:54,823 --> 00:46:57,573
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

770
00:46:59,623 --> 00:47:01,117
That's you.

771
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:04,416
Do you know much about voodoo?

772
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:08,995
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

773
00:47:09,063 --> 00:47:11,681
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

774
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:13,661
the most well-known of which...

775
00:47:13,735 --> 00:47:15,197
is the voodoo doll.

776
00:47:15,272 --> 00:47:16,679
You see...

777
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,581
a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

778
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:29,695
to various pokes and prods.

779
00:47:29,768 --> 00:47:33,729
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

780
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:35,294
Call security, now!

781
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:42,405
All lines are currently down.

782
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:44,773
- I'm gonna have to apologize...
- Would you knock it off?

783
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:47,206
You're doing it again.
Stop. What did we talk about?

784
00:47:48,295 --> 00:47:51,524
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

785
00:47:51,592 --> 00:47:53,479
which draws worship
from the Lord.

786
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:55,747
You have broken
the First Commandment.

787
00:47:55,815 --> 00:47:58,685
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one of you...

788
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:01,410
passes for a decent human being.

789
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:05,735
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

790
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,655
Like you, Mr. Burton.

791
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,069
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years 8 times.

792
00:48:11,144 --> 00:48:13,282
You even had sex
with her best friend...

793
00:48:13,351 --> 00:48:17,508
while you were supposed to be home
watching the kids.

794
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:20,924
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

795
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,080
Mr. Newman.

796
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:24,770
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

797
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,044
and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

798
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,533
to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

799
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,127
just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

800
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,468
when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

801
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:38,564
She killed herself
three months later.

802
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:41,446
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

803
00:48:41,512 --> 00:48:43,366
Very compassionate.

804
00:48:43,432 --> 00:48:46,399
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

805
00:48:46,472 --> 00:48:49,668
and used the profits
from the sale of her home...

806
00:48:49,735 --> 00:48:53,412
to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

807
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:55,105
Heavens.

808
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:57,826
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

809
00:48:57,895 --> 00:49:01,408
to have sex
with an eleven-year-old boy.

810
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,414
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

811
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:07,138
from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

812
00:49:07,207 --> 00:49:09,509
because it was... survey says...

813
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,708
less costly.

814
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:15,645
You, on the other hand...

815
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,891
are an innocent.

816
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:19,748
You lead a good life.

817
00:49:19,816 --> 00:49:20,863
Good for you.

818
00:49:21,736 --> 00:49:24,670
But you, Mr. Whitland...

819
00:49:24,743 --> 00:49:26,631
you have more skeletons
in your closet...

820
00:49:26,695 --> 00:49:28,550
than this assembled party.

821
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:31,200
I cannot even mention them aloud.

822
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:38,367
You're his father,
you sick fuck!

823
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:42,846
- Good.
- Not bad, man.

824
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:44,774
That's great work.
Very good.

825
00:49:45,992 --> 00:49:47,519
Well...

826
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:50,720
alone at last.

827
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:53,213
With the exception of Miss Pryce here...

828
00:49:53,287 --> 00:49:56,932
there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

829
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,690
Not one.

830
00:49:58,759 --> 00:50:02,207
Do you know what makes
a human being decent?

831
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:03,489
Fear.

832
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:05,567
And therein lies the problem.

833
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,454
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

834
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,836
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

835
00:50:11,912 --> 00:50:15,010
hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

836
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:18,211
lives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

837
00:50:19,879 --> 00:50:21,734
But not from God.

838
00:50:26,535 --> 00:50:28,542
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

839
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:34,047
Man, it really looks
just like you, doesn't it?

840
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,731
Look, if I believed enough in this...

841
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:39,326
I wonder...

842
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:58,050
Come on.
I don't believe in voodoo.

843
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:04,094
Voodoo.

844
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:13,663
But I do believe in this.

845
00:51:13,735 --> 00:51:16,037
Don't run! Don't run!

846
00:51:16,103 --> 00:51:18,787
Fakes! Fakes!
All of you, fakes!

847
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:23,331
"But I do believe in this."

848
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,774
What does that mean?

849
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,246
And one to grow on.

850
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:33,119
Gum?

851
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:36,895
Go on. It's okay.

852
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:38,942
You've done nothing wrong.

853
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:41,983
These guys were fakes.

854
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:44,291
You're a pure soul.

855
00:51:45,832 --> 00:51:48,319
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

856
00:51:49,351 --> 00:51:50,726
Loki!

857
00:51:52,712 --> 00:51:54,086
You're getting off light.

858
00:51:54,151 --> 00:51:56,093
- Loki!
- I know. I'm comin'.

859
00:51:59,943 --> 00:52:01,317
You're so lucky.

860
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:08,261
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

861
00:52:08,327 --> 00:52:09,701
Three years this August.

862
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:13,280
Let me guess... the 14th Apostle, left
out of the Bible because she's a woman?

863
00:52:13,351 --> 00:52:14,529
This girl's no woman.

864
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:17,501
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

865
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:19,233
What, these?

866
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:23,329
You should know better than anyone here
that tits don't make a woman.

867
00:52:23,399 --> 00:52:25,701
Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

868
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:29,150
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things...

869
00:52:29,223 --> 00:52:30,849
her legs.

870
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:33,253
But as you can see...

871
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:35,010
I lack definition.

872
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:38,658
Hey, they're gettin' a free show!
Let me see that shit!

873
00:52:38,728 --> 00:52:41,630
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

874
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:44,256
How do you...
How does she know Metatron?

875
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,237
This is the last scion.

876
00:52:47,111 --> 00:52:49,762
You're kidding.

877
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:51,424
Wow.

878
00:52:51,495 --> 00:52:52,477
I'm confused.

879
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:56,479
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

880
00:52:56,551 --> 00:53:00,097
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

881
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:03,779
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

882
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,342
I'm a muse, stupid.

883
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:08,863
I can't take much more of this.

884
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,561
So you, what, inspire people?

885
00:53:10,631 --> 00:53:13,249
What just went down
with your friends over there...

886
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,101
It doesn't really take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

887
00:53:16,168 --> 00:53:18,077
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

888
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:23,422
For example, I'm responsible for 19 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

889
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:25,983
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

890
00:53:26,055 --> 00:53:28,870
The one about the kid
by himself in his house...

891
00:53:28,935 --> 00:53:31,837
burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off...

892
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:34,082
I had nothing to do
with that one.

893
00:53:34,151 --> 00:53:38,308
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.

894
00:53:55,879 --> 00:53:58,181
What are you doing stripping?

895
00:53:58,247 --> 00:53:59,622
Remember why I left?

896
00:53:59,687 --> 00:54:02,982
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

897
00:54:03,047 --> 00:54:06,081
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

898
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:09,894
I gave my two weeks notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

899
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:12,894
and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

900
00:54:12,968 --> 00:54:14,462
So what happened?

901
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:17,182
Writer's block.

902
00:54:17,256 --> 00:54:20,005
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

903
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:23,933
I can inspire anyone I meet and give out
a zillion and nine ideas a second...

904
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,862
but I can't keep any for myself.

905
00:54:27,399 --> 00:54:29,701
Her quirky sense of humor.

906
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,938
- Whose?
- God's.

907
00:54:32,008 --> 00:54:34,822
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there ever a doubt in your mind?

908
00:54:34,888 --> 00:54:36,611
He's always referred to as "Him."

909
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:38,435
That's not how I wrote it.

910
00:54:38,503 --> 00:54:40,358
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

911
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:43,041
is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

912
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:46,046
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

913
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,541
and all the penholders were men.

914
00:54:48,615 --> 00:54:52,390
So She became a He.
Doesn't stop with God either.

915
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,430
The whole book's gender-biased.

916
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:56,642
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

917
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:58,817
A woman cuts Samson coif of power.

918
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:02,149
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

919
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,622
Read that book again.

920
00:55:03,688 --> 00:55:06,687
Women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the Egyptians and Romans combined.

921
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:07,970
It stinks.

922
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:15,778
Why is the last scion here?

923
00:55:15,847 --> 00:55:18,695
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

924
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,826
- Not the plenary indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?

925
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:24,710
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

926
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:26,630
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

927
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:29,116
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

928
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:32,606
I have issues with anyone who treats God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

929
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:33,988
like some Catholics.

930
00:55:34,056 --> 00:55:36,903
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

931
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:41,026
- If we're wrong, what religion is right?
- It's not about who's right or wrong.

932
00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:42,950
No denomination's nailed it yet...

933
00:55:43,015 --> 00:55:45,535
because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

934
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:50,342
that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in, just that you have faith.

935
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:54,662
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

936
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:59,422
They made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

937
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,950
Who fuckin' farted?

938
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:11,490
Not born.
Shit into existence.

939
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:17,509
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

940
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,964
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

941
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,211
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

942
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:23,621
A shit demon!

943
00:56:23,687 --> 00:56:27,200
No man of woman born!

944
00:56:27,943 --> 00:56:30,977
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

945
00:56:31,048 --> 00:56:32,608
It came for Bethany!

946
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,495
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thang!

947
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,927
I knew I's gonna
whack somebody today!

948
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:39,846
Get your fuckin' hand back.

949
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:41,089
Represent!

950
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:44,742
Go! Go! Go!

951
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:07,526
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

952
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:10,301
Over the bar!

953
00:57:19,399 --> 00:57:22,695
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

954
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:24,701
The hill where Christ
was crucified.

955
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,426
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

956
00:57:27,496 --> 00:57:30,878
Christ excluded, they were criminals...
killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

957
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:33,951
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

958
00:57:34,023 --> 00:57:36,445
spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

959
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,269
the result of which
is that walking pile of crap...

960
00:57:39,335 --> 00:57:42,302
the Golgothan shit demon,
Hell's chief assassin.

961
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,099
It's here for you, girlie.

962
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:50,626
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

963
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:24,323
- Hey, man.
- How?

964
00:58:26,343 --> 00:58:27,936
"Knocks strong odors out."

965
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:30,822
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

966
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:34,465
What?

967
00:58:34,536 --> 00:58:36,390
Whoever sent this might send more.

968
00:58:36,456 --> 00:58:40,252
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

969
00:58:40,327 --> 00:58:42,782
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

970
00:58:42,855 --> 00:58:45,506
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

971
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:48,963
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

972
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:50,657
Jersey's sold out, sir.

973
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,215
- What?
- There's one at the same time tomorrow.

974
00:58:53,288 --> 00:58:57,062
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State.

975
00:58:57,128 --> 00:58:59,364
Show up two hours in advance.

976
00:59:01,543 --> 00:59:02,917
Nice.

977
00:59:02,984 --> 00:59:05,798
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

978
00:59:05,864 --> 00:59:09,824
what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

979
00:59:09,895 --> 00:59:11,488
Bus, schmuss.

980
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:15,967
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

981
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:18,373
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

982
00:59:18,439 --> 00:59:19,966
Fuck, let's use 'em!

983
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:22,373
I wouldn't suggest that.

984
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:25,475
You see, kids...

985
00:59:25,543 --> 00:59:28,838
you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

986
00:59:34,247 --> 00:59:36,255
How'd you get out of Hell?

987
00:59:36,328 --> 00:59:38,499
I told them I was coming up
on a routine possession.

988
00:59:38,567 --> 00:59:41,666
I don't have much time. If they figure
out my ruse, they'll come after me.

989
00:59:41,736 --> 00:59:45,314
- What's with bringing us in here?
- You two are inches from getting caught.

990
00:59:45,384 --> 00:59:48,733
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

991
00:59:48,808 --> 00:59:50,662
Don't you know what's going on?

992
00:59:50,728 --> 00:59:52,582
Well, we're going home.

993
00:59:52,648 --> 00:59:56,925
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into Heaven?

994
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,455
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

995
00:59:59,528 --> 01:00:02,342
Both sides.
Above and below.

996
01:00:02,408 --> 01:00:04,612
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

997
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,021
- Really?
- Why?

998
01:00:06,088 --> 01:00:08,160
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

999
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:12,000
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1000
01:00:12,071 --> 01:00:15,202
and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you assholes might make him look bad...

1001
01:00:15,271 --> 01:00:17,126
by succeeding
where he's failed so many times.

1002
01:00:17,191 --> 01:00:20,159
- So they're just gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1003
01:00:20,231 --> 01:00:23,046
That's why you have to travel
incognito.

1004
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:26,046
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1005
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:27,974
Quit killing people.
That's high profile.

1006
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:30,821
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1007
01:00:30,887 --> 01:00:32,742
Oh, believe it, boys.

1008
01:00:33,928 --> 01:00:36,099
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1009
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:37,858
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1010
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:40,797
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1011
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,726
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1012
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:45,922
In the meantime, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1013
01:00:45,991 --> 01:00:47,966
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1014
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,106
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1015
01:00:51,175 --> 01:00:53,990
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1016
01:00:54,055 --> 01:00:57,568
And remember, incognito.

1017
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:04,320
How you coping, kid?

1018
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:06,017
It's weird.

1019
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:08,575
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1020
01:01:08,648 --> 01:01:11,779
something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1021
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:14,302
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1022
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,928
You sound like the Man.

1023
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:18,341
What's he like?

1024
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:20,862
He likes to listen to people talk.

1025
01:01:20,935 --> 01:01:24,230
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1026
01:01:24,295 --> 01:01:26,564
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1027
01:01:26,632 --> 01:01:28,737
he always had a smile
on his face.

1028
01:01:28,808 --> 01:01:30,782
His only real beef with mankind...

1029
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:33,986
is the shit that gets carried out
in His name.

1030
01:01:34,056 --> 01:01:37,317
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1031
01:01:37,383 --> 01:01:40,896
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1032
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:42,822
He said mankind
got it all wrong...

1033
01:01:42,887 --> 01:01:46,236
by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1034
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:48,864
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1035
01:01:48,935 --> 01:01:50,942
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1036
01:01:51,015 --> 01:01:54,015
You can change an idea.
Changing a belief is trickier.

1037
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:56,476
People die for it.
People kill for it.

1038
01:01:56,552 --> 01:01:58,886
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1039
01:01:58,951 --> 01:02:03,905
because of the Catholic belief structure
regarding this plenary indulgence shit.

1040
01:02:03,976 --> 01:02:06,147
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1041
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:08,070
are exploiting that belief...

1042
01:02:08,135 --> 01:02:09,542
and if they're successful...

1043
01:02:09,607 --> 01:02:13,633
you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1044
01:02:13,703 --> 01:02:15,613
All over a belief.

1045
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:21,565
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1046
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:24,607
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1047
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:27,876
and he went flying through the air,
fuckin' crashed through the wall.

1048
01:02:27,943 --> 01:02:29,317
It was fucked up.

1049
01:02:29,384 --> 01:02:32,198
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1050
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:35,395
We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1051
01:02:35,463 --> 01:02:38,562
who just got on at the last stop...
Larry and Barry.

1052
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:42,559
So, Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1053
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,414
Hit this shit, man.
It's good stuff.

1054
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:52,101
Oh, fuck.

1055
01:02:55,527 --> 01:02:57,861
That's some bad shit, dude.

1056
01:02:57,928 --> 01:02:59,782
You hit that?

1057
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:03,942
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1058
01:03:07,015 --> 01:03:08,422
Bad shit.

1059
01:03:09,383 --> 01:03:11,772
Why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1060
01:03:11,847 --> 01:03:15,142
It's just this thing I have to do.

1061
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,636
We're going home.

1062
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:19,362
Oh.
Do you two live together?

1063
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:21,220
Unfortunately, yes.

1064
01:03:23,752 --> 01:03:26,402
So, how long have you two
been together?

1065
01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:29,379
A while.

1066
01:03:29,447 --> 01:03:33,026
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1067
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:34,622
How'd you meet?

1068
01:03:34,695 --> 01:03:36,222
We were stationed together.

1069
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:38,564
See, that's beautiful.

1070
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:42,341
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1071
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:44,447
Pardon?

1072
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,644
You know, there's all the macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1073
01:03:48,712 --> 01:03:50,883
You two meet there, hook up...

1074
01:03:51,815 --> 01:03:54,849
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1075
01:03:54,919 --> 01:03:57,254
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:03:57,319 --> 01:04:00,319
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1077
01:04:03,016 --> 01:04:06,082
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1078
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:08,607
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1079
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,207
I call it being dumped.

1080
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,189
I was...

1081
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:13,857
dumped once.

1082
01:04:13,928 --> 01:04:16,742
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1083
01:04:16,808 --> 01:04:19,328
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1084
01:04:19,399 --> 01:04:22,847
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1085
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,294
and call you back.

1086
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,676
They always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1087
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,759
When actually...

1088
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:31,457
it hurts more.

1089
01:04:34,727 --> 01:04:36,866
You know what we need?

1090
01:04:36,935 --> 01:04:38,691
What do we need?

1091
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:40,221
We need drinks.

1092
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:43,621
We need a lot of drinks.

1093
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,015
Garçon.

1094
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:55,101
You still go to church?

1095
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:57,248
Every Sunday.

1096
01:04:57,319 --> 01:04:59,621
Does it do anything for you?

1097
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:02,721
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook every week.

1098
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:06,686
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1099
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:08,931
They go to church and feel bored...

1100
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,261
but they keep going every week
just out of habit.

1101
01:05:12,328 --> 01:05:14,531
I am so buzzed.

1102
01:05:16,072 --> 01:05:18,886
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1103
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:21,090
I remember the exact moment.

1104
01:05:23,623 --> 01:05:27,201
I was on the phone with my mother...

1105
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:31,068
and she was trying to counsel me
through this...

1106
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:33,541
this thing.

1107
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:39,815
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1108
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,735
she said...

1109
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,622
"Bethany...

1110
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:45,542
God has a plan."

1111
01:05:48,808 --> 01:05:52,353
I was... I was so angry with her.

1112
01:05:54,376 --> 01:05:55,902
I was like...

1113
01:05:55,975 --> 01:05:57,830
"What about my plans?"

1114
01:05:57,895 --> 01:05:59,684
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

1115
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:02,653
I had planned
to have a family...

1116
01:06:02,727 --> 01:06:04,320
with my husband.

1117
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:07,206
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1118
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:12,807
Apparently not.

1119
01:06:15,975 --> 01:06:19,805
How about you?
How'd you lose your faith?

1120
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,074
A long time ago.

1121
01:06:23,143 --> 01:06:26,492
One day God just stopped listening.

1122
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:30,942
I kept talking, but I got the distinct
impression He wasn't listening anymore.

1123
01:06:31,015 --> 01:06:34,364
How did you know She was listening
in the first place?

1124
01:06:37,095 --> 01:06:38,950
Well, I guess I don't.

1125
01:06:39,015 --> 01:06:41,154
I hate thoughts like that.

1126
01:06:42,247 --> 01:06:45,182
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1127
01:06:45,256 --> 01:06:49,446
'Cause when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1128
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,571
God's in Heaven, and He's...

1129
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,935
She's always got her eye on you.

1130
01:07:01,255 --> 01:07:04,070
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1131
01:07:08,967 --> 01:07:12,066
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1132
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:22,050
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1133
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:25,185
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1134
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:27,492
All right, but I warned you.

1135
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:29,185
Okay.

1136
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:32,703
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1137
01:07:32,775 --> 01:07:34,499
Really.

1138
01:07:34,568 --> 01:07:38,823
<i>Kerwood Mandel to car three.</i>
<i>Kerwood Mandel to car three.</i>

1139
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:42,204
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1140
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:44,134
from going into the church.

1141
01:07:45,959 --> 01:07:47,748
They're trying...

1142
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,189
Shit.

1143
01:07:50,919 --> 01:07:53,254
They're trying
to get back into Heaven.

1144
01:07:56,488 --> 01:07:58,975
See, they got tossed
out of Heaven...

1145
01:07:59,047 --> 01:08:00,454
years ago, right?

1146
01:08:01,479 --> 01:08:03,584
And if they get back in...

1147
01:08:03,655 --> 01:08:05,444
it proves God wrong...

1148
01:08:05,511 --> 01:08:08,545
and since God is infallible...

1149
01:08:08,616 --> 01:08:10,306
to prove Her wrong...

1150
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:13,507
would, you know, unmake existence.

1151
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:17,247
<i>May I have your attention, please.</i>

1152
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:21,411
<i>The dining car will be closing</i>
<i>in five minutes. Thank you.</i>

1153
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:24,000
I feel so stupid...

1154
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:25,926
just saying it.

1155
01:08:27,335 --> 01:08:29,572
The thing I don't get is...

1156
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,225
how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1157
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:33,670
Two, even!

1158
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:41,828
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1159
01:08:41,895 --> 01:08:43,935
Maybe you're supposed to kill them.

1160
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:47,073
Oh, yeah, right.
Kill them.

1161
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,669
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1162
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:56,765
how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1163
01:08:57,511 --> 01:08:59,453
Oh...

1164
01:08:59,527 --> 01:09:01,349
I don't suppose
it's much different from...

1165
01:09:02,376 --> 01:09:03,750
killing a human.

1166
01:09:05,127 --> 01:09:07,615
Where is everybody?
I wake up and...

1167
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,334
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1168
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:14,301
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1169
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:19,421
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1170
01:09:19,495 --> 01:09:22,146
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1171
01:09:22,215 --> 01:09:24,386
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1172
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:27,903
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1173
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:30,757
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1174
01:09:30,824 --> 01:09:33,606
Save it. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1175
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:34,565
Loki!

1176
01:09:35,591 --> 01:09:36,801
Holy shit. The apostle.

1177
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:38,879
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1178
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:40,861
What are you doing here?

1179
01:09:40,936 --> 01:09:42,790
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1180
01:09:42,856 --> 01:09:44,710
- Us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1181
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:48,289
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1182
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,043
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1183
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:52,737
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1184
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:55,622
We're going home,
no matter whose pride it may hurt.

1185
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:58,077
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1186
01:09:58,151 --> 01:10:00,737
What are you, high? I can't kill her
if she hasn't done anything.

1187
01:10:00,807 --> 01:10:02,181
Fine.
I'll kill her myself.

1188
01:10:02,248 --> 01:10:04,484
I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1189
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:07,006
- These guys are fuckin' flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1190
01:10:16,648 --> 01:10:18,174
Oh, shit!

1191
01:10:19,559 --> 01:10:20,966
Jay!

1192
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:23,265
Biggie!

1193
01:10:23,335 --> 01:10:25,702
The door! The door!

1194
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:31,522
Can't we talk about this?

1195
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:39,644
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1196
01:11:17,992 --> 01:11:19,366
No ticket.

1197
01:11:22,536 --> 01:11:25,121
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1198
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:28,540
- Then you know who she was, don't you?
- The scion, I imagine!

1199
01:11:29,383 --> 01:11:31,325
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1200
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:34,465
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1201
01:11:34,535 --> 01:11:38,332
And Azrael tells us we're marked?
There's more to this than we thought of.

1202
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:40,350
I was close.

1203
01:11:40,424 --> 01:11:43,457
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1204
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:44,574
Whoa.

1205
01:11:44,647 --> 01:11:47,778
You know how I felt?
Righteous.

1206
01:11:47,848 --> 01:11:49,374
Justified.
Eager, even.

1207
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:51,422
You all right?
Your eyes are kinda...

1208
01:11:51,496 --> 01:11:53,536
My eyes are open.

1209
01:11:53,608 --> 01:11:55,462
For the first time I get it.

1210
01:11:55,528 --> 01:11:59,172
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1211
01:11:59,239 --> 01:12:02,851
See, in the beginning it was
just us and Him... angels and God.

1212
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,611
Then He created humans.

1213
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,582
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1214
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,787
and bowing and scraping and adoration.

1215
01:12:10,855 --> 01:12:15,110
He gave them more than He ever gave us.
He gave them a choice.

1216
01:12:15,175 --> 01:12:18,339
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore Him.

1217
01:12:18,407 --> 01:12:20,262
All this time
we've been down here...

1218
01:12:20,327 --> 01:12:22,815
I've felt the absence
of the Divine Presence...

1219
01:12:22,887 --> 01:12:26,051
and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1220
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:29,916
And why?
Because of the way He made us.

1221
01:12:29,992 --> 01:12:33,188
Had we been given free will we could
choose to ignore the pain, like they do.

1222
01:12:33,255 --> 01:12:34,979
But no, we're servants.

1223
01:12:35,048 --> 01:12:36,990
Okay.

1224
01:12:37,064 --> 01:12:40,446
All I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1225
01:12:40,519 --> 01:12:44,261
Wake up! These humans have besmirched
everything He's bestowed upon them.

1226
01:12:44,327 --> 01:12:46,182
They were given paradise;
they threw it away.

1227
01:12:46,247 --> 01:12:48,582
They were given this planet;
they destroyed it.

1228
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:51,102
They were favored best
among all His endeavors...

1229
01:12:51,175 --> 01:12:54,371
and some of them
don't even believe He exists!

1230
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:56,447
And in spite of it all...

1231
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,098
He has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1232
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,890
at every turn.

1233
01:13:01,959 --> 01:13:03,421
What about us?

1234
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:07,366
I asked you once...

1235
01:13:07,432 --> 01:13:10,246
to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1236
01:13:10,312 --> 01:13:12,068
What was the result?

1237
01:13:12,136 --> 01:13:14,307
Our expulsion from paradise.

1238
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:16,863
Where was His
infinite fucking patience then?

1239
01:13:16,936 --> 01:13:19,653
It's not right!
It's not fair!

1240
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,575
We've paid our debt!

1241
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:25,634
Don't you think it's time?

1242
01:13:25,703 --> 01:13:28,453
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1243
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:34,844
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1244
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,505
Wait. Wait, wait.
Kill them?

1245
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:41,185
You're talking about the last scion,
for Christ's sake.

1246
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:44,070
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1247
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:45,629
Don't.
Don't, my friend.

1248
01:13:45,703 --> 01:13:49,183
Don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1249
01:13:49,255 --> 01:13:50,684
They did me once.

1250
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,581
Scion or not...

1251
01:13:52,648 --> 01:13:54,022
she's just a human...

1252
01:13:54,087 --> 01:13:57,120
and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1253
01:13:57,191 --> 01:13:59,101
No harm, no foul.

1254
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:03,046
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1255
01:14:04,519 --> 01:14:05,829
What did you say?

1256
01:14:05,896 --> 01:14:08,863
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1257
01:14:08,935 --> 01:14:11,837
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking face!

1258
01:14:11,912 --> 01:14:14,879
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1259
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:17,439
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1260
01:14:17,512 --> 01:14:19,967
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1261
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:22,846
Well, fuck that.

1262
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:27,110
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the Throne.

1263
01:14:28,072 --> 01:14:30,079
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1264
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:33,218
We're going home, Loki...

1265
01:14:33,287 --> 01:14:37,182
and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty Himself...

1266
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:39,110
is gonna make that otherwise.

1267
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:46,726
Shit.

1268
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,360
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1269
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:53,089
Very basic strategy.

1270
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:56,454
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1271
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,600
Why are we enemies?

1272
01:14:57,671 --> 01:15:00,901
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1273
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:04,229
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1274
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:07,809
I'm tired
of all this cryptic bullshit.

1275
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:10,335
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1276
01:15:10,408 --> 01:15:13,539
and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1277
01:15:13,607 --> 01:15:15,909
unless you come clean right now.

1278
01:15:15,976 --> 01:15:17,983
Why me?

1279
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:21,404
Out of all the people
on the goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1280
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,294
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1281
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,342
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1282
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:32,863
How long do you think it would take to
come to grips with something that huge?

1283
01:15:32,935 --> 01:15:35,488
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1284
01:15:35,559 --> 01:15:40,448
In the Bible, Jesus suddenly
goes from age 12 to 30. 12 to 30.

1285
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:42,658
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1286
01:15:42,727 --> 01:15:45,542
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1287
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:46,884
I'll tell you where.

1288
01:15:46,952 --> 01:15:51,491
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1289
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:54,461
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1290
01:15:54,535 --> 01:15:57,186
to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1291
01:15:59,432 --> 01:16:00,806
Oh, bullshit.

1292
01:16:00,871 --> 01:16:02,781
Any important material
about Christ...

1293
01:16:02,856 --> 01:16:05,343
would give people a better understanding
of the nature of God.

1294
01:16:05,415 --> 01:16:09,277
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with His family.

1295
01:16:09,351 --> 01:16:12,253
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1296
01:16:12,327 --> 01:16:16,418
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1297
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:20,677
Mary gave birth to Christ without having
known a man's touch. This is true.

1298
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:22,598
But she did have a husband.

1299
01:16:22,664 --> 01:16:26,209
Do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1300
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:27,806
if he wasn't gettin' laid?

1301
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,175
The nature of God and the Virgin Birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1302
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:35,331
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1303
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,480
Meaning?

1304
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:38,406
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1305
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:41,057
shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1306
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:42,818
with the one you call Jesus.

1307
01:16:43,847 --> 01:16:45,669
Bethany, you are...

1308
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:50,557
the great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandniece...

1309
01:16:50,631 --> 01:16:52,486
of Jesus Christ.

1310
01:16:56,199 --> 01:17:00,061
So, that would make Bethany
part black?

1311
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,438
I can't do this anymore.

1312
01:17:11,368 --> 01:17:14,531
Where you gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1313
01:17:14,599 --> 01:17:16,323
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1314
01:17:16,391 --> 01:17:17,918
It's bullshit!

1315
01:17:21,447 --> 01:17:23,716
Let her go, man.

1316
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:25,212
Give her time.

1317
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,174
Why?

1318
01:17:34,247 --> 01:17:37,062
What the fuck do You want from me?

1319
01:17:37,127 --> 01:17:39,429
I fucking hate You!

1320
01:17:40,328 --> 01:17:41,921
I hate You.

1321
01:17:41,992 --> 01:17:44,163
He can't hear you, you know.

1322
01:17:49,672 --> 01:17:51,646
That's why we needed you.

1323
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:53,923
Why didn't you tell me?

1324
01:17:53,991 --> 01:17:55,104
Would you...

1325
01:17:56,136 --> 01:17:58,339
Could you have believed me?

1326
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,501
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1327
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,579
Only after everything you've seen...

1328
01:18:05,671 --> 01:18:06,719
everything you've heard...

1329
01:18:08,647 --> 01:18:11,614
could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1330
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,597
I don't want this.

1331
01:18:16,712 --> 01:18:18,686
It's too big.

1332
01:18:18,759 --> 01:18:20,385
That's what Jesus said.

1333
01:18:22,472 --> 01:18:24,327
I had to tell Him.

1334
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:30,301
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1335
01:18:31,335 --> 01:18:33,572
not to be able
to tell the Son Himself...

1336
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,509
because one word from His lips would
destroy the boy's frail human form.

1337
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,812
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1338
01:18:39,879 --> 01:18:42,018
who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1339
01:18:42,087 --> 01:18:46,048
I had to tell this little boy
that He was God's only son...

1340
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,935
and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1341
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,098
at the hands of the very people
He'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1342
01:18:54,215 --> 01:18:56,288
He begged me to take it all back.

1343
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,167
As if I could.

1344
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:03,491
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1345
01:19:03,559 --> 01:19:07,782
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
something I've never told anyone before.

1346
01:19:09,191 --> 01:19:11,046
If I had the power...

1347
01:19:12,455 --> 01:19:13,829
I would have.

1348
01:19:14,535 --> 01:19:15,680
It's unfair.

1349
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:19,264
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1350
01:19:19,335 --> 01:19:21,539
and to ask you to do the same now.

1351
01:19:21,607 --> 01:19:23,265
I sympathize. I do.

1352
01:19:23,335 --> 01:19:25,670
I wish I could take it all back.

1353
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:29,566
But I can't.

1354
01:19:32,327 --> 01:19:33,702
This...

1355
01:19:34,887 --> 01:19:36,894
is who you are.

1356
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:41,215
Everything I am has been a lie?

1357
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:49,503
Knowing what you now know
doesn't mean you're not who you were.

1358
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:50,656
You are...

1359
01:19:50,728 --> 01:19:52,254
Bethany Sloane.

1360
01:19:52,327 --> 01:19:55,142
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1361
01:19:56,935 --> 01:20:01,475
All this means is
a redefinition of that identity.

1362
01:20:01,544 --> 01:20:05,024
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1363
01:20:05,095 --> 01:20:07,200
Be who you've always been.

1364
01:20:08,231 --> 01:20:09,343
Just...

1365
01:20:10,247 --> 01:20:11,807
be this as well...

1366
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,901
from time to time.

1367
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:22,150
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1368
01:20:22,216 --> 01:20:24,387
To say the least.

1369
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:34,654
Do you mind if we adjourn
to somewhere...

1370
01:20:34,727 --> 01:20:37,248
a tad more habitable...

1371
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,846
and a bit warmer?

1372
01:20:53,095 --> 01:20:55,680
Fuck, I think this shit
just kicked in.

1373
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:58,501
Weren't we just in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1374
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:00,477
Going out in style.

1375
01:21:00,551 --> 01:21:03,039
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1376
01:21:03,111 --> 01:21:04,867
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1377
01:21:04,935 --> 01:21:07,040
The voice of God.
Show some respect.

1378
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:09,446
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of Him?

1379
01:21:09,512 --> 01:21:11,683
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1380
01:21:11,751 --> 01:21:14,402
- What?
- Didn't it ever occur to you...

1381
01:21:14,471 --> 01:21:18,333
that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of His control?

1382
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:20,098
Yes, but then why was she tapped?

1383
01:21:20,168 --> 01:21:23,997
You know those constitutionals
that He likes to take?

1384
01:21:24,071 --> 01:21:25,281
"Constitutionals"?

1385
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:27,740
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1386
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:29,670
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1387
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,822
The Lord has quite a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it for years.

1388
01:21:33,895 --> 01:21:35,837
He assumes a human form once a month
and indulges.

1389
01:21:35,911 --> 01:21:39,294
Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing.
He just goes away for a couple of hours.

1390
01:21:39,368 --> 01:21:42,848
And He always gives His free points away
to neighborhood children.

1391
01:21:42,919 --> 01:21:44,293
Isn't that sweet?

1392
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:47,807
But She hasn't come back
from one of these day trips?

1393
01:21:47,879 --> 01:21:50,181
No, "She" hasn't...

1394
01:21:50,247 --> 01:21:52,964
and we've been unable to locate "Her."

1395
01:21:53,031 --> 01:21:56,228
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1396
01:21:56,296 --> 01:22:00,005
No, there's a different sort
of foul play afoot, children.

1397
01:22:01,096 --> 01:22:04,445
Whomever has set the renegade angels
on their path...

1398
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,854
and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1399
01:22:06,919 --> 01:22:09,788
is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1400
01:22:09,863 --> 01:22:12,035
Were He to be killed in human form...

1401
01:22:12,104 --> 01:22:14,657
He'd have returned
immediately to Heaven.

1402
01:22:14,728 --> 01:22:16,637
Someone knew enough...

1403
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:18,752
to keep Him biologically alive...

1404
01:22:18,824 --> 01:22:21,671
but incapacitate Him
in another fashion.

1405
01:22:21,735 --> 01:22:24,386
And as omnipotent as we are above...

1406
01:22:24,455 --> 01:22:27,771
I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without His presence.

1407
01:22:27,847 --> 01:22:29,702
We've looked everywhere for Him.

1408
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:34,437
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind this.

1409
01:22:34,503 --> 01:22:37,667
But whoever he is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys after you...

1410
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:39,742
as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1411
01:22:39,815 --> 01:22:41,506
Could it be Lucifer?

1412
01:22:41,575 --> 01:22:42,917
Not Lucifer.

1413
01:22:42,984 --> 01:22:46,366
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1414
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:49,254
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1415
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:52,418
because he's had just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1416
01:22:52,487 --> 01:22:53,894
What do we do now?

1417
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:56,709
I say we get drunk,
'cause I'm all out of ideas.

1418
01:22:56,776 --> 01:22:59,623
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?

1419
01:22:59,687 --> 01:23:01,443
I beg your pardon?

1420
01:23:01,511 --> 01:23:03,366
The guy in charge
of the church thing.

1421
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:07,909
Cardinal Glick?

1422
01:23:07,975 --> 01:23:10,048
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1423
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,349
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1424
01:23:13,415 --> 01:23:14,659
Good Lord.

1425
01:23:14,727 --> 01:23:16,702
The little stoner's got a point.

1426
01:23:16,776 --> 01:23:21,183
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
cancelling the rededication ceremony.

1427
01:23:21,255 --> 01:23:23,197
"We"?

1428
01:23:23,271 --> 01:23:26,238
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. I-Don't-Think-I-Can-Do-This-Anymore?

1429
01:23:30,376 --> 01:23:33,572
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now would I?

1430
01:23:36,328 --> 01:23:37,221
Well...

1431
01:23:38,408 --> 01:23:42,085
the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1432
01:23:42,152 --> 01:23:45,185
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1433
01:23:45,255 --> 01:23:49,565
but if we can let 'em know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1434
01:23:49,639 --> 01:23:52,574
we can win 'em back,
even get some new ones.

1435
01:23:52,648 --> 01:23:54,174
Excuse me.

1436
01:23:56,136 --> 01:23:57,696
Fill them pews, people.

1437
01:23:57,767 --> 01:24:00,582
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1438
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:03,036
Hook 'em while they're young.

1439
01:24:03,112 --> 01:24:07,105
- Kinda like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1440
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:10,175
We really appreciate you seeing us
this late in the day, Your Eminence.

1441
01:24:10,247 --> 01:24:13,695
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1442
01:24:13,768 --> 01:24:16,156
about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1443
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:18,620
You looking to help out in some way?

1444
01:24:18,695 --> 01:24:21,378
We'd like you to cancel the ceremony.

1445
01:24:22,408 --> 01:24:23,968
I beg your pardon.

1446
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:27,902
There's gonna be a world of trouble if
tomorrow's ceremony goes on as planned.

1447
01:24:28,936 --> 01:24:31,653
Are you pro-choice?

1448
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,247
The trouble's not from us.

1449
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:36,549
It's from these renegade angels that've
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1450
01:24:39,175 --> 01:24:41,597
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1451
01:24:41,672 --> 01:24:43,777
See, Padre, it goes down like this.

1452
01:24:43,847 --> 01:24:48,386
These guys think that by passing through
that archway, they can go to Heaven.

1453
01:24:48,455 --> 01:24:51,935
You want me to call off the ceremony
for that.

1454
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:54,047
Who sent you?

1455
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:58,974
We were sent
by Him who is called I Am!

1456
01:24:59,048 --> 01:25:01,535
Cute. Really cute.

1457
01:25:01,607 --> 01:25:03,909
Playtime with the cardinal is over.

1458
01:25:03,975 --> 01:25:06,496
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1459
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,128
It's not a joke.

1460
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,167
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1461
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:14,086
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1462
01:25:14,152 --> 01:25:16,966
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1463
01:25:17,032 --> 01:25:19,487
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?

1464
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,894
All right, mistakes were made.

1465
01:25:21,959 --> 01:25:24,926
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1466
01:25:24,999 --> 01:25:26,941
responsible for the oversights of old.

1467
01:25:27,015 --> 01:25:30,627
I'm a very important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1468
01:25:30,695 --> 01:25:32,124
so if you please...

1469
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,851
- But tomorrow...
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1470
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,229
Do I make myself clear?

1471
01:25:36,295 --> 01:25:40,768
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God Himself...

1472
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,655
is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1473
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:05,725
I can see the headlines now...

1474
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,655
if there were gonna be any.

1475
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,280
"Existence Erased."

1476
01:26:09,351 --> 01:26:11,490
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1477
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,829
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1478
01:26:16,231 --> 01:26:17,344
What up.

1479
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:19,587
You stole the cardinal's driver?

1480
01:26:19,655 --> 01:26:21,728
That's what he gets
for messin' with our girlfriend.

1481
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:23,490
Cross-dressin' fuck.

1482
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:25,894
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1483
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:30,406
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1484
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:33,537
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill 'em.

1485
01:26:33,607 --> 01:26:35,647
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1486
01:26:37,191 --> 01:26:39,809
They won't be killed.

1487
01:26:39,879 --> 01:26:42,814
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1488
01:26:42,887 --> 01:26:44,097
right here...

1489
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:47,102
until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1490
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:50,142
There's only one idiot here,
Azrael...

1491
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:55,392
and I'm looking right at him.

1492
01:26:55,464 --> 01:26:56,925
Muse!

1493
01:26:58,215 --> 01:27:01,215
Just in time to join us
for a drink.

1494
01:27:02,632 --> 01:27:03,679
Hey.
Where'd you come from?

1495
01:27:05,447 --> 01:27:07,302
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1496
01:27:07,367 --> 01:27:08,829
Nothingness.

1497
01:27:08,904 --> 01:27:12,482
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1498
01:27:12,551 --> 01:27:15,966
All right, Plato,
sounds like you've had enough already.

1499
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:18,428
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1500
01:27:18,504 --> 01:27:22,017
Come on, barkeep, just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1501
01:27:22,088 --> 01:27:25,088
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1502
01:27:25,159 --> 01:27:26,850
Is that who I think it is?

1503
01:27:26,919 --> 01:27:28,163
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1504
01:27:28,231 --> 01:27:30,882
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1505
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:33,024
Give me a...

1506
01:27:33,096 --> 01:27:35,462
Holy Bartender.

1507
01:27:35,528 --> 01:27:37,350
Never heard of it.

1508
01:27:37,415 --> 01:27:41,125
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1509
01:27:41,192 --> 01:27:43,047
You do, don't you, Muse?

1510
01:27:43,112 --> 01:27:44,126
Don't.

1511
01:27:45,191 --> 01:27:46,303
Anybody?

1512
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:47,804
No?

1513
01:27:47,879 --> 01:27:51,262
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1514
01:27:59,495 --> 01:28:00,542
Get it?

1515
01:28:00,615 --> 01:28:02,786
Sweet Jesus, Azrael!
Why?

1516
01:28:02,856 --> 01:28:06,238
Come on, Demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1517
01:28:06,311 --> 01:28:09,606
Oh, Apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1518
01:28:09,671 --> 01:28:12,574
and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1519
01:28:12,647 --> 01:28:14,720
The Christ bitch will join you.

1520
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:17,825
Are you really that stupid?

1521
01:28:17,895 --> 01:28:21,278
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1522
01:28:21,352 --> 01:28:23,621
I'm actually counting on it.

1523
01:28:24,807 --> 01:28:26,880
And if my calculations
are correct...

1524
01:28:26,951 --> 01:28:29,570
the pawns are moving into checkmate
as we speak.

1525
01:28:34,344 --> 01:28:37,726
"Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1526
01:28:37,799 --> 01:28:41,858
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1527
01:28:41,927 --> 01:28:43,650
for coming this morning.

1528
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:46,534
She's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1529
01:28:48,136 --> 01:28:52,642
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1530
01:28:52,711 --> 01:28:55,264
hundred-years-young house of God.

1531
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:56,579
God's house?

1532
01:28:57,895 --> 01:29:00,513
God doesn't live here anymore.

1533
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:03,266
He's grown weary
of your superficial faith.

1534
01:29:03,336 --> 01:29:06,150
He's turned a deaf ear
to your lip-service prayers.

1535
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:09,412
- He has abandoned you, his favorites...
- Sorry.

1536
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:11,334
To the whim of judgment.

1537
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:13,821
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1538
01:29:15,431 --> 01:29:17,951
prepare to taste God's wrath.

1539
01:29:18,023 --> 01:29:20,838
- Maybe we should just leave.
- You wanted your body count. You got it.

1540
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:23,424
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1541
01:29:23,496 --> 01:29:24,706
Officer McGhee.

1542
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,171
All right, mouthpiece...

1543
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,923
let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1544
01:29:29,991 --> 01:29:32,293
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1545
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:34,214
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

1546
01:29:34,279 --> 01:29:36,068
Is that so?

1547
01:29:40,168 --> 01:29:41,858
Ladies and gentlemen...

1548
01:29:41,927 --> 01:29:47,197
you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1549
01:29:47,271 --> 01:29:49,573
and this very day...

1550
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:53,251
I assure you you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1551
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,011
in blood.

1552
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,284
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1553
01:29:57,352 --> 01:29:58,366
Do it!

1554
01:29:59,528 --> 01:30:02,146
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1555
01:30:03,751 --> 01:30:07,013
He was kicked out.

1556
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:09,446
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1557
01:30:09,511 --> 01:30:10,559
Then what happened?

1558
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:12,704
Yes, what?

1559
01:30:12,775 --> 01:30:16,572
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1560
01:30:16,648 --> 01:30:19,103
Heaven became divided
into two factions...

1561
01:30:19,176 --> 01:30:21,281
the faithful and the renegades.

1562
01:30:21,352 --> 01:30:24,069
Oh, the Ethereal Plains
were chaotic with battle.

1563
01:30:24,136 --> 01:30:26,819
Angel against angel.

1564
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:30,182
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1565
01:30:30,248 --> 01:30:32,070
But Azrael refused to fight.

1566
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:35,484
He remained in the middle,
waiting to see who came out victorious.

1567
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,567
What are you,
some kind of fuckin' chicken?

1568
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:38,883
No.

1569
01:30:38,951 --> 01:30:40,740
I was an artist...

1570
01:30:40,808 --> 01:30:42,848
stupid!

1571
01:30:42,919 --> 01:30:44,512
I was inspiration!

1572
01:30:44,583 --> 01:30:46,972
A muse has no place in battle.

1573
01:30:47,047 --> 01:30:49,665
So after the fallen
were banished to Hell...

1574
01:30:49,735 --> 01:30:51,590
God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1575
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:53,924
and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1576
01:30:53,992 --> 01:30:56,675
something he considers
a great injustice.

1577
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,816
Oh, come on.

1578
01:30:58,888 --> 01:31:01,822
Don't tell me you never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1579
01:31:01,895 --> 01:31:04,546
No.
It never bothered me.

1580
01:31:04,615 --> 01:31:06,557
So you were an artist.

1581
01:31:06,632 --> 01:31:08,323
Big deal!

1582
01:31:08,392 --> 01:31:10,366
Elvis was an artist...

1583
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:13,668
but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time of war.

1584
01:31:13,735 --> 01:31:15,590
That's why he is the king...

1585
01:31:15,655 --> 01:31:17,510
and you're a schmuck.

1586
01:31:17,575 --> 01:31:18,688
Nice.

1587
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,582
So all this is about revenge.

1588
01:31:20,647 --> 01:31:23,517
You're gonna unmake existence
because you have a grudge against God?

1589
01:31:23,591 --> 01:31:27,203
After the first million years?
No.

1590
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:30,948
Escape from Hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1591
01:31:31,015 --> 01:31:35,325
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1592
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:36,861
which it finally did...

1593
01:31:36,936 --> 01:31:38,823
in Catholicism.

1594
01:31:38,887 --> 01:31:40,098
Plenary indulgence.

1595
01:31:40,168 --> 01:31:41,990
But I couldn't exercise it.

1596
01:31:42,055 --> 01:31:44,422
Demons can't become human.

1597
01:31:44,487 --> 01:31:46,560
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1598
01:31:47,975 --> 01:31:49,382
But angels can.

1599
01:31:50,567 --> 01:31:51,844
Bartleby and Loki.

1600
01:31:53,479 --> 01:31:56,381
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1601
01:31:56,455 --> 01:31:58,178
to celebrate their centennial...

1602
01:31:58,247 --> 01:32:03,649
and when that finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1603
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,574
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1604
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,680
kept them cloaked
and off Heaven's radars.

1605
01:32:07,751 --> 01:32:10,785
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1606
01:32:10,855 --> 01:32:14,499
no soul in Hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1607
01:32:14,567 --> 01:32:17,437
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1608
01:32:17,512 --> 01:32:20,861
so I dispatched Him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1609
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,270
Her. And how?

1610
01:32:23,335 --> 01:32:25,823
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1611
01:32:25,896 --> 01:32:28,710
Oh, no, I've seen
way too many Bond movies to know...

1612
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:31,590
that you never reveal
all the details of your plan...

1613
01:32:31,656 --> 01:32:34,951
no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1614
01:32:35,015 --> 01:32:38,081
The only "X" factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1615
01:32:39,367 --> 01:32:43,295
But fat lot of good that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1616
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,993
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1617
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:53,024
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1618
01:32:53,095 --> 01:32:56,837
but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1619
01:32:56,903 --> 01:32:59,751
Human, have you ever been to Hell?

1620
01:32:59,815 --> 01:33:01,920
I think not.

1621
01:33:01,991 --> 01:33:04,162
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1622
01:33:04,231 --> 01:33:08,388
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1623
01:33:08,455 --> 01:33:10,876
Still thinking only about yourself...

1624
01:33:10,951 --> 01:33:12,806
you fucking child!

1625
01:33:12,871 --> 01:33:14,879
Now, now, now.

1626
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,622
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1627
01:33:18,696 --> 01:33:21,151
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1628
01:33:21,224 --> 01:33:23,111
Yo, put on channel 9.
<i>Davey and Goliath.</i>

1629
01:33:24,456 --> 01:33:28,678
Actually, I was thinking
more along the lines of current events.

1630
01:33:28,743 --> 01:33:31,078
<i>Keep rolling! Keep rolling!</i>

1631
01:33:31,143 --> 01:33:33,893
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>men with huge fucking wings...</i>

1632
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,032
<i>have laid waste to St. Michael's!</i>

1633
01:33:36,103 --> 01:33:38,372
<i>Bullets don't seem to affect them!</i>

1634
01:33:39,143 --> 01:33:41,958
<i>The remainder of the crowd</i>
<i>have dropped to their knees...</i>

1635
01:33:42,023 --> 01:33:44,292
<i>identifying this</i>
<i>as the fabled apocalypse.</i>

1636
01:33:44,359 --> 01:33:47,109
<i>Now, I'm not a man of faith,</i>
<i>but I'm inclined to agree.</i>

1637
01:33:47,175 --> 01:33:51,201
<i>Oh, God, please, don't come any closer!</i>
<i>God, no!</i>

1638
01:33:58,951 --> 01:34:02,050
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1639
01:34:02,119 --> 01:34:05,567
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not going to matter anyway.

1640
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:10,525
Oh?

1641
01:34:11,943 --> 01:34:14,278
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1642
01:34:14,343 --> 01:34:15,903
What?

1643
01:34:15,975 --> 01:34:18,364
Oh, nothing.

1644
01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:20,511
I had something in my eye.

1645
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:23,234
Now who's the fucking child?

1646
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:27,425
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1647
01:34:28,072 --> 01:34:31,585
Are you serious? I'm a fucking demon.
You'd have him assault me with a putter?

1648
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,590
You want to play?
Then we'll play.

1649
01:34:34,663 --> 01:34:36,386
One side, Red.

1650
01:34:37,095 --> 01:34:38,721
Go ahead, then.
Pick it up.

1651
01:34:38,792 --> 01:34:39,904
Call it a gift.

1652
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,229
Come on.

1653
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:44,677
That's it.

1654
01:34:46,151 --> 01:34:47,678
Take a shot.

1655
01:34:47,751 --> 01:34:51,199
Take your best fucking shot.

1656
01:34:52,615 --> 01:34:54,917
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1657
01:34:56,039 --> 01:34:57,894
Come on, bright boy.

1658
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:08,066
Don't you know anything?

1659
01:35:22,919 --> 01:35:24,774
Bethany, bless the sink!

1660
01:35:24,839 --> 01:35:26,628
- What?
- Just do it!

1661
01:35:26,695 --> 01:35:28,604
Bless the sink, damn it!

1662
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:53,984
That's what you get,
motherfucker.

1663
01:35:56,423 --> 01:35:58,528
But I'm a fucking demon.

1664
01:36:05,544 --> 01:36:06,754
What just happened?

1665
01:36:06,823 --> 01:36:09,376
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1666
01:36:09,447 --> 01:36:13,637
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side so it'll do some damage.

1667
01:36:13,703 --> 01:36:15,678
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1668
01:36:15,752 --> 01:36:19,527
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1669
01:36:19,592 --> 01:36:22,526
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1670
01:36:22,599 --> 01:36:24,771
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1671
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:27,174
Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing
at my next party.

1672
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:30,305
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about ten miles.

1673
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:32,230
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1674
01:36:32,295 --> 01:36:34,434
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1675
01:36:34,503 --> 01:36:37,602
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1676
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:50,561
Oh, my God.

1677
01:37:02,823 --> 01:37:05,442
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1678
01:37:05,512 --> 01:37:06,722
Are we too late?

1679
01:37:06,791 --> 01:37:09,279
To save these poor schmucks?

1680
01:37:10,983 --> 01:37:12,030
Yeah.

1681
01:37:12,103 --> 01:37:14,656
But we still exist.

1682
01:37:14,727 --> 01:37:16,483
Where are they?

1683
01:37:16,551 --> 01:37:18,940
They could already be
in the church.

1684
01:37:19,015 --> 01:37:21,022
Which means if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1685
01:37:21,095 --> 01:37:22,469
Are you shitting me?

1686
01:37:22,536 --> 01:37:26,398
The brother here is gonna shred 'em with
his angel-be-good special. Huh, homey?

1687
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:28,326
If they pass through that arch,
they come out clean.

1688
01:37:28,391 --> 01:37:30,431
And if they die,
they go straight up.

1689
01:37:30,503 --> 01:37:32,838
And hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1690
01:37:32,904 --> 01:37:35,205
- Why don't they just kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1691
01:37:35,272 --> 01:37:37,989
Die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They don't want to go to hell.

1692
01:37:38,056 --> 01:37:41,765
Then what, are we supposed to just wait
for a solution to fall from the sky?

1693
01:37:45,799 --> 01:37:47,108
Friend of yours?

1694
01:37:47,175 --> 01:37:49,030
No, that was a cardinal.

1695
01:37:49,095 --> 01:37:52,772
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1696
01:37:52,839 --> 01:37:55,327
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1697
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:56,609
Don't you listen?

1698
01:37:56,679 --> 01:37:59,549
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1699
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:01,827
He's been at it for a while now.

1700
01:38:01,896 --> 01:38:03,422
Please! Please!

1701
01:38:04,551 --> 01:38:06,406
We ran out of parishioners...

1702
01:38:06,471 --> 01:38:10,628
so he just started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping 'em.

1703
01:38:10,696 --> 01:38:13,794
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1704
01:38:14,759 --> 01:38:16,799
If only they'd let us jerk off.

1705
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,810
Whoops.
Take a step back.

1706
01:38:23,976 --> 01:38:25,350
Let me go!

1707
01:38:26,439 --> 01:38:28,643
Why?
What are you trying to prove?

1708
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:31,973
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1709
01:38:32,935 --> 01:38:34,309
Jesus Christ!

1710
01:38:35,591 --> 01:38:37,446
I just wanted to go home.

1711
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:39,267
But him, you know...

1712
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:41,637
he just lost it.

1713
01:38:41,703 --> 01:38:44,802
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1714
01:38:44,871 --> 01:38:46,278
He just snapped.

1715
01:38:46,343 --> 01:38:49,824
The funny thing is, this guy
could never even stand to see me work.

1716
01:38:49,896 --> 01:38:52,863
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1717
01:38:53,863 --> 01:38:55,357
Now look at him.

1718
01:38:55,431 --> 01:38:57,406
This guy's fuckin' drunker than hell.

1719
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,869
Which means he's human now.

1720
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:03,198
His wings have been cut off.

1721
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:11,398
The muse?

1722
01:39:11,463 --> 01:39:13,471
Oh, no way!

1723
01:39:13,544 --> 01:39:16,227
I haven't seen you...
You look terrific. Wow!

1724
01:39:16,295 --> 01:39:18,368
What's with the tits?
Can I...

1725
01:39:18,439 --> 01:39:20,611
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1726
01:39:23,848 --> 01:39:27,263
Tell me. Have you gone in
and come out through the archway yet?

1727
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:28,645
No!

1728
01:39:33,512 --> 01:39:34,886
He's back.

1729
01:39:57,256 --> 01:39:59,110
We were awaiting your arrival.

1730
01:39:59,176 --> 01:40:02,110
Bartleby, wait. Stop.
Listen to me.

1731
01:40:02,183 --> 01:40:04,801
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1732
01:40:04,871 --> 01:40:06,082
If you go back...

1733
01:40:06,919 --> 01:40:09,788
I've become aware of the repercussions.
I know what I'm doing.

1734
01:40:11,175 --> 01:40:12,801
You sick, twisted fuck!

1735
01:40:14,311 --> 01:40:15,522
Bethany.

1736
01:40:18,568 --> 01:40:21,764
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1737
01:40:21,831 --> 01:40:24,646
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1738
01:40:24,711 --> 01:40:27,646
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1739
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:30,687
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1740
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:35,015
While you never see your ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his new wife...

1741
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,730
and he is...

1742
01:40:40,775 --> 01:40:45,314
seeing you people every day on this
perfect world He created for you...

1743
01:40:45,383 --> 01:40:47,041
is a constant reminder...

1744
01:40:47,111 --> 01:40:50,046
that though my kind came first...

1745
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:52,126
your kind was most revered.

1746
01:40:53,319 --> 01:40:55,588
And while you know forgiveness...

1747
01:40:55,656 --> 01:40:57,510
we know only regret.

1748
01:40:58,536 --> 01:41:00,292
The lesson must be taught.

1749
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,214
All are accountable...

1750
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,490
even God.

1751
01:41:04,712 --> 01:41:06,817
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1752
01:41:06,887 --> 01:41:10,018
just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1753
01:41:11,207 --> 01:41:14,556
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1754
01:41:14,631 --> 01:41:16,060
will cease to be.

1755
01:41:16,135 --> 01:41:17,629
No. Hey. Hey!

1756
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:22,086
I can't let you do that,
Bartleby.

1757
01:41:22,151 --> 01:41:24,158
This has gone too far.

1758
01:41:26,055 --> 01:41:28,390
I might have to take you down.

1759
01:41:29,864 --> 01:41:31,620
It's okay. Shh.

1760
01:41:31,688 --> 01:41:33,214
I'll do it.

1761
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,654
My compatriot.

1762
01:41:40,936 --> 01:41:43,391
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1763
01:41:43,464 --> 01:41:44,674
He's weakened.

1764
01:41:44,743 --> 01:41:46,150
You're weak.

1765
01:41:46,215 --> 01:41:48,932
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1766
01:41:48,999 --> 01:41:51,104
a condition which carries
two liabilities...

1767
01:41:52,839 --> 01:41:54,563
a conscience...

1768
01:41:55,336 --> 01:41:56,710
and...

1769
01:41:59,591 --> 01:42:02,079
a short life span.

1770
01:42:02,152 --> 01:42:04,835
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1771
01:42:31,464 --> 01:42:33,319
He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1772
01:42:33,384 --> 01:42:35,588
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1773
01:42:36,903 --> 01:42:38,278
I can't believe this.

1774
01:42:38,343 --> 01:42:40,863
We're on the brink of nonexistence,
and God's still nowhere to be found.

1775
01:42:40,935 --> 01:42:43,902
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1776
01:42:50,504 --> 01:42:52,543
What the hell are you doing?

1777
01:42:52,615 --> 01:42:55,998
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1778
01:42:59,879 --> 01:43:02,694
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1779
01:43:02,759 --> 01:43:06,207
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1780
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:09,095
- or we can get makin' with the love.
- What did you say?

1781
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,167
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1782
01:43:11,239 --> 01:43:12,701
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1783
01:43:16,359 --> 01:43:19,229
That guy, the one they won't take
off life support... John Doe Jersey.

1784
01:43:19,304 --> 01:43:21,278
This is where he's at...
St. Michael's Hospital.

1785
01:43:22,759 --> 01:43:24,166
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1786
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:26,751
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1787
01:43:26,823 --> 01:43:29,190
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1788
01:43:29,256 --> 01:43:31,230
- Have you ever been there?
- Once, with this chick.

1789
01:43:31,303 --> 01:43:34,205
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1790
01:43:34,279 --> 01:43:36,068
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1791
01:43:39,335 --> 01:43:41,190
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1792
01:43:48,872 --> 01:43:51,839
Whatever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1793
01:43:51,911 --> 01:43:53,983
Bob, come with me.
Come on!

1794
01:43:54,055 --> 01:43:56,641
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1795
01:43:56,711 --> 01:43:58,850
I already did,
but it takes two of us!

1796
01:43:59,655 --> 01:44:01,794
<i>I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

1797
01:44:01,863 --> 01:44:03,586
<i>This is the apocalypse.</i>

1798
01:44:03,655 --> 01:44:06,274
<i>Please exit the hospital</i>
<i>in an orderly fashion.</i>

1799
01:44:06,344 --> 01:44:08,034
<i>Thank you.</i>

1800
01:44:22,824 --> 01:44:24,384
Hey, Big Bird!

1801
01:44:25,223 --> 01:44:26,849
Ready for the counting game?

1802
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:33,319
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1803
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,247
No more bullets.

1804
01:45:02,311 --> 01:45:04,416
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1805
01:45:04,487 --> 01:45:07,302
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1806
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:09,342
You just did him a favor,
stupid!

1807
01:45:54,183 --> 01:45:56,769
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1808
01:46:36,199 --> 01:46:38,534
Oh, Bartleby.

1809
01:46:38,599 --> 01:46:42,112
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1810
01:46:42,183 --> 01:46:44,190
Bow down, stupid!

1811
01:47:01,991 --> 01:47:03,846
I'm sorry.

1812
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:28,386
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1813
01:47:28,456 --> 01:47:32,067
would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1814
01:47:32,136 --> 01:47:34,110
What the fuck?

1815
01:47:40,007 --> 01:47:41,949
Thank you.

1816
01:48:12,456 --> 01:48:14,049
It never ends!

1817
01:48:33,255 --> 01:48:35,262
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1818
01:48:35,335 --> 01:48:37,724
What the fuck is this shit?

1819
01:48:37,799 --> 01:48:39,457
Who the fuck are you, lady?

1820
01:48:39,527 --> 01:48:41,894
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1821
01:48:41,959 --> 01:48:44,774
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1822
01:48:44,839 --> 01:48:47,687
What the fuck is this, <i>The Piano?</i>
Why ain't this broad talkin'?

1823
01:48:47,751 --> 01:48:52,869
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1824
01:48:52,936 --> 01:48:56,100
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fuckin' nuts?

1825
01:48:56,168 --> 01:48:59,015
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head?

1826
01:48:59,079 --> 01:49:00,989
Shh.

1827
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,505
Where was she?

1828
01:49:17,575 --> 01:49:20,031
Imprisoned in a body.

1829
01:49:20,103 --> 01:49:22,918
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1830
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,886
Hang on a minute.

1831
01:49:58,951 --> 01:50:00,806
You missed a bit.

1832
01:50:02,279 --> 01:50:05,094
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1833
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:07,526
You ready to make some of those
changes I been talking about?

1834
01:50:07,591 --> 01:50:08,704
We'll see.

1835
01:50:08,776 --> 01:50:10,270
Muse?

1836
01:50:10,344 --> 01:50:12,831
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1837
01:50:12,903 --> 01:50:15,075
you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1838
01:50:15,144 --> 01:50:17,959
First I gotta say good-bye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1839
01:50:18,024 --> 01:50:19,398
Oh, no.

1840
01:50:39,783 --> 01:50:42,150
Metatron, is she...

1841
01:50:42,216 --> 01:50:44,452
Afraid so.

1842
01:50:44,519 --> 01:50:48,349
One of the drawbacks to being a martyr
is that you have to die.

1843
01:50:48,423 --> 01:50:50,879
But no matter.

1844
01:51:00,008 --> 01:51:01,862
All is being taken care of.

1845
01:51:02,919 --> 01:51:04,294
How so?

1846
01:51:05,383 --> 01:51:08,350
Wax on, wax off.

1847
01:51:30,951 --> 01:51:32,031
How did I...

1848
01:51:32,103 --> 01:51:33,729
She can rebuild you.

1849
01:51:33,799 --> 01:51:35,326
She has the technology.

1850
01:51:35,399 --> 01:51:39,327
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1851
01:51:44,872 --> 01:51:45,951
That's...

1852
01:51:46,983 --> 01:51:49,667
A very relieved deity.

1853
01:51:51,367 --> 01:51:53,953
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come 'round.

1854
01:51:54,024 --> 01:51:56,358
Your kind always does.

1855
01:51:57,512 --> 01:51:59,879
You might want to
take good care of yourself.

1856
01:51:59,943 --> 01:52:02,626
We're gonna need you down the road.

1857
01:52:02,695 --> 01:52:05,062
I know.
I'm the last scion.

1858
01:52:07,623 --> 01:52:10,623
Well, you're half right.

1859
01:52:10,696 --> 01:52:13,510
You were the last scion.

1860
01:52:15,175 --> 01:52:16,550
But now...

1861
01:52:17,575 --> 01:52:19,036
this...

1862
01:52:19,751 --> 01:52:21,758
is the last scion.

1863
01:52:24,679 --> 01:52:26,534
I'm pregnant?

1864
01:52:28,776 --> 01:52:30,848
Can't put anything past you.

1865
01:52:34,023 --> 01:52:36,445
Take care of that parcel for us.

1866
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:40,295
She has a world of work
ahead of her.

1867
01:52:51,239 --> 01:52:53,214
Thank you for...

1868
01:52:53,288 --> 01:52:55,197
I don't know...

1869
01:52:55,271 --> 01:52:56,481
everything.

1870
01:53:00,071 --> 01:53:03,366
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1871
01:53:03,431 --> 01:53:07,326
most of it questioning your great plan,
and that'd be arrogant of me, I know.

1872
01:53:08,071 --> 01:53:10,111
But there is one I need to ask.

1873
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:13,663
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1874
01:53:15,559 --> 01:53:17,447
Why are we here?

1875
01:53:33,352 --> 01:53:36,166
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1876
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:45,248
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1877
01:53:45,959 --> 01:53:48,032
It was an honor.

1878
01:53:52,519 --> 01:53:55,334
You did so well.

1879
01:53:59,784 --> 01:54:02,599
I told you She was a woman.

1880
01:54:04,487 --> 01:54:06,756
She's not really a woman.

1881
01:54:06,823 --> 01:54:09,190
She's not really anything.

1882
01:54:09,255 --> 01:54:10,848
She's something, all right.

1883
01:54:12,008 --> 01:54:14,146
Crisis of faith over?

1884
01:54:14,215 --> 01:54:17,030
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1885
01:54:17,095 --> 01:54:18,950
When it rains, it pours.

1886
01:54:19,015 --> 01:54:21,154
Are you saying you believe?

1887
01:54:22,408 --> 01:54:24,317
But I have a good idea.

1888
01:54:24,392 --> 01:54:25,766
Yes!

1889
01:54:29,544 --> 01:54:31,399
The Man was right about you.

1890
01:54:31,464 --> 01:54:34,366
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell Him so.

1891
01:54:35,239 --> 01:54:37,094
And if you clean up your language...

1892
01:54:37,159 --> 01:54:39,526
I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1893
01:54:39,592 --> 01:54:41,118
Thanks.

1894
01:54:42,599 --> 01:54:44,933
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1895
01:54:47,655 --> 01:54:49,346
Rufus.

1896
01:55:14,664 --> 01:55:16,998
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1897
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:23,495
Youse guys
wanna hear something sick?

1898
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:26,375
I got half a stalk
when she kissed me.

1899
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,774
I couldn't help it.
The bitch was hot.

1900
01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:33,214
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1901
01:55:33,287 --> 01:55:34,716
You're pregnant?

1902
01:55:36,328 --> 01:55:39,710
You know, when you're pregnant you can
have sex until the third trimester.

1903
01:55:39,783 --> 01:55:41,638
I'll keep that in mind.

1904
02:03:02,823 --> 02:03:06,566
<i>So, that would make Bethany</i>
<i>part black?</i>
