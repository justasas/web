1
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:11,096
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving force
behind Catholicism WOW! Cardinal Glick.

2
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:20,339
Thank you.

3
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:22,349
Now we all know
how the majority...

4
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,681
and the media in this country...

5
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:27,016
view the Catholic church.

6
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:30,182
They think of us as a passé,
archaic institution.

7
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:33,489
People find the Bible obtuse...

8
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,051
even hokey.

9
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,222
Now, in an effort to disprove
all that...

10
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:41,029
the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

11
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:43,070
both of faith and of style.

12
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:46,203
For example, the crucifix.

13
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:48,902
While it has been a time-honored symbol
of our faith...

14
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:52,036
Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

15
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:53,705
this highly recognizable...

16
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:56,079
yet wholly depressing image...

17
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,345
of our Lord, crucified.

18
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,786
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

19
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,721
He came to help us out.

20
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,488
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

21
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,326
that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring Sigil.

22
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:14,328
So, it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

23
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,064
of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! Campaign...

24
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:20,574
will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

25
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:21,869
"The Buddy Christ."

26
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:34,746
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

27
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:37,222
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

28
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,690
But look at it.

29
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,591
Doesn't it pop?

30
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,288
Buddy Christ.

31
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:44,488
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

32
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,465
Let me get this straight.

33
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:50,129
You don't believe in God
because of <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>

34
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:52,229
No, <i>Through the Looking Glass.</i>

35
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,240
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

36
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:56,538
that's an indictment
of organized religion.

37
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,636
The Walrus, with his girth
and his good nature...

38
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:00,738
he obviously represents either Buddha...

39
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:03,841
or with his tusks,
the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

40
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,909
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

41
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:08,717
Now, the Carpenter, which is
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

42
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,419
who was raised a carpenter's son,
he represents the Western religions.

43
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,961
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

44
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:17,589
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

45
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:21,431
and then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

46
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:24,437
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

47
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:28,271
that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

48
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:31,072
ensures the destruction
of one's inner-being.

49
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,238
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

50
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,147
by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

51
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:39,584
out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

52
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,646
who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

53
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:46,625
and says, " Do it...
Do it and I'll fuckin' spank you!"

54
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:48,059
Oh, Jesus!

55
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,724
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

56
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,124
What have I been doing
with my life?

57
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,595
- What am I?
- Yeah, I know.

58
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,470
Listen, my advice to you...

59
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,101
you take this money that you've
been collecting for your parish...

60
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,374
go get yourself a nice dress,
fix yourself up.

61
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,678
Find some man... find some woman... you
can connect with, even for a moment...

62
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,844
'cause that's really all life is,
Sister... a series of moments.

63
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:15,922
Why don't you seize yours?

64
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,559
That a girl.

65
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,503
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

66
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:33,404
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

67
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,307
You've been in His presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

68
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,608
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy, man.

69
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,116
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

70
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:45,118
Here's what I don't get about you.

71
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:47,950
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

72
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,490
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

73
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,752
Look at them.

74
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:55,694
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

75
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:59,699
forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

76
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,029
See those two?

77
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:04,401
What that guy doesn't know is that the
girl cheated on him while she was away.

78
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:06,406
- She did?
- Twice.

79
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,635
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

80
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,644
'cause they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

81
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:13,975
I like that.

82
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:16,346
I wish they all could
feel that way more often.

83
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,580
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

84
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,088
You call me, you tell me
it's important.

85
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:25,614
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

86
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,752
We're going home.

87
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:30,092
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

88
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:38,033
Take it and quit leering at me. People
will think I just broke up with you.

89
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:41,541
- You said we're going home, didn't you?
- Read.

90
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,602
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

91
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,147
And?

92
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,911
You have to keep reading.

93
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:53,112
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church..."

94
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:55,587
<i>... is the kickoff of a new campaign</i>
<i>which seeks to bring...</i>

95
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:57,487
<i>Catholicism into the mainstream.</i>

96
00:06:57,558 --> 00:07:00,083
<i>With a papal sanction,</i>
<i>the archway entrance...</i>

97
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,629
<i>of the century-old Jersey shore</i>
<i>house of worship...</i>

98
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:05,097
<i>will serve as a passageway</i>
<i>of plenary indulgence...</i>

99
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,499
<i>a little-known Catholic belief offering</i>
<i>all that passes through its arches...</i>

100
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,434
<i>a morally clean slate.</i>

101
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:13,667
<i>For Sunday News Brief,</i>
<i>I'm Grant Hicks.</i>

102
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:17,233
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

103
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,803
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

104
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:23,509
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

105
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:27,350
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

106
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:30,515
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

107
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,388
What then, Hell?
Fuck that.

108
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,394
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

109
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:37,898
and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

110
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:40,433
If we die with clean souls,
there's no way they can keep us out.

111
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,629
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

112
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:47,105
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

113
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:50,268
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

114
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,278
He can't keep us out anymore.

115
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,280
Once we're back in,
it'll be forgive and forget.

116
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,441
But this thing,
this is Church law.

117
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,382
It's not Divine Mandate.

118
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:02,047
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:05,559
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:09,187
by the Son of God
before He left was...

121
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:12,460
- "Whatever you hold true on Earth..."
- "I'll hold true in Heaven."

122
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,593
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

123
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,330
This thing has a papal sanction...

124
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:20,306
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

125
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,308
never yielded positive results.

126
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,469
You can't be anal retentive
if you don't have an anus.

127
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,809
Outstanding work!

128
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,782
There's just one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

129
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,977
This is gonna help us get back
on His good side.

130
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,213
What?

131
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:36,154
Here. I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

132
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,690
"Mooby, the Golden Calf.

133
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:40,522
Creating an Empire
Out of Simplicity."

134
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:42,494
I wanna hit 'em.

135
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,293
You really are
just a simple creature.

136
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:47,664
We finally find a way back
and you want to jeopardize that...

137
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,828
because you've got a soft spot
for the good ol' days.

138
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,362
What better way to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

139
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:54,931
thanks to you?

140
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:58,069
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

141
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:01,046
Killing spree?
I'm talking about Divine Justice here.

142
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:04,448
I'm talking about reigning down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

143
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:07,146
He's all about that.
I know He'd want this done.

144
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,917
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
since you quit.

145
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,582
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

146
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:14,526
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

147
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,223
If I'm wrong... which I'm not...
it's not gonna matter.

148
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:19,562
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

149
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:22,466
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

150
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:26,233
Well, He does hate competition.
I will say that.

151
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:28,605
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

152
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:30,701
Where is this church
we have to go to?

153
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,077
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

154
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:36,116
Last four days on Earth?

155
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:38,549
If I had a dick,
I'd go get laid.

156
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,746
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

157
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,686
Let's kill people.

158
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,348
Oh, not you.

159
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:54,825

at the New Jersey shore last Tuesday...

168
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:19,586
lies in critical, but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

169
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,457
He lacks identification...

170
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,021
and police have had no luck tracking
down any possible family.

171
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:29,502
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

172
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,801
to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

173
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:35,603
asking that Catholics
all over the country...

174
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,804
join in this protest against euthanasia.

175
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,306
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

176
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:48,847
We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty...

177
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:50,447
Maker of Heaven and Earth.

178
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,618
<i>We believe in Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>His only Son, Our Lord...</i>

179
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:56,560
Choose life!

180
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,088
You're gonna burn in Hell,
ya fuckin' baby killer!

181
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,964
Holy shit. It's the pope.

182
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,435
- Huh?
- Where?

183
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:04,835
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:17,811
Jesus! You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

185
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,012
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

186
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:22,954
At least you have an excuse. You're
Jewish. You don't know any better.

187
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:26,515
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

188
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:28,653
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

189
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,094
I went to church.

190
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:32,098
That still kills me,
you and church.

191
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,693
If only they knew your weekly tithing
came from a Planned Parenthood check.

192
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:38,203
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

193
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:43,102
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

194
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:46,408
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

195
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,914
I don't think I have any faith left.

196
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:53,119
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

197
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:58,591
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have baby-sat for in high school.

198
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:01,025
The point is,
he told me something.

199
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,655
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

200
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:06,700
When you're young, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

201
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,701
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

202
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,794
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it anymore.

203
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,704
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

204
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,674
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

205
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,971
In more ways than one.

206
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:21,481
You need to get laid, Bethany Sloane.
You need a man, if only for 10 minutes.

207
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:24,381
It's been my experience that
the average male is never a man...

208
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,851
not even for ten minutes
in his entire life span.

209
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,855
That sounds militant. Are you thinking
of joining the other side?

210
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,823
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

211
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:35,089
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

212
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:37,096
I think God is dead.

213
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:39,598
The sign of a true Catholic.

214
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:53,410
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

215
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,175
I'm from the EPA.

216
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,184
We're checking on possible
freon leaks.

217
00:12:59,253 --> 00:13:01,585
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

218
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,350
Yes, we have central air.

219
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:05,051
In every room?

220
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,922
Except the bathroom.
Why?

221
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,019
Well, you do know
what that means, don't you?

222
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:21,966
Move!

223
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:32,211
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

224
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:35,250
than central air.

225
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:38,117
Pick that up.

226
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:45,393
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

227
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:48,367
Now, if I remember
the protocol correctly...

228
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,868
the powers...

229
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:53,338
will attempt to contact
the last scion.

230
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,568
I need you three...

231
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:58,770
to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

232
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:03,909
Go.

233
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:40,585
Behold the Metatron!

234
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:43,452
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true God!

235
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:46,220
Behold the Metatron!

236
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:50,354
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true God!

237
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,814
Sweet Jesus!
Do you have to use the whole can?

238
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:12,909
Who the fuck are you and
what the fuck are you doing in my room?

239
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:15,819
I'm the one that's soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

240
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,857
Stupid fucking...

241
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:20,257
Get the fuck out of here,
now!

242
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:22,955
Or you'll do what exactly?

243
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,225
Hit me with that fish?

244
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,096
Now, just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

245
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:35,767
Jesus wept!

246
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:37,606
Look at my suit.

247
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:41,510
Just take whatever you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

248
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:45,985
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

249
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,678
See?

250
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:55,192
I'm as anatomically-impaired
as a Ken doll.

251
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:58,458
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

252
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,932
You bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

253
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,698
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

254
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,363
What are you?

255
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,465
I'm pissed off is what I am.

256
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:12,603
Do you drench everyone who comes in your
room with flame-retardant chemicals?

257
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,546
No wonder you're single.

258
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,778
Stand back.

259
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,121
As I was sayin'...

260
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,430
prior to your fire-fighting episode...

261
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,967
I am the Metatron.

262
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,503
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell?

263
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:47,713
You people.

264
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,978
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

265
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:55,014
I am a seraphim.

266
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,689
The highest choir of angels.

267
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:02,928
You do know what an angel is,
don't you?

268
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:08,628
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

269
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:12,934
Any documented occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

270
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,735
they're speaking to me.

271
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:17,003
Or they're talking to themselves.

272
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,206
Why doesn't God speak for Himself?

273
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,449
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

274
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,750
human beings have neither the aural,
nor the psychological capacity...

275
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:33,282
to withstand the awesome power
of God's true voice.

276
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,796
Were you to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

277
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:39,730
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

278
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,634
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

279
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:48,038
Aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?

280
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:52,778
You want more proof?

281
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,541
Fine.

282
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,741
How about tequila?

283
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,992
- Where the hell are we?
- Only place you can go for good tequila.

284
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,154
<i>Dos tequilas, por favor,</i>
and an empty glass.

285
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:13,928
We're in Mexico?

286
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,435
Actually, we're in a franchised
Mexican family eatery...

287
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,733
down the street
from your apartment, but...

288
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,670
it's impressive nonetheless.

289
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:25,405
You don't mind I lost the wings, do you?
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

290
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,276
What do you want with me?

291
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,752
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

292
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,119
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

293
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,556
Noah was a drunk.
Look what he accomplished.

294
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:43,528
And no one's asking you to build an ark.
All you gotta do is go to New Jersey...

295
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:46,157
and visit a small church
on a very important day.

296
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,899
New Jersey?

297
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:55,199
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

298
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,800
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

299
00:18:57,878 --> 00:18:59,937
What's the fine print?

300
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,946
Stop a couple of angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

301
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,212
Wait, wait, wait.
Repeat that.

302
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:09,551
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

303
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:12,786
and thus negating all existence.

304
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,157
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

305
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:17,059
You might want to clarify that.

306
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:22,496
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

307
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,696
And His wrath was bore...

308
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:28,002
by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

309
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:30,236
When Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed...

310
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,800
that was Loki.

311
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:35,939
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

312
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,746
that was Loki...
and he was good at what he did.

313
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,582
But one day...

314
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:43,623
he refused to bear God's wrath
any longer.

315
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:47,191
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

316
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,319
a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

317
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,522
Grigori?

318
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:53,828
One of the choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

319
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,333
Guess what they do.

320
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,839
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt...

321
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,397
The Tenth Plague.

322
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:05,274
Tell a person that you're the Metatron
and they stare at you blankly.

323
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,438
Mention something out of
a Charlton Heston movie...

324
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:09,675
and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

325
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,684
May I continue uninterrupted?

326
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,845
Once he's done with the firstborn...

327
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,619
Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

328
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:21,024
And over many rounds...

329
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,221
they get into
this discussion about...

330
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:25,196
whether or not murder
in the name of God is okay.

331
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,630
And in the end...

332
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,636
Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

333
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:33,036
and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

334
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,698
So...

335
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:38,576
very inebriated...

336
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:41,307
Loki tells God he quits...

337
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:43,679
throws down his fiery sword...

338
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,684
and gives Him the finger.

339
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:48,949
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

340
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:52,082
God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

341
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,626
Hence all the spitting.

342
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,122
So, for their insolence...

343
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:59,188
God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

344
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,826
would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

345
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:03,767
- Were they sent to Hell?
- Worse.

346
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:05,771
Wisconsin...

347
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,774
for the entire span
of human history.

348
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:12,005
And when the world ends, they'll have to
sit outside the gates for all eternity.

349
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,069
And this has what to do with me?

350
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:18,675
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

351
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:21,346
that would allow them
to reenter Heaven.

352
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:24,117
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

353
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,091
It's not that simple.

354
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,255
If they get in,
they will have reversed God's decree.

355
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:34,867
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

356
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:40,063
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

357
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,803
function solely on one principle...

358
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:46,903
God is infallible.

359
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,914
To prove Him wrong...

360
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:51,951
would undo reality
and everything that is.

361
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:54,919
Up would become down,
black would become white.

362
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:57,957
Existence would become nothingness.

363
00:21:58,024 --> 00:21:59,616
In essence...

364
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,162
if they're allowed to enter
that church...

365
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,990
they'll unmake the world.

366
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:10,969
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

367
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:13,801
- Why doesn't God do something about it?
- He could.

368
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,002
But He'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

369
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:18,704
Why me?

370
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:21,076
Because of who you are.

371
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:23,012
And who am I?

372
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,210
The girl in the pj's!

373
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:28,982
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

374
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:31,080
I'm gonna have to pass.

375
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:33,152
I beg your pardon?

376
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,663
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

377
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,358
When my husband decided...

378
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:41,866
he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear his children...

379
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,232
where was God?

380
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:46,934
To Hell with Him.

381
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:51,239
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

382
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:53,609
just because you've got a grudge
against your Creator.

383
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,114
So you lost the ability
to make life.

384
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:59,674
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

385
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,051
by acting like one
and protecting it...

386
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:04,056
saving it!

387
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,527
But I can't make you.

388
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:12,257
However, if you should decide
to stop being selfish...

389
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:14,823
and accept your responsibility...

390
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:16,801
you won't be alone.

391
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,235
You'll have support.

392
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,398
What? More angels?

393
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:22,065
Prophets.

394
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,036
In a manner of speaking.
Two of 'em.

395
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,107
The one who speaks...

396
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:35,746
and he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not...

397
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:37,847
will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

398
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:39,414
The other one...

399
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:42,156
well, he's the quiet type.

400
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:43,490
Look, I've gotta go.

401
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,895
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

402
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:51,531
What's He like?

403
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:52,571
God?

404
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,302
Lonely...

405
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:58,276
but funny.

406
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,506
He's got a great sense of humor.

407
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,514
Take sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

408
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:05,244
than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

409
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,252
Sex is a joke in Heaven?

410
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,154
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

411
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:12,486
I'll see ya.

412
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:18,381
Snootch to the motherfucking nootch!

413
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:57,922
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

414
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:01,526
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

415
00:27:01,594 --> 00:27:05,257
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pube-less asses!

416
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:13,538
I don't know what to say
or think, except...

417
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:15,574
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

418
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:18,873
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

419
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:21,846
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

420
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:24,440
I don't know who those kids were,
but they would have kicked yours...

421
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,452
and Lunchbox's asses
if I hadn't represented.

422
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,353
Thanks for being
out here so late.

423
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:32,618
Wait a minute.
Are you protestors?

424
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,684
You mean those dickheads with the signs
and pictures of dead babies?

425
00:27:35,762 --> 00:27:38,230
Shit no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

426
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:40,266
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

427
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,324
But what are you doing
hanging around?

428
00:27:42,402 --> 00:27:44,427
We're here to pick up chicks.

429
00:27:44,504 --> 00:27:46,233
Excuse me?

430
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:49,469
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

431
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,306
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

432
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,306
Right.

433
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,179
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

434
00:27:58,251 --> 00:28:00,151
- I think.
- Wait a second.

435
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,814
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

436
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,981
What the shit is that?

437
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,959
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

438
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:10,996
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

439
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:15,823
Now how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

440
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,427
I'm goin' back to Jersey
and startin' up the business again.

441
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:22,338
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

442
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:25,002
<i>Prophets. Two of em.</i>

443
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,775
- You know what I'm sayin', Silent Bob?
- You gotta be kidding me.

444
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:31,544
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

445
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:34,246
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

446
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,753
Try it on.

447
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:41,123
It's a lot more compact than the flaming
sword, but not nearly as impressive.

448
00:28:41,194 --> 00:28:44,493
It doesn't have that
"Wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

449
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:48,694
How am I supposed to strike fear into
hearts of the wicked with this thing?

450
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,860
Look at this.

451
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:54,635
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

452
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:57,699
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

453
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,972
You got to stand there and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

454
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:01,980
I had to do all the work.

455
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:05,313
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

456
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:07,979
I rained down sulfur.
There's a subtle difference.

457
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:09,783
Okay, I'm sure.

458
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:13,917
Fuck you. Any moron with a pack
of matches can set a fire.

459
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:15,927
Raining down sulfur
is like an endurance trial.

460
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:18,657
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can engage in...

461
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:20,289
next to soccer.

462
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,499
I'll take this one.

463
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:40,407
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or are you gonna do us both?

464
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,886
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

465
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,980
You're a man of principle.

466
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:48,687
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

467
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:51,252
Some fuck named John Hughes.

468
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,026
<i>Sixteen Candles</i> John Hughes?

469
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:57,302
You know that guy too?
That fuckin' guy.

470
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,134
He made this flick <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>
Not bad.

471
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:02,436
There's tits in it, but no bush.

472
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:05,136
But Ebert over here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

473
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:07,611
because he's like in love
with this John Hughes guy.

474
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,841
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

475
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:14,376
Fuckin' <i>Breakfast Club,</i> where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

476
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:18,220
Fuckin' <i>Weird Science,</i> where this babe
wants to undress and get down...

477
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,488
but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

478
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:25,725
And then <i>Pretty in Pink,</i> which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

479
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:29,165
because when the redhead hooks up
with her dream guy...

480
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:32,762
he starts sobbin' like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

481
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,070
And there's nothing worse
than watchin' a fuckin' fat man weep.

482
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:38,110
What exactly brought you
to Illinois?

483
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:42,079
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

484
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:46,278
where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

485
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:49,321
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fuckin' harsh.

486
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,686
But best of all...

487
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:52,884
there was no one dealin', man.

488
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:55,427
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

489
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:57,793
if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

490
00:30:57,864 --> 00:31:01,027
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

491
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,194
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

492
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,171
There is no Shermer, Illinois.

493
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,208
Movies are fuckin' bullshit.

494
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:13,268
- When are you going back to New Jersey?
- This broad asks a lot of questions.

495
00:31:13,346 --> 00:31:16,509
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

496
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,447
Yeah. So you do anal?

497
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:21,043
Is it true that chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

498
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,020
I didn't ask you out for sex.

499
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,023
I'll take head.

500
00:31:27,493 --> 00:31:31,020
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this.

501
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,533
I think I should go with you.

502
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:38,536
Like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

503
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:42,607
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

504
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:45,508
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

505
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:46,670
Really?

506
00:31:46,746 --> 00:31:48,839
You're going to lead me somewhere.

507
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:50,576
Me lead you?

508
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,619
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

509
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:56,678
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

510
00:31:56,756 --> 00:32:00,817
Someone told me I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I was supposed to go.

511
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:02,884
What the hell are you babbling about?

512
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,658
We saved your ass from
some angry fuckin' dwarves...

513
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:09,497
and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

514
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:13,200
Do you believe in God?

515
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:17,939
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

516
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,944
and we gotta get the one Jesus freak?

517
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:21,274
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Wait.

518
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:23,042
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

519
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,416
Pay?

520
00:32:28,087 --> 00:32:30,055
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

521
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:34,218
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

522
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:37,785
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

523
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:40,264
and we're in that fucked-up bar!

524
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,857
What about sex?

525
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,265
No sex.

526
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:49,206
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

527
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:52,767
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

528
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,870
In that highly unlikely situation?

529
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,445
Yeah, sure.

530
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:02,579
She's a slut.

531
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,483
All right.

532
00:33:08,594 --> 00:33:10,061
But I get to drive.

533
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:21,639
What gear are you in?

534
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:22,901
Gear?

535
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:34,445
What do I know about shiftin'?

536
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,718
Like I ever drove before.

537
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,462
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

538
00:33:46,532 --> 00:33:47,931
New Jersey.

539
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,127
Maybe you're wrong
about this slaughter thing.

540
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:54,332
How can you be sure what incurs the
Lord's wrath these days? Times change.

541
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:58,138
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a Hell-worthy trespass.

542
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,678
The major sins never change.

543
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:06,847
Besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker from a mile away.

544
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,784
Bet on it.

545
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:11,584
This from the guy who still owes me
ten bucks over that bet...

546
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:14,854
about which was gonna be the bigger
movie... <i>ET</i> or <i>Krush Groove.</i>

547
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,021
Fuck you, man,
'cause time's gonna tell on that one.

548
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,162
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

549
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,795
Insinuating, no.

550
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:29,432
Flat-out telling you.

551
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,538
Right there.
There's one.

552
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,014
So? They're kissing.

553
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,050
Adultery.

554
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,415
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

555
00:34:40,486 --> 00:34:42,454
You are just a simple creature.

556
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:45,115
- Am I right?
- I happen to know the truth.

557
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:48,217
I'm not gonna tell you. I want to see
how boned up on the job you are.

558
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,092
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

559
00:34:51,163 --> 00:34:53,859
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

560
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,231
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

561
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,066
Okay. It's a good thing
you were never...

562
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,130
the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

563
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:06,076
"No married man kisses
his wife like that"? Are you stoned?

564
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,237
Excuse me.

565
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:11,506
Are you married?

566
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:13,381
Why?

567
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:14,919
I'm just curious.

568
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,285
What do you think?

569
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:28,325
- What?
- To her?

570
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:30,460
- What?
- Are you married to her?

571
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:33,972
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

572
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,871
Why?

573
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,680
<i>Whose house</i>

574
00:36:22,755 --> 00:36:25,223
<i>Run's house</i>

575
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,919
<i>I said, whose house</i>

576
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:29,927
<i>Run's house</i>

577
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:32,122
<i>Whose house</i>
<i>Say what</i>

578
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:34,530
<i>Run's house</i>
<i>Say what</i>

579
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,431
<i>Martin</i>

580
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:43,332
She's fuckin' pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

581
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,400
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

582
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:47,673
Let me know how she is.

583
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,614
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

584
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,714
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

585
00:36:53,786 --> 00:36:57,051
but being that I've decided to go home,
and not to New Jersey...

586
00:36:57,123 --> 00:36:59,614
sorry for the inconvenience
and good-bye.

587
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:01,859
You're breaking up with us?

588
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:05,528
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

589
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,590
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

590
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:11,966
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

591
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:15,165
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fuckin' sky.

592
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:26,814
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky.

593
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,495
No heartbeat.

594
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:45,162
Think someone threw him out of a plane
with a message written on him...

595
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:46,761
like in <i>Con Air?</i>

596
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,535
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

597
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:52,270
<i>- Con Air?</i> Con Shit.
- Kill it!

598
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:55,438
- Sounds familiar.
- Jesus, are you okay?

599
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:57,607
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

600
00:37:57,683 --> 00:37:59,947
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!

601
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:02,886
What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

602
00:38:02,955 --> 00:38:07,051
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

603
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:09,594
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

604
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,426
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

605
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,958
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand?

606
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:20,335
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find my own threads?

607
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,472
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

608
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:28,944
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside of your armor.

609
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:31,346
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

610
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,746
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

611
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,288
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

612
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,325
the impact with which you hit
the asphalt would have liquefied you.

613
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:42,155
Death is a worry of the living.

614
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:45,720
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

615
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:48,665
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

616
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:49,758
I died.

617
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:52,065
Christ told me the secret
to the resurrection once.

618
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:55,732
We were at this wedding in Caanan.
I got drunk and forgot it.

619
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:57,571
Wait, wait, wait.

620
00:38:57,643 --> 00:38:59,543
Christ?

621
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:01,705
You knew Christ?

622
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,839
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

623
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,747
Let me guess.

624
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:08,343
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

625
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,253
I'm a man, just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

626
00:39:11,323 --> 00:39:12,950
At least I was a man.

627
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:16,153
Been dead nearly 2,000 years.
Here, check this out.

628
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:20,493
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rockin' the ganj.

629
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,761
It's not a joint.

630
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:25,133
I can't read this.

631
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:30,301
It's Aramaic. It says,
"Rufus, see you in two years. Jesus."

632
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:33,504
Freaked me out because He basically
told me when my number was up.

633
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,412
Took all the flavor out of the
remaining years. We gotta get moving.

634
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:40,145
Let's say we continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit. Come on.

635
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:42,779
I'm starvin'.
Back off, Kato.

636
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:44,117
Wait a second!

637
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:47,916
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

638
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:50,052
and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

639
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:53,121
I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

640
00:39:53,198 --> 00:39:56,634
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where the hell you came from.

641
00:39:56,702 --> 00:39:58,636
Me? I came from Heaven.

642
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:00,228
Now let's start walkin'.

643
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:03,139
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

644
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:07,440
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

645
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:09,777
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

646
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:16,650
What the hell's an apostle?

647
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:41,676
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

648
00:40:41,747 --> 00:40:44,011
She's already met the prophets...

649
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,210
and the apostle's with them?

650
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:51,418
I think that our best course
of action...

651
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,017
is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

652
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:59,690
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

653
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,961
well, I'm left with no choice...

654
00:41:04,036 --> 00:41:08,097
but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

655
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,603
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

656
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:19,149
I appreciate the loan, brother.
You can have that back.

657
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:22,585
Man, I remember when all we used to have
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

658
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:25,122
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

659
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,353
Now, how 'bout you start explaining
some things, like for starters...

660
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:29,860
how did you know
where to find us?

661
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:32,192
Do you know what the dead do
with most of their time?

662
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:35,131
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

663
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,827
I can't wait to die.

664
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:38,733
And why are you watching me?

665
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:41,398
Because you're the one who's gonna
help me get some changes made...

666
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:43,168
in that book
you put so much stock in.

667
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:45,574
<i>- Hustler?</i>
- The Bible!

668
00:41:45,644 --> 00:41:48,977
- What's your beef with the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

669
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,642
Neither are any of us, but you
don't hear us bitchin' and moanin'.

670
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,175
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th Apostle.

671
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:00,818
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th Apostle.

672
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,657
But you heard of
the other 12 Apostles.

673
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,358
They were all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

674
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:09,958
And why is that?
'Cause I'm a black man.

675
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:12,094
But you know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

676
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:16,631
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing your faith on.

677
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:20,269
- What's that?
- Jesus wasn't white. Jesus was black.

678
00:42:20,345 --> 00:42:21,505
I don't buy it.

679
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,778
If that's true, why did He get
written about and you were left out?

680
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:28,081
Well, He is the Son of God.

681
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:30,314
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

682
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:33,187
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

683
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:36,887
Leaving me out is okay 'cause you
still got 12 white boys to choose from.

684
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:40,591
- Are you gonna listen to this shit?
- That's what people of Antioch said...

685
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,497
right before they stoned my ass.

686
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:43,728
You were martyred?

687
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,736
That's one way of puttin' it.

688
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:48,830
Another way is to say I was bludgeoned
to shit by big fucking rocks.

689
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:51,705
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit...

690
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,075
life eternal,
a place in God's Heaven.

691
00:42:54,146 --> 00:42:56,706
But as soon as you hear
that you're gettin' this good shit...

692
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,477
from a black Jesus, ya freak.

693
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,814
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

694
00:43:00,886 --> 00:43:05,550
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't be your savior.

695
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,955
You gonna eat that hash brown?

696
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,960
So, you went to Heaven?

697
00:43:10,028 --> 00:43:13,293
Damn right I went to Heaven!
That's the least He could do.

698
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:16,801
In the three years I followed His ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

699
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:20,032
Hell no.
And I was in my prime.

700
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:22,573
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

701
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,235
not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

702
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,244
She had a thing for dark meat,
if you follow me.

703
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:30,543
Maybe this is just me talking,
but if I were in Heaven...

704
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:33,551
I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as they got the message right.

705
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,746
The message is what counts.

706
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,621
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be colorblind.

707
00:43:39,691 --> 00:43:42,751
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

708
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,762
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

709
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,561
That's why I'm gonna help you stop those
angels from gettin' into that church...

710
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:51,228
in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

711
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:54,067
How do you know about that,
the angels?

712
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:57,267
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

713
00:43:57,342 --> 00:44:01,642
When you were five, you let a kid
from next door piss on your hand.

714
00:44:01,713 --> 00:44:05,114
You did that shit?
You're nasty.

715
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,709
I never told anybody about that.

716
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:09,481
Neither did he.

717
00:44:09,555 --> 00:44:12,388
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

718
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:15,153
His name was Brian Johnson.

719
00:44:15,227 --> 00:44:17,354
Your exploits,
no matter how inane...

720
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,488
are well documented in Heaven.

721
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:21,396
Probably Hell too.

722
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:28,232
Where are you going?

723
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:30,138
Tell me somethin' about me.

724
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,201
You masturbate more than anyone
on the planet.

725
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:36,145
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

726
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,683
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

727
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,955
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

728
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,996
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

729
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,692
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
God even existed.

730
00:44:54,766 --> 00:44:58,258
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

731
00:44:58,337 --> 00:45:02,205
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

732
00:45:02,274 --> 00:45:07,007
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

733
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,676
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

734
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:18,448
Where did those two assholes go?

735
00:45:36,008 --> 00:45:38,033
What are you doing?

736
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,135
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

737
00:45:40,212 --> 00:45:42,203
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

738
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,613
We gotta get movin'.
How can we get to Jersey?

739
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:46,708
We'll take the train.
I'll call for reservations.

740
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:46,511
I thought she looked familiar.

741
00:46:46,578 --> 00:46:48,205
- Who?
- Serendipity.

742
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:02,618
<i>Morning, shoppers.</i>

743
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,457
Good morning.

744
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,798
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

745
00:47:09,134 --> 00:47:10,726
We creamed 'em.

746
00:47:13,405 --> 00:47:16,067
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me...

747
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,544
Do I smell onions?

748
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:28,350
Excuse me.

749
00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:34,248
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

750
00:47:35,193 --> 00:47:38,128
You may proceed, <i>mon ami.</i>

751
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,761
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

752
00:47:43,835 --> 00:47:46,770
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

753
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:48,430
Oh, come on!

754
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,677
Relax. I'm doing it.

755
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,971
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

756
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:02,452
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher in 1989.

757
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:05,285
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991.

758
00:48:05,357 --> 00:48:09,123
Broadcast nationally
as the "Mooby Fun-Time Hour."

759
00:48:09,194 --> 00:48:13,688
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

760
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,758
16 records,
8 prime-time specials...

761
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:22,432
and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

762
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:26,466
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

763
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:29,105
dubbed "Mooby World."

764
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:31,513
Did I miss anything?

765
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,346
You forgot <i>Mooby Magazine.</i>

766
00:48:33,418 --> 00:48:34,851
Damn it!

767
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,649
Is there a point to this?

768
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:40,487
You and your board are idolaters.

769
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:45,394
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

770
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:49,090
That's you.

771
00:48:50,335 --> 00:48:52,530
Do you know much about voodoo?

772
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:57,304
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

773
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:00,105
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

774
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:02,169
the most well-known of which...

775
00:49:02,247 --> 00:49:03,771
is the voodoo doll.

776
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,316
You see...

777
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:16,684
a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

778
00:49:16,761 --> 00:49:18,888
to various pokes and prods.

779
00:49:18,964 --> 00:49:23,094
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

780
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,726
Call security, now!

781
00:49:29,274 --> 00:49:32,141
All lines are currently down.

782
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,610
- I'm gonna have to apologize...
- Would you knock it off?

783
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:37,147
You're doing it again.
Stop. What did we talk about?

784
00:49:38,283 --> 00:49:41,650
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

785
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,688
which draws worship
from the Lord.

786
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:46,053
You have broken
the First Commandment.

787
00:49:46,124 --> 00:49:49,116
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one of you...

788
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,958
passes for a decent human being.

789
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,467
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

790
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,469
Like you, Mr. Burton.

791
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:02,029
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years 8 times.

792
00:50:02,107 --> 00:50:04,337
You even had sex
with her best friend...

793
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:08,743
while you were supposed to be home
watching the kids.

794
00:50:08,813 --> 00:50:12,305
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

795
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,510
Mr. Newman.

796
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:16,315
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

797
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,686
and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

798
00:50:18,757 --> 00:50:21,282
to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

799
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,987
just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

800
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,428
when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

801
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:30,699
She killed herself
three months later.

802
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:33,704
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

803
00:50:33,772 --> 00:50:35,706
Very compassionate.

804
00:50:35,774 --> 00:50:38,868
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

805
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:42,277
and used the profits
from the sale of her home...

806
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:46,181
to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

807
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,946
Heavens.

808
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:50,783
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

809
00:50:50,855 --> 00:50:54,518
to have sex
with an eleven-year-old boy.

810
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,653
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

811
00:50:57,729 --> 00:51:00,493
from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

812
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:02,965
because it was... survey says...

813
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,301
less costly.

814
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:09,363
You, on the other hand...

815
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,705
are an innocent.

816
00:51:11,776 --> 00:51:13,641
You lead a good life.

817
00:51:13,712 --> 00:51:14,804
Good for you.

818
00:51:15,714 --> 00:51:18,774
But you, Mr. Whitland...

819
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,818
you have more skeletons
in your closet...

820
00:51:20,885 --> 00:51:22,819
than this assembled party.

821
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:25,583
I cannot even mention them aloud.

822
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:33,056
You're his father,
you sick fuck!

823
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,726
- Good.
- Not bad, man.

824
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:39,736
That's great work.
Very good.

825
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:42,598
Well...

826
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,936
alone at last.

827
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:48,536
With the exception of Miss Pryce here...

828
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:52,413
there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

829
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,247
Not one.

830
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,914
Do you know what makes
a human being decent?

831
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,251
Fear.

832
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,417
And therein lies the problem.

833
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,428
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

834
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,954
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

835
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:11,264
hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

836
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,601
lives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

837
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,275
But not from God.

838
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:25,374
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

839
00:52:27,485 --> 00:52:31,114
Man, it really looks
just like you, doesn't it?

840
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,955
Look, if I believed enough in this...

841
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,618
I wonder...

842
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,142
Come on.
I don't believe in voodoo.

843
00:53:00,852 --> 00:53:02,444
Voodoo.

844
00:53:09,828 --> 00:53:12,422
But I do believe in this.

845
00:53:12,497 --> 00:53:14,897
Don't run! Don't run!

846
00:53:14,966 --> 00:53:17,764
Fakes! Fakes!
All of you, fakes!

847
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,502
"But I do believe in this."

848
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,007
What does that mean?

849
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,542
And one to grow on.

850
00:53:31,616 --> 00:53:32,708
Gum?

851
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:36,646
Go on. It's okay.

852
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:38,780
You've done nothing wrong.

853
00:53:38,857 --> 00:53:41,951
These guys were fakes.

854
00:53:42,026 --> 00:53:44,358
You're a pure soul.

855
00:53:45,964 --> 00:53:48,558
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

856
00:53:49,634 --> 00:53:51,067
Loki!

857
00:53:53,138 --> 00:53:54,571
You're getting off light.

858
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:56,664
- Loki!
- I know. I'm comin'.

859
00:54:00,678 --> 00:54:02,111
You're so lucky.

860
00:54:06,484 --> 00:54:09,351
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

861
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,853
Three years this August.

862
00:54:10,922 --> 00:54:14,585
Let me guess... the 14th Apostle, left
out of the Bible because she's a woman?

863
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:15,887
This girl's no woman.

864
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,986
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

865
00:54:19,063 --> 00:54:20,792
What, these?

866
00:54:20,865 --> 00:54:25,063
You should know better than anyone here
that tits don't make a woman.

867
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,536
Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

868
00:54:27,605 --> 00:54:31,132
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things...

869
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:32,904
her legs.

870
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:35,411
But as you can see...

871
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,243
I lack definition.

872
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:41,046
Hey, they're gettin' a free show!
Let me see that shit!

873
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,145
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

874
00:54:44,222 --> 00:54:46,884
How do you...
How does she know Metatron?

875
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,949
This is the last scion.

876
00:54:49,861 --> 00:54:52,625
You're kidding.

877
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:54,358
Wow.

878
00:54:54,432 --> 00:54:55,456
I'm confused.

879
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:59,629
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

880
00:54:59,704 --> 00:55:03,401
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

881
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:07,240
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

882
00:55:07,312 --> 00:55:08,870
I'm a muse, stupid.

883
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:12,542
I can't take much more of this.

884
00:55:12,617 --> 00:55:14,312
So you, what, inspire people?

885
00:55:14,385 --> 00:55:17,115
What just went down
with your friends over there...

886
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,089
It doesn't really take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

887
00:55:20,158 --> 00:55:22,149
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

888
00:55:22,227 --> 00:55:27,722
For example, I'm responsible for 19 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

889
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:30,393
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

890
00:55:30,468 --> 00:55:33,403
The one about the kid
by himself in his house...

891
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:36,497
burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off...

892
00:55:36,574 --> 00:55:38,838
I had nothing to do
with that one.

893
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:43,244
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.

894
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,966
What are you doing stripping?

895
00:56:04,035 --> 00:56:05,468
Remember why I left?

896
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:08,972
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

897
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,203
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

898
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:16,179
I gave my two weeks notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

899
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,307
and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

900
00:56:19,384 --> 00:56:20,942
So what happened?

901
00:56:22,186 --> 00:56:23,778
Writer's block.

902
00:56:23,855 --> 00:56:26,722
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

903
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:30,818
I can inspire anyone I meet and give out
a zillion and nine ideas a second...

904
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:32,829
but I can't keep any for myself.

905
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,832
Her quirky sense of humor.

906
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:39,165
- Whose?
- God's.

907
00:56:39,237 --> 00:56:42,172
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there ever a doubt in your mind?

908
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,037
He's always referred to as "Him."

909
00:56:44,108 --> 00:56:45,939
That's not how I wrote it.

910
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,944
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

911
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:50,742
is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

912
00:56:50,815 --> 00:56:53,875
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

913
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,477
and all the penholders were men.

914
00:56:56,554 --> 00:57:00,490
So She became a He.
Doesn't stop with God either.

915
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:02,617
The whole book's gender-biased.

916
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:04,924
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

917
00:57:04,996 --> 00:57:07,191
A woman cuts Samson coif of power.

918
00:57:07,265 --> 00:57:10,666
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

919
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:12,202
Read that book again.

920
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:15,398
Women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the Egyptians and Romans combined.

921
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,735
It stinks.

922
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:24,877
Why is the last scion here?

923
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:27,918
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

924
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:31,183
- Not the plenary indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?

925
00:57:31,255 --> 00:57:34,190
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

926
00:57:34,258 --> 00:57:36,192
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

927
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,785
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

928
00:57:38,863 --> 00:57:42,424
I have issues with anyone who treats God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

929
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,865
like some Catholics.

930
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,904
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

931
00:57:46,971 --> 00:57:51,203
- If we're wrong, what religion is right?
- It's not about who's right or wrong.

932
00:57:51,275 --> 00:57:53,209
No denomination's nailed it yet...

933
00:57:53,277 --> 00:57:55,905
because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

934
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,917
that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in, just that you have faith.

935
00:58:00,985 --> 00:58:05,422
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

936
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:10,385
They made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

937
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,234
Who fuckin' farted?

938
00:58:19,737 --> 00:58:22,968
Not born.
Shit into existence.

939
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:29,244
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

940
00:58:29,313 --> 00:58:31,804
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

941
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,147
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

942
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:35,617
A shit demon!

943
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:39,349
No man of woman born!

944
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:43,287
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

945
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:44,988
It came for Bethany!

946
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,998
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thang!

947
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,534
I knew I's gonna
whack somebody today!

948
00:58:50,601 --> 00:58:52,535
Get your fuckin' hand back.

949
00:58:52,603 --> 00:58:53,831
Represent!

950
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:57,640
Go! Go! Go!

951
00:59:18,963 --> 00:59:21,397
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

952
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,291
Over the bar!

953
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:37,214
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

954
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:39,306
The hill where Christ
was crucified.

955
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:42,147
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

956
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,747
Christ excluded, they were criminals...
killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

957
00:59:45,823 --> 00:59:48,951
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

958
00:59:49,026 --> 00:59:51,551
spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

959
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,496
the result of which
is that walking pile of crap...

960
00:59:54,565 --> 00:59:57,659
the Golgothan shit demon,
Hell's chief assassin.

961
00:59:57,735 --> 00:59:59,532
It's here for you, girlie.

962
01:00:04,108 --> 01:00:06,338
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

963
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,474
- Hey, man.
- How?

964
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:45,242
"Knocks strong odors out."

965
01:00:45,316 --> 01:00:48,251
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

966
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:52,049
What?

967
01:00:52,123 --> 01:00:54,057
Whoever sent this might send more.

968
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:58,084
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

969
01:00:58,162 --> 01:01:00,722
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

970
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:03,562
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

971
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,167
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

972
01:01:07,238 --> 01:01:08,933
Jersey's sold out, sir.

973
01:01:09,006 --> 01:01:11,600
- What?
- There's one at the same time tomorrow.

974
01:01:11,676 --> 01:01:15,612
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State.

975
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,012
Show up two hours in advance.

976
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:21,717
Nice.

977
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:24,721
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

978
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:28,919
what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

979
01:01:28,993 --> 01:01:30,654
Bus, schmuss.

980
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:35,324
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

981
01:01:35,399 --> 01:01:37,833
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

982
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,494
Fuck, let's use 'em!

983
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,004
I wouldn't suggest that.

984
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:45,238
You see, kids...

985
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:48,745
you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

986
01:01:54,385 --> 01:01:56,478
How'd you get out of Hell?

987
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:58,818
I told them I was coming up
on a routine possession.

988
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:02,120
I don't have much time. If they figure
out my ruse, they'll come after me.

989
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:05,924
- What's with bringing us in here?
- You two are inches from getting caught.

990
01:02:05,997 --> 01:02:09,489
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

991
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,501
Don't you know what's going on?

992
01:02:11,569 --> 01:02:13,503
Well, we're going home.

993
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:18,031
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into Heaven?

994
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,669
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

995
01:02:20,745 --> 01:02:23,680
Both sides.
Above and below.

996
01:02:23,748 --> 01:02:26,046
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

997
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,516
- Really?
- Why?

998
01:02:27,585 --> 01:02:29,746
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

999
01:02:31,088 --> 01:02:33,750
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1000
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:37,089
and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you assholes might make him look bad...

1001
01:02:37,161 --> 01:02:39,095
by succeeding
where he's failed so many times.

1002
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:42,257
- So they're just gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1003
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:45,268
That's why you have to travel
incognito.

1004
01:02:45,336 --> 01:02:48,396
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1005
01:02:48,472 --> 01:02:50,406
Quit killing people.
That's high profile.

1006
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:53,375
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1007
01:02:53,444 --> 01:02:55,378
Oh, believe it, boys.

1008
01:02:56,614 --> 01:02:58,878
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1009
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:00,712
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1010
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:03,777
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1011
01:03:03,854 --> 01:03:05,788
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1012
01:03:05,856 --> 01:03:09,121
In the meantime, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1013
01:03:09,193 --> 01:03:11,252
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1014
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,526
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1015
01:03:14,598 --> 01:03:17,533
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1016
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:21,264
And remember, incognito.

1017
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,304
How you coping, kid?

1018
01:03:28,379 --> 01:03:30,074
It's weird.

1019
01:03:30,147 --> 01:03:32,741
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1020
01:03:32,817 --> 01:03:36,082
something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1021
01:03:36,153 --> 01:03:38,713
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1022
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:41,451
You sound like the Man.

1023
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:42,924
What's he like?

1024
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:45,553
He likes to listen to people talk.

1025
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:49,065
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1026
01:03:49,133 --> 01:03:51,499
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1027
01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:53,764
he always had a smile
on his face.

1028
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:55,897
His only real beef with mankind...

1029
01:03:55,973 --> 01:03:59,238
is the shit that gets carried out
in His name.

1030
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:02,711
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1031
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,443
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1032
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:08,451
He said mankind
got it all wrong...

1033
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:12,011
by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1034
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:14,751
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1035
01:04:14,825 --> 01:04:16,918
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1036
01:04:16,994 --> 01:04:20,122
You can change an idea.
Changing a belief is trickier.

1037
01:04:20,197 --> 01:04:22,688
People die for it.
People kill for it.

1038
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:25,201
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1039
01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:30,434
because of the Catholic belief structure
regarding this plenary indulgence shit.

1040
01:04:30,508 --> 01:04:32,772
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1041
01:04:32,843 --> 01:04:34,777
are exploiting that belief...

1042
01:04:34,845 --> 01:04:36,312
and if they're successful...

1043
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:40,578
you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1044
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:42,642
All over a belief.

1045
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:48,848
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1046
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:52,020
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1047
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:55,429
and he went flying through the air,
fuckin' crashed through the wall.

1048
01:04:55,499 --> 01:04:56,932
It was fucked up.

1049
01:04:57,001 --> 01:04:59,936
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1050
01:05:00,004 --> 01:05:03,269
We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1051
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:06,571
who just got on at the last stop...
Larry and Barry.

1052
01:05:08,179 --> 01:05:10,739
So, Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1053
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,887
Hit this shit, man.
It's good stuff.

1054
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:20,689
Oh, fuck.

1055
01:05:24,261 --> 01:05:26,695
That's some bad shit, dude.

1056
01:05:26,764 --> 01:05:28,698
You hit that?

1057
01:05:31,101 --> 01:05:33,035
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1058
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,707
Bad shit.

1059
01:05:38,709 --> 01:05:41,200
Why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1060
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:44,714
It's just this thing I have to do.

1061
01:05:44,782 --> 01:05:46,272
We're going home.

1062
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:49,114
Oh.
Do you two live together?

1063
01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:51,051
Unfortunately, yes.

1064
01:05:53,691 --> 01:05:56,455
So, how long have you two
been together?

1065
01:05:57,728 --> 01:05:59,559
A while.

1066
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:03,361
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1067
01:06:03,434 --> 01:06:05,026
How'd you meet?

1068
01:06:05,102 --> 01:06:06,694
We were stationed together.

1069
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:09,136
See, that's beautiful.

1070
01:06:09,206 --> 01:06:13,074
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1071
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,270
Pardon?

1072
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:19,646
You know, there's all the macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1073
01:06:19,717 --> 01:06:21,981
You two meet there, hook up...

1074
01:06:22,953 --> 01:06:26,116
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1075
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,624
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:31,820
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1077
01:06:34,632 --> 01:06:37,829
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1078
01:06:37,902 --> 01:06:40,462
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1079
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,130
I call it being dumped.

1080
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,197
I was...

1081
01:06:44,275 --> 01:06:45,936
dumped once.

1082
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:48,945
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1083
01:06:49,013 --> 01:06:51,641
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1084
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:55,310
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1085
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,819
and call you back.

1086
01:06:56,887 --> 01:07:00,345
They always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1087
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:02,517
When actually...

1088
01:07:02,593 --> 01:07:04,288
it hurts more.

1089
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:09,928
You know what we need?

1090
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,831
What do we need?

1091
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,426
We need drinks.

1092
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,972
We need a lot of drinks.

1093
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,510
Garçon.

1094
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,942
You still go to church?

1095
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:31,180
Every Sunday.

1096
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,655
Does it do anything for you?

1097
01:07:33,724 --> 01:07:36,887
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook every week.

1098
01:07:36,961 --> 01:07:41,022
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1099
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,362
They go to church and feel bored...

1100
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:46,835
but they keep going every week
just out of habit.

1101
01:07:46,904 --> 01:07:49,202
I am so buzzed.

1102
01:07:50,808 --> 01:07:53,743
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1103
01:07:53,811 --> 01:07:56,041
I remember the exact moment.

1104
01:07:58,682 --> 01:08:02,413
I was on the phone with my mother...

1105
01:08:02,486 --> 01:08:06,445
and she was trying to counsel me
through this...

1106
01:08:07,591 --> 01:08:09,024
this thing.

1107
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:15,565
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1108
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,567
she said...

1109
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,535
"Bethany...

1110
01:08:19,603 --> 01:08:21,537
God has a plan."

1111
01:08:24,942 --> 01:08:28,639
I was... I was so angry with her.

1112
01:08:30,748 --> 01:08:32,340
I was like...

1113
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:34,350
"What about my plans?"

1114
01:08:34,418 --> 01:08:36,283
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

1115
01:08:36,353 --> 01:08:39,379
I had planned
to have a family...

1116
01:08:39,456 --> 01:08:41,117
with my husband.

1117
01:08:41,191 --> 01:08:44,126
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1118
01:08:48,032 --> 01:08:49,966
Apparently not.

1119
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:57,263
How about you?
How'd you lose your faith?

1120
01:08:58,442 --> 01:09:00,672
A long time ago.

1121
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:04,236
One day God just stopped listening.

1122
01:09:04,314 --> 01:09:08,876
I kept talking, but I got the distinct
impression He wasn't listening anymore.

1123
01:09:08,952 --> 01:09:12,444
How did you know She was listening
in the first place?

1124
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,226
Well, I guess I don't.

1125
01:09:17,294 --> 01:09:19,524
I hate thoughts like that.

1126
01:09:20,664 --> 01:09:23,724
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1127
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:28,170
'Cause when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1128
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:32,471
God's in Heaven, and He's...

1129
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,979
She's always got her eye on you.

1130
01:09:40,484 --> 01:09:43,419
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1131
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:51,756
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1132
01:09:59,937 --> 01:10:02,167
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1133
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,436
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1134
01:10:05,509 --> 01:10:07,841
All right, but I warned you.

1135
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:09,606
Okay.

1136
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,275
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1137
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:15,147
Really.

1138
01:10:15,219 --> 01:10:19,656
<i>Kerwood Mandel to car three.</i>
<i>Kerwood Mandel to car three.</i>

1139
01:10:19,723 --> 01:10:23,181
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1140
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,194
from going into the church.

1141
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,962
They're trying...

1142
01:10:29,032 --> 01:10:30,465
Shit.

1143
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,703
They're trying
to get back into Heaven.

1144
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:40,669
See, they got tossed
out of Heaven...

1145
01:10:40,744 --> 01:10:42,211
years ago, right?

1146
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,475
And if they get back in...

1147
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:47,414
it proves God wrong...

1148
01:10:47,484 --> 01:10:50,647
and since God is infallible...

1149
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:52,484
to prove Her wrong...

1150
01:10:52,556 --> 01:10:55,821
would, you know, unmake existence.

1151
01:10:57,594 --> 01:10:59,721
<i>May I have your attention, please.</i>

1152
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:04,063
<i>The dining car will be closing</i>
<i>in five minutes. Thank you.</i>

1153
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,762
I feel so stupid...

1154
01:11:06,837 --> 01:11:08,771
just saying it.

1155
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,572
The thing I don't get is...

1156
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:15,339
how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1157
01:11:15,412 --> 01:11:16,845
Two, even!

1158
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:25,352
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1159
01:11:25,422 --> 01:11:27,549
Maybe you're supposed to kill them.

1160
01:11:27,624 --> 01:11:30,821
Oh, yeah, right.
Kill them.

1161
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:36,656
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1162
01:11:37,901 --> 01:11:40,927
how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1163
01:11:41,705 --> 01:11:43,730
Oh...

1164
01:11:43,807 --> 01:11:45,707
I don't suppose
it's much different from...

1165
01:11:46,777 --> 01:11:48,210
killing a human.

1166
01:11:49,646 --> 01:11:52,240
Where is everybody?
I wake up and...

1167
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:56,118
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1168
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:59,212
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1169
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,550
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1170
01:12:04,628 --> 01:12:07,392
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1171
01:12:07,464 --> 01:12:09,728
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1172
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,395
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1173
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:16,371
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1174
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,341
Save it. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1175
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:20,341
Loki!

1176
01:12:21,411 --> 01:12:22,673
Holy shit. The apostle.

1177
01:12:22,746 --> 01:12:24,839
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1178
01:12:24,915 --> 01:12:26,906
What are you doing here?

1179
01:12:26,984 --> 01:12:28,918
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1180
01:12:28,986 --> 01:12:30,920
- Us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1181
01:12:30,988 --> 01:12:34,651
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1182
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:37,523
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1183
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:39,289
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1184
01:12:39,363 --> 01:12:42,298
We're going home,
no matter whose pride it may hurt.

1185
01:12:42,366 --> 01:12:44,857
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1186
01:12:44,935 --> 01:12:47,631
What are you, high? I can't kill her
if she hasn't done anything.

1187
01:12:47,704 --> 01:12:49,137
Fine.
I'll kill her myself.

1188
01:12:49,206 --> 01:12:51,538
I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1189
01:12:51,608 --> 01:12:54,168
- These guys are fuckin' flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1190
01:13:04,221 --> 01:13:05,813
Oh, shit!

1191
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:08,724
Jay!

1192
01:13:09,893 --> 01:13:11,121
Biggie!

1193
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:13,662
The door! The door!

1194
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:19,731
Can't we talk about this?

1195
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:28,200
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1196
01:14:08,185 --> 01:14:09,618
No ticket.

1197
01:14:12,923 --> 01:14:15,619
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1198
01:14:15,692 --> 01:14:19,184
- Then you know who she was, don't you?
- The scion, I imagine!

1199
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:22,088
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1200
01:14:22,165 --> 01:14:25,362
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1201
01:14:25,435 --> 01:14:29,394
And Azrael tells us we're marked?
There's more to this than we thought of.

1202
01:14:29,473 --> 01:14:31,498
I was close.

1203
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:34,738
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1204
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:35,903
Whoa.

1205
01:14:35,979 --> 01:14:39,244
You know how I felt?
Righteous.

1206
01:14:39,316 --> 01:14:40,908
Justified.
Eager, even.

1207
01:14:40,984 --> 01:14:43,043
You all right?
Your eyes are kinda...

1208
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,247
My eyes are open.

1209
01:14:45,322 --> 01:14:47,256
For the first time I get it.

1210
01:14:47,324 --> 01:14:51,124
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1211
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:54,960
See, in the beginning it was
just us and Him... angels and God.

1212
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,795
Then He created humans.

1213
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:59,893
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1214
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:03,235
and bowing and scraping and adoration.

1215
01:15:03,306 --> 01:15:07,743
He gave them more than He ever gave us.
He gave them a choice.

1216
01:15:07,811 --> 01:15:11,110
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore Him.

1217
01:15:11,181 --> 01:15:13,115
All this time
we've been down here...

1218
01:15:13,183 --> 01:15:15,777
I've felt the absence
of the Divine Presence...

1219
01:15:15,852 --> 01:15:19,151
and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1220
01:15:19,222 --> 01:15:23,181
And why?
Because of the way He made us.

1221
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,593
Had we been given free will we could
choose to ignore the pain, like they do.

1222
01:15:26,663 --> 01:15:28,460
But no, we're servants.

1223
01:15:28,532 --> 01:15:30,557
Okay.

1224
01:15:30,634 --> 01:15:34,161
All I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1225
01:15:34,237 --> 01:15:38,139
Wake up! These humans have besmirched
everything He's bestowed upon them.

1226
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:40,142
They were given paradise;
they threw it away.

1227
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:42,644
They were given this planet;
they destroyed it.

1228
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:45,272
They were favored best
among all His endeavors...

1229
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:48,681
and some of them
don't even believe He exists!

1230
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:50,845
And in spite of it all...

1231
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,652
He has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1232
01:15:54,724 --> 01:15:56,521
at every turn.

1233
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:58,117
What about us?

1234
01:15:59,296 --> 01:16:02,231
I asked you once...

1235
01:16:02,299 --> 01:16:05,234
to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1236
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:07,133
What was the result?

1237
01:16:07,204 --> 01:16:09,468
Our expulsion from paradise.

1238
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:12,133
Where was His
infinite fucking patience then?

1239
01:16:12,209 --> 01:16:15,042
It's not right!
It's not fair!

1240
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,046
We've paid our debt!

1241
01:16:18,515 --> 01:16:21,279
Don't you think it's time?

1242
01:16:21,351 --> 01:16:24,218
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1243
01:16:25,922 --> 01:16:30,882
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1244
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,657
Wait. Wait, wait.
Kill them?

1245
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:37,494
You're talking about the last scion,
for Christ's sake.

1246
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:40,502
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1247
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,128
Don't.
Don't, my friend.

1248
01:16:42,205 --> 01:16:45,834
Don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1249
01:16:45,909 --> 01:16:47,399
They did me once.

1250
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,377
Scion or not...

1251
01:16:49,446 --> 01:16:50,879
she's just a human...

1252
01:16:50,947 --> 01:16:54,110
and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1253
01:16:54,184 --> 01:16:56,175
No harm, no foul.

1254
01:16:57,354 --> 01:17:00,289
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1255
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,190
What did you say?

1256
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:06,354
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1257
01:17:06,429 --> 01:17:09,455
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking face!

1258
01:17:09,533 --> 01:17:12,627
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1259
01:17:12,702 --> 01:17:15,296
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1260
01:17:15,372 --> 01:17:17,932
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1261
01:17:19,342 --> 01:17:20,934
Well, fuck that.

1262
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:25,380
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the Throne.

1263
01:17:26,383 --> 01:17:28,476
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1264
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:31,749
We're going home, Loki...

1265
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:35,882
and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty Himself...

1266
01:17:35,959 --> 01:17:37,893
is gonna make that otherwise.

1267
01:17:44,401 --> 01:17:45,834
Shit.

1268
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:50,666
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1269
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,469
Very basic strategy.

1270
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:55,978
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1271
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,172
Why are we enemies?

1272
01:17:57,247 --> 01:18:00,614
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1273
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:04,085
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1274
01:18:04,154 --> 01:18:07,817
I'm tired
of all this cryptic bullshit.

1275
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:10,451
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1276
01:18:10,527 --> 01:18:13,792
and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1277
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:16,263
unless you come clean right now.

1278
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:18,426
Why me?

1279
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:21,993
Out of all the people
on the goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1280
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:25,007
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1281
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:30,270
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1282
01:18:30,347 --> 01:18:33,942
How long do you think it would take to
come to grips with something that huge?

1283
01:18:34,017 --> 01:18:36,679
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1284
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:41,850
In the Bible, Jesus suddenly
goes from age 12 to 30. 12 to 30.

1285
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:44,155
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1286
01:18:44,227 --> 01:18:47,162
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1287
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:48,561
I'll tell you where.

1288
01:18:48,632 --> 01:18:53,365
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1289
01:18:53,436 --> 01:18:56,462
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1290
01:18:56,539 --> 01:18:59,303
to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1291
01:19:01,645 --> 01:19:03,078
Oh, bullshit.

1292
01:19:03,146 --> 01:19:05,137
Any important material
about Christ...

1293
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,809
would give people a better understanding
of the nature of God.

1294
01:19:07,884 --> 01:19:11,911
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with His family.

1295
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:15,014
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1296
01:19:15,091 --> 01:19:19,357
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1297
01:19:19,429 --> 01:19:23,798
Mary gave birth to Christ without having
known a man's touch. This is true.

1298
01:19:23,867 --> 01:19:25,801
But she did have a husband.

1299
01:19:25,869 --> 01:19:29,566
Do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1300
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,231
if he wasn't gettin' laid?

1301
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,744
The nature of God and the Virgin Birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1302
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:39,077
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1303
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,275
Meaning?

1304
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,284
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1305
01:19:42,352 --> 01:19:45,048
shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1306
01:19:45,121 --> 01:19:46,884
with the one you call Jesus.

1307
01:19:47,957 --> 01:19:49,857
Bethany, you are...

1308
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:54,954
the great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandniece...

1309
01:19:55,031 --> 01:19:56,965
of Jesus Christ.

1310
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:04,864
So, that would make Bethany
part black?

1311
01:20:09,579 --> 01:20:11,513
I can't do this anymore.

1312
01:20:16,653 --> 01:20:19,952
Where you gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1313
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:21,820
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1314
01:20:21,891 --> 01:20:23,483
It's bullshit!

1315
01:20:27,163 --> 01:20:29,529
Let her go, man.

1316
01:20:29,599 --> 01:20:31,089
Give her time.

1317
01:20:38,408 --> 01:20:40,433
Why?

1318
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:43,445
What the fuck do You want from me?

1319
01:20:43,513 --> 01:20:45,913
I fucking hate You!

1320
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,511
I hate You.

1321
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:50,849
He can't hear you, you know.

1322
01:20:56,593 --> 01:20:58,652
That's why we needed you.

1323
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:01,026
Why didn't you tell me?

1324
01:21:01,097 --> 01:21:02,257
Would you...

1325
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:05,631
Could you have believed me?

1326
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,928
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1327
01:21:09,839 --> 01:21:12,137
Only after everything you've seen...

1328
01:21:13,276 --> 01:21:14,368
everything you've heard...

1329
01:21:16,379 --> 01:21:19,473
could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1330
01:21:19,549 --> 01:21:21,540
I don't want this.

1331
01:21:24,788 --> 01:21:26,847
It's too big.

1332
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:28,618
That's what Jesus said.

1333
01:21:30,794 --> 01:21:32,728
I had to tell Him.

1334
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:38,958
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1335
01:21:40,036 --> 01:21:42,368
not to be able
to tell the Son Himself...

1336
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:45,431
because one word from His lips would
destroy the boy's frail human form.

1337
01:21:45,508 --> 01:21:48,875
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1338
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:51,175
who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1339
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:55,377
I had to tell this little boy
that He was God's only son...

1340
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:58,387
and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1341
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:01,686
at the hands of the very people
He'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1342
01:22:03,893 --> 01:22:06,054
He begged me to take it all back.

1343
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,056
As if I could.

1344
01:22:10,767 --> 01:22:13,565
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1345
01:22:13,636 --> 01:22:18,039
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
something I've never told anyone before.

1346
01:22:19,509 --> 01:22:21,443
If I had the power...

1347
01:22:22,912 --> 01:22:24,345
I would have.

1348
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:26,275
It's unfair.

1349
01:22:26,349 --> 01:22:30,012
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1350
01:22:30,086 --> 01:22:32,384
and to ask you to do the same now.

1351
01:22:32,455 --> 01:22:34,184
I sympathize. I do.

1352
01:22:34,257 --> 01:22:36,691
I wish I could take it all back.

1353
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:40,754
But I can't.

1354
01:22:43,633 --> 01:22:45,066
This...

1355
01:22:46,302 --> 01:22:48,395
is who you are.

1356
01:22:50,306 --> 01:22:52,900
Everything I am has been a lie?

1357
01:22:56,946 --> 01:23:01,542
Knowing what you now know
doesn't mean you're not who you were.

1358
01:23:01,618 --> 01:23:02,744
You are...

1359
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:04,411
Bethany Sloane.

1360
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:07,422
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1361
01:23:09,292 --> 01:23:14,025
All this means is
a redefinition of that identity.

1362
01:23:14,097 --> 01:23:17,726
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1363
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,995
Be who you've always been.

1364
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:22,230
Just...

1365
01:23:23,172 --> 01:23:24,799
be this as well...

1366
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:29,068
from time to time.

1367
01:23:32,649 --> 01:23:35,584
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1368
01:23:35,652 --> 01:23:37,916
To say the least.

1369
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,622
Do you mind if we adjourn
to somewhere...

1370
01:23:48,698 --> 01:23:51,326
a tad more habitable...

1371
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:52,993
and a bit warmer?

1372
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,546
Fuck, I think this shit
just kicked in.

1373
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,487
Weren't we just in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1374
01:24:13,556 --> 01:24:15,547
Going out in style.

1375
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,219
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1376
01:24:18,294 --> 01:24:20,125
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1377
01:24:20,196 --> 01:24:22,391
The voice of God.
Show some respect.

1378
01:24:22,465 --> 01:24:24,899
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of Him?

1379
01:24:24,968 --> 01:24:27,232
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1380
01:24:27,303 --> 01:24:30,067
- What?
- Didn't it ever occur to you...

1381
01:24:30,139 --> 01:24:34,166
that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of His control?

1382
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:36,006
Yes, but then why was she tapped?

1383
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:40,072
You know those constitutionals
that He likes to take?

1384
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:41,411
"Constitutionals"?

1385
01:24:41,484 --> 01:24:43,975
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1386
01:24:44,053 --> 01:24:45,987
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1387
01:24:47,256 --> 01:24:50,316
The Lord has quite a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it for years.

1388
01:24:50,393 --> 01:24:52,418
He assumes a human form once a month
and indulges.

1389
01:24:52,495 --> 01:24:56,022
Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing.
He just goes away for a couple of hours.

1390
01:24:56,099 --> 01:24:59,728
And He always gives His free points away
to neighborhood children.

1391
01:24:59,802 --> 01:25:01,235
Isn't that sweet?

1392
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:04,899
But She hasn't come back
from one of these day trips?

1393
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:07,374
No, "She" hasn't...

1394
01:25:07,443 --> 01:25:10,276
and we've been unable to locate "Her."

1395
01:25:10,346 --> 01:25:13,679
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1396
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:17,618
No, there's a different sort
of foul play afoot, children.

1397
01:25:18,755 --> 01:25:22,247
Whomever has set the renegade angels
on their path...

1398
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:24,759
and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1399
01:25:24,827 --> 01:25:27,819
is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1400
01:25:27,897 --> 01:25:30,161
Were He to be killed in human form...

1401
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:32,895
He'd have returned
immediately to Heaven.

1402
01:25:32,969 --> 01:25:34,960
Someone knew enough...

1403
01:25:35,038 --> 01:25:37,165
to keep Him biologically alive...

1404
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,209
but incapacitate Him
in another fashion.

1405
01:25:40,276 --> 01:25:43,040
And as omnipotent as we are above...

1406
01:25:43,112 --> 01:25:46,570
I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without His presence.

1407
01:25:46,649 --> 01:25:48,583
We've looked everywhere for Him.

1408
01:25:48,651 --> 01:25:53,520
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind this.

1409
01:25:53,589 --> 01:25:56,888
But whoever he is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys after you...

1410
01:25:56,959 --> 01:25:59,052
as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1411
01:25:59,128 --> 01:26:00,891
Could it be Lucifer?

1412
01:26:00,963 --> 01:26:02,362
Not Lucifer.

1413
01:26:02,432 --> 01:26:05,959
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1414
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:08,970
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1415
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:12,269
because he's had just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1416
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:13,808
What do we do now?

1417
01:26:13,876 --> 01:26:16,743
I say we get drunk,
'cause I'm all out of ideas.

1418
01:26:16,813 --> 01:26:19,782
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?

1419
01:26:19,849 --> 01:26:21,680
I beg your pardon?

1420
01:26:21,751 --> 01:26:23,685
The guy in charge
of the church thing.

1421
01:26:26,522 --> 01:26:28,422
Cardinal Glick?

1422
01:26:28,491 --> 01:26:30,652
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1423
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:34,094
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1424
01:26:34,163 --> 01:26:35,460
Good Lord.

1425
01:26:35,531 --> 01:26:37,590
The little stoner's got a point.

1426
01:26:37,667 --> 01:26:42,263
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
cancelling the rededication ceremony.

1427
01:26:42,338 --> 01:26:44,363
"We"?

1428
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,534
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. I-Don't-Think-I-Can-Do-This-Anymore?

1429
01:26:51,848 --> 01:26:55,181
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now would I?

1430
01:26:58,054 --> 01:26:58,986
Well...

1431
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:04,057
the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1432
01:27:04,127 --> 01:27:07,290
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1433
01:27:07,363 --> 01:27:11,857
but if we can let 'em know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1434
01:27:11,934 --> 01:27:14,994
we can win 'em back,
even get some new ones.

1435
01:27:15,071 --> 01:27:16,663
Excuse me.

1436
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:20,335
Fill them pews, people.

1437
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:23,344
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1438
01:27:23,412 --> 01:27:25,903
Hook 'em while they're young.

1439
01:27:25,982 --> 01:27:30,146
- Kinda like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1440
01:27:30,219 --> 01:27:33,347
We really appreciate you seeing us
this late in the day, Your Eminence.

1441
01:27:33,422 --> 01:27:37,017
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1442
01:27:37,093 --> 01:27:39,584
about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1443
01:27:39,662 --> 01:27:42,153
You looking to help out in some way?

1444
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:45,029
We'd like you to cancel the ceremony.

1445
01:27:46,102 --> 01:27:47,729
I beg your pardon.

1446
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:51,831
There's gonna be a world of trouble if
tomorrow's ceremony goes on as planned.

1447
01:27:52,909 --> 01:27:55,742
Are you pro-choice?

1448
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,404
The trouble's not from us.

1449
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,847
It's from these renegade angels that've
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1450
01:28:03,586 --> 01:28:06,111
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1451
01:28:06,189 --> 01:28:08,384
See, Padre, it goes down like this.

1452
01:28:08,457 --> 01:28:13,190
These guys think that by passing through
that archway, they can go to Heaven.

1453
01:28:13,262 --> 01:28:16,891
You want me to call off the ceremony
for that.

1454
01:28:17,967 --> 01:28:19,093
Who sent you?

1455
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:24,230
We were sent
by Him who is called I Am!

1456
01:28:24,307 --> 01:28:26,901
Cute. Really cute.

1457
01:28:26,976 --> 01:28:29,376
Playtime with the cardinal is over.

1458
01:28:29,445 --> 01:28:32,073
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1459
01:28:32,148 --> 01:28:33,775
It's not a joke.

1460
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,944
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1461
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:39,988
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1462
01:28:40,056 --> 01:28:42,991
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1463
01:28:43,059 --> 01:28:45,619
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?

1464
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,129
All right, mistakes were made.

1465
01:28:48,197 --> 01:28:51,291
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1466
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:53,392
responsible for the oversights of old.

1467
01:28:53,469 --> 01:28:57,235
I'm a very important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1468
01:28:57,306 --> 01:28:58,796
so if you please...

1469
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,639
- But tomorrow...
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1470
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,076
Do I make myself clear?

1471
01:29:03,145 --> 01:29:07,809
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God Himself...

1472
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:10,819
is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1473
01:29:31,807 --> 01:29:33,832
I can see the headlines now...

1474
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,844
if there were gonna be any.

1475
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,539
"Existence Erased."

1476
01:29:37,613 --> 01:29:39,843
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1477
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:42,282
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1478
01:29:44,787 --> 01:29:45,947
What up.

1479
01:29:46,022 --> 01:29:48,286
You stole the cardinal's driver?

1480
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:50,518
That's what he gets
for messin' with our girlfriend.

1481
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:52,356
Cross-dressin' fuck.

1482
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:54,862
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1483
01:29:56,632 --> 01:29:59,567
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1484
01:29:59,635 --> 01:30:02,832
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill 'em.

1485
01:30:02,905 --> 01:30:05,032
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1486
01:30:06,642 --> 01:30:09,372
They won't be killed.

1487
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:12,505
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1488
01:30:12,581 --> 01:30:13,843
right here...

1489
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:16,976
until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1490
01:30:18,087 --> 01:30:20,146
There's only one idiot here,
Azrael...

1491
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:25,620
and I'm looking right at him.

1492
01:30:25,695 --> 01:30:27,219
Muse!

1493
01:30:28,564 --> 01:30:31,692
Just in time to join us
for a drink.

1494
01:30:33,169 --> 01:30:34,261
Hey.
Where'd you come from?

1495
01:30:36,105 --> 01:30:38,039
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1496
01:30:38,107 --> 01:30:39,631
Nothingness.

1497
01:30:39,709 --> 01:30:43,440
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1498
01:30:43,512 --> 01:30:47,073
All right, Plato,
sounds like you've had enough already.

1499
01:30:47,149 --> 01:30:49,640
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1500
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:53,382
Come on, barkeep, just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1501
01:30:53,456 --> 01:30:56,584
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1502
01:30:56,659 --> 01:30:58,422
Is that who I think it is?

1503
01:30:58,494 --> 01:30:59,791
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1504
01:30:59,862 --> 01:31:02,626
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1505
01:31:02,698 --> 01:31:04,859
Give me a...

1506
01:31:04,934 --> 01:31:07,402
Holy Bartender.

1507
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,370
Never heard of it.

1508
01:31:09,438 --> 01:31:13,306
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1509
01:31:13,376 --> 01:31:15,310
You do, don't you, Muse?

1510
01:31:15,378 --> 01:31:16,436
Don't.

1511
01:31:17,546 --> 01:31:18,706
Anybody?

1512
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:20,271
No?

1513
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:23,876
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1514
01:31:32,461 --> 01:31:33,553
Get it?

1515
01:31:33,629 --> 01:31:35,893
Sweet Jesus, Azrael!
Why?

1516
01:31:35,965 --> 01:31:39,492
Come on, Demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1517
01:31:39,568 --> 01:31:43,004
Oh, Apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1518
01:31:43,072 --> 01:31:46,098
and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1519
01:31:46,175 --> 01:31:48,336
The Christ bitch will join you.

1520
01:31:48,411 --> 01:31:51,574
Are you really that stupid?

1521
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:55,174
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1522
01:31:55,251 --> 01:31:57,617
I'm actually counting on it.

1523
01:31:58,854 --> 01:32:01,015
And if my calculations
are correct...

1524
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,820
the pawns are moving into checkmate
as we speak.

1525
01:32:08,798 --> 01:32:12,325
"Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1526
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:16,633
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1527
01:32:16,705 --> 01:32:18,502
for coming this morning.

1528
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:21,509
She's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1529
01:32:23,179 --> 01:32:27,878
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1530
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:30,612
hundred-years-young house of God.

1531
01:32:30,686 --> 01:32:31,983
God's house?

1532
01:32:33,355 --> 01:32:36,085
God doesn't live here anymore.

1533
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:38,956
He's grown weary
of your superficial faith.

1534
01:32:39,028 --> 01:32:41,963
He's turned a deaf ear
to your lip-service prayers.

1535
01:32:42,031 --> 01:32:45,364
- He has abandoned you, his favorites...
- Sorry.

1536
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:47,368
To the whim of judgment.

1537
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:49,961
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1538
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:54,268
prepare to taste God's wrath.

1539
01:32:54,343 --> 01:32:57,278
- Maybe we should just leave.
- You wanted your body count. You got it.

1540
01:32:57,346 --> 01:32:59,974
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1541
01:33:00,049 --> 01:33:01,311
Officer McGhee.

1542
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:03,881
All right, mouthpiece...

1543
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:06,751
let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1544
01:33:06,822 --> 01:33:09,222
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1545
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:11,225
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

1546
01:33:11,293 --> 01:33:13,158
Is that so?

1547
01:33:17,433 --> 01:33:19,196
Ladies and gentlemen...

1548
01:33:19,268 --> 01:33:24,763
you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1549
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,240
and this very day...

1550
01:33:27,309 --> 01:33:31,075
I assure you you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1551
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:32,910
in blood.

1552
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:35,280
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1553
01:33:35,351 --> 01:33:36,409
Do it!

1554
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:40,350
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1555
01:33:42,024 --> 01:33:45,425
He was kicked out.

1556
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:47,962
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1557
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,122
Then what happened?

1558
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:51,359
Yes, what?

1559
01:33:51,433 --> 01:33:55,392
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1560
01:33:55,471 --> 01:33:58,031
Heaven became divided
into two factions...

1561
01:33:58,107 --> 01:34:00,302
the faithful and the renegades.

1562
01:34:00,376 --> 01:34:03,209
Oh, the Ethereal Plains
were chaotic with battle.

1563
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:06,077
Angel against angel.

1564
01:34:06,148 --> 01:34:09,584
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1565
01:34:09,652 --> 01:34:11,552
But Azrael refused to fight.

1566
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:15,112
He remained in the middle,
waiting to see who came out victorious.

1567
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:17,284
What are you,
some kind of fuckin' chicken?

1568
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:18,656
No.

1569
01:34:18,727 --> 01:34:20,592
I was an artist...

1570
01:34:20,663 --> 01:34:22,790
stupid!

1571
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:24,526
I was inspiration!

1572
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,091
A muse has no place in battle.

1573
01:34:27,169 --> 01:34:29,899
So after the fallen
were banished to Hell...

1574
01:34:29,972 --> 01:34:31,906
God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1575
01:34:31,974 --> 01:34:34,340
and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1576
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:37,208
something he considers
a great injustice.

1577
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:39,440
Oh, come on.

1578
01:34:39,515 --> 01:34:42,575
Don't tell me you never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1579
01:34:42,651 --> 01:34:45,415
No.
It never bothered me.

1580
01:34:45,487 --> 01:34:47,512
So you were an artist.

1581
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:49,353
Big deal!

1582
01:34:49,425 --> 01:34:51,484
Elvis was an artist...

1583
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,927
but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time of war.

1584
01:34:54,997 --> 01:34:56,931
That's why he is the king...

1585
01:34:56,999 --> 01:34:58,933
and you're a schmuck.

1586
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:00,161
Nice.

1587
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:02,136
So all this is about revenge.

1588
01:35:02,204 --> 01:35:05,196
You're gonna unmake existence
because you have a grudge against God?

1589
01:35:05,274 --> 01:35:09,040
After the first million years?
No.

1590
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:12,945
Escape from Hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1591
01:35:13,015 --> 01:35:17,509
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1592
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:19,110
which it finally did...

1593
01:35:19,188 --> 01:35:21,156
in Catholicism.

1594
01:35:21,223 --> 01:35:22,485
Plenary indulgence.

1595
01:35:22,558 --> 01:35:24,458
But I couldn't exercise it.

1596
01:35:24,526 --> 01:35:26,994
Demons can't become human.

1597
01:35:27,062 --> 01:35:29,223
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1598
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:32,166
But angels can.

1599
01:35:33,402 --> 01:35:34,733
Bartleby and Loki.

1600
01:35:36,438 --> 01:35:39,464
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1601
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:41,338
to celebrate their centennial...

1602
01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:47,042
and when that finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1603
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,050
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1604
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,245
kept them cloaked
and off Heaven's radars.

1605
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:54,483
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1606
01:35:54,556 --> 01:35:58,356
no soul in Hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1607
01:35:58,427 --> 01:36:01,419
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1608
01:36:01,497 --> 01:36:04,989
so I dispatched Him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1609
01:36:05,067 --> 01:36:07,501
Her. And how?

1610
01:36:07,569 --> 01:36:10,163
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1611
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:13,174
Oh, no, I've seen
way too many Bond movies to know...

1612
01:36:13,242 --> 01:36:16,177
that you never reveal
all the details of your plan...

1613
01:36:16,245 --> 01:36:19,681
no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1614
01:36:19,748 --> 01:36:22,945
The only "X" factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1615
01:36:24,286 --> 01:36:28,382
But fat lot of good that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1616
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,323
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1617
01:36:34,396 --> 01:36:38,526
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1618
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,502
but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1619
01:36:42,571 --> 01:36:45,540
Human, have you ever been to Hell?

1620
01:36:45,607 --> 01:36:47,802
I think not.

1621
01:36:47,876 --> 01:36:50,140
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1622
01:36:50,212 --> 01:36:54,546
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1623
01:36:54,616 --> 01:36:57,141
Still thinking only about yourself...

1624
01:36:57,219 --> 01:36:59,153
you fucking child!

1625
01:36:59,221 --> 01:37:01,314
Now, now, now.

1626
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:05,217
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1627
01:37:05,294 --> 01:37:07,854
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1628
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:09,898
Yo, put on channel 9.
<i>Davey and Goliath.</i>

1629
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:15,703
Actually, I was thinking
more along the lines of current events.

1630
01:37:15,771 --> 01:37:18,205
<i>Keep rolling! Keep rolling!</i>

1631
01:37:18,273 --> 01:37:21,140
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>men with huge fucking wings...</i>

1632
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:23,371
<i>have laid waste to St. Michael's!</i>

1633
01:37:23,445 --> 01:37:25,811
<i>Bullets don't seem to affect them!</i>

1634
01:37:26,615 --> 01:37:29,550
<i>The remainder of the crowd</i>
<i>have dropped to their knees...</i>

1635
01:37:29,618 --> 01:37:31,984
<i>identifying this</i>
<i>as the fabled apocalypse.</i>

1636
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:34,921
<i>Now, I'm not a man of faith,</i>
<i>but I'm inclined to agree.</i>

1637
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:39,188
<i>Oh, God, please, don't come any closer!</i>
<i>God, no!</i>

1638
01:37:47,269 --> 01:37:50,500
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1639
01:37:50,572 --> 01:37:54,167
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not going to matter anyway.

1640
01:37:58,313 --> 01:37:59,337
Oh?

1641
01:38:00,816 --> 01:38:03,250
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1642
01:38:03,318 --> 01:38:04,945
What?

1643
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:07,511
Oh, nothing.

1644
01:38:07,589 --> 01:38:09,750
I had something in my eye.

1645
01:38:09,825 --> 01:38:12,589
Now who's the fucking child?

1646
01:38:13,762 --> 01:38:16,959
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1647
01:38:17,633 --> 01:38:21,296
Are you serious? I'm a fucking demon.
You'd have him assault me with a putter?

1648
01:38:22,337 --> 01:38:24,430
You want to play?
Then we'll play.

1649
01:38:24,506 --> 01:38:26,303
One side, Red.

1650
01:38:27,042 --> 01:38:28,737
Go ahead, then.
Pick it up.

1651
01:38:28,811 --> 01:38:29,971
Call it a gift.

1652
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:33,438
Come on.

1653
01:38:33,515 --> 01:38:34,948
That's it.

1654
01:38:36,485 --> 01:38:38,077
Take a shot.

1655
01:38:38,153 --> 01:38:41,748
Take your best fucking shot.

1656
01:38:43,225 --> 01:38:45,625
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1657
01:38:46,795 --> 01:38:48,729
Come on, bright boy.

1658
01:38:56,572 --> 01:38:59,336
Don't you know anything?

1659
01:39:14,823 --> 01:39:16,757
Bethany, bless the sink!

1660
01:39:16,825 --> 01:39:18,690
- What?
- Just do it!

1661
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,751
Bless the sink, damn it!

1662
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:47,215
That's what you get,
motherfucker.

1663
01:39:49,758 --> 01:39:51,953
But I'm a fucking demon.

1664
01:39:59,268 --> 01:40:00,530
What just happened?

1665
01:40:00,602 --> 01:40:03,264
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1666
01:40:03,338 --> 01:40:07,707
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side so it'll do some damage.

1667
01:40:07,776 --> 01:40:09,835
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1668
01:40:09,912 --> 01:40:13,848
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1669
01:40:13,916 --> 01:40:16,976
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1670
01:40:17,052 --> 01:40:19,316
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1671
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:21,822
Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing
at my next party.

1672
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:25,087
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about ten miles.

1673
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,094
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1674
01:40:27,162 --> 01:40:29,392
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1675
01:40:29,464 --> 01:40:32,695
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1676
01:40:44,513 --> 01:40:46,208
Oh, my God.

1677
01:40:58,994 --> 01:41:01,724
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1678
01:41:01,797 --> 01:41:03,059
Are we too late?

1679
01:41:03,131 --> 01:41:05,725
To save these poor schmucks?

1680
01:41:07,502 --> 01:41:08,594
Yeah.

1681
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:11,332
But we still exist.

1682
01:41:11,406 --> 01:41:13,237
Where are they?

1683
01:41:13,308 --> 01:41:15,799
They could already be
in the church.

1684
01:41:15,877 --> 01:41:17,970
Which means if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1685
01:41:18,046 --> 01:41:19,479
Are you shitting me?

1686
01:41:19,548 --> 01:41:23,575
The brother here is gonna shred 'em with
his angel-be-good special. Huh, homey?

1687
01:41:23,652 --> 01:41:25,586
If they pass through that arch,
they come out clean.

1688
01:41:25,654 --> 01:41:27,781
And if they die,
they go straight up.

1689
01:41:27,856 --> 01:41:30,290
And hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1690
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:32,759
- Why don't they just kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1691
01:41:32,828 --> 01:41:35,661
Die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They don't want to go to hell.

1692
01:41:35,731 --> 01:41:39,599
Then what, are we supposed to just wait
for a solution to fall from the sky?

1693
01:41:43,805 --> 01:41:45,170
Friend of yours?

1694
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,174
No, that was a cardinal.

1695
01:41:47,242 --> 01:41:51,076
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1696
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:53,740
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1697
01:41:53,815 --> 01:41:55,077
Don't you listen?

1698
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:58,142
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1699
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:00,518
He's been at it for a while now.

1700
01:42:00,589 --> 01:42:02,181
Please! Please!

1701
01:42:03,358 --> 01:42:05,292
We ran out of parishioners...

1702
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:09,694
so he just started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping 'em.

1703
01:42:09,765 --> 01:42:12,996
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1704
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:16,129
If only they'd let us jerk off.

1705
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:19,269
Whoops.
Take a step back.

1706
01:42:23,612 --> 01:42:25,045
Let me go!

1707
01:42:26,181 --> 01:42:28,479
Why?
What are you trying to prove?

1708
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:31,951
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1709
01:42:32,954 --> 01:42:34,387
Jesus Christ!

1710
01:42:35,724 --> 01:42:37,658
I just wanted to go home.

1711
01:42:37,726 --> 01:42:39,557
But him, you know...

1712
01:42:39,628 --> 01:42:42,028
he just lost it.

1713
01:42:42,097 --> 01:42:45,328
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1714
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,867
He just snapped.

1715
01:42:46,935 --> 01:42:50,564
The funny thing is, this guy
could never even stand to see me work.

1716
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,733
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1717
01:42:54,776 --> 01:42:56,334
Now look at him.

1718
01:42:56,411 --> 01:42:58,470
This guy's fuckin' drunker than hell.

1719
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:01,038
Which means he's human now.

1720
01:43:02,417 --> 01:43:04,510
His wings have been cut off.

1721
01:43:11,126 --> 01:43:13,060
The muse?

1722
01:43:13,128 --> 01:43:15,221
Oh, no way!

1723
01:43:15,297 --> 01:43:18,095
I haven't seen you...
You look terrific. Wow!

1724
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:20,327
What's with the tits?
Can I...

1725
01:43:20,402 --> 01:43:22,666
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1726
01:43:26,041 --> 01:43:29,602
Tell me. Have you gone in
and come out through the archway yet?

1727
01:43:29,678 --> 01:43:31,043
No!

1728
01:43:36,118 --> 01:43:37,551
He's back.

1729
01:44:00,876 --> 01:44:02,810
We were awaiting your arrival.

1730
01:44:02,878 --> 01:44:05,938
Bartleby, wait. Stop.
Listen to me.

1731
01:44:06,014 --> 01:44:08,744
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1732
01:44:08,817 --> 01:44:10,079
If you go back...

1733
01:44:10,952 --> 01:44:13,944
I've become aware of the repercussions.
I know what I'm doing.

1734
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:17,085
You sick, twisted fuck!

1735
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:19,922
Bethany.

1736
01:44:23,098 --> 01:44:26,431
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1737
01:44:26,501 --> 01:44:29,436
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1738
01:44:29,504 --> 01:44:32,564
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1739
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:35,735
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1740
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:40,248
While you never see your ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his new wife...

1741
01:44:41,817 --> 01:44:43,079
and he is...

1742
01:44:46,254 --> 01:44:50,987
seeing you people every day on this
perfect world He created for you...

1743
01:44:51,059 --> 01:44:52,788
is a constant reminder...

1744
01:44:52,861 --> 01:44:55,921
that though my kind came first...

1745
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:58,090
your kind was most revered.

1746
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:01,700
And while you know forgiveness...

1747
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:03,704
we know only regret.

1748
01:45:04,773 --> 01:45:06,604
The lesson must be taught.

1749
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:08,609
All are accountable...

1750
01:45:08,677 --> 01:45:09,939
even God.

1751
01:45:11,213 --> 01:45:13,408
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1752
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:16,746
just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1753
01:45:17,986 --> 01:45:21,478
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1754
01:45:21,556 --> 01:45:23,046
will cease to be.

1755
01:45:23,124 --> 01:45:24,682
No. Hey. Hey!

1756
01:45:27,395 --> 01:45:29,329
I can't let you do that,
Bartleby.

1757
01:45:29,397 --> 01:45:31,490
This has gone too far.

1758
01:45:33,468 --> 01:45:35,902
I might have to take you down.

1759
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:39,270
It's okay. Shh.

1760
01:45:39,341 --> 01:45:40,933
I'll do it.

1761
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:47,648
My compatriot.

1762
01:45:48,984 --> 01:45:51,544
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1763
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:52,882
He's weakened.

1764
01:45:52,954 --> 01:45:54,421
You're weak.

1765
01:45:54,489 --> 01:45:57,322
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1766
01:45:57,392 --> 01:45:59,587
a condition which carries
two liabilities...

1767
01:46:01,396 --> 01:46:03,193
a conscience...

1768
01:46:03,999 --> 01:46:05,432
and...

1769
01:46:08,436 --> 01:46:11,030
a short life span.

1770
01:46:11,106 --> 01:46:13,904
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1771
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:43,604
He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1772
01:46:43,672 --> 01:46:45,970
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1773
01:46:47,342 --> 01:46:48,775
I can't believe this.

1774
01:46:48,843 --> 01:46:51,471
We're on the brink of nonexistence,
and God's still nowhere to be found.

1775
01:46:51,546 --> 01:46:54,640
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1776
01:47:01,523 --> 01:47:03,650
What the hell are you doing?

1777
01:47:03,725 --> 01:47:07,252
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1778
01:47:11,299 --> 01:47:14,234
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1779
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:17,897
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1780
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:20,908
- or we can get makin' with the love.
- What did you say?

1781
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:23,069
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1782
01:47:23,144 --> 01:47:24,668
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1783
01:47:28,483 --> 01:47:31,475
That guy, the one they won't take
off life support... John Doe Jersey.

1784
01:47:31,553 --> 01:47:33,612
This is where he's at...
St. Michael's Hospital.

1785
01:47:35,156 --> 01:47:36,623
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1786
01:47:36,691 --> 01:47:39,319
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1787
01:47:39,394 --> 01:47:41,862
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1788
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:43,989
- Have you ever been there?
- Once, with this chick.

1789
01:47:44,065 --> 01:47:47,091
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1790
01:47:47,168 --> 01:47:49,033
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1791
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:54,374
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1792
01:48:02,384 --> 01:48:05,478
Whatever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1793
01:48:05,553 --> 01:48:07,714
Bob, come with me.
Come on!

1794
01:48:07,789 --> 01:48:10,485
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1795
01:48:10,558 --> 01:48:12,788
I already did,
but it takes two of us!

1796
01:48:13,628 --> 01:48:15,858
<i>I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

1797
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:17,727
<i>This is the apocalypse.</i>

1798
01:48:17,799 --> 01:48:20,529
<i>Please exit the hospital</i>
<i>in an orderly fashion.</i>

1799
01:48:20,602 --> 01:48:22,365
<i>Thank you.</i>

1800
01:48:37,786 --> 01:48:39,413
Hey, Big Bird!

1801
01:48:40,288 --> 01:48:41,983
Ready for the counting game?

1802
01:48:46,761 --> 01:48:48,729
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1803
01:49:16,925 --> 01:49:18,893
No more bullets.

1804
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,155
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1805
01:49:21,229 --> 01:49:24,164
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1806
01:49:24,232 --> 01:49:26,291
You just did him a favor,
stupid!

1807
01:50:13,047 --> 01:50:15,743
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1808
01:50:56,858 --> 01:50:59,292
Oh, Bartleby.

1809
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:03,023
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1810
01:51:03,097 --> 01:51:05,190
Bow down, stupid!

1811
01:51:23,751 --> 01:51:25,685
I'm sorry.

1812
01:51:48,076 --> 01:51:51,273
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1813
01:51:51,346 --> 01:51:55,112
would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1814
01:51:55,183 --> 01:51:57,242
What the fuck?

1815
01:52:03,391 --> 01:52:05,416
Thank you.

1816
01:52:37,225 --> 01:52:38,886
It never ends!

1817
01:52:58,913 --> 01:53:01,006
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1818
01:53:01,082 --> 01:53:03,573
What the fuck is this shit?

1819
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:05,380
Who the fuck are you, lady?

1820
01:53:05,453 --> 01:53:07,921
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1821
01:53:07,989 --> 01:53:10,924
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1822
01:53:10,992 --> 01:53:13,961
What the fuck is this, <i>The Piano?</i>
Why ain't this broad talkin'?

1823
01:53:14,028 --> 01:53:19,364
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1824
01:53:19,434 --> 01:53:22,733
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fuckin' nuts?

1825
01:53:22,804 --> 01:53:25,773
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head?

1826
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,831
Shh.

1827
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:45,053
Where was she?

1828
01:53:45,126 --> 01:53:47,686
Imprisoned in a body.

1829
01:53:47,762 --> 01:53:50,697
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1830
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,792
Hang on a minute.

1831
01:54:28,269 --> 01:54:30,203
You missed a bit.

1832
01:54:31,739 --> 01:54:34,674
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1833
01:54:34,742 --> 01:54:37,210
You ready to make some of those
changes I been talking about?

1834
01:54:37,278 --> 01:54:38,438
We'll see.

1835
01:54:38,513 --> 01:54:40,071
Muse?

1836
01:54:40,148 --> 01:54:42,742
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1837
01:54:42,817 --> 01:54:45,081
you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1838
01:54:45,153 --> 01:54:48,088
First I gotta say good-bye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1839
01:54:48,156 --> 01:54:49,589
Oh, no.

1840
01:55:10,845 --> 01:55:13,313
Metatron, is she...

1841
01:55:13,381 --> 01:55:15,713
Afraid so.

1842
01:55:15,783 --> 01:55:19,776
One of the drawbacks to being a martyr
is that you have to die.

1843
01:55:19,854 --> 01:55:22,414
But no matter.

1844
01:55:31,933 --> 01:55:33,867
All is being taken care of.

1845
01:55:34,969 --> 01:55:36,402
How so?

1846
01:55:37,538 --> 01:55:40,632
Wax on, wax off.

1847
01:56:04,198 --> 01:56:05,324
How did I...

1848
01:56:05,399 --> 01:56:07,094
She can rebuild you.

1849
01:56:07,168 --> 01:56:08,760
She has the technology.

1850
01:56:08,836 --> 01:56:12,932
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1851
01:56:18,713 --> 01:56:19,839
That's...

1852
01:56:20,915 --> 01:56:23,713
A very relieved deity.

1853
01:56:25,486 --> 01:56:28,182
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come 'round.

1854
01:56:28,256 --> 01:56:30,690
Your kind always does.

1855
01:56:31,893 --> 01:56:34,361
You might want to
take good care of yourself.

1856
01:56:34,428 --> 01:56:37,226
We're gonna need you down the road.

1857
01:56:37,298 --> 01:56:39,766
I know.
I'm the last scion.

1858
01:56:42,436 --> 01:56:45,564
Well, you're half right.

1859
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:48,575
You were the last scion.

1860
01:56:50,311 --> 01:56:51,744
But now...

1861
01:56:52,813 --> 01:56:54,337
this...

1862
01:56:55,082 --> 01:56:57,175
is the last scion.

1863
01:57:00,221 --> 01:57:02,155
I'm pregnant?

1864
01:57:04,492 --> 01:57:06,653
Can't put anything past you.

1865
01:57:09,964 --> 01:57:12,489
Take care of that parcel for us.

1866
01:57:12,567 --> 01:57:16,503
She has a world of work
ahead of her.

1867
01:57:27,915 --> 01:57:29,974
Thank you for...

1868
01:57:30,051 --> 01:57:32,042
I don't know...

1869
01:57:32,119 --> 01:57:33,381
everything.

1870
01:57:37,124 --> 01:57:40,560
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1871
01:57:40,628 --> 01:57:44,689
most of it questioning your great plan,
and that'd be arrogant of me, I know.

1872
01:57:45,466 --> 01:57:47,593
But there is one I need to ask.

1873
01:57:47,668 --> 01:57:51,297
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1874
01:57:53,274 --> 01:57:55,242
Why are we here?

1875
01:58:11,826 --> 01:58:14,761
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1876
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:24,230
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1877
01:58:24,972 --> 01:58:27,133
It was an honor.

1878
01:58:31,812 --> 01:58:34,747
You did so well.

1879
01:58:39,387 --> 01:58:42,322
I told you She was a woman.

1880
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:46,657
She's not really a woman.

1881
01:58:46,727 --> 01:58:49,195
She's not really anything.

1882
01:58:49,263 --> 01:58:50,924
She's something, all right.

1883
01:58:52,133 --> 01:58:54,363
Crisis of faith over?

1884
01:58:54,435 --> 01:58:57,370
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1885
01:58:57,438 --> 01:58:59,372
When it rains, it pours.

1886
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:01,670
Are you saying you believe?

1887
01:59:02,977 --> 01:59:04,968
But I have a good idea.

1888
01:59:05,046 --> 01:59:06,479
Yes!

1889
01:59:10,418 --> 01:59:12,352
The Man was right about you.

1890
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:15,446
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell Him so.

1891
01:59:16,357 --> 01:59:18,291
And if you clean up your language...

1892
01:59:18,359 --> 01:59:20,827
I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1893
01:59:20,895 --> 01:59:22,487
Thanks.

1894
01:59:24,031 --> 01:59:26,465
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1895
01:59:29,303 --> 01:59:31,066
Rufus.

1896
01:59:57,465 --> 01:59:59,899
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1897
02:00:04,739 --> 02:00:06,673
Youse guys
wanna hear something sick?

1898
02:00:06,741 --> 02:00:09,676
I got half a stalk
when she kissed me.

1899
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:12,178
I couldn't help it.
The bitch was hot.

1900
02:00:12,246 --> 02:00:16,808
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1901
02:00:16,884 --> 02:00:18,374
You're pregnant?

1902
02:00:20,054 --> 02:00:23,581
You know, when you're pregnant you can
have sex until the third trimester.

1903
02:00:23,657 --> 02:00:25,591
I'll keep that in mind.

1904
02:08:05,619 --> 02:08:09,521
<i>So, that would make Bethany</i>
<i>part black?</i>
