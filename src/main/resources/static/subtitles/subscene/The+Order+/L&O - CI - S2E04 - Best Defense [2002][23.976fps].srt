1
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,466
Sir, everything all right?

2
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,167
Yes, sure, Officer, I'm fine.

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,540
Peter Bonham. New York
District Attorney's office.

4
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,670
We're here to interview a witness.

5
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,773
Where's your witness?

6
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,646
He's a no-show.

7
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,119
You gentlemen be careful.

8
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,553
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,356
Now can we go?

10
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,465
- Too bad he didn't show up.
- Hmm.

11
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,372
He was probably scared off.
I should've gone by myself.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,707
I could've put three more
burglary raps on Walters.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,710
Peter, do you need a feather
in your cap that badly?

14
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,117
Excuse me.

15
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,118
Hello? Yes, who's this?

16
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,282
What? Oh, my God. Well, where...

17
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,423
How is...

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,922
Yes, yes, yes, I'm writing it down. I will.

19
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,195
Did you call 911?

20
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,761
I'll be there.
Just, please, call 911.

21
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,035
it's Linda. They said she passed out.

22
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,839
- Where?
- Some tenement uptown,

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,847
she was meeting a pro bono
client, they can't wake her.

24
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,348
They found my number in her wallet.

25
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,078
They called you before they called 911?

26
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,514
It doesn't sound right.

27
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,920
You should try calling her
on your cell phone.

28
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,464
Linda? Oh, thank God.
Where are you?

29
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,368
I'll explain later. I'll see you at home.

30
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,830
She was having lunch at Chanterelle.

31
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,205
That is really weird.

32
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,642
Maybe not.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,373
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,177
The phantom witness. Now this phone call.

35
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,683
No. No.

36
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:24,917
It's just probably some stupid prank.

37
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,156
Who do you think is doing this?
Someone you prosecuted?

38
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,253
Maybe it was one of your old clients,

39
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,197
maybe they feel you didn't argue
their case with enough zeal?

40
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,960
Mommy? Mommy, I made you a drawing.

41
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,233
Oh, sweetie, that is beautiful!

42
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,774
It's your office, Mommy. And that's me.

43
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,311
Can you draw a picture
with you in Daddy's office?

44
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,146
No. Your office is yucky.

45
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,440
Well, Sara, if you draw me a nice picture,

46
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,454
I'll put it in my office
and then it won't be so yucky.

47
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,683
Okay. Mommy, come help me.

48
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,883
Okay.

49
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,627
The seats are right behind the dugout.

50
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,962
Linda's at a trial attorney's
convention in San Francisco that week.

51
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,160
- I have to be with Sara.
- Ah, just bring her.

52
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,567
You know, you could stuff
her full of hot dogs.

53
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,037
I'll see you tomorrow.

54
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,071
Shut up, you do.

55
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,746
Mr. Bonham, what happened? Are you okay?

56
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,185
Yeah, yeah. The brakes, I couldn't stop.

57
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,346
- You said the brakes?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,084
I kept pressing down but nothing
happened. What are you doing?

59
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,750
I know something about cars.

60
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,387
No wonder your brakes didn't work.

61
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,523
Somebody punched a hole in your brake line.

62
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,451
The lines had been perforated

63
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,510
so the brakes would go out on your way home.

64
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,216
I take the FDR home. I could've been killed.

65
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,054
Do you drive your car to work every day?

66
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,720
Oh, just Wednesdays. I pick up
my daughter at her swimming lessons.

67
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,457
I take her out for Chinese food.

68
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,931
Did you trace the address
of that tenement uptown?

69
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,797
It was an abandoned building.

70
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,963
I can't believe...

71
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,102
Ron, if you hadn't told me to call
Linda on her cell phone, I...

72
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,769
The no-show witness, who did
he have information on?

73
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,573
Eric Walters.

74
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,774
Walters is looking at two-to-four
on a simple burglary.

75
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:07,250
Until we know what's what, I'd like to
post a patrol car in front of your home.

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,720
No. I don't want to alarm my family.

77
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,656
Anyway, Linda's out of town
this week in San Francisco.

78
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,489
I'll send Sara to stay with her grandmother.

79
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,858
That still leaves you.

80
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,360
I have a carry permit for it.

81
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,027
I do not intend to be a sitting duck.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,806
His list of cases, larcenies,
fraud, possession.

83
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,315
All low-profile nonviolent crimes.

84
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,116
I take it he's not one of your starters.

85
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,882
Peter may not be the most brilliant
prosecutor in our office,

86
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,950
but right now he's the one in the most danger.

87
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,153
Let me know what you find out.

88
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,494
I got no beef with Mr. Bonham.

89
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,334
He's got his job and I got mine.

90
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,000
What's that, burglary, accessory to murder?

91
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,634
I don't get with no murder.

92
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,975
Someone used your name to lure Bonham

93
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,514
to a phony meeting at Hunts Point.

94
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,312
That's like saying somebody picked
his name out of a phone book.

95
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,410
Hey, man, Mr. Bonham gets killed,

96
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,422
I don't see it helps my case. Does it?

97
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,391
Eric, be quiet. It was nice talking to you.

98
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,828
I wonder how many other inmates
have asked the same question.

99
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,633
If a prosecutor dies during a case?

100
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,637
No inmate's asked for information
on that specific question.

101
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,770
What about the legal issues it would raise?

102
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,974
Most likely the right to a speedy trial.

103
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,641
A Sixth Amendment issue.

104
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,152
Everybody here wants to know
about the Sixth Amendment.

105
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,292
Big caseload, Counselor?

106
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,860
I'm just working on my own case.

107
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,900
Really? You were charged with rape?

108
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,366
You're researching People v. Williams.

109
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,610
That's all about a defendant's
access to a victim's sexual history.

110
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,875
What do you want, Detective?

111
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,820
Have any inmates asked you
about the legal impact

112
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,791
of a prosecutor's untimely death?

113
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,854
That would be privileged information.

114
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,396
There's no privilege for jailhouse lawyers.

115
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,830
I can make the argument there is

116
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,958
if the client had an expectation

117
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,697
his communications with me
would remain confidential.

118
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,931
Oh, brother.

119
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,271
No, actually, Eames, he has a very good point.

120
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,908
But in this case,

121
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:52,144
rule 1.6 of the ABA
Code of Conduct would apply.

122
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,113
Even if the client told me
of an impending crime,

123
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,156
the code doesn't impose any
affirmative obligation on me.

124
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,488
It's my call.

125
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,994
And the code also says

126
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,588
a lawyer must refrain from
morally reprehensible conduct.

127
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,930
Since you have discretion
to breach the privilege,

128
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,798
not doing so when a life is at stake

129
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,130
is morally reprehensible.

130
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,844
Artie Kahn. He made bail last week.

131
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,746
You called my lawyer, right?

132
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,014
We talked to your other lawyer.

133
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,111
Other lawyer?

134
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,622
The one in Rikers. The one you told

135
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,455
you were going to whack your
prosecutor, Peter Bonham.

136
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,392
I never told him that.

137
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,656
I just asked what would happen

138
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,428
if Bonham up and died.

139
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,492
And you said it just like that,

140
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,233
out of intellectual curiosity?

141
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,403
Yeah, out of that.

142
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,740
It just so happens, somebody's
been trying to kill Bonham.

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,575
They cut the brakes on his car.

144
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,046
- No way.
- Yeah.

145
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,879
Whoever did this would've gotten
brake fluid on their hands.

146
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,448
Brake fluid leaves a residue.

147
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,287
No matter how much you wash,
you can't get it off.

148
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,792
You can't see it either.

149
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,351
You know what this is?

150
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,795
It's a towelette thing.

151
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,729
It's a special towelette thing.

152
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:19,897
It has a liquid on it that
reacts with brake fluid residue.

153
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,972
If you have any brake fluid residue
on your hands, it shows up.

154
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,775
Go ahead, Artie. Wipe your hands.

155
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,622
I didn't cut no brake line.

156
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,854
Then why the questions about
Bonham dropping dead?

157
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,557
Because two weeks ago I was at Rikers,

158
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,526
on the phone,

159
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,967
and there was a guy on the phone next to me,

160
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,164
talking about Bonham having an accident.

161
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,473
Is it this guy?

162
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,873
I didn't really look, you know.

163
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,074
I had my back to the guy.

164
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,514
You were listening.

165
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,143
What did he say, his exact words?

166
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,892
He was gonna pay good money for
Bonham to have an accident.

167
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,058
A permanent accident.

168
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,000
Did you know that they're shooting
chicken eggs through a shower head,

169
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,900
boiling it, mixing it with sea
brine and calling it caviar?

170
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,267
Hello, everybody?

171
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,001
Ah, our dedicated civil servant.

172
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,906
Honey, the play starts in 45 minutes.

173
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,675
I'll just change shirts.

174
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,238
Oh, a Detective Goren called you.

175
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,545
He said he tried you at the
office, but you had already left.

176
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,087
I'll call him tomorrow. Something wrong?

177
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,451
Well, I can't find the Pomerol.

178
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,047
I asked you to bring it up this morning.

179
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,921
I thought you said any old Merlot.

180
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,325
Could you be a sweetheart
and get it from the cellar?

181
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,493
Sure. Okay.

182
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,294
Oh! We found the best place to buy caviar.

183
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,397
In Istanbul. Have you been?

184
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,334
No. We're always wanting to travel,

185
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,775
but with Peter's busy schedule...

186
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,144
I came down to get a bottle of wine.

187
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:55,186
I was about to turn the
corner when I heard a noise.

188
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,125
He shot at me. I...

189
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:04,659
I shot back. He was trying to kill me.

190
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,644
There's one round missing.

191
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,941
Serial number's been filed off.

192
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,146
I got burglary tools in here.

193
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:26,555
Lock-pick set, diamond
chisels, cordless drill,

194
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,985
the guy was trying to make it
look like a burglary gone bad.

195
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,226
This is what we're supposed
to think he was after.

196
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,710
Gary Burke. Work ID. Bartender downtown.

197
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,507
He's gonna be late.

198
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:56,277
Burke was feeling lucky. Stopped
by the OTB this afternoon.

199
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,845
Must be a couple grand's
worth of bets here.

200
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:11,761
Check the locks for lubricant.
Both sides of the door.

201
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,599
Yes, sir.

202
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,570
Just covering all the bases.

203
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,502
Do you use the basement door often?

204
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,774
No. I think the lock's rusted.

205
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,314
Oh, well, it's working fine now.

206
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,344
Well, of course it's working. This man's
a burglar. He knows how to open locks.

207
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,615
Why assume he's a burglar?

208
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,322
Well, he came for the safe. Didn't you see it?

209
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,590
We did.

210
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,025
What do you keep in there?

211
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,760
Nothing. It came with the house.

212
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,166
We only lock it because of Sara.

213
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,371
Well, how would a burglar know about it?

214
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,965
Oh, we've had workers down there.
They always ask about it.

215
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,909
But you don't think it was a burglary.

216
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,411
No, but he brought burglary tools with him,

217
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,608
maybe to help with the cover story.

218
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,874
Cover story? What do you mean?

219
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,547
We have an ID on the intruder. Gary Burke.

220
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,056
Either of you ever seen him before?

221
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,015
No.

222
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,686
You ever prosecute him?

223
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,789
He has along rap sheet, muggings,
drug possession. No burglary.

224
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,460
No, I don't recognize him.

225
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,333
You didn't answer my question.
What's going on here?

226
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,137
Someone's put a contract
out on your husband's life.

227
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,343
You can't be serious!

228
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:34,375
The phone call, the car, it's all...
it's all part of it.

229
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,516
Oh, my God, Peter.

230
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,459
But he's okay now, right? I mean, he's safe.

231
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,530
It depends on how determined this person is.

232
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,702
And we have no way of knowing that.

233
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,633
Mr. Sanchez, what are they doing here?

234
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,974
They're cops.

235
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,377
Lori lives here with Gary.

236
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,677
- Where's Gary?
- He's gotten himself into trouble.

237
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,739
What trouble?

238
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,150
The trouble somebody gave him
a lot of money to get into.

239
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,482
I don't know about any money.

240
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,614
The $2 grand he spent at the OTB?

241
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,785
The $3 grand you spent on new
dresses, new shoes, new handbags.

242
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,328
Gary saved up his bar tips.

243
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,557
You're really good at keeping secrets.

244
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,226
Me, I just run off at the mouth.

245
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,702
For example, I'll probably tell
Gary that you were out all evening.

246
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,363
Gary knows I was with my friends.

247
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,668
Look at your hair.

248
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,902
It looks like you just
walked out of the shower.

249
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,570
I know I'm gonna say something
to Gary about your hair.

250
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,171
I went to the gym. I took a shower there.

251
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,273
Really? They let you smoke cigars at the gym?

252
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,215
Because you smell like cigar smoke!

253
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,811
I know I'll just blurt that out to Gary.

254
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,050
Gee, Lori, thanks to my partner's big
mouth, Gary might get the impression

255
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,925
you're fooling around with some guy who
smokes cigars and lets you use his shower.

256
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,760
Please, don't tell him that. He'll hit me.

257
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,064
Okay.

258
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,774
Let's go from the top.

259
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,003
Where did the money come from?

260
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,571
I don't know.

261
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:16,780
Gary got a lot of calls from this buddy
of his in prison. JoJo Martinez.

262
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,616
Please, you can't tell Gary I said anything.

263
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,888
I don't think you have to
worry about Gary anymore.

264
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,328
Gary Burke was apprehended

265
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,763
while trying to shoot one of
my colleagues, Peter Bonham.

266
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,529
Mr. Burke hasn't yet decided
to cooperate with us,

267
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:35,061
but we'd like to give your
client first crack at a plea.

268
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,141
A plea? Why? You think he's involved?

269
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,138
Yes, we do.

270
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,505
Of course, if he'd rather wait for Mr.
Burke to implicate him...

271
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,014
Give me a minute to talk to my client...

272
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,984
Vince, shut up. They're playing you.

273
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,947
Gary Burke is dead.

274
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,215
How do you know that?

275
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,587
PNN, Prison News Network.

276
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,752
That's the same place we get our news from.

277
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,657
Yeah. One of their reporters

278
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,134
heard you on the phone a couple of weeks ago

279
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,863
putting out a contract on Bonham.

280
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,937
Screw that.

281
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,041
Why would I want to hurt that man?

282
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,009
Because he's about to put you away for life?

283
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,478
You're facing your third
felony drug conviction.

284
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,346
Bonham told us he turned you
down for a plea bargain.

285
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,577
That's hardly a motive for murder.

286
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,313
I don't need to kill this
DA to beat this rap.

287
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,015
- JoJo, let me handle...
- Don't "JoJo" me.

288
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,883
The hell with all of you.

289
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:31,258
That's a nice... What you're wearing.

290
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,522
I mean, where'd you get
that from? Is that from Peru?

291
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:40,696
What do they call that? A serap... A serape.

292
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,761
No, it's a...

293
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,707
S-s-s-sweater.

294
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,770
It's a sweater.

295
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,082
Right. Somebody make that for you?

296
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,762
I was reviewing Mr. Martinez's case file,

297
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:09,766
and I noticed you missed a filing deadline
on a motion to suppress drug evidence.

298
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,233
He specifically asked me not to file it.

299
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,497
And why would he do that?

300
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,938
I don't know. I tried to talk
to his mother about it.

301
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,308
What does she have to do with it?

302
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,209
She's paying his legal bills.
$200 bucks a week.

303
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,442
Or I should say, she was.
She stopped three weeks ago.

304
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,677
But I still have to do what Martinez says.

305
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,530
It sounds like JoJo's getting
ready to cut him loose.

306
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,624
That only makes sense if he's
trading up for a better lawyer.

307
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,669
Better lawyers cost more than $200 a week.

308
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,726
It begs the question

309
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,001
where is Mr. Martinez getting the money
to pay for better representation?

310
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,565
Same place Gary Burke got his money?

311
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,178
JoJo's mom might know.

312
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,051
I don't know anything about a new lawyer.

313
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,745
I just do what my son tells me.

314
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,186
He asked you to stop paying Mr. Quitoriano?

315
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,087
I just got behind, that's all.

316
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,995
You made JoJo's sweater.

317
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,859
He was wearing it when we were talking
to him. It's a nice-looking sweater.

318
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,863
This one's even more stunning.

319
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:26,138
Eames, look at the sleeve.

320
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:32,046
This raglan sleeve is laid in so effortlessly.

321
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,917
Under the seam, at the armpit,
it's like a little pouch?

322
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,252
I see it. You can hide something in there.

323
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:43,225
Hmm, and there's another one in this sleeve.

324
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,889
Just big enough for messages,

325
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,027
money, drugs.

326
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,699
You don't tell us the truth,

327
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,828
you could have your visiting
privileges revoked.

328
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,533
Please, it was just messages.

329
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,972
What was in those messages?

330
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,703
Were they about the new lawyer?

331
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,244
I don't look.

332
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,642
But JoJo did get a new lawyer.

333
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,949
How is he paying for it?

334
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,747
He said it wouldn't cost anything.

335
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,756
That the lawyer would work for free.
He said she's the best.

336
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,819
The new lawyer's a woman. What's her name?

337
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,224
I don't know.

338
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,762
JoJo said she can fix everything

339
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,889
when she gets back from California.

340
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,699
All right, Mrs. Martinez. Thank you.

341
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,530
And no more sweaters, okay?

342
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,507
Bonham's wife was supposed to
be in San Francisco next week.

343
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,209
JoJo's new lawyer.

344
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,271
JoJo's payback for having her husband killed.

345
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,113
Talk about pro bono.

346
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,565
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

347
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,167
I didn't know you knew Alfonzo.

348
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,470
John? Just from court.

349
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,137
He was just asking me
about the shooting, so...

350
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,569
Oh.

351
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,705
I have a hearing in an hour.
Do you wanna get lunch?

352
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,649
Peter, can I talk to you?

353
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:18,052
The police suspect Martinez is connected
to this attempt on your life.

354
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,522
Their suspicions are completely
without merit, of course,

355
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,686
but, regardless, I want you to recuse
yourself from Martinez's drug case.

356
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,787
That's not necessary. I can remain objective.

357
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,731
Who are you kidding? They think
he tried to have you killed.

358
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,660
Linda, could you explain to
your husband why he should...

359
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,965
Don't talk to her!

360
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,438
You wanna have me relieved,
make an application.

361
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,135
Unless a judge tells me,
I am not stepping down.

362
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,614
Peter, I don't think that
he was being unreasonable.

363
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,277
Can we just get lunch?

364
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:53,983
I can't, actually, I have a deposition
at 1:00. So, I'll see you tonight.

365
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:06,600
Linda Bonham's involvement would explain
how Gary Burke got into their house

366
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,400
using a door with a rusted lock.

367
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,532
Not to mention, she was working hard
to sell the burglary cover story.

368
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,237
She's one of the most respected
trial attorneys in the city.

369
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,678
She is married to a second-rate prosecutor.

370
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,080
She may be ready to trade up
to something better.

371
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,641
That's what divorces are for.

372
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,415
She's the bread-winner, she'd
end up paying him alimony.

373
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:29,316
Until you present me with
incontrovertible proof that she's involved,

374
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,421
I will not be applying for warrants,

375
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,953
issuing subpoenas nor presenting
evidence to a grand jury.

376
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,899
I will not embarrass Peter Bonham.

377
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,645
So, Linda sent poor Peter down to
the cellar to fetch the Pomerol

378
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,241
and that's when the bullets started flying.

379
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,013
It was her idea to send him down there?

380
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,383
Yes.

381
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:58,888
How well did you know the Bonhams?

382
00:22:58,944 --> 00:22:59,979
Oh, not well.

383
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,822
I met Linda at a brunch.
We had common interests.

384
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,726
Linda Bonham's interest is in the fact

385
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,458
that Allison's sister is on the
board of the Canterbury School.

386
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,090
She's trying to get her daughter admitted.

387
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,692
I already told her they live
far too east of Park Avenue

388
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,294
to stand a chance of being admitted.

389
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,136
Being partner in her law firm
doesn't count for anything?

390
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:20,837
Well, some law partnerships
are forged in the courtroom,

391
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,141
- some in the boardroom...
- And the bedroom?

392
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,273
Oh, Jerry, knock it off.

393
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,817
Oh, no, please, my partner
loves rumor and innuendo.

394
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:29,650
Don't take my word for it.

395
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,381
Ask Rodney Brooks.

396
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,083
He's a litigator at Linda's old law firm,

397
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,753
and I'm told that he was one of her
stepping stones two years ago.

398
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,860
I was a jerk, okay?

399
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,027
Linda had just moved to a
new firm and made partner.

400
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,434
People were envious, they
were taking shots at her...

401
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,370
She slept her way to the
top, that sort of thing?

402
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,170
Right. So, one night at the cigar club,

403
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:56,202
I don't know, I had one Gibson
too many, I made up a story.

404
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,805
You know, like I said, I was a jerk.

405
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,946
Linda's successful because she
is smart and ambitious. Okay?

406
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,888
You handle civil lawsuits, right?

407
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,551
Ms. Bonham ever work with you?

408
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,959
Sometimes. She's good at prepping witnesses.

409
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,997
I work mostly with expert witnesses.

410
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,125
But ordinary citizens who've
never been on the stand before,

411
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,600
Linda was the best.

412
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,469
You ever work with a witness
named JoJo Martinez?

413
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,565
I wouldn't remember.

414
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,109
He stuttered.

415
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,905
That rings a bell.

416
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,650
Sure, about four years ago,
a landlord-tenant suit.

417
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,184
I don't remember the guy's name,

418
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,188
but Linda helped him get over his stutter.

419
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,222
Could you dig up a file on him by
tomorrow? We could send someone over.

420
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,659
Oh, sure.

421
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,361
Martinez's hesitation before words
starting with the letter "S"?

422
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,231
It's the mark of a former stutterer.

423
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,569
That's his name on the witness
list for the lawsuit.

424
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,403
That's how he knows Ms. Bonham.

425
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,001
That's how she came to hire
him to kill her husband

426
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,104
in return for money and
future legal representation.

427
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,982
The floor is yours, Mr. Quitoriano.

428
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,259
You send me an offer in writing,

429
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,160
my client will make a statement.

430
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,597
I'm sure it's just routine.
You know how the police...

431
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,003
They questioned our friends, my colleagues,

432
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,201
they're trading in gossip, it's humiliating.

433
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,767
If you weren't one of the best
defense attorneys in the city,

434
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,506
they wouldn't be doing this to you.

435
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,947
They're doing it to you, too,
Peter. Your own people!

436
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,576
I doubt the DA's office
is even aware that...

437
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,119
Is Ms. Bonham home?

438
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,217
What do you want?

439
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,695
Linda Bonham, we have a
warrant for your arrest.

440
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,663
What? What possible grounds could you have?

441
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:56,791
I wanna see the warrant.

442
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,198
Put your hands behind your back, please.

443
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,998
For God's sake, is that necessary?

444
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,231
It's for her own protection.

445
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,240
Peter, it doesn't matter. Just call
Bill Stanton, tell him what's happening,

446
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,775
and tell Sara that I am at work.

447
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,910
She'll be at the Major Case Squad.

448
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,546
You're insane to think that
I would ever hurt Peter.

449
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,052
The insanity is you thinking
you'd get away with it.

450
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,645
But I have no motive!

451
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:23,549
I'm sure we'll find it, maybe in one of these.

452
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,187
All your electronic gizmos.

453
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,533
Maybe we'll find a boyfriend's number

454
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,903
or a message that you forgot to delete.

455
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:40,136
You know what confounds me?
With all these gizmos,

456
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,611
people still think they
can get away with murder.

457
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,382
What's more confounding is sometimes they do.

458
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:09,135
Your phone has a display for caller ID?

459
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,232
Yes.

460
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:17,212
When you get a call, you check
the display before answering it?

461
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:20,274
Yes. I don't understand - what...

462
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,251
You screen your calls.

463
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,396
Excuse us a minute.

464
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,540
Peter Bonham got a call
that his wife had passed out,

465
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,640
the call to lure him
to the abandoned building.

466
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,981
He called her to see if she was all right.

467
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,850
He called her on her cell phone.

468
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,785
His number would've been
displayed on her phone.

469
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,292
She would've seen it was him calling.

470
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,763
If she was really involved in a
scheme to lure him to his death...

471
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,389
She wouldn't have answered her phone.

472
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,128
That's right, she wouldn't. But she did.

473
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,265
Because she didn't know about any scheme.

474
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,170
It's him.

475
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,043
He's framing her. He wants to get rid of her.

476
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,778
Divorce is out of the question,
he wouldn't get a dime.

477
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,443
And he can't have her killed,
he'd be the obvious suspect.

478
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,544
But he can send her to jail for life.

479
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,886
So far it's working, all the
evidence points to her.

480
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,120
It won't be easy to get him.

481
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,358
He can't know we're on to him.

482
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,999
Martinez said he got $20,000 to
arrange the hit on Peter Bonham.

483
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,007
We just wanna trace it to Linda Bonham.

484
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,838
Just dotting all the "I's."

485
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,775
Let me know what you come up with.

486
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,310
How long are we keeping him in the dark?

487
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,648
Until we have an incontrovertible
case against Peter Bonham.

488
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,449
Starting with tracing
the $20,000 back to him.

489
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,319
I'm just finding the usual checks,

490
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:11,054
groceries, mortgage, doctor.

491
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,388
Which doctor?

492
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,963
A Dr. David Kipper on Park Avenue.

493
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,160
He was writing him checks every month.

494
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,295
Yeah.

495
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:27,906
I've got 11 charges on Bonham's credit card

496
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,539
to Kipper in the last year. Yeah.

497
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,012
Look at the deposits made
to the Bonham's account.

498
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,082
Just the same amount every couple
of weeks. Probably paychecks.

499
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:44,550
Bonham's covered under the
same city medical plan we are.

500
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,061
He pays the doctor,

501
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,190
the insurance company sends
him a reimbursement check.

502
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,463
Well, there's no record
he deposited those checks.

503
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,743
She's finally asleep.

504
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,282
Maybe we should have her
stay up at my mother's.

505
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:12,322
I'm worried that she'll hear
things at her school.

506
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,288
It's pre-school, Linda.

507
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:18,225
They talk about Sponge Bob,
not stuff like this.

508
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,938
Peter, if you want me to sleep in
the guest room, I'll understand.

509
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:35,809
No, no. Don't be silly.

510
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,383
Sweetheart,

511
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,289
I need to tell you this.

512
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:50,291
I have never cheated on you. Never.

513
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,553
You know that, don't you?

514
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,326
Sure, of course.

515
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,459
And the police said that I was ashamed of you.

516
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,528
I mean, that's just not true. I have
always admired you for what you do.

517
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,164
You don't have to say anything.

518
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,142
And when I made partner, I was happy for us,

519
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,236
it just meant that our life
would be better. And Sara's.

520
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:29,993
The insurance company says

521
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,093
two years ago Bonham stopped
depositing the reimbursement checks

522
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,968
and started just cashing them.
He's been hoarding the money.

523
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:37,463
How much are we talking about?

524
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,906
About $25,000.

525
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,741
All from routine doctor's visits,
check-ups, little aches and pains.

526
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:46,772
He's used his insurance money to
build a war chest to frame his wife.

527
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,317
Two years ago

528
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,253
Bonham won a conviction over
George Kolinsky for a drug case.

529
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,381
Kolinsky got 20 years.

530
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,722
Hired a new lawyer and appealed.

531
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,184
The conviction was overturned,

532
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,094
most of the charges were set aside.

533
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,497
Kolinsky ended up serving a year.

534
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:05,658
All thanks to his new lawyer.

535
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,203
Linda Bonham.

536
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,601
The guy's a prosecutor. He knows
losing a case is part of the game.

537
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,801
There's losing. And then
there's losing to your wife.

538
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,277
And then there's getting your
balls handed to you on a platter.

539
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,473
His wife had just made partner,

540
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,608
there were rumors of infidelities.

541
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,208
The guy stayed with her for two years,

542
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,551
sleeping in the same bed,
just waiting for payback?

543
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:30,650
This guy's a poster boy for
passive-aggressive personality disorder.

544
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:35,664
He doesn't confront his wife, he doesn't
argue with her, he doesn't contradict her.

545
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,367
Instead he uses us, the police,

546
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,597
the DA's office to nail her.

547
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,674
It's time we let Mr. Carver know

548
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,143
he's prosecuting the wrong person.

549
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:51,772
We can't tell him without Bonham finding out.

550
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,741
You want me to keep Carver out of the loop?

551
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,213
Okay. We'll tell him when we're ready.

552
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,953
Any idea when that will be?

553
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,391
Bonham's done a great job of burying his wife.

554
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:08,022
There is someone who might be
able to help us dig her out.

555
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,855
JoJo Martinez.

556
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,002
My client laid everything
out in his statement.

557
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,800
He called Miss Bonham twice. That's
when she told him what she wanted.

558
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,568
She sent the money to his mother,

559
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,166
and Gary Burke collected his
share from Mrs. Martinez.

560
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,542
How did you know when to call Miss Bonham?

561
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:26,174
She s-s-sent the notes to my mother

562
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,218
with the phone number and when to call.

563
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,913
The notes your mother sewed into the sweaters?

564
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,978
My mother didn't know what was going down.

565
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,490
The number you called, you still have it?

566
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,755
No. It was different numbers both times.

567
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,494
C-c-cell phone numbers.

568
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:51,737
How did you know it was Ms.
Bonham that you were talking to?

569
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,575
I mean, did you recognize her voice?

570
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,908
No. She just s-s-said who she was.

571
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,716
And it was the same lady both times?

572
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:11,020
I guess. I don't know. The s-s-second
time she called she said she had a cold.

573
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,860
Was there any chit-chat or just business?

574
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,564
Just business. She told me what she
wanted me to do and that was that.

575
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,274
The numbers he called were
probably prepaid cell phones.

576
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,337
Untraceable.

577
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,508
And the woman he talked to?

578
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,778
Most likely two different women.

579
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,479
Most likely prostitutes Bonham
hired for the occasion.

580
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,920
The times the calls were
made corresponded to times

581
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,423
when Linda Bonham was home alone.

582
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:45,086
With no verifiable alibi.
Bonham thought of everything.

583
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,895
What's that?

584
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:52,094
It's Martinez's statement. I'm improving it.

585
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,038
3 calls?

586
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,870
Didn't you just tell me Martinez made 2 calls?

587
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,841
Well, now he's made 3.

588
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,935
I need to get this re-typed.

589
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,378
Don't expect me to beg for a plea
bargain for something that I didn't do!

590
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,355
Miss Bonham, I'm offering
this out of consideration...

591
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,583
I'm innocent.

592
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,922
I know you hear it from defendants
all the time, but I am innocent.

593
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,758
We have Mr. Martinez's statement.

594
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,422
He says he talked to you.

595
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,227
It's just not true.

596
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,100
Let's show her the statement.

597
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,965
It's on the second page when he
talks about the phone calls.

598
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,445
He lists the calls, date and time.

599
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,375
If there's anyone who can verify

600
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,849
you didn't get the calls, tell us.

601
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,415
Well, these first two,
I might have been alone.

602
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,317
But this third one, I remember
this Sunday, I was with Peter.

603
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,293
We went to Connecticut for a drive.

604
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,954
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

605
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,557
We talked about getting a summer rental.

606
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,796
We even got lobster rolls at a food stand.

607
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,566
Ask Peter. I did not get a phone call.

608
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,163
This whole thing is a pack of lies.

609
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:07,870
Well, we'll certainly
look into it, Ms. Bonham.

610
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,737
Why not ask Peter right now?

611
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:14,045
Yes, ask him! Please, just ask him.

612
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,400
It's Ron. Could you come down to the office?

613
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,629
Yeah, thank you.

614
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,448
This date here. It's a Sunday.

615
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:59,557
That's one of the times Martinez
said he talked to your wife.

616
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,692
Do you remember where you
were that afternoon?

617
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,470
I was with Sara in Central Park.

618
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,304
With Linda?

619
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:20,909
No. She stayed home.

620
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,149
So, you weren't in Connecticut?

621
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,395
Peter, don't you remember?

622
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:39,031
We stopped to eat right outside of Guilford.

623
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,592
Ms. Bonham, I'm sorry.

624
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,468
Peter, what's the matter?
You have to remember.

625
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,007
- Linda, let's go.
- No.

626
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,168
- Peter.
- Linda, please.

627
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:52,375
We dug for clams with Sara.

628
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:05,157
Oh, my God, no, you...
You son of a bitch, you...

629
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,824
That's enough, Linda.

630
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:11,493
Oh, my God! How could you?

631
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,611
I need to...

632
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,839
Now she knows.

633
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,748
She knows it was you.

634
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,014
What's he talking about?

635
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,716
What are you talking about, Detective?

636
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,161
Well, you just couldn't resist.

637
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,423
Resist what?

638
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,958
Letting his wife know that
he's the one who framed her.

639
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,099
What?

640
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,799
That's not true.

641
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:57,136
Martinez never said that he
called your wife that Sunday.

642
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,675
That was me. I revised the statement.

643
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:09,285
The truth is, is Linda was
in Connecticut with you.

644
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:13,695
Not only did you stop for
food, you stopped for gas.

645
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:18,791
$12 worth.

646
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:26,634
It's right here on his credit card bill.

647
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:33,579
Maybe you forgot. Maybe you didn't.

648
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:38,415
But you could either confirm
your wife's alibi

649
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:41,955
or confirm Martinez's statement.

650
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:45,891
It's a tough choice.

651
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,397
Oh, I see.

652
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:56,167
It was brilliant, Peter.

653
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,769
You put that little wife
of yours in her place.

654
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,871
Her and her big salary,
her successful law practice.

655
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,980
All the things that she accomplished

656
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:14,353
with no regard for you,
for your... your feelings.

657
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,092
When she took the Kolinsky appeal,

658
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,755
how did she rationalize it?

659
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,391
Did she tell you

660
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:27,231
that there were important
constitutional issues at stake?

661
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:32,940
And when she beat you, did she go "Aw,
shucks, honey, it's not personal."

662
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:41,543
Who was she kidding? It was personal.

663
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,548
She crushed you.

664
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,492
And not in the privacy of your
own home but in a courtroom.

665
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,293
In front of your colleagues, in
front of the whole legal community.

666
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,330
Not only that,

667
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,446
it's on the damn record.

668
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,474
There.

669
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,413
Where law students,

670
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,820
lawyers, judges,

671
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,523
your friends and neighbors

672
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,921
can read about it

673
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,332
from now until eternity.

674
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:40,005
Everyone knew. Everyone.

675
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:47,839
They would look at her
and then they look at me.

676
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:57,717
My own daughter looks at me
like I'm some kind of a joke.

677
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:18,781
Well, you showed her, didn't you?

678
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,723
Peter Bonham, you're under arrest for murder.

679
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:51,144
How long had you suspected?

680
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:54,672
Only a few days. We couldn't take
the risk of him finding out.

681
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,744
Please, no explanations.
I've got to first deal with Peter Bonham.

682
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,257
But I will get back to you, Detective.

683
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,836
He'll get over it. Just like Peter Bonham.
