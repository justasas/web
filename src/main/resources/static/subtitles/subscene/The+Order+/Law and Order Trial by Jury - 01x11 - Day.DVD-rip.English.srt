<i>[Man Narrating]
In the criminal justice system...</i>

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,636
<i>sexually based offenses
are considered especially heinous.</i>

3
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:10,972
<i>In New York City, the dedicated detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies...</i>

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,571
<i>are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.</i>

5
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,979
<i>These are their stories.</i>

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,917
<i>[Boy Shouting]
Yeah!</i>

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,118
[Grunts] [Laughing] That was sick, bro.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,457
Dude, you're such a wuss.

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,463
Take your skirt off
and try it again, man.

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,556
I racked myself on that one.

11
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,101
Just not your night, huh?

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,364
Maybe it is.

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,964
"C" note! [Laughs] Sweet.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,976
Come on. Let's buy some beers.

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,978
Yes, dude.

16
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,980
<i>Oh, my God, they're everywhere.</i>

17
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,278
One hundred
- I love this so much. Nice. Two hundred.

18
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,752
Oh, man.

19
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,654
Dude, she's dead.

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,654
<i>Talk about putting your
money where your mouth is.</i>

21
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,891
How many bills?
Five. All hundreds.

22
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:08,798
<i>You I.D. Her? Jane Doe.
No wallet or I.D. On her.</i>

23
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,099
Definitely raped.
Panties torn, bruising to the breast.

24
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,572
Condom lubricant
on the thighs.

25
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,941
- Hell of a lot of blood. She stabbed?
- Just a head laceration. Scalp wounds bleed heavily.

26
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,242
So she choked on the money?

27
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:25,182
I think she died of heart failure.
Found these pills in her pocket. Digoxin.

28
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,745
He scared her to death
by raping her.

29
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,290
He's going for felony murder.

30
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,292
Probably a prostitute, but what's
with the money-in-the-mouth thing?

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,328
I've never seen that before.

32
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,830
Maybe it's the perp's twisted way
of paying her.

33
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,924
<i>[Man] Detectives. You got something?</i>

34
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,469
<i>Footwear impression in blood.</i>

35
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,404
<i>Not a full shoe print,
but a distinctive waffle-tread pattern.</i>

36
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,408
<i>[Benson] One of the skateboarders? Nah.</i>

37
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,138
Their sneakers are flat-soled.
This is more like a rubber-soled slip-on.

38
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,442
<i>Think you could track the blood?
I'm way ahead of you.</i>

39
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,039
Already called for K-9.

40
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,415
<i>[Man]
Let's seal off the whole floor.</i>

41
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,250
[Barking]
Good boy, Barnaby.

42
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,223
Perp lives here, I'm pinning
my shield on the pooch.

43
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,127
<i>Open up. Police.
[Locks Clicking]</i>

44
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,798
What the hell do you want?

45
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,993
Is there anybody inside?
How is that your business?

46
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,002
Answer the question.
I'm alone.

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,334
<i>[Fin] All clear. Check this out.</i>

48
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:23,136
- There's dried blood on the sole.
- Hey. That's my purse.

49
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,609
This your money too?
I found it.

50
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,648
- You robbed a corpse.
- She was dead. There was nothing I could do to help her.

51
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:33,345
- So you helped yourself to the money?
- She couldn't take it with her.

52
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,910
Neither can you.

53
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,107
This makes exactly $5,000,
all in hundreds.

54
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,938
Any prints? No, just your skate
punks and little Miss Grave Robber.

55
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,240
Captain doesn't want the press
to know about the cash.

56
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,941
You run the signature
through VICAP? No matches.

57
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,210
We're thinking that our victim
is a prostitute.

58
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,218
Munch and Fin are canvassing
the working girls.

59
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,551
Ask if any of them use this brand.
Condom wrapper, stuck to one of the bills.

60
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,059
The victim's prints are on it. Took
the condom with him. Smart rapist.

61
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,459
I don't think there was a rapist.

62
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,158
This could be consensual sex
gone bad.

63
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,997
How'd you get that off the wrapper?

64
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,902
It's from The Box.
It's a sex club run by women.

65
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,837
<i>Come again?
That's the idea.</i>

66
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,138
It's a party where women live out
their sexual fantasies.

67
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,010
This place is three blocks
from the crime scene. Thanks.

68
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,275
<i>[Benson]
So what, exactly, do you offer?</i>

69
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:17,085
Oh, whatever you want. Striptease,
role-play, girl-boy, girl-girl-

70
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,091
No rules. But no sex acts on premises.

71
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,627
If you want to hook up afterwards,
that's your business.

72
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,686
Sounds great.
How do I join?

73
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:29,292
Well, apply with an erotic essay describing
your sexual interests, and a photo.

74
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,337
You keep photos
of all your members?

75
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,429
We destroy them
once you're accepted.

76
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,532
We just want to insure applicants
are height-weight proportionate.

77
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,339
And you definitely pass that test.

78
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,403
If you're worried about privacy,
don't be.

79
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,143
Guest lists use code names. All you
have to show is a membership card.

80
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,208
And what about men?
Can they join?

81
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,052
No, but members can bring dates...
if they're into guys.

82
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,524
- Ready to sign up?
- I don't think so.

83
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,620
We're not doing anything illegal.
Ladies, I'm not here to hassle you.

84
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,166
This woman was murdered last night
a couple of blocks from here.

85
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,168
Do either one of you recognize her?

86
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,672
Didn't a girl complain
that some guy got rough with her?

87
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,731
Our bouncer threw him out.

88
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,744
He was a real sadist-
whipping this girl.

89
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,337
She told him to stop and he
didn't. You see this happen?

90
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,349
No, but I got the word
to 86 the guy,

91
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,908
so I escorted him to the street.
He go quietly?

92
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,581
No. He didn't want to.
He flashed a wad of cash in my face.

93
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,183
You know, you can't bribe me. I showed him
the door. He kept hanging around outside.

94
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,854
What for? He said he was waiting for
the woman who brought him to the club.

95
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,261
I told him to move on.
Did he?

96
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,766
Not until I have him
some encouragement.

97
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,065
How much encouragement?
I just roughed him up a little.

98
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,334
I checked his bag of tricks. The freak
had cuffs, whips and a big-ass knife.

99
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,875
What did you do with the toys?
I gave them back.

100
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,911
Even the knife?

101
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,038
No way. Then he gave me some sob
story about needing it for work.

102
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,743
Says he's a chef
at that restaurant Soriello's.

103
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,218
This is insane.

104
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,552
I can't believe that little bitch
called the cops.

105
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,217
It was just a game.
What kind of game?

106
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,387
A little master-slave action.
She was lookin' for it.

107
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,897
She just walked up to you and begged
you to beat the crap out of her?

108
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,297
Yeah. With a leash
around her neck.

109
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,563
She said she wanted to play.

110
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,402
She got sassy,
so I lashed her with my crop.

111
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:18,240
She flips out, had that
security goon beat me up.

112
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,475
I don't get off on being hurt. So you
can dish it out but you can't take it?

113
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,746
- So you hung around for a little payback.
- No, I went home and put ice on my face.

114
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,583
<i>Were you alone?
Yes.</i>

115
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,919
Once Lola calms down,
she'll drop the charges.

116
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,289
And after a couple of more months
in the scene,

117
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,555
when her sexuality is more evolved,

118
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,395
<i>she'll be ready for me.
This your Lola?</i>

119
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,333
Whoa. I like it rough,
but not that rough.

120
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,167
And that's not Lola.

121
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,441
<i>[Benson]
All right. Thanks.</i>

122
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,740
I checked with The Box. Five
women use "Lola" as a code name.

123
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,803
<i>Any of them African-American?
One.</i>

124
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,281
Her real name is Sarah Miller.
She's an ad exec.

125
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,784
- Fin's checking on her whereabouts now.
- He's wasting his time.

126
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,320
<i>[Phone Rings] Sarah Miller
is on a slab in the morgue.</i>

127
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,686
Benson.

128
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,026
<i>Thanks.</i>

129
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,928
That was Fin. Sarah Miller never
showed up for work. Never checked in.

130
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,290
<i>Right.
[Engine Starts]</i>

131
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,437
<i>[Knocking]</i>

132
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,633
Not at home or at work.
You satisfied?

133
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,676
We'll find the super,
get him to let us in.

134
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,838
<i>[Woman] Who is it? Who's there? Police.</i>

135
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,251
<i>Sarah Miller?
[Locks Clicking]</i>

136
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,089
Yes?

137
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,228
I've taken six showers
since last night.

138
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,227
I was so upset
I couldn't even call in sick.

139
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,635
I didn't know what to say.

140
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,533
So I stayed home.

141
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,376
You think that man who attacked me
killed a woman?

142
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,246
Well, can you tell us
what he did to you?

143
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,554
We were flirting.

144
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,061
Then he got rough.

145
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,400
He grabbed me.

146
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,302
Forced me on my knees.

147
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,966
He pushed his crotch in my face.

148
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,908
And when I started to leave,

149
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,519
he started whipping me.

150
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,225
Do you remember seeing him
with any other women at the party?

151
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,230
<i>After it happened,</i>

152
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,732
<i>I hid in the bathroom...</i>

153
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,064
<i>until a friend of mine
told me he was gone.</i>

154
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,040
But earlier I saw him coming on
to a couple of girls.

155
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,436
Could she have been
one of those girls?

156
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,083
[Whispering]
I know her.

157
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,587
She kept me company
in the ladies' room.

158
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,455
She say if he bothered her?

159
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:25,293
You've got it wrong.
She's the bathroom attendant.

160
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,241
<i>[Man]
It's Marguerite.</i>

161
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,740
My daughter.

162
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,244
<i>Ma petite fille.</i>

163
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,353
When she didn't come home,

164
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,447
<i>I thought she went straight
to her secondjob.</i>

165
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,924
Where's that?

166
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,427
An office building on Broadway.

167
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,588
She was a cleaner.

168
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,757
Eight years.
[Sobs]

169
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,893
Never missed a day.
[Sobs]

170
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,138
Did she suffer?

171
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,299
She had a massive heart attack.

172
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,775
It would have been very quick.

173
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,278
<i>Her heart was always weak.</i>

174
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,508
She had rheumatic fever,

175
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,610
but the doctor said
if she took her pills-

176
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,620
[Sobbing]

177
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,691
Marguerite.

178
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,886
We'll take you home.

<i>[Murmuring] [Man] It's unbelievable.</i>

180
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,471
Monsieur Beauclair.

181
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,201
Your wife called me.
I am so sorry.

182
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,209
Thank you.

183
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,074
<i>I guess it took a murder
to finally get your attention, huh?</i>

184
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,086
- And you are?
- I'm Mildred Quintana.

185
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,247
I run the New Americans Justice Center.

186
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,382
And I think it's a travesty
the police department...

187
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,551
doesn't care
about undocumented women.

188
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,154
Miss Quintana, you got it backwards. We
don't care what a victim's legal status is.

189
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:10,100
<i>Oh, really? Then why is that sick son of
a bitch still raping women in my community?</i>

190
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,161
<i>What makes you think that all these
women were attacked by the same man?</i>

191
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,208
Well, you found money
on the body, didn't you?

192
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,538
He's attacked 16 women
in the last three years-

193
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,550
and those are just the ones
I know about.

194
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,281
All of them undocumented cleaning
women raped on their way home from work.

195
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,789
So why didn't you come to us?

196
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,725
I tried.
I went to my precinct.

197
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,729
I told them women
were being attacked.

198
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,425
I even gave them
a description of the rapist.

199
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,490
Do you know what they said?

200
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,729
That their hands were tied
without a victim.

201
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,068
We can't do anything
without a complainant either.

202
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,733
Is there anyone who's willing to
step forward? No. They're terrified.

203
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,937
These women would rather suffer
than risk being deported.

204
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,412
<i>Well, staying silent isn't gonna
make him stop.</i>

205
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,076
Let us talk to them and explain that the
police are different from Immigration.

206
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,085
No, no. This is not going to work.

207
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:05,146
These women come from a place where the
police are corrupt, justice is for sale,

208
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,749
and no one gives a damn
about poor people.

209
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,091
<i>They are not going to trust you.</i>

210
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,757
Then he'll keep attacking them because
he knows they won't say anything.

211
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,301
<i>You came to us.</i>

212
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,735
You want us to help you?
We need their names.

214
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,746
Hi. Yolanda Martinez?
Never heard of her.

215
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,681
Please. It's very important.
I don't know no Yolanda.

216
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,685
Yes, my name is Amina Asante,

217
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,153
but I am quite sure I have never
been a victim of a crime.

218
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,452
Yes, but I'd still like to talk to you.
Sorry.

<i>Go away.

220
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,392
Please go.
Miss Zergin, it's important.

221
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,433
Mildred Quintana sent me.

222
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,303
She told you?

223
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,340
Yes, because she knows
that I can help you.

224
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,580
Come in.

225
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,417
I wasn't going to tell anyone,

226
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,354
but it hurts so much
to keep it inside.

227
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,688
It'll get better if you
go to counseling. I can't.

228
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,593
If anyone finds out
I'll be an outcast.

229
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:21,190
In my religion a woman
must be a virgin when she marries.

230
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,599
<i>You're Muslim?
From Bosnia.</i>

231
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,660
Do you have any family here?

232
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,263
My brother Milan.

233
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,003
Oh, you have to go before he comes
home. He's become very traditional.

234
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,877
Nina, I promise your brother's
not gonna find out,

235
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,143
but I need for you to tell me
what happened.

236
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,046
<i>I can't. He's raped
a lot of women, Nina.</i>

237
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:48,355
The one who he attacked last night died.

238
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,431
<i>Please help me stop him.</i>

239
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,910
I work nights,

240
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,276
cleaning offices.

241
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,245
I was on my way home,

242
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,752
coming up from the subway.

243
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,280
He dragged me into an alley.
Raped me.

244
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,225
Did you see his face?

245
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,191
I'll never forget it.

246
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,026
The way he looked at me afterwards-

247
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,265
He smiled.

248
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,275
Said thank you.

249
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,279
Then handed me cash,
like I was a prostitute.

250
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,184
It was more money than I make
in six months.

251
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:53,490
I lay there in that filthy alley thinking,
"At least I can pay the rent.' '

252
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,994
Nina, you have nothing to be ashamed of.

253
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,896
Then why do I feel so dirty?

254
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,594
Every day I think I should
burn the money.

255
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,367
Do you still have it?

256
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,407
I couldn't spend it.

257
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:14,412
Please- get it out of here.

258
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,971

264
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,327
I didn't see anything.

265
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,533
That's what I just told her.

266
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,442
Sorry.
Thank you for your help.

267
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,912
These bills have never been
in circulation,

268
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,182
so I should be able to lift
some great prints.

269
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,224
Spray on a little ninhydrin.

270
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,787
Steam accelerates the reaction.

271
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,032
I got your prints.

272
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,072

00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,750

00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,085
Well, it is your fingerprints on that money.

00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,919
Why don't you explain it to us

You can't.

but, uh, he got pretty rattled when I
told him his prints were on the money.

303
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,040
<i>Rattled how? He said he
couldn't talk about it.</i>

304
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,477
Sounds like he's protecting
one of his clients.

305
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,708
No, Whitaker's prints...

306
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,445
were on the money because
he gave it to our rapist.

307
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,182
Yeah. He tries to clear himself, he's pointing
the finger at his client. He can't do that.

308
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,692
Can you get a client list? Yeah. You
know what firm Jason Whitaker works for?

00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,278
Well, just one estate-

318
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,619

She spends a lot on clothes, but she
gives even more of her wealth away.

334
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,406
Mm-hmm.
Oh, he hasn't lived here in years.

335
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,068
Huh. This address
is on his driver's license.

336
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,603
[Laughs] Oh, he never remembers
to update those things.

337
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,912
Unfortunately, he never remembers
to pay his parking tickets either.

338
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,918
Well, I'm not surprised.

339
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:53,083
Gabriel has all the money he needs,
and he never remembers to pay the bills.

340
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:57,151
His head is in the clouds,
or on those computers.

341
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:02,532
<i>I'll write you a check.
Mrs. Duvall. Mrs. Duvall?</i>

342
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,399
I'm sorry. He's gonna have to come
down and deal with it in person.

343
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,462
Yes, of course.
I'll give you his address.

344
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,833
I paid those tickets.
I know I did.

345
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,277
The canceled checks
must be here somewhere.

346
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,713
I should have scanned them
onto my hard drive.

347
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,910
<i>You're a computer guy?
Uh-</i>

348
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,112
I freelance, but this is my real work-

349
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,246
teaching computers how to see.

350
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,621
See what?
Visual data-

351
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:31,095
To process it the same way
humans do, through optical clues.

352
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,098
<i>The algorithms are complex-
very hard to create.</i>

353
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,100
Some people say impossible,
but I'll do it.

354
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,295
The canceled checks are here somewhere.
I just can't seem to find them.

355
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,429
We can sort this all out
down at the precinct.

356
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,735
I only have two hours,
then I have to get back.

357
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,299
Not a problem.
It'll take 15 minutes.

358
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,971
I have to be back by 8:00.
Promise.

359
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,946
<i>Your coat?
Yes, right. My coat.</i>

360
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,618
Liv, I got him.
Go get Nina.

361
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,693
Is Nina home?
Are you joking?

362
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,697
I saw you arrest her two hours ago.

363
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,359
What?
The police-

364
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,427
Coming home from work, I saw two
cops with guns put her in a car.

365
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,475
<i>Did they say where they were
taking her? Why are you asking me?</i>

366
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,534
You're the one who did this.

367
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,946
- We never had any problems until you showed up.
- We didn't take your sister.

368
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,152
Then who did?

369
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,289
The neighbors confirmed
the brother's story.

370
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,559
Two cops took Nina away, but there's no
arrest in the system, no outstanding warrants.

371
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,159
Munch and Fin talked to her boss. He
said Nina didn't show up for work tonight.

372
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,170
So what are we dealing with?
Impersonators? Feds?

373
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,536
I talked to the F.B.I.
They don't have her.

374
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,508
How much longer
can we keep Duvall?

375
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,739
<i>We're running out of reasons to hold
him, and Elliot's running out of patience.</i>

376
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,976
He's some kind of oddball genius.
Won't shut up about computers.

377
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,985
Once we let him go, we're never gonna
get him back here without his lawyer.

378
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,987
<i>Is that him?</i>

379
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,989
Is that why Nina disappeared?

380
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,418
Did you tell him who she is?

381
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,519
Miss Quintana, we really can't
discuss it. Hey, I'm not stupid.

382
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,928
You have a suspect.
Nina is gone.

383
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,593
Something terrible has happened to her.

384
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,432
I should never
have given you their names.

385
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,770
We'll find Nina,
and we'll arrest the rapist.

386
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,776
I have to go.
I'm late for dinner.

387
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,779
Got a date? And I'm hungry. I
can't disrupt my eating schedule.

388
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,611
I get hypoglycemic and use up
the glycogens stored in my liver.

389
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,947
If I don't have glucose,
my blood sugar plummets.

390
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,385
I'll get you something to eat.
What?

391
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:40,414
What do you want? Burger? Sandwich?
No. It's Thursday, meat loaf night.

392
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:44,189
The Gainsvort Diner blue plate special is meat
loaf, mashed potato, mushroom gravy and green beans.

393
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,355
But I don't eat the green beans.
I don't like green.

394
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,729
I'll tell you what. I'll have my
paperwork done in a few minutes.

395
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,291
You'll have plenty of time
for your meat loaf.

396
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,999
<i>No, they run out. I have to go now.
I can't disrupt my eating schedule.</i>

397
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,372
My mentation will be affected, and my
research requires absolute concentration.

398
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:02,243
Give me a few minutes. Meantime, you
want a cup of coffee, maybe a can of soda?

399
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,748
<i>No, I don't want anything.
I have to go. That's my boy.</i>

400
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,808
See, Gabriel's too smart for your tricks.
He's not gonna leave his D.N.A. On a soda can.

401
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,820
Come on, let's go.
Just being polite.

402
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,413
Oh, no, no. Yeah.
This is just about parking tickets.

403
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,255
Next time you want to talk to my
client, why don't you call me first?

404
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,057
I can't get a cab. I lost my wallet.
Can you take me home? Sure, sure.

405
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,727
You can drop me off at the diner. Have
some meat loaf with me. It's very good.

406
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,793
They make it with pork, beef and veal
- Is that him?

407
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,805
<i>Let's go back inside. They grind
it up separately, of course.</i>

408
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,273
<i>Trichinosis
- Wait a minute. Are you talking about food?</i>

409
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,436
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Who is that woman? Why is she shouting at me?

410
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,003
<i>Do I know her?
I'd remember if I'd met her.</i>

411
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,572
<i>[Whitaker] Shut up. The police may be through
with you, but I am just getting started.</i>

412
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,346
<i>- [Stabler] Stay out of this.
- You're gonna pay for what you've done.</i>

413
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,355
Hey, come near my client again,
I'll have you arrested for harassment.

414
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,789
Oh. Do I look scared to you?

415
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,884
Hey, you're out of your league. Why don't
you just stick with your wetback washer women?

416
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,529
I'm gonna take the stairs.
You tell me when you find Nina.

417
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,225
Did you tell Whitaker that Nina's
an undocumented janitor? No.

418
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,771
Then why did he mention
wetback washer women?

419
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,570
Because someone's been leaking
information to Whitaker about our case.

420
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,770
They checked our file,
sold Nina out.

421
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,905
Could be anyone in this precinct
- in the department, for that matter.

422
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,211
I think I figured out where Nina is.

423
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,295
Nina.

424
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,528
Why did you turn me into
Immigration? I didn't.

425
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,270
They're deporting me
back to Bosnia.

426
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,739
My parents were killed in
the war, our home destroyed.

427
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,743
I have nothing there. You
did this. It wasn't me.

428
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,508
<i>Oh, I don't believe you. Who else
could have? It was the rapist.</i>

429
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,880
Nina, listen to me.
We have a suspect.

430
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,216
We were about to have you
make an identification.

431
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,347
Don't stop trusting me now.

432
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:00,264
Please get me out of here.

433
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,732
<i>Nina Zergin applied for
political asylum three years ago,</i>

434
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,735
but her claim was denied.

435
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,737
We were about to deport her
when she disappeared.

436
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,796
You left her alone for three years.
Why pick her up now?

437
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,173
We received information
linking her to a radical Islamist cell.

438
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,077
From where?
Anonymous tip on our hotline.

439
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,341
She's a cleaning woman,
not a terrorist.

440
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,282
Your mystery caller? That's the defense
attorney of the man who raped her.

441
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,286
Can you prove that?

442
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,585
<i>If I could, I'd charge him
with witness tampering.</i>

443
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,592
Nina still needs to be debriefed
by Homeland Security.

444
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,424
When she comes up clean,
will you cut her loose?

445
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,523
I can't. The deportation order
is legal. My hands are tied.

446
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,433
The Violence Against Women Act has a
provision granting temporary asylum...

447
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,734
to victims of crime
who cooperate with prosecutors.

448
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,106
You file that paperwork,
she's all yours.

449
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,372
Am I really legal now?
Temporarily.

450
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,074
After the trial I can petition
for permanent status.

451
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,141
Thank you.
Your help is all the thanks I need.

452
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,590
Did you tell Milan I was raped?

453
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,492
No, but you should.

454
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,594
[Speaking Bosnian]

455
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,602
Who is this?

456
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,104
This is A.D.A. Novak.
She's a lawyer that works with us.

457
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,172
You freed Nina?

458
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,939
It was nothing.
She never should have been locked up.

459
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,946
Thank you.
Ride back to the office?

460
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,948
<i>[Novak]
No, take them home.</i>

461
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,814
I got a stop to make.

462
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:36,158
Casey. My boss said you were interested,
but you don't waste any time.

463
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,685
Neither do you. Please sit
down. What can I do for you?

464
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,597
Bring in Gabriel Duvall for a lineup.

465
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,601
Who's looking at him?

466
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,502
<i>The rape victim you were about to have
conveniently deported.</i>

467
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,666
I got her status legalized,
so she's not going anywhere.

468
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,317
Where are we going tonight?
We having dinner?

469
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,052
Special Victims.

470
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,718
I made you a reservation.

471
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,414
I don't know.

472
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,475
Just take your time.

473
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,412
Number two.

474
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,881
He raped me. I'm sure.

475
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,482
We'll give you some privacy.

476
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,284
Good job.

477
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,400
Looks like your boy is going down. She'd
say anything to remain in this country.

478
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,664
She just picked my client because he's
wealthy and he's in the society pages.

479
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,899
We have the money. With my fingerprints
on it, not Gabriel Duvall's.

480
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,066
What, are you gonna charge me?
Come on, Casey. You got nothing.

481
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,508
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jason, they're gonna put me in jail.</i>

482
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,944
<i>Can't you do something to stop
them? Gabriel, don't worry.</i>

483
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,177
You arrest my client now, the judge will
dismiss him at arraignment. Uh, Mr. Whitaker?

484
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,810
Mrs. Duvall, you shouldn't have come
down here. Everything's under control.

485
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,583
- It doesn't look under control to me.
- Mother, these detectives think I've committed a crime.

486
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,524
Well, Mr. Whitaker is going
to set everything straight.

487
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,585
Gabriel will be coming home
with us, won't he?

488
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,223
Let him go.

489
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,665
Sweetheart, are you all right?

490
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,569
<i>[Gabriel] I think I have a cold. I don't
know why. I've been taking my vitamins.</i>

491
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,732

some of your favorite chicken soup.

502

Marguerite Beauclair's makeup...

503
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,922
was smeared all over her face
when her body was found.

504
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,985
I'll type the cosmetic brand,
see if I can match it...

00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,053
to what Marguerite used,
but I'll need extra time.

to nail this bastard.

- Will Nina still get asylum if she doesn't have to testify?

- No, I'm not seeing anyone.

If they're from Jason Whitaker,
they're going straight in the trash.

514

- Every second of every day.

Let me see your hands. What's
going on? What do you want?

Give me your hands. My lawyer said
you're not allowed to talk to me.

You have to get out of here.
Now get out.

- Answer my question. Where were you tonight?

<i>She got what she deserved. What,

She made my sister untouchable.

How'd she do that?
Tell me how she did that.

She's gotta deal with it.
So do you.

00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,428

593
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,931

You threatened him.

603
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,980
I was investigating an attack

00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,018
Which he did not commit.

605
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,817
I didn't know that at the time.
But you would have,

606
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,187
if you had investigated.

607
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,855
The captain tells me that you have been
a policeman for almost 20 years.

Yes, ma'am.

Then I suggest you stay away
from my son.

612
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,905
The police commissioner is a friend.

00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,970
So is the mayor.

614
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,014
Don't make me call them.

623

<i>Captain-
Save it. I probably...</i>

627
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,187
would have thrown Gabriel Duvall
out the window.

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,694
<i>We may have a bigger problem anyway.
What?</i>

629
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,734
Nina Zergin. Her brother says
she doesn't want to testify.

630
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,405
She backs out, Gabriel walks.

631
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,540
I'll talk to her.

632
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,877
Let Novak do it.

633
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,243
She's not back at work. I don't
think she wants anyone to see her yet.

634
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,516
Exactly.

635
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,692
I can't speak to you.
L-I promised my brother.

636
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,393
I know how hard it was for you
to tell me what happened.

637
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,798
I know what it's done to your family.

638
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,471
But no matter what you decide to do,

639
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:40,203
nothing will stop me from prosecuting
the man who raped you.

640
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,139
What do you want me to do?

641
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,242
<i>Testify in the grandjury.</i>

642
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,085
Once I get an indictment,
we can arrest Gabriel Duvall.

643
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:02,190
Casey. Casey, I'm so sorry. L-
Oh, God. I heard what happened.

644
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,200
Why don't you save it
for someone who cares?

645
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,669
No joke. I'm serious. You are making
me late. I have grand jury time booked.

646
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,571
I don't think you'll be using it. Judge
Trillin's ordering you removed from the case.

647
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,810
On what grounds?

648
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,904
I want you as a defense witness.

649
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,789
<i>[Branch]
Hell of a strategy.</i>

650
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,916
Nina lost her virginity,
was afraid of what...

651
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,587
her traditional Muslim brother
might do if he found out,

652
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,596
so she lied about being raped.

653
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,633
Whitaker wants to use Milan's attack on me
to bolster his case.

654
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,535
He's violent, therefore Nina's afraid, so she made
up a story about being raped by Gabriel Duvall.

655
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,539
It's a compelling argument.

656
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,575
I can win this motion.

657
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,077
"A," I'm up in front ofJudge Trillin.
He loves me.

658
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,636
"B," the way I look,
I'm gonna get the sympathy vote.

659
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,478
<i>Casey. I'm taking this case
away from you.</i>

660
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,917
You can't-
Not after what I've been through.

661
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,514
No one wants to win this case
more than I do.

662
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,753
Which is exactly why
you can't try it.

663
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,921
Whitaker was right.
You're too emotionally involved.

664
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,964
I've already reassigned the case.

665
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,432
To who?
Tracey Kibre.

666
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,265
She's a homicide A.D.A.
She's not used to live victims.

667
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,271
Nina won't be able to relate to her.

668
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,273
Well, she'll have to,
'cause Tracey's putting Nina...

669
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:20,504
in the grand jury tomorrow morning.

670
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,439
<i>Remember, there are no surprises
in the grandjury.</i>

671
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:30,783
You know what I'm going to ask you,
so just answer my questions...

672
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,050
and everything'll be just fine.

673
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,956
Okay. I'm ready.
Good.

674
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:40,258
- Hi, Nina.
- Miss Novak. So glad to see you.

675
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,265
I just want to wish you luck.

676
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,567
You're up.

677
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,607
Okay.

678
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,575
Casey. I thought you were
off the case.

679
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,774
I am.

680
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,876
You looking for Kibre?
Yeah.

681
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,251
Warner finished the analysis
on the tissue from Gabriel's pocket.

682
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,780
It had more on it
than just the dead girl's makeup.

683
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,294
D.N.A. From her blood?

684
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,593
Her tears.

685
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,862
Go collar the son of a bitch.

686
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,499
[Chattering]

687
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,986
My mother relayed your apology,

688
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,522
though I do appreciate
this personal delivery...

689
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,854
of the proverbial olive branch.

690
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:45,259
Would you care to join me? I recommend
the pork chop, but not the peas.

691
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,456
Right. They're green.

692
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,465
Stand up.

693
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,467
I'm not done with my dinner.
You're done.

694
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,828
I thought you were ordered
to stop this harassment.

695
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,897
You're hurting me. You haven't
begun to see what hurt is.

696
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,569
Gabriel Duvall, you're under arrest
for the rape of Nina Zergin,

697
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,942
and for the rape-murder
of Marguerite Beauclair.

698
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,004
You have the right to remain silent.

699
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:09,018
If you give up that right, anything you say can
and will be used against you in a court of law.

700
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,077
You have the right to an attorney.

701
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,209
