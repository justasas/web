1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,607
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,607 --> 00:00:06,318
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:07,483
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:11,004
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:14,076
of an elite squad known 
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:16,104
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:20,469
Now, you sure it was a talking car,
not a talking fire hydrant?

8
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:22,833
Don't crack wise with me, young man.

9
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,294
I'm not some senile old bitch.

10
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:26,155
Then where is it?

11
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:28,568
It was right there.
In the bus stop.

12
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:31,681
Okay, Anna, the voice in trunk,
what did it say to you?

13
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:33,560
"Help me" and then a name,

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,063
- Savannah, Samantha.
- Sabrina?

15
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:38,249
- Was it Sabrina?
- That's it! Sabrina.

16
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:40,771
- Yo, Sanjay.
- Officer Tim.

17
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,238
- No kraut, heavy mustard.
- No, no, no.

18
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:45,359
You seen this girl today?

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,666
No, sir.

20
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:50,197
What about a car parked in the bus stop
about two hours ago?

21
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,403
Yes, the truck towed it away.

22
00:00:52,403 --> 00:00:53,774
Great.

23
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:55,434
Twenty Frank to Central.

24
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:58,244
Possible sighting
on kidnap victim Sabrina farmer.

25
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:01,607
Notify SVU she might be in the trunk
of an impounded car.

26
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,219
They don't know which vehicle?

27
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,076
Lady couldn't give a description.
Traffic computers are down.

28
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:07,628
How do they even know it's in Queens?

29
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:09,196
It has to be here.

30
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:10,554
Cause Pier 76 is full.

31
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:12,625
And this is where Manhattan
is sending their overflow.

32
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,358
Anybody going through the paperwork?

33
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:17,811
Central called all the tow truck drivers,
told them we have a missing kid out here.

34
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,580
Where the hell is that infrared camera?

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,020
Emergency services on their way.

36
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:25,916
Better be quick.
There's a lot of cars out here.

37
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,144
Pop every trunk.

38
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:32,184
Heard your call on the radio.
Where should I start?

39
00:01:32,184 --> 00:01:34,964
Take your pick. They've been putting cars
in every empty space.

40
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,862
Captain, ESU's got another camera.

41
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,787
Tell him to start two rows up
from O'Halloran.

42
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:43,598
Hey, guys!
I got something.

43
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:44,401
What do we got?

44
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,785
Just caught a blue plume
coming from one of these cars.

45
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:49,384
Rear row. That gray Impala.

46
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:51,699
If she's in there, get her out.

47
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:58,622
- She's barely breathing.
- We need oxygen.

48
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:01,555
- EMS is stuck in traffic.
- We'll take her.

49
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,144
Sabrina's CAT scan
didn't show any bleeding,

50
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:01,927
but she does have
a serious concussion.

51
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,185
Any idea what she was hit with?

52
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,886
Probably a rock.
There's dirt in the laceration.

53
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,067
When will she wake up?

54
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,282
Your guess is as good as mine.

55
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,827
- Was she raped?
- Yes. No fluids.

56
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:15,448
But several hairs and there's
significant bruising.

57
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:17,677
She's only 11.

58
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,967
Don't ask why.
It'll just make you crazy.

59
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,055
I'll call you when she's conscious.

60
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,871
Well, we can always go back.
and check the security cam

61
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:28,411
Well, we're just gonna see the same thing.

62
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:30,929
Sabrina leaving the bookstore alone
and nobody following her.

63
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:32,828
Why'd she go out by herself?

64
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:35,732
Maybe she couldn't find her mother
and went out there looking for her.

65
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:37,323
We got a hit on the Impala.

66
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:41,566
The driver's name, Saul Picard
from Mandeville, Louisiana.

67
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,148
Picked it up from escape rent-a-car
three days ago.

68
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:46,242
Good, well, if he's a tourist,
he's already left by now.

69
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:50,257
I doubt it. He's staying at the executive
apartments on West 73rd Street.

70
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:54,061
Manager said he signed
a month-long lease.

71
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,668
Apartment of Saul Picard
177 West 73rd Street
Tuesday, October 9

72
00:03:56,668 --> 00:04:00,884
So detectives Benson and Stabler,
what can I do for you?

73
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:02,177
We're here about your rental car.

74
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:03,967
The one I returned yesterday?

75
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,858
That's not what the rental agency says.

76
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,751
I'm sorry, can I use your bathroom, please?

77
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,595
Uh, through... through the bedroom.

78
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:10,503
Thank you.

79
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,230
The guy's name was, um...

80
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,174
here it is.

81
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,198
Um, Mickey.

82
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,360
Well, what's the big deal about the car?

83
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,810
It was stolen, Mr. Picard.

84
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,947
Well, there's the receipt.

85
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:28,163
I'm not responsible for what happened
after I dropped it off.

86
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:30,649
Can you tell me where you've been
the last two days?

87
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:32,760
Here, working.

88
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,077
I went to the deli on the corner a few times
for coffee and burgers.

89
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:39,479
You're an artist.

90
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,337
Not what my critics say.

91
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,836
Have we met before?

92
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:49,552
Doubt it.

93
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,435
I'm here every few months on business,
but I live in Louisiana.

94
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:54,922
Oh, near New Orleans?

95
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,451
Other side of Lake Pontchartrain.
North shore.

96
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:59,462
But now I'm fixing to relocate.

97
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:04,717
Katrina destroyed my house two years ago,
and it's not the same down home.

98
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:08,408
I wouldn't blame you for trying to get away.

99
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:14,750
Can I see both your
credentials again, please?

100
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:24,248
You have my apology.

101
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,967
Thank you for obliging my eccentricity.

102
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,365
Thanks for your time.
We'll talk to the car rental company again

103
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:32,619
and, uh, try to figure this whole thing out.

104
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,627
Have a good day.

105
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,468
Yeah, that helps.
Thanks.

106
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:39,329
Anything from Escape Rent-A-Car?

107
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:41,878
Yeah, Picard's story checks out.

108
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:42,929
He returned the car to Mickey.

109
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:44,361
So how'd it wind up at a bus stop?

110
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:45,886
Mickey didn't have enough room
in the garage

111
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:47,537
and left it on the street
with the keys inside.

112
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:49,975
Came out. It was gone.
Why not report it stolen?

113
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,917
Well, he panicked.
He was afraid he was going to get fired,

114
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:55,927
so he doctored the computer records
to make it look like Picard still had it.

115
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:59,187
You get anything out of the deli
besides burned coffee?

116
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:02,388
The clerk said that Picard has been in
at least a couple dozen times

117
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:05,388
over the last three days.
Definite caffeine freak.

118
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:08,040
And a paranoid freak.
Asking for our IDs twice?

119
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,169
- Bad cause of OCD.
- And not to mention BO.

120
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,793
There shower was bone dry
like it'd never been used.

121
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:13,715
How about the bedroom?

122
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,777
Messy.
But no sign Sabrina was ever there.

123
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:18,285
All we got left is the Impala, huh?

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,342
No DNA. No prints. No nothing.

125
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:22,990
Except this.

126
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,497
- Looks like bacteria.
- It's pollen.

127
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:28,806
I found microscopic traces on the driver's
seat and on Sabrina's clothing.

128
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,640
All that proves is Sabrina was in the car.

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,797
No, sample was so minute,

130
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:35,933
it could only have been transferred
through extremely close contact.

131
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,443
- Like sitting on the seat.
- Yeah or during the rape.

132
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:39,509
What difference does it make?

133
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,982
Any of the last ten people
who rented the car could a left the pollen.

134
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:44,160
Only if they'd been down south recently.

135
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,924
Pollen's from a Louisiana Flatsdege.

136
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,432
Louisiana Flatsdege.

137
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:52,755
That grow anywhere near
Lake Pontchartrain?

138
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:55,592
Around the bayous of the north shore.
How'd you know?

139
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:01,128
Clear.

140
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:03,461
You're telling me.
His laptop and artwork are gone.

141
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:05,564
- So is his suitcase.
- All right, Picard's alibi check out.

142
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:07,118
What did we miss?
We missed something.

143
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:11,060
He returned the Impala.
He walks out of the rental office.

144
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:14,792
He saw the keys in the car.

145
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,478
He stole the car right back.

146
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,263
Oh, we screwed up.

147
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:24,473
No press, but I want every cop on the street
looking for this guy.

148
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,723
You know, if I'm Picard
and I got an 18-hour head start,

149
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:28,016
I'm on my way to Brazil.

150
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,995
Maybe that's where
he's been attacking little girls,

151
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:33,722
cause his DNA's not in the system
and the Fibbies got nothing on him.

152
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:36,399
Unless Sabrina is his first victim.

153
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,145
A rapist wannabe's most likely to want
to bust his cherry closer to home

154
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:41,367
where he's more comfortable.

155
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,760
Did we check with the Louisianan cops?

156
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,026
Yeah. They only turned up two warrants
for unpaid speeding tickets.

157
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:50,205
Speaking of which, did our friends
at Escape Rent-A-Car happen to mention

158
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:53,119
loaning a blue ford explorer to Mr. Picard?

159
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:56,964
When? / Yesterday afternoon about 3:00
before we put out the alert on him.

160
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:58,374
That's right after we left his place.

161
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,803
Yeah, from which, by the way,
he didn't check out.

162
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:05,424
Nor did he buy airplane tickets to any
exotic, non-extraditable vacation spots.

163
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:07,400
Sounds like our nut job's sticking around.

164
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,632
Hopefully not looking for his next victim.

165
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:11,535
Let's get the description
of the car on the air.

166
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:15,106
It's already done and sent to every police
department in the Northeast.

167
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:16,909
Special victims unit.
This is Detective Benson.

168
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,343
Captain, you want us to sit
on Picard's place?

169
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:21,496
- I don't think he's going back there.
- Thanks.

170
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:23,238
Sabrina's awake.

171
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,381
Mercy General Hospital
365 West 32nd Street
Wednesday, October 10

172
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:34,555
I was looking at some books
when he told me I was in danger.

173
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:39,517
He said mom was waiting
for me outside.

174
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:43,728
Then he went out
through the coffee place.

175
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:45,938
Explains why he wasn't
on the surveillance video.

176
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,179
What happened then?

177
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:50,672
My mom wasn't outside, but he was.

178
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:54,128
He said mom was hurt
and if I told him where I lived,

179
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:57,511
- he'd take me home.
- Okay. So you got into his car.

180
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,689
But he drove the wrong way.

181
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,823
I tried to get out,
but the doors were locked.

182
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:04,840
Did you ask him where you were going?

183
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,777
He said some place safe.
He was talking funny.

184
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:10,212
Okay.
What else did he say?

185
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:15,460
He said, "Hearken to the ark."

186
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,936
- "Hearken to the ark."
- Yeah.

187
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:21,103
Mostly I didn't understand him.

188
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:25,349
Sabrina, I'm gonna show you some pictures.

189
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:29,624
And I want you to take
a really, really good look, okay?

190
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,359
That... that's him.
He said his name was William.

191
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,612
Now, Sabrina, when you got out of the car...

192
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:42,453
Did you see anything?
Did you notice where you were?

193
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,291
It was...

194
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,811
a park.

195
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:53,951
I tried to run away, but he said,
"Stop, Francine."

196
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:56,088
And...

197
00:09:56,683 --> 00:10:01,013
And what else?
What else did he say?

198
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,811
Okay, sweetie.
You need to rest.

199
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:08,797
So I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna visit you tomorrow, okay?

200
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:10,828
Okay, Olivia.

201
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:13,704
Okay.
Tell me we've got Picard?

202
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:15,352
I wish.

203
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:17,397
Another girl's been kidnapped.

204
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,804
Eve Holland, 11.
Mom was next door shopping for clothes.

205
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,487
And left Eve in the children's section.

206
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:26,232
At least we know Picard's MO.

207
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:28,330
That's a great place to pick up kids
if you're a pedophile.

208
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,987
You know the girl?

209
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:33,476
Yeah. Right over there picking out
a few books.

210
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,537
- What? those books there?
- Could be.

211
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:37,475
She was sitting in that chair.

212
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:43,586
Quentin's Quest by William S. Falstaff.
I read this to my kids.

213
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,784
You and a million other parents.

214
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:50,186
Surveillance caught Picard on tape
escorting Eve Holland out 45 minutes ago.

215
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:52,398
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

216
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,869
I knew I recognized him.

217
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:58,276
That's Saul Picard.
He rapes kids and writes books for them.

218
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:01,178
William S. Falstaff.
That's a Helluva pen name.

219
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,478
Okay, where is he bringing her to?

220
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:05,849
What'd he say to Sabrina?
"Hearkening the ark."

221
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:07,893
Hearken to the ark.

222
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,918
Hearken to the arch.

223
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:12,385
- Secret of the Arch?
- Maybe he took her here.

224
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:13,786
The Arc De Triomphe in Paris?

225
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,988
There's one exactly like this
in Washington Square Park.

226
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:17,918
There's nowhere to hide
in Washington Square.

227
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:19,992
Maybe Brooklyn.
Prospect Park.

228
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:22,083
The arch at Grand Army Plaza.

229
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,178
Lieutenant.

230
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,481
Benson. Stabler.
Manhattan SVU.

231
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:38,721
Lieutenant Shea.

232
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:39,780
Anyone spot them yet?

233
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,413
No, but I got chopper up
and we're calling in some more manpower.

234
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:43,874
Victim was snatched
less than two hours ago.

235
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:45,955
So if we move fast, maybe we can find them
before he hurts her.

236
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,908
Well, we'll do the best we can,
but it's a big park.

237
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:51,245
Lieutenant, chopper spotted
something in the trees on lookout hill.

238
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,338
Mount up.

239
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:55,407
Lieutenant, look, we don't know
how this guys operates.

240
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:57,363
If he sees all the troops...

241
00:11:57,712 --> 00:12:00,260
Okay. You go in first.

242
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,229
- Police. Don't move.
- Make it right.

243
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:21,559
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car. Shut up.

244
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,961
Shut up and put your hands
on the car over there.

245
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,218
Put your hands up.
Hands up. / Eve.

246
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:28,225
Eve, honey, can you hear me?

247
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,715
My name is Olivia.
I'm a police officer.

248
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:33,847
Can you sit up for me?
Are you okay?

249
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:35,584
I'm tired.

250
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,757
Okay.

251
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,327
Manhattan SVU to detail.
We have one in custody.

252
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,683
We'll meet you back at our car.

253
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:46,579
Okay, sweetie.
Come with me.

254
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,174
Good job.

255
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:51,845
What'd you give that girl
to make her go to sleep?

256
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:53,784
Alice swallowed one of the cakes,

257
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:58,269
and she was delighted to find
that she began shrinking directly.

258
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:59,767
You give Sabrina Farmer
one of those cakes

259
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,200
before you raped her
and left her in that car?

260
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,290
I had a car.
It got a tow.

261
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,036
Guy who towed its name was Joe.

262
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:08,450
- You're under arrest for the rape
and kidnapping of Sabrina Farmer
- He looks like a lot of guys I know.

263
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,276
- and attempted kidnapping of Eve Holland.
- My attorney is Lucien Deveraux.

264
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:12,838
- Of New Orleans.
- You have the right to remain silent.

265
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:15,767
- He's an expert on pralines.
- Do you understand me?

266
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,872
Did you hear the president's
speech last week?

267
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:21,468
Man, that guy'll do anything
to keep us fighting this Iraq war.

268
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,785
Oh, Nefarious war!

269
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:26,869
I see why arms were seldom used...

270
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:28,313
WINTER'S COMING...
TIME TO ESCAPE

271
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:33,818
WINTER'S COMING...
TIME TO ESCAPE

272
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:37,307
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, what?

273
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,100
Do I have to do it now?

274
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,916
Cause it's gonna be really hard.

275
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:45,612
- I gotta get away.
- You're not going anywhere.

276
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:47,537
Gotta get away.

277
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:51,147
Elliot!

278
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:54,513
Get him.

279
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,292
Get him.

280
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,865
Officer down.
Call a bus.

281
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:04,229
Elliot.
Elliot, you're okay.

282
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,660
A bus is on its way.

283
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,266
You're okay.
You're okay.

284
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,971
You're okay.

285
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:12,326
You're okay.

286
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:18,643
What's going on?

287
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:19,931
He's awake.

288
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:21,635
Kathy.

289
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,029
Welcome back, El.

290
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,246
What's going on?

291
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:30,861
You're in the hospital.
You're okay.

292
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,612
I'm not okay.
Where are you?

293
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:40,044
What do you mean?
I'm standing right next to you.

294
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:42,600
Oh, God.

295
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,713
I can't see you.
I can't see anything.

296
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,125
It's all a blur.

297
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,369
I can't see anything.

298
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,647
- Kathy?
- Right here, Elliot.

299
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,223
I'm right here.

300
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:11,304
Detective Stabler hit his head so hard,

301
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:14,347
his brain bounced off the front
and back of his skull.

302
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,148
How bad?

303
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,312
His CAT scan shows contusions
to the frontal and occipital lobes.

304
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:19,380
He's bleeding?

305
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,896
It's not life-threatening.
They're like bruises.

306
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:24,656
- Then why can't he see?
- The occipital lobe controls vision.

307
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:28,539
It's not uncommon with an injury like this
for there to be some temporary blindness.

308
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,584
- How temporary?
- Don't panic.

309
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:32,777
His brain should heal
in a couple of days.

310
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,853
And his vision should return.

311
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:38,744
He's seeing bright lights, shadows.
This is good news.

312
00:15:38,744 --> 00:15:41,047
Captain, we got a problem in Picard's room.

313
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,353
Give me a minute.

314
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:43,892
His vision should return.

315
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,537
So you're saying that there's
a chance that it won't?

316
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:48,526
His MRI showed swelling in the optic nerve.

317
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,612
We'll know more in a few days.

318
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,152
- Who the hell are you?
- Special Agent Wayne Nelson.

319
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,830
I'm taking Mr. Picard into custody.

320
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,010
Mr. Picard is out
of the Bureau's jurisdiction.

321
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,398
He never crossed state lines
with either of our victims.

322
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:13,267
He did with the nine-year-old girl
he kidnapped in Mississippi.

323
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:16,634
Took her to Louisiana, raped her,
and left her there to die.

324
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:18,994
And his DNA is gonna prove it.

325
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,637
The girl Picard kidnapped
is Tiffany Lemarsh, nine years old.

326
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:24,705
Disappeared last week
from a bookstore

327
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:27,424
at a shopping mall
in Gulfport, Mississippi.

328
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:31,502
Found last night after four days
without food and water

329
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:33,637
in what's left
of Picard's house in Louisiana.

330
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,133
- Alive?
- Barely.

331
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:38,431
Neighbor's dog got a whiff.
Sniffed her out just in time.

332
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,008
They're charging Picard
with interstate kidnapping.

333
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:43,777
Feds faxed me the indictment.
Who called them?

334
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,421
- Didn't you?
- No.

335
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,075
We just picked him up this morning.

336
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:48,406
Never even got him into the system.

337
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,026
Then how do they know we collared him?

338
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,147
Can you do anything about it?

339
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:52,996
Feds' jurisdiction trumps ours.

340
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:54,886
We don't even get an extradition hearing.

341
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:57,315
Well, it doesn't matter.
This indictment's a crock.

342
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,779
Picard kidnaps Tiffany in Mississippi

343
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,563
and the feds indict him in Louisiana?

344
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,401
He raped her there.
It's part of the same crime.

345
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:04,830
The Feds can try him in either state.

346
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,120
Olivia, they're gonna drop the kidnapping
charge and let Louisiana try him for rape.

347
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,125
Because raping a child under the age of 12
in Louisiana is a capital crime.

348
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,158
I don't understand why you're so ticked off
about this, Casey.

349
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:20,104
The Feds are saving you
a lot of time and trouble.

350
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,148
The Feds are pushing
their own agenda.

351
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:24,238
Louisianan has the death penalty
and we don't.

352
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:26,071
That's why they want
Picard tried there.

353
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:28,556
And you're not about
to get screwed without a fight.

354
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:30,509
Look, I'm not going to let them
abuse their power

355
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:33,122
and emasculate
the authority of my office.

356
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:36,052
Problem is, I don't have
any legal standing to stop them.

357
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,454
But you do.

358
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,597
You mean as Mr. Picard's attorney.

359
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:42,322
The Feds want to extradite him
under the table.

360
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,534
That's a violation of due process.

361
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:46,003
You're a constitutional lawyer.

362
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:47,880
I never thought I'd see the day

363
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,057
when a prosecutor would ask
for my help.

364
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,674
Just get him back into my custody

365
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:53,403
and I'll have a judge
appoint a legal aid attorney

366
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,396
and you're out of it.
Deal?

367
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:58,746
You don't think I'm gonna pass up
the chance to beat those sneaky SOBs

368
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,819
at their own game, do you?

369
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:01,870
Thanks.

370
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:05,515
Um, Mr. Picard does have
some psychiatric issues.

371
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:07,524
Is it okay if our Dr. Huang evaluates him?

372
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:10,488
Can't hurt.
I got to war with the Feds,

373
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:13,539
I'm gonna need all the ammunition
I can get.

374
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:17,506
Metropolitan Correctional Center
Mental Health Unit
Thursday, October 11

375
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:19,621
Why did you attack detective Stabler?

376
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:22,995
Well, I saw the sign
on the truck in the park.

377
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:25,671
It said, "Time to escape."

378
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,160
A lot of people have seen that sign.

379
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,889
I know.

380
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,709
But the message was for me.

381
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,378
Have you seen any other messages?

382
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:39,356
Well, there... there was one
on a billboard.

383
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:43,281
It said, "You really need to get away."

384
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:46,010
So, uh...

385
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,726
Yeah, I pulled the car into a bus stop
and...

386
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,361
and got away as fast as I could.

387
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:56,810
Francine's sending the messages.

388
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:58,846
Who's Francine?

389
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,499
My sister.

390
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:03,478
Why is she sending you messages?

391
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:08,826
Because those boys raped her.

392
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:15,201
Are you okay, Saul?

393
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:23,144
I came home from school one day
and I heard them upstairs.

394
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:26,632
Listen, they...they are here...

395
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,915
I know those boys from school.

396
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:38,883
They're taking turns on her.

397
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:40,806
You like that?

398
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,060
You want some more?

399
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:47,923
She's screaming for help.

400
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:49,686
Stop it.

401
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,032
Leave her alone.
Get off her.

402
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:55,029
What did you do?

403
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,130
Nothing.

404
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,304
I froze.

405
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,983
I couldn't move.

406
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:06,639
Why'd they do such
a horrible thing to her?

407
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:10,343
She was just 11.
She was a little girl.

408
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:13,758
How old were you?

409
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:16,144
17.

410
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:18,280
But after that, I was never the same.

411
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,778
The stress of seeing your sister attacked
triggered you first psychotic break.

412
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:23,067
That's why you froze.

413
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,532
Doctors told me that
when they put me on the haldol.

414
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:27,944
- That worked?
- Sure did.

415
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,686
Till it stopped working.

416
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,588
- And when was that?
- Last year.

417
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:34,377
After Francine died.

418
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:36,632
Your doctors must've started you
on some new medication.

419
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:39,107
Well, only thing that worked was rispiridone.

420
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:43,300
But I felt like I was swimming
through wet cement.

421
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,498
You know, struggling to find every word.
Every thought.

422
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:51,604
So I stopped taking it.

423
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:53,843
And that's when the messages started.

424
00:20:53,843 --> 00:20:56,045
And I saw those boys again.

425
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:58,473
The boys that raped your sister?

426
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:02,024
- Where?
- In that bookstore in Gulfport.

427
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:04,064
What happened?

428
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:09,212
I saw Francine.

429
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:15,564
She was in the store reading my book
Bridge to Nowhere.

430
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,919
Those boys were gathered around her.

431
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:20,822
She was in terrible danger.

432
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,629
- What did you do?
- Took her someplace safe.

433
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:25,768
But they found us.

434
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:32,435
Two of them held me down
and the other one raped her.

435
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:36,782
It was horrible.
I couldn't do anything.

436
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,512
But then I set a trap.

437
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:46,042
I took Francine to New York.

438
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:48,963
I knew they'd follow us.

439
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:52,165
Francine and me.

440
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:55,300
We lured them to the arch.

441
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:59,638
And this time, when they came to rape her,

442
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,368
I was ready.

443
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,889
I beat them with rocks.

444
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:09,950
I beat them so bad, they ran.

445
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:17,914
I saved Francine.

446
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:23,459
I made things right.

447
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:32,610
He's not a pedophile.

448
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,165
He's a schizophrenic.

449
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:37,525
He kidnapped those girls because
he thinks they're his sister Francine.

450
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:41,385
But will he ever realize that he's the one
that beat and raped Sabrina and Tiffany?

451
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:44,377
It's possible. But it's also possible
that he won't remember.

452
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:47,636
Right. So we have to wait
for his rispiridone to kick in.

453
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:49,432
If it kicks in.

454
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:51,126
What do you mean "if"?

455
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:53,693
Haldol helped him with
his schizophrenia for years.

456
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:55,020
Until his sister died.

457
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,158
It's possible that any medication we give
him won't work in times of great stress.

458
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:00,951
Are you saying he might not make it
through a trial?

459
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:02,851
Are you actually considering
putting him though one? / Yeah.

460
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:05,448
- After what he did to Sabrina Farmer...
- You heard what he said.

461
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:07,448
He believes that
his hallucinations are real.

462
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:08,664
He thinks that he saved her.

463
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:10,761
He belongs in a hospital.

464
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:12,685
I'll take that under advisement.

465
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:14,516
Casey, the man is sick.

466
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:17,452
Putting him in prison is no less
cruel and unusual punishment

467
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:20,317
than the Feds trying
to have him executed.

468
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,887
Text message from Picard's lawyer.

469
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,898
We don't have to worry
about the Feds anymore.

470
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:28,726
You don't think that's going
to stop Louisiana

471
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:31,500
from trying to get
their hands on him, do you?

472
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,798
Then maybe I should
send them a message.

473
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:37,555
Miss Novak, any comment
on the US attorney's decision

474
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:40,345
to drop the federal kidnapping charges
against Saul Picard?

475
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:43,282
We're pleased the Justice Department
has decided to stay out of state's business

476
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:45,077
and clear the way for us
to seek an indictment.

477
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:47,290
What will you do if Louisiana
extradites Mr. Picard

478
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,347
to face the death penalty?

479
00:23:48,347 --> 00:23:50,814
I fully expect Louisianan
to file for extradition.

480
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:53,566
But we have Mr. Picard now,
and this is where he's going to stay.

481
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,828
Do you believe that capital punishment
is appropriate for the rape of a child?

482
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,655
What I believe isn't the issue.

483
00:23:58,655 --> 00:24:00,651
Right now, that's not the law
of the State of New York.

484
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:03,195
If and when the legislature
makes that the law,

485
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:05,162
I will enforce it
to the best of my ability.

486
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:07,655
- Thank you.
- I hope you mean that.

487
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,587
Hey, mean what?

488
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:12,510
That you're not going to let
Louisianan have my client.

489
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,291
That's right.
I'm gonna try him here.

490
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:18,655
Why? / Because Louisiana
is not wasting any time.

491
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,444
Motion for extradition.

492
00:24:20,444 --> 00:24:23,329
- Did you tell your client about this?
- Yes.

493
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,752
He wants to talk to you.

494
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,902
Rikers Island
Mental Health Wing
Friday, October 12

495
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,420
Mr. Picard.

496
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:41,854
This is Miss Novak.

497
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:44,234
Please call me Saul.

498
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:47,107
Okay.

499
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:49,047
Saul.

500
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:56,763
My medication is working.

501
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,438
So you understand what you did.

502
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:04,442
Yes.
Tell the other girls I'm sorry.

503
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:08,426
That I'd do anything to take it back.

504
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:15,403
- Would you like to make a statement?
- Yes.

505
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,840
Send me to Louisiana.

506
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,870
But you could face the death penalty.

507
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,979
That's what I want.

508
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:30,619
- Mr. Picard, that's not gonna h...
- I don't deserve to live.

509
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:32,808
Don't you understand?

510
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:44,376
If the state thinks that killing me
will stop one pervert from...

511
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:51,199
Doing what I did
to those poor little girls,

512
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,884
then it's worth it.

513
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:03,464
Please.

514
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:06,872
Let me go home to die.

515
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:19,461
You can't put Saul Picard on trial.

516
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:20,622
I don't have a choice, Barry.

517
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,570
Just because he's schizophrenic
doesn't mean he can't stand trial.

518
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,198
You know he's crazy.

519
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:28,621
Then file for a 730 hearing
and have his competency questioned.

520
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,242
He won't let me.
I'm his attorney.

521
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:34,370
I have to abide by what he wishes.

522
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,257
But you don't.

523
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:38,717
So now you're asking me for help.

524
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:41,770
He can waive extradition
if he's declared incompetent.

525
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,785
And if he's declared incompetent,
he can't stand trial and I can't allow that.

526
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:47,733
Then make a deal, Casey.

527
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:52,059
He pleads guilty and you send him
to a mental institution instead of a prison.

528
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,407
If you think Jack McCoy
is gonna let me get away with that,

529
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:56,586
you are crazier than he is.

530
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:59,398
So that's what this is about.

531
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,200
The new boss wants to show
he's tough on crime

532
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,706
and you want to be a team player
instead of doing the right thing.

533
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:09,825
The right thing?

534
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:15,229
Saul Picard raped an 11-yeal-old girl
and beat her to within an inch of her life.

535
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:19,337
No, Casey.
That's Saul Picard.

536
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,264
Look at him.

537
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:26,745
He's not the same man
who raped Sabrina Farmer.

538
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:38,768
Moredock has a point.

539
00:27:38,768 --> 00:27:42,089
Picard didn't hurt Sabrina,
the fairy tales in his head did.

540
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:44,600
He wouldn't have had those fairy tales
if he stayed on his meds.

541
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,712
But he didn't know by not taking them
he'd turn into Godzilla.

542
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:50,017
But he was lucid when he made
the decision to stop,

543
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,857
- and that makes him responsible.
- Damn right.

544
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:53,859
There ought to be a law
for people like Picard.

545
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:56,965
Take your meds or we're gonna
force-feed them to you.

546
00:27:57,364 --> 00:28:00,111
You think that you can prove
that Picard knew that he hurt someone?

547
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,347
Sabrina Farmer on the witness stand
is all the evidence I'll need to convict.

548
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:06,061
Then what, he goes back to Louisiana?

549
00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:08,781
- If we let him.
- Don't let him, Casey.

550
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:11,769
I never picked you for being soft
on Capital Punishment.

551
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:14,765
It's a no-brainer. Death penalty's
never been a deterrent for murder.

552
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:16,473
Most killer strike once.

553
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:19,039
Animals who rape kids usually repeat.

554
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,899
Threaten to execute them for rape,

555
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,022
they have nothing to lose
by killing their victims to silence them.

556
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:26,115
But execute them, they'll never
hurt another child.

557
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:27,744
Exactly.

558
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:33,807
I'm gonna need your fives.

559
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:36,062
When do you want me on the stand?

560
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:39,307
Uh, I don't think I do.
I'll just use Sabrina and Elliot.

561
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:42,202
Oh, you don't need Elliot.
I saw everything that Picard did.

562
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:43,685
But you didn't hear what he said

563
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:46,396
and I need Elliot to show the jury
what Picard is capable of.

564
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:47,880
Well, the police surgeon said that

565
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,417
Elliot can't leave his house
until his vision's back.

566
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,951
Unless he has to appear in court.

567
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:55,057
Casey.

568
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:57,539
Elliot has a better chance
for a quicker recovery

569
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,697
if we don't stress him out.

570
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,647
Look, I know he appreciates you
looking out for him.

571
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:02,628
It's my job to look out for him.

572
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:09,276
He is perfectly capable
of making this decision on his own,

573
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:11,408
so I'll take to him myself.

574
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:12,740
Leave him alone, Casey.

575
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,290
I can't.

576
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:20,987
Coming.

577
00:29:26,922 --> 00:29:28,465
It's Casey.

578
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:30,536
I know.
I can see you. Come on in.

579
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,114
I'm sorry, I...

580
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:34,745
Expecting a seeing eye dog and a cane?

581
00:29:35,977 --> 00:29:37,240
Maybe.

582
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,416
To tell you the truth, so was I.
Have a seat.

583
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:45,154
It's...

584
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,321
It's just, uh, a little blurry.

585
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,339
But I'm getting better.

586
00:29:50,653 --> 00:29:53,689
Better enough to drag you into court?

587
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:57,193
- Olivia said you were coming by.
- Yeah.

588
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:59,903
She was worried that you weren't up to it.

589
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:01,895
I'm a big boy.

590
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:06,306
And you're sure you can handle
facing Picard?

591
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:10,242
You know I'm gonna have
a child in a month.

592
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:14,958
That's scary enough.

593
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:21,749
It was the thought that I was never gonna
be able to see that child.

594
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:26,790
That terrified me.

595
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,854
So Picard...

596
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:35,944
bring him on.

597
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,997
Trial Part 38
Thursday, November 8

598
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:41,896
I was taking Mr. Picard to our car.

599
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:44,292
He tried to escape,
I attempted to subdue him,

600
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:45,656
and he head butted me.

601
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:47,559
What happened?

602
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:53,655
Uh, I fell backwards, head first,
through the rear window of the car.

603
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:55,511
How badly were you injured?

604
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:58,600
I sustained head injuries
that have left me temporarily blind.

605
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,984
Can you see the defendant now?

606
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:13,511
That's him right there.

607
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:17,350
Would you consider Mr. Picard dangerous?

608
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,215
I would consider him
extremely dangerous.

609
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:25,496
When Mr. Picard started attacking you,

610
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,760
was he saying anything?

611
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,501
He was repeating over and over,
"It's time to escape."

612
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:33,672
Mr. Picard told our psychiatrist
that a sign was sending him that message.

613
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:35,732
Did you see that sign?

614
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,446
- Yes.
- And was he distraught?

615
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:42,684
Yes.

616
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:44,830
In your experience as a police officer,

617
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,915
would you say that Mr. Picard
qualifies as an EDP?

618
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:58,516
Yes. / Would you please tell the jury
what that means?

619
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:04,595
EDP stands for Emotionally
Disturbed Person.

620
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:07,811
- In other words, he's crazy, right?
- Don't answer that, Detective.

621
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:12,045
He is not qualified to draw
that conclusion, counselor.

622
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:17,296
Did the defendant ever utter the name
Francine in your presence?

623
00:32:17,296 --> 00:32:18,831
No.

624
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:22,395
Did he mention witnessing
his sister being gang raped

625
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:24,332
- and doing nothing to stop it?
- No.

626
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:26,303
Did he say it was his fault?

627
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:29,366
He never mentioned anything
about his sister in my presence.

628
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,962
Why?
Why... why should I?

629
00:32:30,962 --> 00:32:33,286
Yeah, why should I trust God?

630
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,468
Control your client, Mr. Moredock.

631
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:38,488
One more time, sir, and I'll have you
removed from this courtroom.

632
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:40,575
He made me rape those girls.

633
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,786
I am your older brother, Francine.

634
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:45,809
I... I finally rescued you
from those boys...

635
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:48,359
- Just be quiet now, Saul.
- Why do you keep testing me?

636
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,616
Stop testing me, Francine.

637
00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:52,054
Officers, remove the defendant.

638
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,507
You... you did this, Francine.

639
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:57,238
You brought him in to test me.

640
00:32:57,238 --> 00:33:01,599
I can't face him.
Why do you keep making me face him?

641
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,117
Stop testing me!

642
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:06,187
Stop testing me, Francine!

643
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:08,451
Stop testing me!

644
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:13,142
- Your Honor...
- Don't bother, Mr. Moredock.

645
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:17,212
After what the jury just witnessed,
I am declaring a mistrial.

646
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:21,040
And before we start this freak
show up again, Miss Novak,

647
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,235
I'm calling for a 730 hearing

648
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:27,447
to determine whether Mr. Picard
is competent to stand trial.

649
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:30,340
You may step down, Detective.

650
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:32,583
We're adjourned.

651
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,862
Hey, Casey.

652
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:34,893
Casey!
What was that?

653
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:35,871
I don't know what you're talking about.

654
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:37,291
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

655
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,854
You never wanted to try that guy.

656
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:40,990
I tried this case to the best of my ability.

657
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,123
Cut the crap.

658
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:45,371
You wanted Picard in the Loony Bin,
and you used me to put him there.

659
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:47,046
Elliot...

660
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:50,996
I'm fine.

661
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:57,985
Yes, sir.

662
00:33:57,985 --> 00:33:59,695
I'll be right up.

663
00:33:59,695 --> 00:34:01,428
You proud of yourself?

664
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:03,167
I don't need a lecture from you.

665
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,123
I know why you sandbagged Elliot
in court.

666
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,150
- Stay out of my desk!
- Where is he now, Casey?

667
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,071
Your schizo ex-boyfriend.
Is he locked up somewhere?

668
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:13,744
Get out of my office.

669
00:34:13,744 --> 00:34:16,324
He's the reason that
you tanked the Picard case.

670
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:18,932
That man deserves to be punished
for what he did.

671
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:22,113
Wait, wait... what he did
to Tiffany Lemarsh or Sabrina Farmer,

672
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:24,619
or are you talking about
payback for what he did to Elliot?

673
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:29,117
You manipulated me and Elliot
to satisfy your own agenda.

674
00:34:29,396 --> 00:34:31,565
Okay, you answer the question, Detective.

675
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:33,565
Who did you let it leak
to that we collared Picard?

676
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:35,105
Did you go straight to the Feds,

677
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:37,188
or did you back-channel it
through the Louisiana cops?

678
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:39,140
Oh, you're damn right I told the Feds.
They have a right to know.

679
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,029
No. You want Picard dead.

680
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:42,700
Louisiana kills him,
your hands are clean.

681
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,572
Those little girls are entitled
to some justice.

682
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:47,784
What you're talking about
isn't justice, it's revenge.

683
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:49,637
He's my partner, Casey.

684
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,463
And it's my case.

685
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:56,353
And how I handle it
is none of your damn business.

686
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,058
Because I don't answer to you.

687
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:01,542
We'll see.

688
00:35:02,108 --> 00:35:04,475
Office of District Attorney Jack McCoy
Thursday, November 8

689
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,882
- Congratulations.
- For what?

690
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:10,988
The excellent job you did
as Saul Picard's defense attorney.

691
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,987
- Judge Bradley called me.
- Jack, I...

692
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,538
I told him he must be mistaken,

693
00:35:14,538 --> 00:35:17,029
since I only have prosecutors
working in this office.

694
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:18,973
At least I thought I did...

695
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:20,844
until I got this.

696
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:28,249
- Who gave this to you?
- What matters is what's in it.

697
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:32,280
Five years ago, the cops responded to
a disturbance call in your apartment.

698
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,213
You told the officers it was mistake,
but it isn't true, is it?

699
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,130
My fiancee Charlie, he attacked me.

700
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,380
He was a schizophrenic
and he was off his medication.

701
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,453
When the police saw the cuts
and bruises on my face and neck,

702
00:35:47,453 --> 00:35:49,829
they wanted to arrest Charlie.

703
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:52,585
But I thought I could help him.

704
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:55,683
So I identified myself as an ADA.

705
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:58,211
And I begged them not to take him in.

706
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:02,202
You abused the authority of this office
for personal reason back then?

707
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,682
Just like you're doing now!

708
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:06,693
Sick people like Saul Picard
shouldn't be put to death.

709
00:36:06,693 --> 00:36:09,385
The last time I checked,
the supreme court still says

710
00:36:09,385 --> 00:36:12,254
you can't execute a mentally ill
person in this country.

711
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,114
And what... what if a jury
found him responsible

712
00:36:14,114 --> 00:36:17,093
because he was lucid when he decided
to stop taking his medication?

713
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:20,263
That's not your problem.
That's why he has a defense attorney.

714
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:24,649
No defense attorney could make a jury
see past what he did to those little girls.

715
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,949
So you weren't about to take
a chance he'd be convicted?

716
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:31,385
Because he belongs in a hospital,
not a prison cell, and you now it.

717
00:36:34,178 --> 00:36:35,632
I'll tell you what I know.

718
00:36:35,632 --> 00:36:38,564
You're going to stay on this
case through the 730 hearing,

719
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:40,309
and you're going to behave yourself.

720
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:44,223
Because if you don't,
I'm not only going to fire you,

721
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:46,787
I'll make sure the bar yanks your license.

722
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,665
And if you don't think
I have the juice to do it, try me.

723
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,466
Why did you rat me out to the DA?

724
00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:12,803
Because you threw the case.

725
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:15,680
I had no choice after you
sold out Picard to the Feds.

726
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,343
Look, uh, Casey.
I'm as guilty as you are.

727
00:37:18,343 --> 00:37:20,092
You were right.

728
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:24,101
I wanted revenge.

729
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:27,931
For Elliot.

730
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:28,861
Is he okay?

731
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:31,250
He'll be back to work next week.

732
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:34,764
How about Picard?

733
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:37,006
The judge ruled him incompetent.

734
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,575
Louisiana can't touch him now.

735
00:37:46,656 --> 00:37:49,096
Do you think he'll ever get better?

736
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,241
I don't know.
I thought Charlie would get better.

737
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,094
What happened?

738
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:03,853
I got a call from the morgue
about six months ago.

739
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:05,925
A John Doe clipped by a passing cab.

740
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:09,333
No ID on him but my business card.

741
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,748
It was Charlie.

742
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:16,215
Maybe he'd be alive
if I hadn't make him leave.

743
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:17,718
Casey.

744
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:20,214
You had to save yourself.

745
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,768
What?

746
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:37,540
Picard made a noose out of his shirt
and tried to hang himself in lock-up.

747
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,905
New York State Mental Hospital
Saratoga Springs, NY
Friday, November 9

748
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:58,748
Hi.

749
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:02,094
Ms. Novak.

750
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:04,630
Call me Casey.

751
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:09,404
Why are you here?

752
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:12,263
I heard you tried to hurt yourself.

753
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,311
I'm not crazy.

754
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:21,185
I'm on my medication.

755
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:23,049
That's good.

756
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,608
I want to die.

757
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:29,953
You should have let them execute me.

758
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:35,462
I'd rather be dead than
live with what I've done.

759
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:41,940
You see, every day...

760
00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:46,122
I get a little better.

761
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:51,360
And the better I get...

762
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:58,097
The worse I feel about
what I did to those girls.

763
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:09,265
Maybe one day you can forgive yourself
when you realize it wasn't your fault.

764
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:15,929
Wasn't it?
