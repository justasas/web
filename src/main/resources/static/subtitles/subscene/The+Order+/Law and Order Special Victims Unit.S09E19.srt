1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,888
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,888 --> 00:00:06,638
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:07,779
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:11,268
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:14,345
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:16,007
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:21,149
32-year-old white female.
Blunt force trauma.

8
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,888
Victim's missing vehicle
pointed to a carjacking.

9
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:25,244
You locate her vehicle?

10
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:27,504
A burned-out hull
in the next county.

11
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:30,205
Did the pathologist uncover 
distal skull fractures?

12
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:31,722
Yes, he did.

13
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:33,346
The scene's staged.

14
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:35,377
Was there evidence
of sexual assault?

15
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:36,866
Nothing probative.

16
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,573
Was she in a relationship?

17
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,111
A fiance.
We looked at him.

18
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:43,343
I'd take another look.
A lot of overkill for a robbery.

19
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,702
The rage is personal.

20
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:47,806
Were the signs of lividity consistent
with body position?

21
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:50,117
You get a chance to look
at those photos I sent you?

22
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,772
There are 82 members
who would be glad to help.

23
00:00:52,772 --> 00:00:55,685
Present to the group.
Take advantage of our expertise.

24
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:58,599
Vidocq's swamped.
There isn't an open slot for a year.

25
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:01,141
Chester, stop being so stubborn.

26
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:04,216
Ten years is a long time
to hold on to a case.

27
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:07,156
I'm asking you, Pen.

28
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:09,507
Your victim was dumped.

29
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:12,759
Sort through everything.
Determine what belongs and what doesn't.

30
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,430
If he made mistakes,
I didn't find any. / Not yet.

31
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,588
- Also re-interview any witnesses.
- There weren't any.

32
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:23,537
That's not exactly true.
There was one.

33
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:30,504
- What are you selling, Brett?
- Criminal defense.

34
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,275
Yeah, hard to imagine.

35
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,713
You've worked sex crimes 
longer than most,

36
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:37,894
and you're still passionate.
We need you.

37
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:40,510
Yeah, well, it's harder to care
when your clients are guilty.

38
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,792
Ours are accused of SEC violations,

39
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,847
not diddling some four-year-old 
on a playground.

40
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:48,274
I'm sorry, I have to go.

41
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,082
No more late-night calls.

42
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,645
No more rape victims and dead kids.

43
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:56,260
How do you sleep at night?

44
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:58,279
I don't.

45
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,317
Captain, it was a cop shooting.

46
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,480
Everyone's using their cell phones.
How did the press get wind?

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,934
They followed the line of brass
out of one PP.

48
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,847
So we have one dead cop
and one wounded. Why are we here?

49
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:18,550
Because I fought for it.

50
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,748
- Control this crime scene.
- Who's our victim?

51
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,385
Precinct Detective Edward Kralik.

52
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,085
- Any suspects?
- One.

53
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:28,532
You are not allowed to question him,
nothing searched without a warrant,

54
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,642
and you keep me on speed dial.

55
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,478
Who the hell is he?

56
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,708
Detective Chester Lake.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2008/05/13

74
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:40,501
- I see the circus is in town.
- What do you expect?

75
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:43,637
When cops shoot each other,
clowns come out. It's entertainment.

76
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,051
What's got him riled?

77
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,987
Guilty by association.

78
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:53,312
I count at least five GSWs.
He's officially dead. Can I take him?

79
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:56,000
Forensics hasn't finished mapping.
Let me get you an ETA.

80
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:03,047
Don't move! / Who the hell you think
you're talking to, Detective?

81
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:06,541
You... you're stepping
in my blood evidence, Inspector.

82
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:10,825
If you're finished,
Warner wants the body.

83
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,312
We're almost done.
We're freezing the scene in time.

84
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:16,742
- Virtual crime scene.
- It's called "scanstation 2."

85
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,198
I don't know how we lived without it.

86
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:20,200
You'll be able to look
from any angle you want.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,257
The lasers are capturing 
every detail in 3-D.

88
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:27,305
It can show us where
each other shooter was standing.

89
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:29,149
Can it tell us who pulled
the trigger first?

90
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:31,225
No, only Lake can do that.

91
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:33,037
Wish we could ask him.

92
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:34,992
No harm in checking on his condition.

MERCY GENERAL HOSPITAL
365 WEST 32ND STREET
TUESDAY, MARCH 18

94
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,993
Hey, how you feelings?

95
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:46,952
I took through and thorough
in the arm and the leg. I'll live.

96
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,170
Feel up to talking?

97
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,377
No.

98
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:54,329
Doesn't look good, Chester.
You need to give us your statement.

99
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,444
No, I don't.

100
00:04:56,444 --> 00:05:00,431
- This isn't going away.
- I don't expect it to.

101
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:05,245
But I know you won't question me,
at least not for the next 48 hours.

102
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:08,563
- You're invoking.
- Section 118-09,

103
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:11,888
no superior investigating
officer can talk to me for two days.

104
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:14,533
It's called coerced testimony.

105
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,394
You go down this road,
there's no coming back.

106
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,521
What's this about?

107
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,433
Give us something.

108
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,774
Are you interrogating me, Detective?

109
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:35,287
No.
I'm watching you drown.

110
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,321
We can't clear Lake
without his statement.

111
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:48,791
If it was justified,
why not just say so?

112
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,904
He invoked, and his silence
proves nothing.

113
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:52,392
What do we have on Edward Kralik?

114
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:56,991
Well, he came up through the ranks.
Unspectacular, but solid patrol officer.

115
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,373
Promoted to Detective.
He works out of the one-four.

116
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:03,027
According to witnesses, Lake and Kralik 
were going at it outside his precinct.

117
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:04,249
How do they know each other?

118
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:05,903
Came up through
the same Brooklyn house.

119
00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:07,924
Any history of beefs between them?

120
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:10,479
- None that we found.
- Then dig deeper.

121
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,459
A verbal argument between two cops
doesn't escalate to murder

122
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,673
without some damn good reason why.

123
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,607
You find anything
at Lake's apartment?

124
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:23,940
Ticket stub for a train
from Philly dated yesterday.

125
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,722
- What was he doing there?
- Good question.

126
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:27,981
We dumped Lake's phone.
From the roaming charges,

127
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:30,875
he's been in Philadelphia
at the same time every month.

128
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:35,820
- Have any idea why?
- I said I don't know.

129
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,681
What do you mean?
You're his partner.

130
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:39,307
Do you know everything about Olivia?

131
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:42,104
No, but I'd notice
if she disappeared once a month.

132
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,869
We'll find out. I left messages
with the Philly numbers.

133
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:49,094
- I'm expecting callbacks.
- So we'll follow the evidence.

134
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:52,732
Since Lake's not talking, maybe we can 
reconstruct what happened in that lot.

135
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,488
Thought you fell in.

136
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:03,446
I'm not used to sitting to take a leak.

137
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:07,002
That's the price of turning a vacant lot,
into OK Corral.

138
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,929
You know you shouldn't be here, Fin.

139
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,196
Neither should you,
but here we are.

140
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,672
I'm all ears.

141
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:22,694
I got nothing to say.

142
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:26,157
Well, my partner would never shoot anyone
except in self defense.

143
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:27,999
You don't know me, Fin.

144
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,954
And you never made any effort until now.

145
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,960
All you had to do
was pick up the damn phone.

146
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,890
I would've backed your play.

147
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,547
I had it covered. / Yeah, those holes 
in your body say different.

148
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:39,165
What's going on in Philly?

149
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:41,747
Really good cheese steaks.

150
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:44,725
You got us running blind, man.
We're trying to save your ass.

151
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,555
If you don't walk me through this,
you're going upstate.

152
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,410
I hope you know what you're doing.

153

OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
TUESDAY, MARCH 18

154
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,205
I'm ruling Detective Kralik's 
death a homicide.

155
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,486
Five gunshot wounds.

156
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,257
One nine-millimeter projectile
hit the left lung and pierced the heart.

157
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:07,993
The second lodged in the victim's spine.

158
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:09,282
Either one could've killed him.

159
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,536
Center mass hits
from a right-handed shooter.

160
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:14,749
Problem is the non-fatal shots
came from behind,

161
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:18,589
penetrating the upper-right thigh,
right buttock, and upper back.

162
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:21,056
You think Kralik was running away
and Lake shot him in the back?

163
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:23,696
Dropped him in his tracks,
finished him off with two to the chest.

164
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:24,850
It's possible.

165
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,078
There were shell casings
all over the crime scene.

166
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,630
They had to be crouching and rotating.

167
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,476
Would that explain the back wounds?

168
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,136
It's a reach.

169
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,678
What does Lake say happened?

170
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:36,340
Nothing, which is why
we're spinning our wheels.

171
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,391
Did ballistics test-fire Lake's gun?

172
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:40,673
All five shots came from his glock.

173
00:08:40,673 --> 00:08:43,338
They're checking both guns
for ejection patterns,

174
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,141
and matching trajectory
to wound tracks.

175
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:46,868
Maybe that'll give you some answers.

176
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:50,150
Or maybe we should start accepting
that Lake murdered Ed Kralik.

177
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,588
You find anything on Lake's 
movements? / Not yet.

178
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:55,263
What's got your undivided attention?

179
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:58,051
It's a cold case file 
I found in Lake's desk.

180
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:01,154
One of ours? / No, this is 
from Brooklyn, ten years ago.

181
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:02,801
He was still working on it.

182
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:06,804
There's recent notes. He said he wanted 
to re-interview the first responders.

183
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,500
How's that connect to the shooting?

184
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,597
Ed Kralik was one of them.

185
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:13,298
The notes mention
what they talked about?

186
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:16,261
- I don't think they got that far.
- Excuse me.

187
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,051
- I'm looking for Detective Munch.
- Right there.

188
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:21,823
- May I help you?
- I'm Penelope Fielding.

189
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:23,294
You left messages on my voicemail,

190
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,488
so I caught the first train in from Philly.

191
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:27,183
Is Chester all right?

192
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,787
He's stable.
How do you know him?

193
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,021
What hospital is he in?

194
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:33,922
Uh, he's not seeing anyone right now.
What's your connection to Lake?

195
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:38,160
We belong to a group called 
The Vidocq Society based in Philadelphia.

196
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,687
Once a month, we hear cold case 
presentations from law enforcement,

197
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:44,136
and redirect focus on 
unsolved homicides.

198
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:45,765
Explains the frequent trips out of town.

199
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,504
Okay, why would a cop 
spend his free time

200
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,054
trying to solve other people's cold cases?

201
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,015
Freedom.
We work without politics or bosses.

202
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:57,234
Olivia, Elliot... my office.

203
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:04,061
You think you could manage
to read Detective Lake his rights?

204
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,734
I miss something? / I specifically 
told you not to question him.

205
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:11,334
He's under the 48-hour rule
and shielded from interrogation.

206
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:12,638
Don't worry.
He didn't say anything.

207
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:15,326
Yeah, and lucky for you.
Because if he talked,

208
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:17,683
it would've been inadmissible
and under immunity.

209
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,360
Okay, so how are we
supposed to put this down

210
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,548
when most crimes are solved
within the first 48?

211
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,040
You know what?
That's not my problem.

212
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,006
So you either follow orders,
or just stay out of the way.

213
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:29,696
This isn't my call.

214
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:33,129
Lake killed a cop in what appears
to be an unprovoked shooting.

215
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,849
So why not wait for the rest 
of the evidence to get processed?

216
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:36,895
What is the rush?

217
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:40,019
If it were anybody else,
he's already be in shackles,

218
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,566
so just do your job.

219
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,581
He's running.

220
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:01,230
He hasn't been gone long.
IV's still pretty full.

221
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,225
I'll get hospital security
to help with the search.

222
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:06,250
I'll call Casey, get a subpoena
to dump Tutuola's phone.

223
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,980
You think Fin warned him?

224
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:10,978
Who else would've told Lake
we were coming?

225
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:17,044
Searched the hospital from the ground up.
Units are parked outside Lake's home.

226
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,188
Dumping my phones
was a bitch move, Stabler.

227
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:20,658
Yeah, I called him.
I didn't think he'd run.

228
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,852
- You should've stayed out of it.
- Take it easy. / He's my partner.

229
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,169
Who you helped evade arrest.

230
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,612
Dial it down 
or you're both going on report.

231
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,357
Lake is not our problem anymore.

232
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,150
The fugitive apprehension team
will take it from here.

233
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,709
All those guys do is workout
and shoot guns. They're gonna kill Lake.

234
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,377
Well, that's not how
FAT works, Detective.

235
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:42,224
Kralik's got a lot of friends on the street 
that'd like to see Lake dead.

236
00:11:42,224 --> 00:11:43,396
You gotta at least let me look.

237
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:44,975
Where you gonna start?
You don't even know the guy.

238
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:46,101
I know he didn't do it.

239
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:48,141
Three bullet holes in
the victim's back say different.

240
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,949
You ever think the force
behind the first two spun Kralik?

241
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:53,258
We're trained to keep firing
till the subject is down.

242
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:56,675
And you're assuming
that the fatal shots came first.

243
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:04,700
Have ballistics run both scenarios, 
see which one fits.

244
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:13,761
- You check out Penelope Fielding?
- She's legit.

245
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:16,665
She ran the regional lab in Richmond,
consults at Quantico,

246
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:18,741
and volunteers on Vidocq.

247
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:20,444
Well, get her statement
and show her the door.

248
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:23,590
Lake's only connection
to Kralik is a cold case.

249
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,508
- Maybe she can help.
- I know all about the Vidocq society.

250
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:28,961
So does the Brass, and they don't want 
them anywhere near this.

251
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,546
They've solved a lot of open homicides.

252
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:32,221
Easy to do when you pick and choose.

253
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,947
Yeah, but Lake has held on
to this case for ten years.

254
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:36,812
He must've talked to her about it.

255
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:40,832
Limited access only,
then I want her gone.

256
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,949
Undocumented female,
Alisa Hernandez, 14.

257
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,044
Found raped and strangled
in a vacant lot ten years ago.

258
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:51,205
Last seen leaving school with
her best friend Cecelia Cruz.

259
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:54,435
When questioned, the girl said 
they split up and didn't see anything.

260
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,350
Cecelia was lying.

261
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,669
Her statement's full of elliptical pauses,
which indicated invention.

262
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:02,049
Well, she was scared.
The victim was in the country illegally.

263
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,767
A good bet is that
her best friend was too.

264
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,960
Lying makes sense when
you're running from immigration.

265
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,555
I also suggested he re-examine
the crime scene

266
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,343
for what should be there 
and what shouldn't.

267
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:11,606
Like our dead cop.

268
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:14,498
He responded to the call even though 
it was outside his patrol sector.

269
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:16,074
- That's suggestive.
- Why?

270
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:18,482
When I was in uniform,
I went to a lot of calls that weren't mine.

271
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:21,898
Alisa's killer used a condom
and tried to wipe the body down.

272
00:13:21,898 --> 00:13:24,807
- A lot of rapists do.
- They didn't ten years ago.

273
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:27,424
DNA was just starting
to get convictions.

274
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:31,238
But a cop would have
forensic knowledge. Like Kralik.

275
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:33,614
We know Lake confronted Kralik.

276
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:36,178
Phone dumps show he got a call
to his cell from a payphone

277
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:38,285
a 1/2 hour before the shooting started.

278
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,504
If Lake knew the guy was a killer,

279
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:42,450
he wouldn't have met him
in such an isolated spot.

280
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,063
Not if he thought this was finally 
his chance to get the truth.

281
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:46,850
So we run Alisa's rape kit.

282
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,494
If Kralik's our guy,
Lake's off the hook.

283
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,282
EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE 
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 19

284
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:58,126
I thought you got federal money
to get rape kits into CODIS.

285
00:13:58,126 --> 00:14:01,211
It was 12 million bucks.
We had 20,000 kits.

286
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:02,921
You do the math.

287
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,306
Here it is.

288
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:09,548
"Hernandez, Alisa.
Homicide, 11-10-97."

289
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,475
- What happened to it?
- Evidence storage got flooded.

290
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,612
A couple of refrigeration units
got burned out.

291
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:16,027
I told all this to the other two dicks.

292
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:18,663
- Tell me you got names.
- Detective Lake.

293
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:20,162
Said he wanted it pulled
and sent to the lab,

294
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:23,154
but you can't fast-track a specimen
without command approval.

295
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,508
- Who's the other Detective?
- Kralik.

296
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:28,486
Wanted to confirm the request was made.

297
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:31,901
Captain Cragen of Manhattan SVU
wants this DNA sample rushed,

298
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:33,523
so I'm gonna take it in myself.

299
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:44,185
I was getting the cold shoulder
in your precinct, so thanks for coming.

300
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:46,532
Bosses think you'll make us look bad.

301
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,636
If you get me the 3-D scan
and the ballistic measurements,

302
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:53,065
I can recreate the most likely
scenario for what happened in that lot.

303
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:54,228
Our people can do that.

304
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,084
How long will it take them?

305
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,088
How many cases do they have
that are just as pressing as this one?

306
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:01,852
- There is no other case.
- That's what you'd like to believe.

307
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,615
I ran a lab. The world doesn't stop
because you want it to.

308
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:07,700
I can't help you, Pen.

309
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:13,662
Proving Kralik's a rapist
isn't gonna be enough to clear Chester.

310
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:17,791
I know he didn't shoot first.

311
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,278
- Has there been any word?
- Nothing.

312
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,571
Lake got shot twice.
He should be easy to find.

313
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:28,103
- He's a resourceful guy.
- You should know.

314
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:31,725
You seem pretty angry.

315
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:34,927
Yeah, before today if anybody had asked
if Lake was involved,

316
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,480
I would've said no,
and I would've been wrong.

317
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,733
You think he doesn't trust you.

318
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,741
When in fact he's been trying
to earn your respect.

319
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:46,635
He said you were a hard person 
to know. / Like he's easy.

320
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:49,220
You have any idea
where we can find him?

321
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:54,380
You could try his ex-partner,
Wesley Meadows.

322
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,918
They kept in touch.

323
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,481
I haven't heard from Lake
in six months.

324
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:01,054
Same damn conversation,
The Hernandez murder.

325
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:03,343
- He was obsessed about it?
- Haunted.

326
00:16:03,343 --> 00:16:04,719
His first case.

327
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,758
Poor kid gets yoked midday
and nobody sees nothing.

328
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,907
What about her best friend,
Cecelia Cruz?

329
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:11,603
Lying through her teeth.

330
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,957
Two girls walk home from school every day
except the day one gets done?

331
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:17,619
- Sell me a bridge.
- You try to re-interview Cecelia?

332
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:21,068
Lake tried, but her family skipped.
Can't say I blame her.

333
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:23,103
Always thought she was a victim too.

334
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:26,836
- You think Cecelia was raped?
- We saw some bruises,

335
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,186
couldn't look us in the eye,
and couldn't stand to be touched.

336
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:31,067
My gut was screaming.

337
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:34,095
Remember seeing officer
Edward Kralik at the scene?

338
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:36,071
- That the guy Lake popped?
- Yeah.

339
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:38,475
Sorry, ten years is a lifetime ago.

340
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,228
All I remember was hitting the wall.

341
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:43,049
Since most of the neighborhood
is illegal, nobody talked.

342
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,705
Hernandez family still around?

343
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:47,039
No.
But I heard they got amnesty,

344
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,106
so you might be able
to track them down through tax rolls.

345
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:53,645
DARRATY'S FRUIT PACKING
733 HUNTS POINT AVENUE
BRONX, NEW YORK
THURSDAY, MARCH 20

346
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,594
Why are you bringing Alisa up again?

347
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:57,613
I'm trying to move on,
live with it somehow.

348
00:16:57,613 --> 00:16:59,533
We're very sorry,
but there's new evidence

349
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,005
that may tell us what happened
to your daughter.

350
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:02,257
I know what happened.

351
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:05,757
She got murdered in a country
that I told my family was safe.

352
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:09,393
I convinced them that 
this was a great future for all of us.

353
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:11,212
Now I'm here all alone.

354
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,680
Where is your family, Mr. Hernandez?

355
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,612
They went back to El Salvador.
I couldn't leave.

356
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:19,863
Somebody should stay with Alisa,
visit her grave, remember her.

357
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:22,064
Detective Lake never forgot.

358
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:25,113
He's been working on the case
for ten years.

359
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:27,647
- It didn't help him solve it.
- Until now.

360
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:32,408
- You found her killer?
- We believe so.

361
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,764
We think Cecelia Cruz
witnessed the attack.

362
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:36,235
We need to talk to her.

363
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:37,639
No, you're wrong.

364
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,374
She would've told me
if she knew anything.

365
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:41,246
She was 14 years old.

366
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:43,859
A scared little girl
who was in a lot of trouble.

367
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:45,256
She had no place to turn.

368
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:47,380
How doesn't someone lie
about murder?

369
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,221
Because she was raped too.

370
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:53,403
Dios Mio.

371
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,741
Why didn't Lake tell me this
when he called?

372
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,746
- When was that?
- Last night.

373
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:01,076
He wanted to talk to Cecelia,
but he didn't say why.

374
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:02,609
Where is she?

375
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:07,070
She works as a seamstress
for a designer downtown.

376
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:11,094
STREBOR CLOTHING DESIGNS 
144 WEST 28TH STREET
THURSDAY, MARCH 20

377
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:13,899
What the hell's going on here,
three cops in two days?

378
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:16,685
So I was annoyed 
when Cecelia said she had to leave,

379
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:18,978
but then the cop explained
it was about a rape.

380
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,018
Is this the guy?

381
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,035
Yeah, he was in pretty bad shape too.

382
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:25,492
Started bleeding on the floor.

383
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:28,196
Cecelia had to help him out,
said she was taking him to a hospital.

384
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:29,241
How long ago?

385
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,776
1:00 am ... like I said,
we're on a deadline.

386
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,662
Guy's bleeding out,
she doesn’t call the cops.

387
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:36,378
What is Lake doing
involving a civilian?

388
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:38,128
City-wide alert out.

389
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:40,712
She's now his hostage.

390
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,089
We notified ESU that Lake
could have a civilian with him.

391
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,041
It's hard to believe
he'd be so reckless.

392
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,758
- Any leads on his whereabouts?
- The tip lines are going crazy.

393
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:51,790
He could be long gone
or anywhere in the city.

394
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,987
Not if he's bleeding out.
What about hospitals or walk-in clinics?

395
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:57,676
No one matching Lake's description
has been admitted or treated.

396
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:01,353
News reports are saying Lake
took a hostage. Who gave them that?

397
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:04,614
How about your partner after he took 
Cecelia Cruz with a warrant on his ass?

398
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:07,235
And with Kralik dead,
it just doesn't make sense.

399
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:08,656
Lake had to have a good reason.

400
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:10,192
For putting a witness in harm's way?

401
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,867
I'm open to suggestions.

402
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,716
How about a third shooter?

403
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,432
31 shots were fired in that lot.

404
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:19,141
Same brand of ammunition,
all NYPD issue.

405
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,060
10 came from Lake's gun

406
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,489
and Kralik emptied
his 15-round clip.

407
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,441
Remaining six bullets
came from an unknown source.

408
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,258
Lake fires seven bullets
into Kralik's direction.

409
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:31,932
Three shots standing

410
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:34,177
and four shots crouching.

411
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:37,537
Five direct hits.
The other two were found in a wall.

412
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,499
The first two hits spun him,

413
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:40,905
and based on his wound tracks,

414
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:42,284
Kralik was already falling to the ground

415
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:44,328
when the last three bullets 
entered his body.

416
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:46,814
That proves Lake didn't shoot
him in the back.

417
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:51,170
Lake then rotates 30 degrees
and fires at what appears to be a void.

418
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,197
You find any shell casings
in the void area? / No.

419
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:56,106
The third guy policed his brass.

420
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:58,764
Did the bullets that hit Lake
match Kralik's gun?

421
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,174
The third shooter fired
six shots at Lake.

422
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:03,956
Two plugged him.
The other four were found at the scene.

423
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:05,791
- That gun in the system?
- Sorry.

424
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,845
If it's a cop, 
I'm thinking drop gun.

425
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:09,304
That'd be my guess.

426
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:12,584
Looks like Lake took
Cecelia Cruz to protect her.

427
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:16,588
Another dirty cop means
somebody close to Kralik 10 years ago.

428
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,667
He have a partner in Brooklyn?

429
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,530
Sean Lassiter.
Died on the line last year.

430
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,331
We should talk to Kralik's widow,
see who his friends are now.

431
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:27,283
Tread easy.
Everybody's already heated enough.

432
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:31,601
KRALIK RESIDENCE
68 REMSEN STREET
BROOKLYN, NEW YOTK
FRIDAY, MARCH 21

433
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:37,062
- What do you want?
- Let them in, Bill.

434
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,995
Mrs. Kralik, I'm Detective Stabler.
This is my partner, Detective Benson.

435
00:20:42,995 --> 00:20:44,558
Very sorry for your loss.

436
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:47,612
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

437
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:50,332
Elliot Stabler.

438
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:51,824
Bill Jensen.

439
00:20:51,824 --> 00:20:53,874
That's Tom Crane, Dave Foster.

440
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,598
Find that bastard Lake yet?

441
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:57,933
It's not their job to find him,
it's mine.

442
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,761
You're with the fugitive
apprehension team?

443
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,146
My unit usually brings them in
without incident, unless they fight.

444
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,170
I know he's a friend of yours.

445
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:08,227
- So I just want to make that clear.
- Guy's a hump.

446
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:12,472
Look, I want to find out
what happened that night, don't you?

447
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,007
No. Word is he busted his stitches.

448
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,038
We wait it out,
maybe he'll bleed to death.

449
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:18,227
Yeah, I told you that puts us behind...

450
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,133
- So what? Who...
- Stop it.

451
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:22,388
All of you.

452
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:25,649
That is not what I want.

453
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,519
I need to understand
why he killed my husband.

454
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,196
Why did he do it?

455
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:33,807
We're working on it.

456
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:39,371
Mrs. Kralik, was there somebody
that your husband was close to?

457
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,520
Are you looking at us?

458
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:48,032
- Why?
- Did you know him in Brooklyn?

459
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,627
What does that got to do with anything?

460
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:56,345
If you're looking for a way 
to justify murder, you can leave right now.

461
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,169
Get out.

462
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:11,251
That woman has no idea
who she was married to.

463
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:13,262
If this comes out,
it will kill her.

464
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:15,218
Cops seemed pretty riled.

465
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:17,239
- So let's check them out.
- And then what do we do?

466
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:20,760
Dig up some dirt but hope we find a gun
that matches the slugs from the vacant lot?

467
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,589
All Lake had to do was ID the shooter.

468
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:23,876
You can't be sure that he saw him.

469
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,430
It was dark out,
there were bullets flying.

470
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,183
- What is your problem?
- He didn't trust us.

471
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:30,140
And maybe for good reason.

472
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:32,848
Look, all the evidence pointed
to his guilty.

473
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:36,705
Which means that we should've
taken a hard look at Lake, not Fin.

474
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:40,180
Oh, so I shouldn't have dumped 
his phones?

475
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,760
Fin's a straight shooter, Elliot.

476
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,507
All you had to do was ask him.

477
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,882
I think you need to make this right.

478
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,349
Nothing on Jensen, Crane, and Foster.

479
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:55,883
They all three came from Brooklyn.
I'm waiting on their jackets.

480
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:58,161
- How long have they known Kralik?
- Jensen for Ten years.

481
00:22:58,161 --> 00:23:01,423
Crane and Foster worked his precinct.
They transferred out last year.

482
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,428
Well, maybe we should be looking
at the academy roles,

483
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:04,876
see who Kralik was close to.

484
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:07,773
That was the lab. They made 
a preliminary DNA match to Kralik.

485
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:10,014
They found his blood underneath
the victim's fingernails.

486
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,823
She fought back.
Maybe that's why he killed her.

487
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,667
Well, they found a second semen sample,

488
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:16,151
but it was only a partial profile.
It's too degraded.

489
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:17,290
The guy's gonna skate.

490
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,492
We can still get him on the attempted 
murder of a police officer.

491
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:22,035
That's a parole sentence, Munch.

492
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:24,631
Well it won't matter
unless we find out who he is.

493
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:27,721
ESU has Lake pinned
in an abandoned building.

494
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:37,047
Is the subject armed?
I repeat, is the subject armed?

495
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,087
Confirmed.
Suspect is armed.

496
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:40,727
Hold your position.

497
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:42,827
Manhattan SVU, Lieutenant.
How'd you find him?

498
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,181
BOLO on the female.

499
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:46,642
Cashier noticed when she bought
too many medical supplies.

500
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,649
The FAT pinpointed their location,

501
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,365
but with the hostage,
it's our OP now.

502
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:53,283
- Hey. Get your ass back here.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

503
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:54,701
That's Detective Lake's partner.

504
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,196
I don't give a damn
if it's his long lost brother...

505
00:23:56,196 --> 00:23:59,376
Want this take-down to go blood-free?
You let him work.

506
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:04,413
Let him go.

507
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,050
You'd shoot me in the back?

508
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,193
If I have to.

509
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:34,807
Wait.

510
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:37,560
What are you doing?

511
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,051
Take it easy. It's my partner.
He's not gonna use that gun.

512
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:44,176
Only cause I'm low on ammo.

513
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:47,072
Okay, hand it over and let's go.

514
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:50,172
Looking forward to the perp walk?

515
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:54,123
Somebody's gotta take credit.
Might as well be me.

516
00:24:57,418 --> 00:25:00,152
- Yeah, they're getting into position.
- And you know what's next.

517
00:25:00,152 --> 00:25:03,780
They're gonna throw in a few flash bangs
and we'll both be blind and deaf.

518
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,884
Whatever happened to 
hostage negotiation?

519
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,814
Listen, she brought you those bandages.

520
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:10,638
That makes her an accomplice
to the felony skip.

521
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,337
You see where I'm going?

522
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:20,514
You want to put bracelets on my wrists.

523
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:22,358
I'd rather do that
before someone gets hurt.

524
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:24,012
I'm already hurt.

525
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:31,547
I'm not going into custody
so I can be an easier target.

526
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,709
Lake, we followed your breadcrumbs.

527
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:37,608
We know Kralik is a rapist,
and we can prove it.

528
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:39,873
Did you see the hump that shot you?

529
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:42,379
Didn't get a good look.

530
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,677
I was just trying to fight for my life.

531
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:45,329
How'd you get lured?

532
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,959
I got a call from a guy named Bill Jensen.

533
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,373
He said he had some information.

534
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:58,001
Then when I showed up,
the son of a bitch just opened fire.

535
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:01,475
I don't know his name,
but I'll never forget his face.

536
00:26:04,054 --> 00:26:05,643
He raped me.

537
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,784
Are you ready to say that in court?

538
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:11,512
I'll tell whoever will listen.

539
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:19,081
Captain, Kralik's shadow 
during his academy days was Thomas Crane.

540
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,365
- Why him?
- Well, I pulled his jacket.

541
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:24,948
Excessive force, sexual abuse, 
intimidation complaints.

542
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:27,233
Why does this bastard
still have his tin?

543
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:29,445
Well, all his victims 
had sheets and recanted.

544
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:31,448
CCRB cleared him.

545
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:32,909
What's his present assignment?

546
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:35,040
The Fugitive Apprehension Team.

547
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,891
Son of a bitch.

548
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:50,337
Squeeze that trigger,

549
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,344
you'll be dead before the slug
leaves the pipe.

550
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,264
Alisa and I got caught
in the middle of a fight

551
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:12,138
on our way home from school.

552
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:15,318
That's when the police came
to break it up.

553
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:16,523
What happened next?

554
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:20,506
Two cops, told us they would
give us a ride home,

555
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,729
so we got into the back seat.

556
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,698
They took turns raping us.

557
00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:29,525
If felt like it went on forever.

558
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,526
What happened to Alisa Hernandez?

559
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:35,429
She fought back.
scratching and clawing.

560
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:40,177
He punched her, but...
she wouldn't stop screaming,

561
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:45,681
so he put his hands
around her throat and squeezed.

562
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:51,660
Is one of the men who lured you
and then brutally raped you in this room?

563
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,011
Yes.

564
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:57,330
- Thomas Crane.
- Why didn't they kill you too?

565
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,993
I begged for my life,
promised never to tell.

566
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:04,773
He was angry
that officer Kralik lost control.

567
00:28:04,773 --> 00:28:07,029
When they started fighting, 
I ran away.

568
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,241
Thank you.

569
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,408
Nothing further.

570
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,261
When did you become
a US citizen, Miss Cruz?

571
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:16,958
- Objection. Irrelevant.
- Witness veracity, Your Honor.

572
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:21,266
- Answer the question.
- You don't understand.

573
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,199
We didn't have the money
for amnesty then,

574
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,484
but I've been trying ever since.

575
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:26,569
In other words,
you're here illegally.

576
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:29,580
You went to school here,
you saw doctors here,

577
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,265
made money here,
but you paid no taxes here.

578
00:28:32,265 --> 00:28:34,734
Is there a question, or is counsel
just going to pontificate?

579
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:37,929
Is the DA's office
helping you with immigration
in exchange for your testimony?

580
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:38,867
Objection.

581
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,785
Withdrawn.
Nothing further.

582
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,294
The jury's looking at my witness
like she did something wrong.

583
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:53,020
People feel strongly
about immigration on both sides.

584
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,582
That's why your forensic testimony
needs to be solid.

585
00:28:57,228 --> 00:29:00,196
Is this partial profile enough
to say he's a match?

586
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,671
Yes, but it leaves you
wide open on rebuttal.

587
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:05,036
Okay, why?

588
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:08,696
All human cells except 
platelets have 13 loci.

589
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:11,396
The semen the lab tested
presented only nine,

590
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:14,071
which means it was 
significantly degraded.

591
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,418
I'll need probabilities
as to the DNA match for Crane.

592
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:21,984
I can't give them with what we have.

593
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:24,259
Okay, without it, he walks.

594
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:26,621
Thomas Crane raped 
and murdered a young girl,

595
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:28,963
and we gave him the badge
to hide behind while he did it.

596
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:30,790
I know what you want me to say,

597
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,091
but the science doesn't support it.

598
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,310
When the defense gets these lab reports,

599
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,243
they might have enough
for reasonable doubt.

600
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,990
- Can you live with that?
- If I have to.

601
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,035
Because I sure as hell
won't risk my reputation

602
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,268
for a verdict we didn't earn.

603
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:54,822
TRIAL PART 46
THURSDAY, MAY 8

604
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:57,753
We found blood and skin
under the victim's nails.

605
00:29:57,753 --> 00:30:01,504
As you can see from the overlay,
13 loci match.

606
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:05,090
Is there any doubt the DNA belongs
to Detective Edward Kralik?

607
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,393
None.

608
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:08,761
The second sample found was semen.

609
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:11,075
The lab took a buccal swab
from Thomas Crane

610
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:14,654
and compared it with swabs
from the victim Alisa Hernandez.

611
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:17,712
Here, nine loci match.

612
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:22,291
although it's a partial profile,
in my opinion, it belongs to the defendant.

613
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,697
Thank you, doctor.
Nothing further.

614
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:27,451
I have no questions.

615
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:39,039
I interviewed Detective Kralik
about his presence at the crime scene.

616
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,389
He said he couldn't remember,
and then he got hostile.

617
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:44,577
Didn't you have a very loud
and public brawl with the deceased?

618
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:48,579
He threw a punch after I collected
the cigarette butt he tossed.

619
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:49,750
Why did you do that?

620
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,185
Well, I thought he was guilty 
of rape and murder.

621
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:54,900
I wanted to compare
his DNA to the evidence.

622
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,292
So what happened next?

623
00:30:56,292 --> 00:31:00,384
Well, I called in to get the rape kit
pulled from storage and sent to the lab,

624
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:05,134
but I got lured and then ambushed by 
two shooters before I could have it done.

625
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:06,637
How were you lured?

626
00:31:06,637 --> 00:31:08,294
Well, I got a call from a cop

627
00:31:08,294 --> 00:31:11,513
saying he had information
about the Hernandez murder.

628
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:12,943
He called himself Jensen,

629
00:31:12,943 --> 00:31:17,188
But I IDed the caller as Thomas Crane
in a voice print line-up.

630
00:31:17,188 --> 00:31:21,945
And you're sure that the second shooter
was the defendant, Thomas Crane?

631
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:23,895
Positive.

632
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:25,945
Nothing further.

633
00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:27,591
Two shooters.

634
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:29,626
You must be a hard man to kill.

635
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:30,740
Well, I was lucky.

636
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,681
Did you find the gun matching the bullets
at the crime scene in my client's possession?

637
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:38,252
It's easy to toss a gun in the city.

638
00:31:38,252 --> 00:31:39,460
Yes or no.

639
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,943
Not yet, no.

640
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,939
You call the lab to move the evidence.

641
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,917
What were you told by the desk officer?

642
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,860
That I needed a boss to request it.

643
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,599
Was that all you were told?

644
00:32:00,274 --> 00:32:01,388
I don't recall.

645
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:05,739
You weren't told that the evidence was 
too degraded and contaminated for testing?

646
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:11,173
No. / Objection. Your Honor, I call
for an immediate mistrial.

647
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:13,005
There's a serious cover-up
going on here,

648
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:15,474
and I have proof
that this witness perjured himself,

649
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:17,614
and the prosecution violated Brady.

650
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:19,748
Your Honor, that's ridiculous.
no one lied.

651
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:23,209
Counsel is accusing my office of conspiracy 
in front of the jury just to score points.

652
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:26,334
Enough!
In my chambers now.

653
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:29,969
DNA is the rock on which
the people built their case.

654
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:31,564
They don't have a credible witness.

655
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:35,221
Cecelia Cruz's immigrant status has 
nothing to do with her eyewitness testimony.

656
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:38,146
And yet they've placed
more emphasis on biological evidence,

657
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:40,167
which I discovered was compromised.

658
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,563
Is that true, Miss Novak?

659
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:44,195
No, the evidence was tested
by lab protocol.

660
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,267
Then where are the reports?
Because I don't have them.

661
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:47,725
Incomplete.
They're not finished.

662
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:49,499
And the dog ate my homework.

663
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:53,148
I will turn everything over
as soon as it is done.

664
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:54,779
See that you do.

665
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,706
- And the conspiracy?
- Detective Lake perjured himself.

666
00:32:57,706 --> 00:32:59,777
He was told that the sample
was too degraded for testing

667
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,075
- by the evidence intake officer.
- Who's not a DNA expert.

668
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:05,783
If it's so degraded,
how did we find two separate profiles?

669
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,151
I think you want to win so badly you'd 
plant the evidence and frame my client.

670
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:11,867
Oh, the OJ defense.
That's original. Good for you.

671
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,524
Knock it off.

672
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,010
I grant the missing lab reports
are suspicious,

673
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,083
but you can't accuse sworn officers 
without hard evidence.

674
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:21,840
The prosecution tried to sandbag
the defense, Your Honor.

675
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,271
And you'll have those reports
by close of business today...

676
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:27,582
Or Miss Novak will be in contempt.

677
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:32,904
- Anything else?
- Yes.

678
00:33:33,131 --> 00:33:35,329
Just to show that I play by the rules,

679
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:39,316
I'm issuing a subpoena for Penelope Fielding
as a witness for the defense.

680
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,198
TRIAL PART 46
FRIDAY, MAY 9

681
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:50,062
Ms. Fielding, can you list
your credentials for the jury?

682
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:54,260
I hold a masters in population genetics 
and statistics.

683
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,715
I ran a state crime lab,
and I work with law enforcement.

684
00:33:57,715 --> 00:34:00,835
When you ran the lab,
which departments reported to you?

685
00:34:01,121 --> 00:34:05,723
Fingerprints, ballistics,
blood spatter, trace and DNA.

686
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,016
What's your opinion
on partial DNA profiles?

687
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:12,309
They can be an invaluable
investigative tool.

688
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:14,910
Really?

689
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,652
A suspect list can be narrowed
of even cleared using partial profiles.

690
00:34:19,652 --> 00:34:24,103
"A partial profile is outside
all scientific standards

691
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,580
and should be viewed
skeptically if at all."

692
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,523
Who wrote that, 
Ms. Fielding?

693
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:35,617
I did.

694
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:38,757
An article published
in a journal of applied sciences

695
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:41,793
criticizing multiplex PCR
and, I quote,

696
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:45,020
"The disturbing trend
of using partial profiles

697
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,361
in the criminal justice system."

698
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,211
In your expert opinion,
Ms. Fielding,

699
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:56,158
does the DNA found on Alisa Hernandez
match my client, Thomas Crane?

700
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,718
- I can't answer that.
- Why not?

701
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:09,163
The sample is the equivalent
of less than a single human cell.

702
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:14,963
So I can't say with any certainty
that it matches the defendant.

703
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:16,809
Nothing further.

704
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:26,762
- Have you reached a verdict?
- No, Your Honor. We're deadlocked.

705
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,911
Your Honor, can we poll the jury?

706
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:36,023
Madam foreman, how do you find?

707
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:37,495
Guilty.

708
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:39,824
Not guilty.

709
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:42,157
Not guilty.

710
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:44,497
Guilty.

711
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:46,526
Not guilty.

712
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:48,620
Not guilty.

713
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:51,179
Not guilty.

714
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:53,727
Not guilty.

715
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:56,443
Guilty.

716
00:35:57,951 --> 00:35:59,446
Not guilty.

717
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,229
Not guilty.

718
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:05,416
- No, Hector.
- Let go of her.

719
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:06,547
Hey, what's going on here?

720
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:08,776
US immigration enforcement, ma'am.
Please step back.

721
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:10,778
- Where are you going with my witness?
- I can't tell you that.

722
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:13,212
You'll have to take it up
with a federal judge in dispensation.

723
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,911
I'm sorry I never told you
about Alisa, Mr. Hernandez.

724
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:18,490
Please believe me.
I'm sorry.

725
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,368
Where are you taking me?

726
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:29,414
Don't do anything stupid, Hector.

727
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,908
We can't win, can we?

728
00:36:37,908 --> 00:36:41,701
No, I promise I will re-file the charges
and I will try him again.

729
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,161
Hey, Fin, we're heading out for a drink.
You wanna join us?

730
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:54,416
No, somebody needs to check on Lake,
he's not answering his phone.

731
00:36:57,076 --> 00:37:03,495
Look, the situation got a little heated
and I want to say I'm sorry about that.

732
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,543
You're a bulldog, Stabler.

733
00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:08,784
Quick to assume,
slow to admit when you're wrong.

734
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:12,534
Makes for a good cop,
but a lousy human being...

735
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,142
- Fin, hear him out.
- Stay out of it, Liv.

736
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:18,259
That being said,
I know what it cost you.

737
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:23,108
- Appreciate that.
- I'm not done.

738
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:28,045
The problem is you will still be
the same rat bastard tomorrow,

739
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,773
and nothing you say
will ever change that.

740
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:50,483
What's that?

741
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:53,119
Fin's transfer request.

742
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:58,730
CHAMBERS OF
JUDGE ELIZABETH DONNELLY
FRIDAY, MAY 9

743
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,734
You wanted to see me,
judge Donnelly?

744
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:03,395
Yes, the, um...

745
00:38:03,893 --> 00:38:07,776
The DA is declining to re-file charges
against Thomas Crane.

746
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:14,155
He raped and murdered Alisa Hernandez
and he gets to keep his badge?

747
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:16,697
Because of your actions, counselor.

748
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,238
With all due respect, ma'am,
this doesn't concern you.

749
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:22,743
It does now.

750
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:36,976
I'm being called before the bar.

751
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:39,645
At my insistence.

752
00:38:41,594 --> 00:38:43,015
Why?

753
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:46,497
Because you lost perspective.

754
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:49,996
And because I sit
on the peer review board,

755
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:52,009
and I cannot allow you
to commit a Brady violation

756
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:53,801
and lie to the court
without consequence.

757
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:56,668
The reports weren't finished, Your Honor.
I sent them back.

758
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,186
You lied to Petrovsky,
and now you are lying to me.

759
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:02,095
The lab reports
were dated and stamped.

760
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:08,342
We are civil servants, Casey.

761
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,113
No one is falling
on their sword for you.

762
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:21,251
What I want to know... is why.

763
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,162
Because the bad guys can't always win.

764
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,428
And he deserved to pay.

765
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:41,883
And so do you.

766
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:53,114
How much trouble am I in?

767
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,778
Censure.

768
00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:59,531
Possible suspension.

769
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:03,602
For how long?

770
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,386
A year.

771
00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:10,139
Maybe more.

772
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,995
What should I do?

773
00:40:19,995 --> 00:40:21,845
Something else.

774
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:37,662
I have to go.
