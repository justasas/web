1
00:00:00,423 --> 00:00:05,757
In the criminal justice system, all defendants
are innocent until proven guilty

2
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:10,141
either by confession,
plea bargain, or trial by jury.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,465
This is one of those trials.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,675
She said she was staying
with her friend Jennifer.

5
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:19,158
Out near us at Woodhaven.

6
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:24,704
When the police called,
they said they found a body.

7
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:28,720
I thought, "That can't be our daughter."

8
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:32,764
We knew she was seeing Justin,
but we liked him.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,539
I can't imagine how this could happen.

10
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:39,427
- I thought Kristen went home.
- Home?

11
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:43,305
Somebody put two bullets in her head
100 yards from your front door, Justin.

12
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:45,566
That's your girlfriend.
You don't seem too upset.

13
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:47,137
I'm upset!

14
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:50,773
- I'm totally freaked out!
- Let's talk about your buddy Carter.

15
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:54,157
Carter, you knew Kristen Ames,
Justin's girlfriend?

16
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:57,788
- I mean, I saw her, yeah.
- You saying you never talked to her?

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,676
Like last night before she was killed?

18
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:05,255
Yeah, actually, uh...
You know, I saw her with her ex.

19
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:07,814
Her ex-boyfriend, Danny Wallace.

20
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:12,105
So, Danny, you dated Kristen.
You got dumped.

21
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:15,901
She starts banging your friend Justin.
Gotta be hard to take.

22
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:19,285
- That's not how it was.
- What time did you leave last night?

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,834
I don't remember.

24
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:25,978
She was arguing with Danny, not me.

25
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,269
- About what?
- I don't know, they were outside.

26
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:33,158
And then Justin went out,
you know, to make sure she was okay.

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,634
Next thing I heard,
a gun capped two times.

28
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:38,357
- Danny shot her?
- That's what Justin said.

29
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:41,411
- Carter told us you did it.
- He's lying.

30
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,124
Kristen told me
Justin and Carter raped her.

31
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,857
I was passed out.

32
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,755
She wanted to go to the cops,

33
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:53,039
Justin followed her, chased her into
Tompkins Square Park.

34
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:54,887
He shot her.

35
00:01:55,746 --> 00:02:00,433
- Justin shot her?
- There was nothing I could do, I swear.

36
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,990
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet, Justin.

37
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,234
But I'd get comfortable.

38
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,440
I wanna call my father.
I want a lawyer.

39
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:15,619
Justin lawyered up,

40
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,392
and we have conflicting
statements from the other two.

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,759
Danny says he saw it go down.
You buy that?

42
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:24,421
Well, I might have...

43
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,402
Until he took off his jacket.

44
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:29,637
Nitrate. Gunshot residue?

45
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:32,014
I'm gonna log it into evidence.
Test for GSR.

46
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:35,711
All right, I'll get a statement from Danny
and try to get one from Carter.

47
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:38,682
And you can charge 'em all
with second degree murder.

48
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,267
You know...

49
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:42,511
I almost believed the kid.

50
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:45,584
Everybody lies.

54
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,312
Her blood alcohol was four times the limit.

55
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:42,521
We know Carter and Justin had sex with her,
probably while she was passed out.

56
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,254
Apparently, Danny didn't.

57
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,885
It looks like when she realized she'd been raped,
she threatened to go to the police.

58
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,444
Danny claims he offered to take her.

59
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,365
He says Justin followed them,

60
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:55,011
pulled her intoTompkins Square Park,
and killed her.

61
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:57,533
What are you gonna show the Grand Jury?

62
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:00,221
Well, the gun's probably in the Hudson.

63
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,519
Carter's prints are on shell casings
found at the scene.

64
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:06,400
And there's nitrates on Danny's jacket,

65
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,921
maybe used to muffle gun shots.

66
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,553
Well, that gets you Danny and Carter,
but what about this third kid?

67
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:13,272
Well, Justin's our weakest case.

68
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,433
He lawyered up, and we don't
have a statement from him.

69
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,818
We can't even prove rape.

70
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,894
Justin was dating the victim.
The sex could have been consensual.

71
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:21,278
Doesn't sound like much.

72
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,828
Turn one of the other two against Justin.

73
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,989
Well, Danny's the testimony we need.

74
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,759
He claims he saw the murder
go down, but wasn't part of it.

75
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:30,976
But Carter's statement
points the finger at Danny.

76
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:33,525
The poor girl.

77
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:36,379
The thought of losing
a daughter like that.

78
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,258
Try to make a deal,
but everybody does real time.

79
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:41,976
Two out of three won't do.

80
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,700
Danny, I'm Dean Conners.

81
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:50,585
The court assigned me to your case.

82
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:53,578
- I spoke to your mother.
- That was my grandma.

83
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:56,909
- My mom's not around.
- Well, then your grandmother.

84
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,323
She's coming to the arraignment.

85
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:01,066
I'll  try to arrange a chance for you to speak.

86
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:03,060
She doesn't need this kind of grief.

87
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,106
I was just thinking if we needed
to raise money for bail.

88
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:10,791
I'm not gonna take her money.
She gets some Social Security.

89
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,972
Um, so you spoke to the police.

90
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,272
I told them the truth.

91
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,982
Kristen said that Justin and Carter had raped her,
so I was taking her to the cops.

92
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:25,864
Justin followed us and shot her.

93
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,405
When that happened, what did you do?

94
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:31,483
I took off like a coward.

95
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:39,911
Do you know if they collected any evidence
that could implicate you in the shooting?

96
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,684
I don't know, they took my jacket.

97
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:43,763
Why did they do that?

98
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:45,618
Look,

99
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:48,972
I didn't kill Kristen, I swear.

100
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,240
Danny, look...

101
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,513
I'm not here to judge you.

102
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,229
Or to judge what you've done.

103
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:59,389
I'm here to advocate for you.

104
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:00,941
Yeah.

105
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,492
You don't believe me.

106
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:04,570
- Danny.
- No, you don't. No.

107
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,175
Neither did the cops.

108
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:09,973
Everyone thinks I'm guilty.

109
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,880
I believe you.

110
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:15,902
Okay?

111
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,000
Docket number 3304.

112
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:23,993
People v. Justin Birch.
Charge is murder in the second degree.

113
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,737
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

114
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:29,313
Your Honor, this defendant
has the resources and means to flee.

115
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,419
Given the charge, the people ask for remand.

116
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:34,466
We ask for ROR to his parents pending trial.

117
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,378
Counsel, approach.

118
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:42,474
What can we live with here?

119
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:46,657
Your Honor, I have to seriously question
the legitimacy of the charges.

120
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,069
They have no evidence.

121
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,064
The defense'll get their
discovery when it's time.

122
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,612
Okay, you don't want to show your hand,
fine, counselor, but you'll have to bend.

123
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,633
The victim's parents are here, Your Honor,

124
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,795
expecting to see him held
for their daughter's murder.

125
00:06:57,823 --> 00:07:00,483
So  I'll set the bail at 800,000,
and you'll argue it.

126
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,480
And we'll accept it.

127
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,891
From what I understand,
this kid's parents can just write a check.

128
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:06,995
Look, I said I'll make you look good.
Both of you, step back.

129
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,310
Bail is set at 800,000.

130
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:16,661
On bond, the defendant will be held
under house arrest with an ankle bracelet.

131
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:17,603
Next.

132
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:24,421
I'll have my office draw up the paperwork.
And Justin should be out of here by lunch.

133
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,335
Docket number 33005.

134
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:37,412
People v. Daniel Wallace.
Charge is murder in the second degree.

135
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:38,717
Do we have a plea?

136
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,519
Not guilty, Your Honor.

137
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:44,563
The people would prefer remand, but we'll agree
to the previous bail recommendation.

138
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,143
$800,000?

139
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:50,023
Your Honor, the people know
my client is without means.

140
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,737
Will the court at least accept a surety of ten percent?

141
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,456
Not on a murder charge.

142
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,808
So the poor sit in jail
while the rich walk free?

143
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:00,385
So it goes, Mr. Conners.

144
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:05,065
Docket number 33006.

145
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:08,916
People v. Carter McSherry.
Charge of murder in the second degree.

146
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:14,017
The night we first met Danny...

147
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,338
Kristen missed her curfew.

148
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,525
Danny brought her home.
They were both drunk.

149
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,631
And George and I stepped in.

150
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:24,017
I called his parents.

151
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:28,563
Well, his grandmother.
His parents aren't even in the picture.

152
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,494
How do you expect a kid like that
to be raised right?

153
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,155
To have good values?

154
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,233
I was worried that Kristen was seeing him.

155
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,444
And now you telling me you're gonna offer
this little son of a bitch a deal?

156
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,014
Well, Danny will serve time.

157
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,365
We're offering him 15 to 25 years
for his testimony against Justin.

158
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,970
All three are responsible
for what happened to Kristen.

159
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,162
15 years?

160
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,405
Not 15 years for our daughter's life.

161
00:08:57,461 --> 00:09:00,315
Mr. Ames, you blame Danny
and I understand that.

162
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,254
But Justin Birch killed her.

163
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,942
A plea from Danny will help us get him.

164
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:07,214
Kristen didn't get any kind of deal.

165
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:17,340
That went well.

166
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,152
Well, what plea agreement
ever made everybody happy?

167
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:22,037
- I'm just saying that...
- Kelly,

168
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:24,254
we didn't come here for their permission.

169
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,107
A little more reassurance
might have helped, you know?

170
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:30,100
Some guarantee that he'll be punished.

171
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,759
It would have been a lie.

172
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:36,223
Well, you brought us down here
for a sneak peek at discovery,

173
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,384
or do I smell a plea bargain?

174
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:42,430
Your  client's conviction is right here.

175
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:45,117
What's the offer?

176
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:49,660
For testimony against Justin,
15 to 25, concurrent on all counts.

177
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:54,482
Tracey, the problem is,
our guys aren't equally guilty here.

178
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,532
He's right, my guy didn't even
leave the apartment.

179
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,302
Peter, I'll be honest.
I know you wanna clear your case.

180
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,741
But Danny's the witness.
He's the one I wanna flip.

181
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,182
So, you're wasting my time.

182
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,399
No, you're plan B.

183
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,200
Danny won't cop to rape.

184
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,053
He didn't witness it,
he only saw the shooting.

185
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,159
Kibre, you need my guy.

186
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,431
Carter gave Justin the gun.

187
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,786
He can give you the rape
and the conspiracy.

188
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:18,782
Danny can't do that.

189
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,376
All right, that'll get Carter a plea.

190
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,034
But I still want Danny.

191
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:29,863
I'll talk to him.

192
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:34,103
They found gunshot residue on your jacket.

193
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:36,431
If we go to trial,
they very well could convict you.

194
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,175
I wasn't wearing my jacket.

195
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:42,637
- Justin's gonna walk?
- He's in a position to do that.

196
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:47,236
He's got all this money,
fancy lawyers. I got what?

197
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:51,364
It's unfair, I agree.

198
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:54,884
But Justin's money won't matter
if you cooperate.

199
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:58,319
Carter's getting the same deal.
Well, Carter raped her.

200
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:02,031
- Justin shot her. All I did...
- Danny, they got evidence against you.

201
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,693
It's a good offer.

202
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,214
So I'm supposed to say
I'm guilty of something I didn't do.

203
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,545
Well, that's your decision.

204
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,314
But I recommend you take the deal.

205
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,153
We left Justin's place.

206
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,721
I put my jacket on her shoulders
'cause it was pretty cold.

207
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:28,298
Justin followed us.

208
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:33,202
He was pretty drunk. He kept threatening her
about if she went to the cops.

209
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,641
Kristen stood up to him, you know?

210
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:37,912
She pissed him off.

211
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,071
- What did Justin do?
- He hit her in the face.

212
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:45,088
He pulled a gun.
I was so scared I... I couldn't move.

213
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,446
Where were you all standing?

214
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:48,883
At the entrance over there.

215
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,181
How did you wind up in here?

216
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:56,392
Well, she, uh, ran.

217
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:58,970
And, uh, he chased her,

218
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:01,629
and he grabbed her arm.

219
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,339
I mean, it happened so fast.
He was cursing at her.

220
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:09,692
And she's crying, trying to get away.

221
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:13,072
And then he just started shooting her.

222
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,150
Did he aim the gun at you?

223
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,148
No.

224
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:17,976
Well, Danny...

225
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:22,049
You could have shouted for help.
You could have made a run for the police.

226
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,655
I  should have.

227
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:29,060
I wanted to, but I froze.

228
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,273
And then she was gone.

229
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,407
And there was nothing
that I could really do.

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,997
Are we done now?

231
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:45,764
Sure, Danny, we're done.

232
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:00,366
So you bright Carter and Danny.

233
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:03,858
I knew you'd flip one...
But, uh, are we in trouble?

234
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:06,463
Just makes it a
stronger case against Justin.

235
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,068
Oh, please, they can't even
get their stories straight.

236
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:12,144
Danny says that Justin did the girl.
Carter says that Danny did it.

237
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:13,307
Then why worry?

238
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:16,355
You know, you're wasting
your time in the DA's office.

239
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:17,464
I'd triple what you make.

240
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:20,012
You don't want me, Norman.
I have scruples.

241
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,425
They have pills for that.

242
00:13:23,713 --> 00:13:26,345
We got two pleas, why not three?

243
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:29,255
What's the problem, Norman?
My client is innocent.

244
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,528
Well, you can tell that to a jury.

245
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,634
Selection begins three weeks from tomorrow.

246
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:35,915
Now, Tracey, what about
this motion in limine?

247
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:39,130
The sexual history of Kristen Ames
is important to our defense.

248
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:42,094
It's irrelevant, Your Honor.
His client is facing murder charges.

249
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:45,669
There's a count of aggravated rape which is
an issue at the heart of the people's case.

250
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:49,686
- It's an excuse to sling mud.
- The victim was known to be promiscuous.

251
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:54,756
She had sex with my client and
with Carter McSherry that night by choice.

252
00:13:55,337 --> 00:14:00,270
The victim's questionable virtue goes directly
to Danny Wallace's state of mind.

253
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,182
She had sex with two men.

254
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:05,063
Danny Wallace killed her out of jealousy.

255
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:06,670
I read the briefs.

256
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:08,721
You're reaching, counselor.

257
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:11,049
Anything else?

258
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,929
All right, see you at trial.

259
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:18,945
Kristen was passed out.
But she woke up while we were doing it.

260
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,356
When she woke up, what was Justin doing?

261
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:24,458
- Holding her down, I guess.
- Don't guess, Carter.

262
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:26,260
Did he hold her by the arms?

263
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:28,087
Details are important here.

264
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,358
- Okay, he held her by the arms.
- Don't make things up.

265
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:32,743
What do you want me to say?

266
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:36,317
Justin said I could bang his girlfriend.
What's the big deal?

267
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:40,418
You wanna help your client out
with the basics of a declarative sentence?

268
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:41,747
It's your prep, Kibre.

269
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:44,214
You wanted this deal.
You help make it work.

270
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:47,150
The defense will use your original
statement from the police.

271
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:49,838
The fact that you lied about
giving Justin your gun.

272
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:51,750
They'll say you were lying then.
You could be lying now.

273
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,275
Well, I ain't lying now.

274
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,654
You know what?
I'm done for the day. I got a headache.

275
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,012
Today's it, Carter.

276
00:14:58,567 --> 00:14:59,204
Carter.

277
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,226
Bitch, I said I'm done!

278
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:06,268
You're done when I say you're done!
Now sit your ass down and answer the questions!

279
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:17,764
Kristen and Danny took off.

280
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,868
You know, Justin said for me
to give him my gun.

281
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:23,973
I asked him, "Why?" You know?

282
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:27,271
He said that he wasn't gonna
let Kristen go to the cops.

283
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,684
So  he was just gonna shut her up.

284
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,286
- Shut her up about the rape.
- Yeah.

285
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:36,053
So Justin took the gun...

286
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:38,630
...and followed Kristen and Danny out.

287
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:40,347
Then what?

288
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,306
What did you see or hear?

289
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:50,377
Oh, yeah, gunshots.

290
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:54,672
Later, Justin came back and gave me the gun.
He said he capped the bitch.

291
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:58,192
Well, his words.

292
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:03,927
- Did you get rid of the murder weapon?
- I threw it off the Williamsburg bridge.

293
00:16:05,783 --> 00:16:06,808
Nothing further.

294
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:10,355
Fascinating, Mr. McSherry.

295
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,897
Let's talk a little about why you're here.

296
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:19,221
The deal you made with the DA.

297
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,765
Life in prison without parole to... what?

298
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:26,425
15 to 25.

299
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:27,534
Good deal.

300
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:32,105
Now, did you discuss with the prosecutor
what you were gonna say here?

301
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,764
Did you get your story straight?

302
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,815
- Objection.
- Sustained.

303
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:41,220
Now, you've had some past
trouble with the law, correct?

304
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:44,767
Two assault convictions as a juvenile.

305
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:46,512
One attempted rape.

306
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:51,388
You served two years
in a juvenile facility, correct?

307
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:52,746
Basically, yeah.

308
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,790
An experienced criminal knows
the truth gets you nowhere.

309
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,675
Am I right?

310
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:03,414
You give the police one version. The DA another.
Whatever they want to hear.

311
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,404
- And you get a better deal.
- Objection. Is there a question here?

312
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,425
Sustained. Mr. Rothenberg?

313
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:14,746
Justin Birch didn't really kill Kristen Ames.

314
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:15,938
Did he?

315
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,607
Danny stole my gun earlier that night.

316
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:29,624
He was mad at Kristen because
she had sex with me and Justin.

317
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:33,393
I  wasn't there,
but Justin said Danny shot her.

318
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:35,332
Nothing he could do about it.

319
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:37,854
Chambers, Your Honor?

320
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:39,239
Let's go.

321
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,649
And can Mr. Voight join us as well?

322
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:49,549
You want to explain that back flip?

323
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,517
He was thoroughly prepped, Your Honor.

324
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,540
Maybe Mr. Voight should answer that.

325
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,450
Was there any inappropriate
contact between you two?

326
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:57,691
Absolutely not.

327
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:01,460
Mr. Voight was debriefed
as part of our discovery.

328
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,677
We had dinner and discussed the case.

329
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:07,415
- We even split the check.
- Interesting. Where'd you go?

330
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:08,912
Le Bernardin.

331
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,877
Debriefed over a $300 meal?

332
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:13,568
Sounds like a job audition.

333
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,757
You're a self-righteous bitch, you know that?

334
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:18,167
Can I quote that to the Ethics Board?

335
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:21,105
Hey, you can both cool off in a cell
unless you shut the hell up.

336
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:24,346
Your Honor, we'd like to redirect
Carter McSherry as a hostile witness.

337
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:26,895
And examine why
he changed his testimony.

338
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:29,111
That could step on
attorney-client privilege, judge.

339
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:30,996
Yeah, expose your duplicitous counsel.

340
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:35,539
Your Honor, these accusations are without merit.
The witness caved on the stand.

341
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,422
There was nothing improper.

342
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:41,829
I'll let you redirect on
the witnesses' credibility only.

343
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:43,214
I'm keeping the reins tight.

344
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:48,035
We'll adjourn for the week
and then resume Monday at 10:00.

345
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,660
Danny, our offer still stands.

346
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:55,766
You're it, now.

347
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,591
Uh, yeah, okay. I'm up for it.

348
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:04,501
Listen, they're gonna go after you
for taking this deal.

349
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:08,676
They'll say you were angry with Kristen
because she slept with Justin and Carter.

350
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:10,533
- And that you killed her.
- That's a lie.

351
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,251
But they're gonna be tough on you, okay?

352
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,767
So you just have to remember that you're
doing the right thing. You're helping yourself.

353
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:18,790
I'm doing it for Kristen.

354
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,805
Ms. Kibre, can I ask a favor?

355
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,800
Sure.

356
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:32,921
There was something that I was
hoping that I could do.

357
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:41,343
Mr. and Mrs. Ames are here at your request.

358
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:44,891
They're not under any obligation
to say anything to you.

359
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:50,432
- I think what Danny wanted to...
- No, no, I got it. Please, I gotta do this.

360
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:51,291
Please.

361
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,690
I want you to know how sorry I am.

362
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:00,932
Sorry?

363
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:05,643
Do you realize what you took from us?

364
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:07,888
Do you?

365
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:10,909
Say what you gotta say
and get it over with.

366
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,215
When you wouldn't let Kristen date me,

367
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,851
I got Justin to...

368
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,452
pick her up and bring her out
so that we could see each other.

369
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,750
Because I knew that you would accept him and...

370
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,939
... think that he was good enough.

371
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:35,400
I never thought Kristen would too.

372
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:39,911
He didn't love her.

373
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:41,795
I did.

374
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:51,394
And I feel like what happened
was my fault for not protecting her.

375
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:54,061
For not stopping 'em.

376
00:20:57,526 --> 00:21:00,193
I know you hate me,
but you gotta know how sorry I am.

377
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,290
Everyone that hurt Kristen
should be punished.

378
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:12,656
I want you to know
I'm not taking Ms. Kibre's deal.

379
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,700
- Hold on a second.
- I'm gonna testify against Justin.

380
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:20,372
But if I'm getting some deal, nobody's
gonna believe that I'm telling the truth.

381
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:21,992
Danny, we.. Dan, we need to talk about this.

382
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:22,685
No.

383
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:26,981
All three of us,
whatever we get we deserve it.

384
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:43,284
You know, in the best of all worlds
a defendant accepts some responsibilities.

385
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:44,462
It's kind of refreshing.

386
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:48,272
He does it because he's guilty
or because he feels guilty?

387
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,836
You mean, suppose he's a good kid?

388
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,252
Suppose he is.

389
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,885
Kind of bothers you, huh?
Not knowing.

390
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:55,959
Yeah.

391
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,098
Well, let me tell you something.

392
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,493
In this job, never give anybody
the benefit of the doubt.

393
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,477
So Danny helps us convict Justin,

394
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:08,907
and to repay the favor we lock him away
for the rest of his life?

395
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:13,463
Any leniency you show is gonna look like
an exchange for a favor.

396
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,684
Now, Rothenberg will cry foul
all the way to the bar.

397
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:18,313
Wouldn't that be ironic?

398
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:21,534
Bottom line is, you don't know
what happened that night.

399
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:24,254
There's no evidence
to exonerate Danny, right?

400
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:25,744
Just the opposite.

401
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,139
Well, then, thank God for the law.
Just do what it says.

402
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:32,949
We came with the delusion
that you had a worthwhile offer.

403
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:35,851
- It's better than a conviction.
- You've convicted him?

404
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,380
We're certainly confident today.

405
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,178
He does 15 to 25 and we'll recommend
that he serve his time downstate.

406
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:46,538
- So mom and dad can visit.
- No way I'm doing 15 year...

407
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:49,829
What happened to that girl was awful.

408
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:54,039
For the sake of tragedy,
I'll accept negligent homicide.

409
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:57,087
- Right. A class E felony.
- Probation.

410
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:00,439
Substance abuse counseling.
No time served.

411
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:02,760
No jury's gonna find your client innocent.

412
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:05,635
You can't prove the rape.
It means you don't have a motive.

413
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:09,230
No motive, your evidence means nothing.

414
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:11,932
Danny Wallace is gonna testify against him.

415
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,140
He took a plea.
No one will believe a word he says.

416
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:17,275
Danny's not testifying under
protection of a plea agreement.

417
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:19,700
Makes him a hell of a lot more
credible than your client.

418
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:21,834
It makes him a defendant, not a witness.

419
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,382
If he doesn't take the stand,
you don't have a case.

420
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:32,452
If he does, I can ask him anything I want.

421
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:38,991
Our offer expires with this meeting.

422
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:44,014
Why prolong the inevitable?

423
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,098
Your office told me you'd be here.

424
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:56,917
Last place I'd have thought to look.

425
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,818
About the only place I can get any work done.

426
00:23:59,862 --> 00:24:01,507
What can I do for you, Norman?

427
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:06,184
Oh, I'm just a little curious about what you're up to.
This altruistic nonsense your client is doing.

428
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,688
Danny is just trying to do
the right thing, that's all.

429
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,161
Trying to put an innocent
young man in prison for the rest of his life.

430
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:13,763
Please, Norman.

431
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,794
There's a lot of gray here for both our guys.

432
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:21,428
I'm sure a seasoned lawyer
like yourself can smell a win.

433
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:27,074
The DA's case rests entirely on what Danny says.

434
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:30,538
If he incriminates himself,
he takes my client down with him.

435
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:32,678
On the other hand,

436
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:40,170
if he decides not to testify,
Justin's memory could significantly improve.

437
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:44,508
Would I get Justin as a witness for Danny's defense?

438
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:48,449
All we need to do here is raise reasonable doubt.

439
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,571
It's an interesting way to practice law.

440
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:59,248
Oh, you know, one thing
you're forgetting, Norman.

441
00:25:00,677 --> 00:25:02,410
What if Danny's on the level?

442
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:06,606
How long have you been doing this?

443
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:15,180
Your motion is surprising
but valid, Mr. Conners.

444
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,827
Joining these trials certainly
makes economic sense.

445
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:21,248
Your Honor, binding these
defendants creates complexity.

446
00:25:21,377 --> 00:25:24,712
It had the potential of drawing
a single trial out even longer.

447
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:28,089
Mr. Conners may not be aware of it, your Honor,

448
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:32,038
but our defense could put
his client in a negative light.

449
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:35,979
- You mean, you intend to blame him.
- It's a bit more nuanced than that.

450
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,464
- There's no joint defense?
- No.

451
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:40,846
Your Honor, my client
was not a party to this crime.

452
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:44,007
In fact, he intends to testify
against Justin Birch.

453
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:46,787
And because of that,
the District Attorney would seek to delay...

454
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,952
... my client's trial
until after his testimony.

455
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,334
Now I would not be
providing effective counsel

456
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,495
if I were to let my client sit in jail
for something that he didn't do.

457
00:25:54,807 --> 00:25:57,406
A speedy trial is the very least that he should get.

458
00:25:57,492 --> 00:26:00,740
Then he should move for
a speedy trial, and not a joinder.

459
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:05,382
Now both defendants
are accused of the same crime.

460
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:09,513
I don't think antagonistic defenses
is sufficient reason to maintain severance,

461
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:11,072
especially given the cost.

462
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:14,579
- Your Honor...
- Ms. Kibre, I'm granting the motion.

463
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:22,346
What the hell is this about?

464
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,334
You think playing rich against poor
is gonna get Danny a walk?

465
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,672
I don't expect you to defend my client.

466
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:30,141
My job, I'll do it how I see fit.

467
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:32,392
What guarantee do I have
that he'll testify?

468
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:33,951
He says he wants to make this right.

469
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:35,919
Well, that's not good enough.

470
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:38,604
Well, it's good enough for me.

471
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:46,330
Even if Danny's story isn't rock solid,

472
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:47,802
It could have happened the way he said.

473
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:49,817
We went with his story
'cause he could get us Justin.

474
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:52,185
Yeah, that's what we want.
I still don't see the problem.

475
00:26:52,268 --> 00:26:55,815
We believed Danny
and we gave him 15 to 25.

476
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:58,751
Now, with no deal,
just the mercy of the court,

477
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:01,301
he gets a jury to believe him, he walks.

478
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,905
Okay, maybe they give him a walk.

479
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:05,678
That's fine if he's telling the truth.

480
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,060
The worst thing is when you sucker yourself.

481
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:15,620
Okay, I'm Danny. I'm standing here
rubbernecking Kristen's murder.

482
00:27:15,731 --> 00:27:18,336
She's getting killed,
you're here frozen in fear.

483
00:27:18,756 --> 00:27:22,913
There are at least three different places
that were probably open at 3:00 a.m.

484
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:26,432
The bar, that restaurant, and that bodega.

485
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:27,291
What's your point?

486
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:30,698
Well, why did Danny say
he was standing here?

487
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:32,250
Right here.

488
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:34,938
I'm not following you.

489
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:38,678
Well, If he was lying, why didn't he say
he was two blocks from here?

490
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:41,226
Or that he ran when
Justin grabbed Kristen,

491
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:43,859
- then heard the shots?
- Then he's telling the truth.

492
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:46,270
What if somebody saw him here?

493
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:50,110
Cops canvassed the area.
There's no witnesses.

494
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:53,380
Danny told the cops,
"I was scared. I was frozen."

495
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:56,290
He's thinking there's a witness
that's gonna come forward...

496
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:58,349
... and say they saw him
in the park that night.

497
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:02,589
So he makes a statement,
but the witness never turns up.

498
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,389
Now Danny's stuck with his story.

499
00:28:04,445 --> 00:28:06,163
But if there was a witness,

500
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:08,602
wouldn't he have seen Justin and Kristen?

501
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,480
Not necessarily. It was dark.

502
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:14,781
Turn around.

503
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:21,264
He would have had a perfect view
up and down Avenue B and East 7th.

504
00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:24,394
Anybody would have seen him coming.

505
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:29,272
You're saying he was
playing lookout for Justin.

506
00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:30,822
I don't know.

507
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:34,314
The kid's either really honest or...

508
00:28:35,887 --> 00:28:37,411
... really smart.

509
00:28:40,404 --> 00:28:43,591
So you're not buying
Danny's sacrificial blamas anymore

510
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:45,103
Well, I'm not sure.

511
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,479
It's possible Danny
was playing lookout for Justin.

512
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:50,431
If he thinks somebody
saw him that night,

513
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:52,730
that may be why he told the police
he witnessed the crime.

514
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,316
You think you could find that witness?

515
00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:56,959
Cops are recanvassing the area
around Tompkins Square Park.

516
00:28:58,144 --> 00:29:02,003
You're telling me your case is entirely
in the hands of a kid...

517
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:03,770
...who you should be trying to convict.

518
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:08,840
Look, Dean Conners is not stupid.
He knows how a jury loves an underdog.

519
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:10,532
Danny will testify.

520
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:13,725
He'll have to answer the accusations
made by Justin's defense.

521
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:15,245
I'll take my shot on cross.

522
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,069
Except when you impeach Danny's credibility,
you make everything else he says worthless.

523
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:21,663
And Justin walks.

524
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,381
There you go, ladies.

525
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:25,066
You've been outmaneuvered.

526
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:26,223
Yeah?

527
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,518
Okay, she'll be right down.

528
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,072
Kristen's parents are here.

529
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:37,533
We've prayed about this.

530
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,713
And Karen and I feel...

531
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:43,546
Well, we may have misjudged Danny.

532
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:46,167
We favored Justin...

533
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:48,645
... for the wrong reasons.

534
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:51,520
And we pushed Kristen toward him, and...

535
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:54,295
She died because of it.

536
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:57,048
Danny cared for her.

537
00:29:57,973 --> 00:30:00,087
We feel some blame for her death.

538
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:01,706
Mr. and Mrs. Ames,

539
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:04,680
I sympathize with what
you're going through, I really do.

540
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:08,358
We wanna ask if the murder charges
against Danny can be dropped.

541
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:11,563
We don't want him going to prison
for the rest of his life.

542
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,089
See, we've forgiven him in our hearts.

543
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:21,441
We have evidence
that suggests his involvement.

544
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:24,018
The law says we hold him accountable.

545
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:27,091
- He was just a witness.
- We don't know what he was.

546
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:28,280
He didn't kill her.

547
00:30:28,974 --> 00:30:30,164
You know that.

548
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:36,133
I'm sorry, I have to prosecute the crime.

549
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:46,153
And here we see Kristin Ames
leaving the building with Danny Wallace.

550
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,216
Right after that we see Justin Birch
following them out the door.

551
00:30:51,948 --> 00:30:53,666
And what's the time on the footage?

552
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:56,011
They left the building at 3:27 a.m.

553
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:59,976
It correlates to the estimated time of death,
which was put between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m.

554
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:07,102
So you inferred that the murder happened
shortly after all three left the building.

555
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,159
Correct.

556
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,630
Thank you, Detective Saunders.

557
00:31:14,117 --> 00:31:16,628
I was, uh, coming out of the establishment.

558
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:22,498
And there, by the... by the fence,
where the lady is standing with the dog,

559
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:26,463
I see this guy standing around.
And he sees me, right?

560
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,008
And I figure, who stands on
a corner... at 3:00 a.m.

561
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:32,321
- unless he's holdin'?
- Did you approach him?

562
00:31:32,343 --> 00:31:35,218
I got close enough to see
he wasn't a drug dealer, you know?

563
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,432
So I turned around and I walked away.

564
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,901
Half a minute later I heard two gunshots.

565
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,197
- This was the guy you saw, right?
- No. No, that's not him.

566
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:47,552
All right.

567
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:50,790
What about this guy?

568
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,678
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that... that's him.

569
00:31:55,107 --> 00:31:56,297
That's him for sure.

570
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,722
Did you see anyone else with him?

571
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:03,489
- Another man and a woman?
- No, just... just... just him.

572
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,570
Why didn't you come forward before now?

573
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:08,455
You think I'm looking for a headache?

574
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:16,715
Do you think I could get a ride across town?
I got an appointment for my meds.

575
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:23,862
We're not actually thinking
of using this guy, are we?

576
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:24,655
Are you kidding?

577
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:29,071
Excuse me, I turned Alphabet City
upside down looking for this guy.

578
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:31,109
His story proves Danny was the lookout.

579
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:32,695
And thank you for that, Detective.

580
00:32:32,695 --> 00:32:36,164
But I'm not about to stake my case
on the credibility of a perpie witness.

581
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:38,036
So you're gonna cut him loose.

582
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:40,812
I didn't say that.
Do an addendum to the witness list.

583
00:32:40,812 --> 00:32:42,662
I'll take it up with the judge in the morning.

584
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:44,512
But if we're not gonna call him,
what's the point?

585
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:46,648
He's got scare value.

586
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:52,078
Your Honor, this witness only
came to our attention last night.

587
00:32:52,177 --> 00:32:53,829
We've moved on, Ms. Kibre.

588
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:56,274
He's an important percipient witness.

589
00:32:56,373 --> 00:33:00,734
He was near the crime scene and can offer
first-hand observations of the murder.

590
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,925
The prosecution's playing
games here, Your Honor.

591
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:05,535
I have to agree, Your Honor.
They've already rested their case.

592
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:09,236
Then we ask to revisit the issue
until after the defense has concluded.

593
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,780
Even on rebuttal, it's unfair surprise.

594
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:12,573
All right.

595
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,392
We'll take the matter up again
at the appropriate time.

596
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:16,812
See if a rebuttal's in order.

597
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:18,828
- Your Honor...
- Bring in the jury.

598
00:33:19,257 --> 00:33:20,876
Let's get this show going.

599
00:33:23,488 --> 00:33:26,353
This witness they're talking
about, you know this guy?

600
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:28,083
No, of course not.

601
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:30,407
Well, this is a hell of a surprise.

602
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:34,231
Look, I didn't see anybody else that night,
if that's what you wanna know.

603
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,717
- I told you, I'm innocent.
- Being innocent isn't enough, Danny.

604
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:43,363
Innocent people go to prison all the time.
You understand what I'm saying?

605
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:46,931
I don't know what this guy's gonna say.

606
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:49,356
What he thinks he saw.

607
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:52,248
I need you to be straight with me here.

608
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:53,275
I am, I swear.

609
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:54,789
Mr. Conners?

610
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:56,411
Are we ready?

611
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:03,513
Your Honor, the defense calls Daniel Wallace.

612
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:09,375
I watched him shoot her twice.

613
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:11,862
I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't move.

614
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:16,236
When I finally snapped
out of it, I got nauseous.

615
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:18,885
- I was sick about it.
- What didn't you help her, Danny?

616
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,317
I wanted to.

617
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,666
I was scared.
I thought Justin was gonna kill me too.

618
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:26,639
Danny, why are you testifying here today?

619
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:31,795
Because I feel like I owe it
to Kristen and her family.

620
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,768
No more questions.

621
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:51,353
Justin dragged Kristin Ames
into the park and murdered her...

622
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:54,597
while you stood frozen in fear, correct?

623
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:57,593
- That's right.
- So you were an eyewitness to the crime.

624
00:34:58,025 --> 00:35:00,350
Why did he kill Kristen and let you live?

625
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,185
I don't know. You'd have to ask him.

626
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:05,939
Why didn't you run for help?

627
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,479
Why didn't you go to the police?

628
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:08,533
I wish I had.

629
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:10,695
But I guess I was in shock.

630
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:12,776
I couldn't believe
what was happening and then...

631
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:17,801
Afterward I kind of lost my head
seeing Kristen... laying there.

632
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:23,878
But you had the presence of mind to retrieve
your jacket from right next to the body.

633
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:28,655
I barely remember doing that.

634
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:33,439
I'm wondering, Danny...

635
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,221
while you were witnessing
Kristen's murder,

636
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,167
was there anybody in the area?

637
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:42,788
Anybody who could have seen you?

638
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:44,947
There might have, uh, been someone.

639
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:49,268
Now that I think about it,
but he was across the street.

640
00:35:49,322 --> 00:35:51,349
And then he headed in the other direction, so...

641
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:54,752
You've never mentioned this person before.

642
00:35:58,451 --> 00:35:59,289
I'm sorry.

643
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:01,316
I forgot.

644
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:05,421
So it was just that one person.
Nobody else?

645
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:06,151
No.

646
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:09,583
How would you know that?

647
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:11,664
How could you know that?

648
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:16,661
You testified that you were
facing the opposite direction,

649
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,091
frozen in fear,
watching Justin kill Kristen.

650
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:24,466
You know, Danny, I'd love to talk about the whole truth...


651
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:26,628
... and not just the parts that make you look good.

652
00:36:26,695 --> 00:36:28,533
Objection! Argumentative.

653
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:29,803
Sustained.

654
00:36:29,973 --> 00:36:32,433
Why'd you let Justin kill Kristen Ames?

655
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,352
I didn't.

656
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:38,460
How'd you feel when Kristen told you
that Justin and Carter had raped her?

657
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:40,025
I was angry.

658
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:41,917
That's why me and Kristen
were getting out of there.

659
00:36:41,944 --> 00:36:45,241
Oh, you didn't blame her just a little bit?
Maybe feel a little betrayed?

660
00:36:45,264 --> 00:36:46,778
I didn't do anything to her.

661
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:50,507
She hurt you all over again that night,
and you didn't believe her, did you?

662
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,829
I loved Kristen.

663
00:36:53,396 --> 00:36:57,153
- Justin killed her right in front of me.
- Oh, Danny, I know he did.

664
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,691
Doesn't mean you didn't want it to happen.

665
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:26,300
Any news?

666
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:27,783
Jury just broke for dinner.

667
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:29,837
I doubt they're coming back tonight.

668
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:32,753
I know what you're thinking, Tracey.

669
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:33,699
Don't go there.

670
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,186
I went after Danny.
It didn't help our case.

671
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:38,534
The jury'll figure it out.

672
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:42,940
The only thing the jury saw was a prosecutor
beating up on a kid they liked.

673
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,098
He got that look in his eye.

674
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:50,422
He was lying his heart out.

675
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:53,260
You saw that.

676
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:58,048
Yeah, I saw that.

677
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:18,836
Jury's coming back.

678
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:21,728
You okay?

679
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,431
The DA made a lot of 
accusations without evidence.

680
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:29,371
You did good.

681
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,290
The jury'll do the right thing.

682
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:37,279
That, um,

683
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,604
last minute witness.

684
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:46,825
Kibre was bluffing, right?

685
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:54,776
Don't tell me...

686
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:57,803
... that you've been lying to me all this time.

687
00:39:07,704 --> 00:39:08,515
Before...

688
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,160
you said whatever I do,
you weren't here to judge me.

689
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,890
That's right, Danny.

690
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:18,454
I did say that.

691
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:23,346
That night...

692
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:28,992
I told her I still loved her.

693
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:36,550
And she said I wasn't...

694
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:39,955
... the type of person
that she wanted to be with.

695
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:42,929
You know what that meant?

696
00:39:44,037 --> 00:39:44,983
That meant Justin.

697
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:49,277
I would have done anything for her.

698
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:51,683
And she...

699
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:57,139
... screws these guys
right under my nose.

700
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,369
They raped her, Danny.

701
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,909
That is what she said!

702
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,098
What did you do?

703
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,856
I was so mad.

704
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:18,775
I'm yelling at her.

705
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:25,339
Justin's yelling at her.
And he starts threatening her with his gun.

706
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:30,420
And I told him...

707
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:33,442
...to do it. I didn't care anymore.

708
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,600
I think I loved her too much.

709
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:02,034
Has the jury reached a verdict?

710
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:03,196
We have, Your Honor.

711
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:06,666
For Justin Birch, on the charge
of the indictment, how do you find?

712
00:41:06,774 --> 00:41:09,045
We find the defendant guilty.

713
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,150
For Daniel Wallace, on the charge of 
the indictment, how do you find?

714
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:17,474
We find the defendant not guilty.

715
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,879
Thank you, jury.
You are dismissed.

716
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:29,122
Congratulations.

717
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:01,262
You're not celebrating.

718
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:03,343
What brings you down here?

719
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:08,291
Rothenberg filed a notice of appeal for Justin.

720
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,967
Probably won't go anywhere, but if it does...

721
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:13,129
Danny's not my client anymore, Kibre.

722
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:17,011
He walked.

723
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:19,497
- You had a good plan.
- Danny's plan.

724
00:42:20,903 --> 00:42:21,876
Smart kid.

725
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:25,814
You believed him.

726
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,300
Wasn't there a minute you did too?

727
00:42:31,435 --> 00:42:32,625
I wanted to.

728
