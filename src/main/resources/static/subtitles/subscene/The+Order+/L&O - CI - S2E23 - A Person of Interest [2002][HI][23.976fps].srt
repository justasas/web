00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,809
In New York City's war on crime,

2
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,856
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,755
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

4
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,723
These are their stories.

5
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,430
I've been warning those people.

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,433
For 15 years, we were vulnerable.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,469
Your resume says that you
served with the Army Rangers

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,596
in the '80s.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,264
Who was your CO?

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,004
Sorry, fellas, can't go
into operational details.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,875
I do have combat experience.

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,710
In an advisory capacity.

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,283
Suffice it to say,

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,117
I'm looking for an opportunity
to get back on the front lines.

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,325
Okay. We'll make our decision
in the next couple of weeks.

16
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,318
Thanks for meeting with us, Dan.

17
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,594
Okay. I'll look forward to working with you.

18
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,494
Yeah. Thanks.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,342
My bus took forever. You get him in bed okay?

21
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,478
He fell asleep listening to his radio.

22
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,283
I left you some tuna in the fridge.

23
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,948
Thanks, sweetheart.

24
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,491
See you tomorrow.

25
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,083
Not if I can help it.

26
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,863
Dr. Croydon, Victor's looking for you.

27
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,297
He found some papers you were
burning in the oil furnace.

28
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,232
He says that's illegal.

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,292
What is he talking about?

30
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:37,197
You tell him snooping through
my garbage, that's illegal.

31
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,046
- Hey, Matson.
- Hey.

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,141
There it is.

33
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,149
Thanks.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,535
Morning, Dr. Croydon.

35
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,734
Don't you worry, I'll get Victor that message.

36
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,572
(DOORBELL RINGING)

37
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,754
Let me just rinse up.

38
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,861
I thought you'd be here earlier.

39
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,159

(THUDDING)

00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,855
AKHRASS: Her name's Connie Matson.

42
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,051
Part-time home care nurse.

43
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,617
She was Air Force until 3 months ago.

44
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,685
We found her discharge papers.

45
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,663
Page 2, section 5.

46
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,799
"Special Duties: Anthrax Vaccination Program."

47
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:44,961
That's why I called you in.

48
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,005
You did the right thing.

49
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,334
She was stationed just down
the road at McGuire AFB.

50
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,240
You'd think an Air Force nurse

51
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,212
could do better than night
shift as a home care.

52
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,344
And here's why.

53
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,577
General discharge. 2 medical leaves,

54
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,381
each less than 30 days. Maybe drug rehab.

55
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,557
No. I didn't see any track marks on her arms.

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,918
If it's drugs, it's probably
amphetamines. Go pills.

57
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,986
Air Force keeps them around like vitamins.

58
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,897
Maybe her go-go lifestyle got the best of her.

59
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:34,384
It's gel from an ice pack where
the seal must have been broken.

60
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,127
"For use with food and medical supplies.

61
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,961
"Conforms to US Military specifications."

62
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,028
Right down to the serial numbers.

63
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,165
HENDRICKS: The ice pack was
traced to your dispensary.

64
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,799
You worked in the infirmary together.

65
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,606
It's even known you fraternized with her.

66
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,610
Right, is the Lieutenant right, Airman?

67
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,977
Were you fraternizing with Matson?

68
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,419
Yes, sir. Before I was married.

69
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,185
Well, she didn't have any
contraceptives in her apartment,

70
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,696
no condoms, no evidence at all
that she had a boyfriend.

71
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,325
Not even that she was pursuing
a heterosexual relationship.

72
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,233
You were her beard?

73
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,099
Because a young, unattached
woman, gay or straight,

74
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,973
would be harassed here.

75
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,403
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,949
And lately she was having
a tough time in the world,

77
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,882
and she came to you for help.

78
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,511
Something she could sell?

79
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,489
Boosters for the anthrax vaccine.

80
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,831
She said she had a buyer for them.

81
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,330
Anthrax vaccinations and the yearly
boosters are tightly controlled.

82
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,032
And someone would buy them on the black market

83
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,837
because they'd want to stay off the radar.

84
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,811
And once they're vaccinated, the next step is

85
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,142
getting the anthrax.

86
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,239
Could be a nut job with a roll of stamps

87
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,580
or a terrorist with a crop duster.

88
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:18,081
I see a lot of inquiries in Matson's
file about her military record.

89
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,055
Hospital, medical group...

90
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,990
Prospective employers.

91
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,856
Yeah. And then there's this one,

92
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,523
Haznostics Incorporated up on Fordham.

93
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,497
They made two inquiries.

94
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,360
"Haznostics."

95
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,303
GOREN: "A testing facility for
environmental hazards and bioagents."

96
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,208
Well, anthrax certainly qualifies.

97
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,414
There was no anthrax in the nurse's apartment.

98
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,388
But the lab found five spores

99
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,153
on the money she gave to her Air Force buddy.

100
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,156
Same South African strain

101
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,823
as the anthrax in Dr. Stern's collection.

102
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,866
Dr. Stern who says he doesn't know anything

103
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,401
about missing anthrax.

104
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,936
Whoever gave the nurse
the money to buy the vaccine,

105
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,903
already has the anthrax.

106
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,874
Haznostics.

107
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,809
EAMES: What position did she apply for?

108
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,278
Nurse in our clinic.

109
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,612
She has experience treating
exposure to bioagents.

110
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,083
Does that happen here often?

111
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,141
No.

112
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:25,178
We do environmental testing for
insurance claims, workers' comp.

113
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,516
But you never know.

114
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,924
Has any of your employees ever
been vaccinated for anthrax?

115
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,725
Anthrax isn't something we've dealt with,

116
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,188
but I think Dr. Croydon...

117
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,236
Dr. Dan Croydon, our lab director.

118
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,406
He was vaccinated a few years ago

119
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,343
during a posting in South Africa

120
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,903
for the WHO.

121
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,877
Has he kept up with his boosters?

122
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,918
His last one was 4 years ago.

123
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,976
He'd no longer be protected
against the virus,

124
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,750
unless he got boosters we didn't know about.

125
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,656
I see he worked at the Army bioweapons lab

126
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,353
at Fort Detrick in the early '90s.

127
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,986
I like this guy.

128
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,730
What's this notation for?

129
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,527
His wages are being garnished.

130
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,499
He fell behind in his child support.

131
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,796
I really like this guy now.

132
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,172
Is he here today?

133
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,401
He took his son to Jones Beach.

134
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,211
Every morning, 7:00, Dr. Croydon's out
the door, comes back an hour later.

135
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,874
You ever seen him with this woman?

136
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,250
No. Dr. Croydon's hit a dry
spell lately, you know?

137
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,112
You call him a doctor, but he's not a
doctor. He's a scientist. A lab rat.

138
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,487
But he makes you call him "Doctor"?

139
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,992
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,791
I know his type. Goes off on people...

141
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,992
That's him. He even threatened
to have the super arrested.

142
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,125
For what?

143
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,362
Super caught him burning
garbage in the furnace.

144
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,735
We need to check the furnace room.

145
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,306
EAMES: Directory of government agencies.

146
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,540
He's highlighted a few,
FBI, Homeland Security.

147
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,082
Could be targets.

148
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:02,410
Found one picture of his son.
Looks at least 5 years old.

149
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,546
He's an equal-opportunity deadbeat.

150
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,285
His wife filled out this
healthcare form 2 months ago.

151
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,452
He hasn't mailed it in yet.

152
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,053
It's "the Great Flu Epidemic."

153
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,263
The flu epidemic of 1918 killed
22 million people worldwide.

154
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,834
Excuse me, who are you?

155
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,930
And what the hell is going on here?

156
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,668
We just executed a search warrant.

157
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,368
A search? A search for what?

158
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,469
Evidence of a crime.

159
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,645
- Do you know a Connie Matson? She's a nurse.
- No.

160
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,514
EAMES: She applied for a job at your lab.

161
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,553
I don't hire the nurses, and you
haven't answered my question.

162
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,180
What are you searching for?

163
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,021
Well, this, for one. You
highlighted some of these agencies.

164
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,789
Any particular reason why?

165
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,659
They offered me work.

166
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,122
You people have no idea
who you're dealing with,

167
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,169
but you'll find out. I promise you.

168
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,101
Oh, speaking of unfulfilled promises,

169
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,105
make sure you mail this.

170
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,104
It doesn't sound good, Dan.

171
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,307
Maybe we should take them up on their
invitation and go and talk to them.

172
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,078
I know these people. It
doesn't matter what you say,

173
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,642
they twist it around

174
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,710
until it suits the conclusion they want.

175
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,587
I refuse to play their game. I won't do it.

176
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:19,062
The lab says there was no trace of
anthrax at all in his apartment.

177
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,065
Might just mean he's not
as careless as we thought.

178
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,759
This is the lab report from the furnace.

179
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,666
They found ashes of paper products

180
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,932
and traces of bentonite.

181
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,601
I give up. What's bentonite?

182
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,940
An anthrax dispersal agent.

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,276
It keeps it from sticking to surfaces,

184
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,579
like the inside of an envelope, for example.

185
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,982
And then there's this

186
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,021
they found in a corner of the furnace box.

187
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:48,150
It's the plastic package
used for self-adhesive stamps.

188
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,820
Postage stamps and bentonite.

189
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,488
And a hit list.

190
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,662
Next stop is a mailbox.

191
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,229
We notified the Feds.

192
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,003
The HAZMAT people are checking mailboxes

193
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,869
near Croydon's home and his job

194
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,674
and along the route he takes to work.

195
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,442
If Dr. Croydon has anthrax,

196
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,505
can we say with certainty how he got it?

197
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,883
The anthrax on the money was from a
strain developed by the South Africans.

198
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,082
Croydon was in South Africa in the late 1990s,

199
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,920
same time as Roger Stern.

200
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,483
Sounds as sure as next week's weather.

201
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,860
"The idea that American
companies export anthrax

202
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,695

203
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,827
"with the approval of our

204
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,427
"But that's what's happening now.

205
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:37,566
"And one day these bioagents will reap
terror, and we will be unprepared."

206
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,476
It's a letter to the editor he wrote in 1988

207
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,480
when he worked for the Defense Department.

208
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,278
Must have made him popular
with his colleagues.

209
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,877
Well, he got reprimanded. His career stalled.

210
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,488
Now he has an ax to grind, a point to prove.

211
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,554
We were posted in South Africa for 3 years.

212
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,155
Dan's work was water quality.

213
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,360
No anthrax, far as I know.

214
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,629
Far as you know.

215
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,034
Was there a lot you didn't know?

216
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,606
Let's just say that Dan was a
disappointment and leave it at that.

217
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,304
You mean personally or professionally?

218
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:18,907
Because he had a prestigious job with the WHO,

219
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,351
a PhD from the Strathcona University.

220
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,549
Was there something wrong with his PhD?

221
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,592
He never finished his thesis.

222
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,888
His problem is he never
finished anything in his life.

223
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,986
He'd rather quit or run away.

224
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,123
I know the type. You know,
he neglects his child support,

225
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,327
irresponsible, self-involved.

226
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,736
You know, he just needs a personal crisis

227
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,342
to carry out his threats.

228
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,108
Anything like that going
on in his life right now?

229
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,348
My son said

230
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,011
that his job interviews
haven't been going very well.

231
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,314
GOREN: Just one more thing.

232
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,421
I noticed a diagnostic code

233
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,989
on your husband's medical claim

234
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,453
for post-cancer treatment.

235
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,021
I was diagnosed with breast
cancer 6 years ago.

236
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,725
When you were in South Africa.

237
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,565
I came home for treatment with my son.

238
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,671
But not with Dan.

239
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,540
He was having too much fun
jetting around the world,

240
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,270
doing important work.

241
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,214
When I finished chemotherapy,
I filed for divorce.

242
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,881
The man that she described
fits the profile.

243
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,513
A wounded idealist who's nursed
his grievances for years.

244
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,955
Which doesn't get us any
closer to an arrest warrant.

245
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,254
We turn up the pressure.

00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,193
We drive him into our arms.

true you're looking for anthrax?

We're looking for evidence in
the murder of Connie Matson.

249
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:51,000
REPORTER 2: We've been told an employee
of Haznostics, Dr. Daniel Croydon,

250
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,441
is a suspect.

251
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,842
CARVER: Dr. Croydon is not a suspect.

252
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,677
While we have no clear evidence
linking him to the murder,

253
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,877
he remains a person of
interest to us. Thank you.

They call me a person of interest,

259

and smear me in the press.

260
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,945
All without a shred of evidence.

261
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,743
I've prepared a handout for the press.

262
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,854
It contains a chronology

263
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,448
of the government's campaign against me.

264
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,118
Dr. Croydon, would you be
willing to take a blood test

265
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,131
to prove that you haven't
been exposed to anthrax

266
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,599
or recently vaccinated for anthrax?

267
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,262
Dr. Croydon wants to come in,
but I've advised him not to.

268
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,704
Well, if you're afraid he's
gonna incriminate himself,

269
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,038
then we'll make it off the record.

270
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,078
I have no fear of incriminating myself.

271
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,139
Is that a yes?

272
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,783
There are over 1,200 different
strains of Bacillus anthracis.

273
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,518
And if your so-called experts told you they
could pinpoint where this one came from,

274
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,820
you should fire them.

275
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,226
No, see, they compared it to an anthrax sample

276
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,822
which is known to have come from the
South African biowarfare program.

277
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,494
I'm sorry, I should be discussing
this with other scientists,

278
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,558
not with you.

279
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,002
We're going on two motives.

280
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,098
The first is extortion.
The suspect needs money.

281
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,106
Say, because his wages are being garnished,

282
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,443
or he's stuck in a dead-end job.

283
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:40,245
Only a mediocre mind would think
that's a plausible motive.

284
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,343
I can't wait to hear your other theory.

285
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,480
Vindication. The suspect feels victimized.

286
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,354
This is how he's settling the score.

287
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,689
That's another mediocre idea,

288
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,422
for someone with his qualifications

289
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,486

to air his grievances.

00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,415
The anthrax booster was found,
unused, this morning

354
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,049
by Canadian customs in a knapsack

355
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,150
on a New York-Montreal train.

356
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:47,095
There was also a small vial with
less than 2 grams of anthrax.

357
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,855
They think the owner

358
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,537
lost his nerve and got off the train
before it reached the border.

359
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,397
It doesn't look like Croydon
was the guy, after all.

360
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,133
EAMES: We still have a homicide.

361
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,305
FBI has taken jurisdiction.
You guys clean up your paperwork.

362
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,490
I would never say anything in
front of the Captain, but...

363
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,761
Everything pointed to Croydon.

364
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,969
You didn't listen, Bobby.

365
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,734
You didn't listen to what his wife said.

366
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,293
EAMES: Admirers?

367
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,027
Reporters. They want a comment.

368
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,666
Can they print a hand gesture?

369
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,009
You get any sleep last night?

370
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,977
I've been trying to tie up loose ends.

371
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,277
Look, you know,

372
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,342
if you don't incinerate bentonite
at a very high temperature,

373
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,049
it leaves a residue.

374
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,521
Now, Croydon...

375
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:56,924
Croydon's lab has a 2,000-degree
industrial furnace.

376
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:01,453
So why did he use an oil furnace
that only burns at 400 degrees?

377
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,857
He would have known better.

378
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,266
I had Latent take another look

379
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,129
at Connie Matson's cover letter to Haznostics.

380
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:16,509
Her fingerprints are under
the ink, not over it.

381
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,677
She only handled the blank page.

382
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,777
Somebody else wrote the letter,
printed it, mailed it.

383
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:30,121
This evidence, it's manufactured.
Croydon was set up.

384
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,557
Now he's dead, and, just as
mysteriously, he's been cleared.

385
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,863
It doesn't make sense. If
somebody wanted to ruin the guy...

386
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,030
Is that what you think
they wanted to do? Or this?

387
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,566
"innocent man driven to suicide

388
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,008
"by ruthless and incompetent detective."

389
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,987
SERVER: You must really like Veal Parmesan.

390
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,546
It's the fifth night in
a row you've ordered it.

391
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,093
I just like watching you write it down.

392
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,661
Hello, Bobby.

393
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,167
I would call you Detective Goren,

394
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,974
but given your press coverage lately,

395
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,610
you probably want a low profile.

396
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,349
Keep your hands on deck.

397
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,320
We don't want you playing with
your pistol under the table.

398
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,256
Nicole Wallace.

399
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:41,560
Hitchens, same as it was and always will be.

400
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,298
Yeah. I thought we cleared all that up.

401
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:48,168
Your identity, your pathology.

402
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,701
Oh, right, your little theory.

403
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,304
But like many of your theories lately,

404
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,707
wouldn't butter your parsnips.

405
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,417
What will they do with you, Bobby?

406
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,851
Do you think they might find a
nice tunnel for you to guard?

407
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,653
(LAUGHING)

408
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,858
Well, you know, there is a bright side.

409
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,555
I mean, you'll have more time
to spend up at Carmel Ridge.

410
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,159
Oh, you're just hitting all the marks.

411
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,167
I was right about you, Nicole.

412
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,539
Elizabeth. And you were wrong about me.

413
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,408
Just like you were wrong about Dr. Croydon.

414
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:37,218
Read the papers, Detective. Your
insights have no currency anymore.

415
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,949
Is that what this is about?

416
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,124
Do you remember what you said about Moby Dick

417
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,530
and the unrelenting pursuit of evil?

418
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,166
I know why you were unrelenting
about Dr. Croydon.

419
00:24:55,661 --> 00:25:00,269
I know what it was about him that
stuck to your hide like a harpoon.

420
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,045
He ran out on his poor sick wife.

421
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,788
Cheers, Bobby. This was
everything I'd hoped for.

422
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,927
Careful, your salad's wilting.

423
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,203
HITCHENS: Oh, I was hoping you'd join us.

424
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,802
This is Robert Goren, my friend
I was telling you about.

425
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,677
This is my husband, Gavin Haynes.

426
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:41,274
Oh, nice to meet you. Elizabeth tells
me you're one of New York's finest.

427
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,718
Oh, not these days. So you're married to...

428
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,848
I told you, Gavin has made an honest woman

429
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,222
and American citizen out of me.

430
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:54,698
We should give you our number, and you
should join us for dinner one night.

431
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,762
Oh, better yet, you should
jot down our license plate.

432
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,860
You can find us that way.

433
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,963
She's a remarkable woman, isn't she?

434
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,571
(LAUGHING)

435
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,938
Oh, gosh.

436
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,336
She wouldn't have dangled herself
in front of me like that

437
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,745
unless she felt completely protected.

438
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,580
With Gavin Haynes as her
husband, she would be.

439
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,484
She planned this return from the
minute that she disappeared.

440
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:20,456
Stern, Buzz Davis, Connie Matson...

441
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,253
Who knows how long that she knew them.

442
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,260
Resourceful girl like her would have held on

443
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,954
to their numbers till she needed them.

444
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,998
And then there's Croydon.

445
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,365
The perfect background.

446
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,695
The perfect personality.

447
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,900
DEAKINS: Perfect fall guy.

448
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,240
CARVER: She framed him with planted
evidence, and she killed him.

449
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,442
And Ms. Matson, is she also responsible?

450
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:00,864
Croydon. She picked a man
I already didn't trust,

451
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,830
I already didn't respect.

452
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,800
That's how she blind-sided me. She...

453
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,107
She picked a man like my father.

454
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,182
She... She got me. She got me good.

455
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,279
Then let's get her back.

456
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,460
That's Nicole and her French boyfriend

457
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,330
during their killing spree in Thailand.

458
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,528
Well, outside of being blonde and pretty,

459
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,037
that girl doesn't have a lot
in common with Elizabeth.

460
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,301
You have any more recent photos?

461
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:45,603
There's that.

462
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,237
I noticed your marriage went unnoticed.

463
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,510
Was that her idea, to keep it a secret?

464
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,116
She told me that she had an ongoing dispute

465
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,448
with the Australian tax people

466
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,114
over a fund she ran in Melbourne.

467
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,715
It's actually not her dispute.

468
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,057
It's Elizabeth Hitchens',
whose identity she stole.

469
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:09,788
She tell you about her little
stint at Hudson University?

470
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:14,031
She was very sorry she got
dragged into an academic feud.

471
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:17,904
A feud? She was responsible
for the murder of 2 people

472
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,705
and killed 2 more in the last 2 weeks.

473
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,212
If you had one iota of evidence...

474
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,215
You don't see it, do you?

475
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,847
We're just picking on your poor innocent wife.

476
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,278
I hear a familiar voice.

477
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:37,593
Sweetheart, I tried to call you at the spa.

478
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,061
They told me, but I was
wrapped up in something.

479
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,689
GOREN: Don't worry.

480
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,099
You did a good job inoculating
him against the truth.

481
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:54,238
Sooner or later, she is going to turn on you.

482
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,844
She probably turned on people for good reason.

483
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,474
I don't intend to give her that reason.

484
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,111
But I've humored you, Detective, up till now.

485
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,623
But I know about all your methods.

486
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,319
You drove an innocent man to commit suicide.

487
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,421
I'm warning you,

488
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,826
don't try it with my wife.

489
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,265
A week after her marriage,

490
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,334
Hitchens got an expedited citizenship hearing

491
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,902
before an administrative judge

492
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,471
and pledged allegiance a week later.

493
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,910
Unless we prove beyond a reasonable doubt

494
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,386
that she is, in fact, Nicole
Wallace, she's out of our reach.

495
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,218
ME heard back from the Australians.

496
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,523
Nicole Wallace got vaccinated
for anthrax in 1996,

497
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,119
in Bendigo.

498
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:50,466
Apparently, that's the
heartland of sheep country.

499
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,092
Do you have an atlas?

500
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:56,071
Her last booster was over 2 years ago.

501
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,302
ME says it protects up to 2 to 3 years later.

502
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:03,141
If we could test her blood, we'd know if
she handled the South African anthrax.

503
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,239
There's no probable cause
to compel a blood test.

504
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,252
6 years ago, Croydon investigated

505
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,948
an anthrax outbreak in Australia,

506
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,953
in the state of Victoria,

507
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,596
which happens to be where Bendigo is.

508
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,623
6 years ago, Croydon's wife was
in New York battling breast cancer.

509
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,829
He would've been in Australia by himself.

510
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:28,530
They could've met.

511
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:32,234
Nicole could've found out
that he ran out on his wife.

512
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,369
Factor in your credibility
problem, Gavin Haynes.

513
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:36,845
The way he was mooning over her,

514
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:40,281
he'd spend his last dime
keeping her out of trouble.

515
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:44,310
She seemed to be moony over
him, too, in her own way.

516
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,587
Question is, how far will
she go to protect him?

517
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:56,632
As you can see by the date, the Australians
filed their extradition request

518
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,760
2 months before Ms. Haynes'
citizenship was granted.

519
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:04,103
She wasn't aware of it. Your office
just didn't perform its due diligence.

520
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,005
You can't revoke her citizenship,

521
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,841
and because this concerns
non-violent financial crimes,

522
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,278
she can't be extradited.

523
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,180
That's true, but this is one of
several irregularities involving

524
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,846
the administrative judge who presided
over her citizenship hearing.

525
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,618
Ms. Haynes, did Judge Burbank ask
you for a financial consideration?

526
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,818
STYMINGTON: Now wait a minute!

527
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,656
The judge paid off the
mortgage on his country home

528
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,629
2 weeks after Ms. Haynes became a citizen.

529
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,363
We're very curious how he did that.

530
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,961
Did we bribe him, is that
what your question is?

531
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,366
No.

532
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,338
If you'll give me a minute,
I'll be right back.

533
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,512
You're sure you don't know about this?

534
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,414
I mean, if Gavin did anything...

535
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,747
I know.

536
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,788
He wouldn't be so bloody reckless.

537
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,346
Well, he just might, Elizabeth. He loves you.

538
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,417
Now, you may not be in
trouble, but he would be.

539
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,997
Bribing a judge is serious business.

540
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,036
Judge Burbank?

541
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,699
Elizabeth Haynes.

542
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,931
You did my citizenship hearing.

543
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,239
Yes, I remember, Mrs. Haynes.

544
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,541
Could I have a word with you in private?

545
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,853
This may come as a shock to you,

546
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,686
but you're being investigated
for taking bribes.

547
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:30,249
Excuse me? Where did you hear this?

548
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:34,457
They suspect my husband of helping
you pay off your little shack here.

549
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,193
I have no way of knowing if he did or not,

550
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,065
but I will not let anything happen to him.

551
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,696
You name your price, whatever it is,

552
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,866
but under no circumstance
will you implicate my husband.

553
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,612
If I'm hearing you clearly...

554
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,842
You heard me clearly, Judge.

555
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,284
I'll be in touch with you tomorrow.

556
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,112
Love the garden.

557
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,190
Hello, Nicole.

558
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,631
If you insist on calling me that name,

559
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,298
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ignore you.

560
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:20,400
Nicole, Elizabeth, Wallace,
Hitchens, Haynes, whatever.

561
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,674
All of you are under arrest
for attempted bribery.

562
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,216
Since we believe she
obtained her citizenship

563
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,479
using a false identity,

564
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,111
she's a foreign national

565
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,180
with no status and no right
to the usual protections.

566
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,953
How long is that going to fly?

567
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,518
Hopefully long enough to get
probable cause to test her blood

568
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,461
for anthrax exposure,

569
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,525
proving once and for all
that she is Nicole Wallace.

570
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,674
What a clever pair you are, with
your phony extradition request.

571
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,676
And that judge, oh, he was very convincing.

572
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,213
I'd keep an eye on him if I were you.

573
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,182
He might actually be taking bribes.

574
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,018
You know, let's put aside
Elizabeth Hitchens' crimes.

575
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,783
Let's talk about Nicole
Wallace and her crimes.

576
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,729
That's the anthrax you left
on the train to Montreal.

577
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,703
Along with the booster Connie Matson
got for you before you killed her.

578
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,666
Where did you find her, at a
bar near the Air Force base?

579
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,043
You slept with her, is that
how you gained her trust?

580
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,374
Fire up your imagination
all you want, Detectives,

581
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,682
you won't provoke me.

582
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,050
And then there's Dan Croydon.

583
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,815
You find out where he was staying.

584
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,760
You invited yourself up to his room.

585
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,458
You commiserated with him
and then suggested that

586
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,669
he vent his outrage on paper.

587
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,362
You made sure he was good and drunk,

588
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,236
and then you got him in the
shower and strung him up.

589
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,866
All that, and she can bake a cake, too.

590
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,506
Really, Detectives.

591
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,343
Hold on.

592
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:14,757
There's a leak in the anthrax bag.
It spilled onto the table.

593
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,350
It's okay. It's not weaponized.
It'll stick to the surface.

594
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,758
It won't float around.

595
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,024
EAMES: I'll get a HAZMAT guy up here.

596
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:24,090
It's an emergency kit.
They give us these things

597
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,360
in case something like this happens.

598
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,639
Your hands.

599
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,976
You touched the table here.

600
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:37,445
So did you.

601
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,947
We were vaccinated after 9/11.

602
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,980
There's no problem.

603
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,722
But you... You touched your face,

604
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,453
your mouth, and...

605
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,358
Yes, please save me.

606
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,955
I've been mortally contaminated
with what? What is this,

607
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,425
confectioner's sugar?

608
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,461
You don't believe it's anthrax.

609
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,061
Fool me once, Detective.

610
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,438
I doubt even you would throw
around bags of lethal anthrax.

611
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,670
Well, there's a detection kit.

612
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,877
It's easy to find out.

613
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,614
Give me your hand.

614
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,420
If you just wanted to hold my hand, Bobby,

615
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:30,898
you really didn't have
to go through such measures.

616
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,566
Is it everything you imagined?

617
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:40,174
Don't flatter yourself.

618
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,641
I see in you what your other conquests don't.

619
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,979
Right, the famous Goren vision.

620
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,916
A little shortsighted lately, though,
with one glaring blind spot.

621
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,819
Well, we all have our off days.

622
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,853
Just a couple of drops on this strip,

623
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,398
and then we'll see if it's anthrax.

624
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,137
Did it ever occur to you
how much you despised him?

625
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,064
Who? Croydon?

626
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:14,110
No. Daddies, Bobby, the subject is Daddies.

627
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,207
I was stunned to discover

628
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,544
divorce decrees were matters
of public record here.

629
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,749
While reading between the lines
of your parents' divorce,

630
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,789
I gather your Daddy was quite the bon vivant.

631
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,722
He liked a good time.

632
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,288
Tell me, Bobby,

633
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,423
when he ran out on your poor mother,

634
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,764
it was her you blamed, wasn't
it, for driving him away?

635
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,874
Yeah. Yes, I did.

636
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,411
You were 11.

637
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,845
You thought Daddy was fun and exciting.

638
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,711
Boys are supposed to look up to their Daddies.

639
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,924
But now you worry you're too much
of a chip off the old block.

640
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,982
Is that why you haven't married?

641
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,257
You're afraid that maybe you'll be the
model husband that your Daddy was?

642
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,524
No.

643
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,832
You remember the rules. Tit for tat.

644
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,129
And what about your father?

645
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,175
Did you ever confront him
for what he did to you?

646
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,336
Did you ever bring him
to account for his abuse?

647
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,911
You never even admitted it to yourself.

648
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,876
This doesn't concern me.

649
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,023
You've become the abuser

650
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,721
of that sparkling little girl.

651
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:41,656
You pimp her out.

652
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,834
You make her sleep with men and
women she doesn't want to,

653
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,066
what, to serve your pathological needs

654
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:52,074
and theirs.

655
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,373
Well, this will come as news to Gavin.

656
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,210
You know, we've fooled ourselves
into thinking we're in love.

657
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,944
Thank God Detective Goren
is here to save us.

658
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,783
No. You just listen to me!
Just listen to me now!

659
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,291
My, how you hate being contradicted.

660
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,898
I believe that there is a part of you

661
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,803
that loves Gavin.

662
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,473
The decent part of Nicole

663
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:37,215
that's hidden in that bunker you call a heart.

664
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,681
You know, the last time you sat here,

665
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,061
you confronted the truth.

666
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,665
It hurt,

667
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,868
so you had to shoot the messenger.

668
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,064
Hmm?

669
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,065
If I could be wrong about Dan Croydon,

670
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,407
then how could I be right about you?

671
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,071
Well, you blew it, Nicole.

672
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:07,309
Your one chance for happiness with Gavin.

673
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,585
One chance,

674
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,320
and you had to come back to me?

675
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,397
You couldn't leave well enough alone.

676
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,626
That's the price of denial.

677
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,276
Look, it's positive for anthrax.

678
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:42,012
- You don't seem concerned.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
- I heard.

679
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,519
You've been exposed to anthrax.

680
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,714
No cause for alarm, Detective.

681
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,157
I've been vaccinated for anthrax

682
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,524
along with millions of my fellow Australians.

683
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,462
Including Nicole Wallace.

684
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:06,404
Yeah. She was vaccinated
in 1996, in Bendigo.

685
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,743
One year before she met Dan Croydon.

686
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,282
And her records show

687
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:18,412
that her last booster was over 2 years ago.

688
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,290
On the other hand,

689
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,816
there's no record that shows
Elizabeth Hitchens

690
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,021
has ever been vaccinated.

691
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,998
So if, in fact, you are Elizabeth,

692
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,333
you would be alarmed.

693
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,498
You'd be screaming for medical help.

694
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:47,539
You might still have enough time to
put on a convincing performance.

695
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,285
(CLEARING THROAT)

696
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,658
This is proof of what? Nothing.

697
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,859
Not quite. It's probable
cause for a blood test,

698
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,199
which will reveal your recent exposure
to the South African anthrax.

699
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,832
And that, Ms. Wallace,
is proof of everything.

700
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,274
Well, of course I've been exposed to that.

701
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,880
Isn't that part of your little charade?

702
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:23,578
This? No, that's a different
strain of anthrax.

703
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:28,052
A genetically impaired harmless strain.

704
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:32,725
You don't seriously think he'd toss
about bags of lethal anthrax, do you?

705
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,329
Don't think for one second that
this is the end of us, Bobby.

706
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,336
When the blood test came back positive,

707
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,937
I thought she'd jump at a plea,

708
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,108
but she's insisting on a trial.

709
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:57,176
Sure, with Gavin Haynes footing the bill.

710
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:01,449
Well, it's your turn in the barrel now.

711
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,250
I'm done with her.

712
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,926
Here, have one.

713
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:10,999
What's this?

714
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,596
Scones.
