00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,694
<i>[Man Narrating]
In the criminal justice system...</i>

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,137
<i>all defendants are innocent
until proven guilty,</i>

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:11,576
<i>either by confession,
plea bargain or trial byjury.</i>

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,839
<i>This is one of those trials.</i>

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,285
What's the latest on Detective Green?
Some improvement.

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,947
Are we gonna be able to get a
statement any time soon? I don't know.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:28,120
His doctors say there's a chance he
may not even remember getting shot.

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,360
I really wanna get whoever did this.

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,699
Yeah, we all want that.

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:43,071
I'm asking you to make some room
for me on this. It's still my case.

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,805
And you're starting
another trial next week.

12
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,074
Okay. I can handle both.

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,084
Kibre's freed up.

14
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,143
You know she'd get it done right.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,917
- I don't want-
- Let's be realistic.

16
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,421
All right. I'll bring her up to speed.

17
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,799
It was all routine.

18
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:12,270
There was no threats, no reason
to believe anything like this would happen.

19
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,273
Detective Green was assigned
to pick up this witness-

20
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,901
Kenny Peluso-
at Borgia's request.

21
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,675
They were ambushed
on the way back to the car.

22
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,110
Killer walked out and fired three shots.

23
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,450
<i>It's all there in my D. D. - 5.</i>

24
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,423
How is Detective Green?
[Sighs] It's hard to say.

25
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,687
He was back in the O.R. Last night.
I'm sorry to hear that.

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,663
Well, the shooter was
definitely after Peluso.

27
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,665
He was hit by two rounds.

28
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:44,294
Green only once,
even after he drew his gun.

29
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>Excuse me.
Detective, we're not done.</i>

30
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,842
Yes, ma'am.

31
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,579
The D.A.' s office is gonna have
an active role in this investigation.

32
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,844
I want you to work with one of our guys
- Hector Salazar.

33
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,114
- Yes, ma'am.
- I agreed to keep you on this case because your lieutenant...

34
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,155
called Jack McCoy and pushed,

35
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,157
but I'm concerned about your bias.

36
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,659
The defense is gonna look
for any excuse to find fault...

37
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,854
<i>with your involvement.
Counselor,</i>

38
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,989
we can put together a solid case.

39
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,702
Are we done now, ma'am?

40
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,914
<i>[Machines Beeping]</i>

41
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,797
Well,

42
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,065
you have no idea of the crap
that I'm going through because of you.

43
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,571
[Chuckles]

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,574
Hey, Joe.

45
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,710
You get the guy?

46
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,712
No. Not yet.

47
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,418
As a matter of fact, I'm at a dead end.

48
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,122
The only witness I have is you.

49
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,258
So, sir,

50
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,553
do you remember anything?

51
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,655
Hispanic guy.

52
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,801
Uh, late 20s.

53
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,205
Uh, l-

54
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,710
<i>I barely got a chance
to see him.</i>

55
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,076
You're sure he was gunnin' for Peluso?

56
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,240
Mm-hmm.

57
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,184
He rolled up...

58
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,948
and said, " Yo, Kenny.' '

59
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,581
<i>Like he knew him?
Mmm.</i>

60
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,956
Uh, I wish I could do better
for you, man.

61
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,655
No, no, no.
You did good.

62
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,563
I mean, you did good.
Really, really, really good.

63
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,658
Really good.

64
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,092
Pulled Peluso's department file,

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,151
and I've been working
on a couple of leads.

66
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,197
Did you talk to Fontana yet?

67
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,892
Guy doesn't return my phone calls,
so I spoke to Van Buren.

68
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,027
She said that Green gave
a description of the shooter-

69
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,037
Hispanic male, 20s.

70
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,233
Guys said, "Yo, Kenny," before
firing. Sounds like he knew him.

71
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,073
He arrested over 60 Hispanics
working Vice.

72
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,275
You know, minor stuff. Nothing jumps
out. Did you talk to his lieutenant yet?

73
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,580
Says Peluso was unofficially suspended
before he turned his badge in.

74
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,586
Guy took no pension.

75
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,522
That's weird. Way I hear it,
guy got caught with a prostitute.

76
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,322
So you gonna talk to I.A. B?
I.A.B. Didn't investigate.

77
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,761
Special Victims did.

78
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,001
<i>[Munch]
Name is Jody Watson.</i>

79
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,503
She was 15 years old,
working as a stripper on a phony I.D.

80
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,439
Doesn't look like
she could have fooled anyone.

81
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,873
Except for Peluso, so he says.

82
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,377
He indulged himself with her
on a weekly basis.

83
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,210
So how did Special Victims get
involved? Jody got busted...

84
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,216
by a couple of cops grabbing
a lunchtime show.

85
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,344
She wanted to beat the charge.
Implicated Peluso on a rape.

86
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,354
You guys gonna make a case?

87
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,390
He was suspended
pending our investigation.

88
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,449
I.A.B. Got involved.
The girl took off.

89
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,460
Everything fell apart.

90
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,521
Look, I doubtJody Watson
was this guy's first indiscretion.

91
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,533
He was a sleazy cop.

92
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,399
<i>Well, what about the shooter?
Any connection?</i>

93
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,269
Peluso had plenty of friends.
Ask his fellow officers.

94
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,433
I got this.
Good luck with the case.

95
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,636
<i>Thanks.
My pleasure.</i>

96
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,202
Kenny Peluso dead?
You made my day.

97
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,911
<i>Me and Peluso were partners
about six months.</i>

98
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,147
I couldn't wait
to get out of Vice.

99
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,919
I wasn't looking for any side
action. You know the type.

100
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,756
Meanwhile, Peluso was hitting
on any female that had a pulse.

101
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,262
First shift that we ever worked,
he busted a hooker.

102
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,299
She paid him off with
a little favor in the alley.

103
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,857
I stayed in the car.
Read the paper.

104
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,369
I don't think shaking down hookers
is what got him killed.

105
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,134
<i>[Salazar] Maybe he shook down
their pimps. I don't know.</i>

106
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,141
Yeah, maybe.

107
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,248
We're looking to talk
to a male Hispanic in his 20s.

108
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,714
All right, you might want to talk
to this guy, Emiliano Ortiz.

109
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,551
Ran a handful of girls.
Nothin' street.

110
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,682
It was all clubs and hotels.

111
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,819
I don't know what it was between them, but it seemed
like they might have been doing business together.

112
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,830
Look, I really gotta get back.

113
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,661
<i>Thanks.
Any time.</i>

114
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,999
- Hector Salazar, D.A.' s office.
- Joe Fontana.

115
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,596
I think maybe we should check out if
Green can make a positive I.D. Of Ortiz.

116
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,610
Yeah. I'll take care of it.
Excuse me.

117
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,744
<i>[Machines Beeping] [Fontana]
We're in no hurry here.</i>

118
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,786
Take your time.
Look it over carefully.

119
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,784
<i>- It could be him.
- [Fontana] Good choice.</i>

120
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,385
I'll call Van Buren, see if she has
a last known address on him.

121
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,229
He's two months out of Rikers.
His parole officer will probably know.

122
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,359
Who is he?

123
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,869
Emiliano Ortiz,
a pimp piece of crap.

124
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,873
Him and Peluso did some business.

125
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,876
Lieutenant Van Buren, please.

126
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,378
Joe.

127
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,573
I'm not sure he's the one.

128
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,946
Oh, we'll make sure he's the right guy.

129
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,951
Lieutenant?

130
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,122
<i>[Salsa]</i>

131
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,215
Was Green 100%?
Close enough for me.

132
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,159
We can't arrest this guy.
We got no P.C. It'd get tossed.

133
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,424
Look. We're gonna talk to this guy.

134
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,695
Either there's probable cause or there
isn't, in which case we'll move on.

135
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,463
Is that all right with you?
Now get over there.

136
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,530
<i>[Stops] [Man] Who is it?</i>

137
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,590
<i>[Speaking Spanish] Hey, there's
water comin'into my room.</i>

138
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,363
<i>Abre la puerta.</i>

139
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,037
- [Groans]
- Stay down and shut up. Check this room out.

140
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,543
<i>What the hell are you doin'? You
can'tjust barge into my crib like this.</i>

141
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,374
It's clear.
How's the whore business?

142
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,277
Why? You need a date?

143
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,748
Got some questions
to ask you, Emil.

144
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,411
<i>Well, I'm on parole, man. I don't
know nothin'. You're not too sharp...</i>

145
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,478
for a guy who's on parole,
you know that?

146
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,649
We haven't asked you anything yet.
How do you know what you don't know?

147
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,558
- All I'm saying is, I'm out of the game.
- Out of the game? Then you got nothin' to worry about, right?

148
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:26,086
We're here on a murder investigation.
Yeah? And what's that got to do with me?

149
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,793
Kenny Peluso's murder.
Kenny's dead, huh?

150
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,802
Well, I ain't seen that guy
in a long time.

151
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,804
A New York City police detective
got shot with him.

152
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,806
I'm a little upset about that.
Maybe you can tell.

153
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,105
I don't know anything about it, man. What do
you think we did, just fall out of the sky?

154
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:42,910
You got identified.
That's why we're here.

155
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,811
Now I'm gonna ask you something,

156
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,652
and I'm gonna ask you one time,
and one time only.

157
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,022
Where's that gun you used in the hit?
Hmm?

158
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,132
It's under the mattress, man.

159
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,232
<i>[Fontana] There's a
ballistics match on the gun.</i>

160
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,437
<i>You're through. We don't
need you for anything more.</i>

161
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,776
<i>Tu vida-</i>

162
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,715
You're looking at life
without the possibility of parole.

163
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,618
Murder of a material witness,
attempted murder of a police officer.

164
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,283
Unless you got something that can help
you get out from underneath all of this.

165
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,623
<i>We're at that place, Emil.</i>

166
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,629
That's what this is about.

167
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,725
Okay. I can give you something.

168
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,736
I was paid to do it.

169
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,965
By who?
No.

170
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,669
Why don't you get your D.A. Down here.
Then maybe I'll remember who.

171
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,074
Look, I read the little rat his rights.

172
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,845
This isn't his first dance.
He didn't ask for a lawyer.

173
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,852
I talked to Kibre.

174
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,549
I'm authorized to put a deal on the table,
but I'm not gonna do it without his attorney.

175
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,559
<i>Counselor, he lawyers up, we
won't get another peep out ofhim.</i>

176
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,152
And before we give up
more than we lose,

177
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,494
let me go back there and talk to him,
keep workin' on him.

178
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,261
Yeah, you push too hard, we risk
having the entire confession thrown out.

179
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,326
We still have the gun evidence.

180
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,170
The case won't work on that alone. And
if the defense argues illegal search-

181
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,766
What illegal search?

182
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,689
<i>Get Ortiz to our office.</i>

183
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,521
I'll have his lawyer meet us there.

184
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,561
Peluso and me had a-
What do you call it?

185
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,063
A reciprocal type of relationship,
all right?

186
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,225
You know, he'd tip me to Vice stings,
and I'd let him get with my girls.

187
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,236
He was hanging out
at a party I had a while back,

188
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,397
and he met this guy I know.

189
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,442
This guy wanted to use my girls
for some special videos he made.

190
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,206
<i>Pornographic videos? Yeah, yeah,
yeah, but, like, weird stuff, you know?</i>

191
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,909
Like kinky sex, B&D, rape fantasies-
Like that type of thing, you know?

192
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,577
I said no way,
but Kenny and him hung out...

193
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,917
and Kenny got off on that stuff.

194
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,957
You know cops.
So I come home from Rikers.

195
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,859
I needed money. Kenny wasn't a cop
no more. Wasn't doin' nothin' for me.

196
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,592
So this guy offered me
10 grand to kill him.

197
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,430
Why'd this guy want him dead?

198
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:21,132
<i>He said he'd killed a girl, and Kenny
knew about it and was talking to the D.A.</i>

199
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,232
You still haven't given us the name.
No, no, no.

200
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,470
I talked, now you deal.

201
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,772
Full cooperation and testimony.

202
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,784
If his story checks out,
concurrent sentences, 25 to life.

203
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,786
That's the best I can do.

204
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,982
All right.

205
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,018
I want his name, Mr. Ortiz.

206
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,166
Shane Lucas.

207
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,567
[Branch] What do we know
about this fellow Lucas?

208
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,628
Convictions for pandering,
rape and assault.

209
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,640
Released from Attica two years ago.

210
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,903
<i>Paroled?
Served his entire sentence.</i>

211
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,037
<i>[Kibre] Since he got out he's
made an attempt at legitimacy.</i>

212
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,742
- If you can call it that.
- He produces and distributes pornography.

213
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,684
Extreme stuff,
like simulated rapes and assaults.

214
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,348
<i>He sells it via mail order
in the back of fringe magazines.</i>

215
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,357
<i>I ran the company name byJustice.</i>

216
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,416
They haven't red-flagged it
beyond obscenity concerns.

217
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,485
This guy pays his taxes.

218
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,963
So why kill Peluso?

219
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,899
Ortiz says Lucas killed a woman.
Peluso knew about it.

220
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,464
Any corroboration beyond
Ortiz's testimony?

221
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,407
<i>You mean like a dead body?
Not yet.</i>

222
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,535
Murder for hire is difficult to prove.

223
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,102
Well, according to Ortiz,

224
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,775
Lucas still owes him money
for the murder.

225
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,047
We can get him to meet with Lucas
and make him wear a wire.

226
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,181
- Risky.
- Suppose we put Salazar with Ortiz?

227
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,225
He'd be under constant surveillance.

228
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,228
We'd control the location of the meeting
and have police backup.

229
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,662
What would you need from me?

230
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,565
I just wanna make sure
you've got my back.

231
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,038
You've got it.
Get it done.

232
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,907
Stay on Ortiz.
Make sure he doesn't blow it.

233
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,917
Look, when you're in there, you keep the
conversation on the murder of Peluso, okay?

234
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,044
Thanks, Chris.
I've done this before.

235
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,054
So when do we move in on him?

236
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,614
When Lucas makes an admission of guilt.
Or he pays off Ortiz.

237
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,088
Hector-You okay with this?

238
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,291
Yeah. Let's do it.

239
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,507
<i>[Man]
We're wired with omnidirectional mikes.</i>

240
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,509
<i>Wherever he goes, we got him.</i>

241
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,636
I need a jury to hear every word.

242
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,204
We're good, as long as no one
turns on a faucet or a radio.

243
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,876
<i>[Man On Radio] King 5, he's in the
lobby, heading for the elevators.</i>

244
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:49,580
<i>Two minutes out.
Copy that. King 5.</i>

245
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,590
<i>[Ravell]
Game time. He's on his way.</i>

246
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,593
<i>[Ortiz] I don't know about this,
man. You know, Shane's kind of smart.</i>

247
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,595
We got plenty of eyes on you, okay?

248
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,894
- Yeah, I just don't think it's gonna work.
- You mess it up, it's your ass.

249
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,333
So why don't you focus on that?
I'm out of here.

250
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,530
<i>[Radio Chatter]</i>

251
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,816
Here we go.

252
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,759
Shane, what's up, man? You were
supposed to call me two days ago.

253
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,098
Hey, I know.
I'm just laying low.

254
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,832
Who the hell's this? It's
cool, man. That's Hector.

255
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,534
<i>- Hector, meet Shane.
- Told you to come alone.</i>

256
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,873
Yeah, I know, but-
Just-

257
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,143
<i>What is wrong with you?
Yo. My boy got concerns.</i>

258
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,150
<i>I'm just here to make sure he gets
paid, man. [Ortiz] Yeah, man, that's it.</i>

259
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,448
Not that I don't trust you.

260
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,223
Nothin', nothin'. It's cool.
He's just checking it out.

261
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,286
<i>So listen, I did the kill.
Now where's my money?</i>

262
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,696
<i>I don't know what you're
talking about. Yeah, you do.</i>

263
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,861
That guy Peluso's dead
like you wanted.

264
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,235
He rushed it. He's not bitin'.

265
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,968
Think he figured us out?
Come on, Hector.

266
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,307
<i>Are you strapped? Hector
- Hey, man, can we cut this gangster crap out, please?</i>

267
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,643
Let's just settle our business.

268
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,879
<i>What the hell you doin',
man? You think I'm wired? Hey.</i>

269
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,817
Just pay him. Just-

270
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,749
<i>Police! Drop the gun!
Drop it! Drop it!</i>

271
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,259
Drop it!
Drop it!

272
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,659
Get down. Down.

273
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,832
You're 5,000 too short.

274
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,198
I want my lawyer.

275
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,534
Damn it.

276
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,576
We got nothing.

277
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,043
He's an ex-felon
with a concealed weapon.

278
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,709
The other thing is, Tracey-

279
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,082
Lucas didn't bring the money.

280
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,789
I know.

281
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,189
He only had a gun.

282
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,558
Jumped too soon on the arrest,
you know that?

283
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,101
Danielle Blair.
I'm representing Shane Lucas.

284
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,400
Serious crime. We're gonna have
him remanded at arraignment.

285
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,236
Your key witness is the person
responsible for the murder.

286
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,242
He'll testify that Lucas
paid him to do it.

287
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,744
You have no corroboration.
Your client has plenty of dirt on him.

288
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:33,445
Convictions for rape and assault
- He hasn't had so much as a speeding ticket in the last two years.

289
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,181
So he's a killer who drives
like my mother.

290
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,386
<i>[Lucas]
They can't tie me to the murder.</i>

291
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,021
At this point they're weak,

292
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,531
unless there is some way
to trace you to Peluso-

293
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,624
phone records, bank statements-

294
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,693
Nothin'. Kenny was paid cash.

295
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,035
Anyone see you together?

296
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,009
Some girls who will be hard
to track down. Them and Emil.

297
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,047
Ortiz will be easy to discredit.

298
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,344
Which leaves your arrest.

299
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,214
That sting- No.
I said nothing.

300
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:11,780
Only thing that jams me up
is my gun in that cop's face.

301
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,220
We'll call the sting entrapment.

302
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,890
You felt threatened
so you protected yourself.

303
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,525
Against your better judgment
you brought a gun.

304
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,669
So we're looking to beat this?

305
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,399
Kibre's good.

306
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,001
She'll look under every rock until she
finds something she can use against you.

307
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,602
When do I get out of here?

308
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,739
Your bail is one million dollars.

309
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,749
You own three apartment buildings.

310
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,012
The one in Greenpoint should cover it.

311
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,179
The other two you sign over to me.

312
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,519
My counsel isn't cheap.

313
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,521
I'll give you the building in Astoria.

314
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,532
The one in Williamsburg you get
when I walk out of court.

315
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,795
Like an incentive.

316
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,394
Fair enough.

317
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,710
You always look this good
when you visit a place like this?

318
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,178
I do for some clients.

319
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,309
Listen. Until we post bail,

320
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,855
expect the D.A. To be monitoring
your phone calls.

321
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,723
Be careful.
Like I've never been in here before.

322
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,886
I know how it works.

323
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,731
<i>[Buzzer Sounds]</i>

324
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,767
His name's Desmond McCarron.

325
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,736
Told the guard he had information
on Lucas. Got passed up.

326
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,068
We quietly pulled him
out of population this morning.

327
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,734
What's he in for?
Forging a Vicodin scrip.

328
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,243
Who's he run with?
He runs with anybody-

329
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,078
Brotherhood, Netas, you name it.
As long as he can score.

330
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:48,415
Every jailhouse snitch I ever met
was an addict looking for a break.

331
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,921
No. You help me, I help you.

332
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,923
That's not how it works,
Mr. McCarron.

333
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,051
You proffer the information,
I decide what it's worth.

334
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,590
<i>[Salazar] You've been in here
for three weeks with Shane Lucas.</i>

335
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,964
<i>What do you know?</i>

336
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,304
[Sighs]

337
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,968
I heard Lucas bragging about his case.

338
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,977
Keep goin'.

339
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,639
<i>He says he's gonna
skate, right?</i>

340
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:21,619
Except he's worried about some dude
talking to the cops.

341
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,555
He thinks this guy's
the only way he gets hung up.

342
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,889
- What's the guy's name?
- L-I don't remember his name.

343
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,397
- But the guy's a freak.
- What do you mean, "freak"?

344
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,695
Lucas said the guy bought
some of his pornos.

345
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,672
But, you know, like a repeat customer.

346
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,833
A pervert.
I mean, that's Lucas's thing, right?

347
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,680
<i>Did we pull the business records
when we searched Lucas's office? Yeah.</i>

348
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,081
All the videos go out mail order.

349
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,381
Guess we could run down
some names.

350
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,922
<i>[Gaffney] Mr. Phelps, I can
understand your embarrassment, but-</i>

351
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,487
I don't know anything about this
Shane Lucas person you mentioned.

352
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,432
We checked the phone records. We know
that you spoke to Lucas several times.

353
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,469
We have the dates.

354
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,471
He must have been confirming receipt
of some packages he sent.

355
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,666
Kenny Peluso called you too.

356
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,643
I'm not familiar with that name.

357
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:26,173
Mr. Peluso was recently murdered,
Mr. Phelps, we believe by Shane Lucas.

358
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,776
<i>A reliable informant says
you know why this went down.</i>

359
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,879
Which makes you a material witness.

360
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:35,825
- You can't be serious.
- Were they extorting money? Blackmailing you?

361
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,398
[Chuckles]

362
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,196
No. Nothing like that.

363
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,068
If I cooperate, uh,

364
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,135
will I have to go to jail?

365
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,180
Have you broken the law?

366
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,474
Oh, most certainly.

367
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,416
You'll see why Lucas was nervous
about Peluso talking to the police.

368
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,584
Phelps paid 50 grand for this-
cash.

369
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,356
So Peluso was the go-between
in the transaction?

370
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,421
Was he still a cop?

371
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,160
He had already left the police department
and was working a security job,

372
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,600
but he wasn't involved
in McCoy's case yet.

373
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,264
So it's all fitting
within the timeline of the shooting.

374
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,274
I cued it up toward the end.

375
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,158
[Screaming]

376
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,227
<i>[Gunshot]</i>

377
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,398
Oh, my God.

378
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,584
So you're sure
that this video is for real?

379
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,247
Our expert examined it.
He says it's legit.

380
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,655
And we're certain that Lucas
was behind it?

381
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,888
We have corroboration. Lucas had
Peluso killed to keep him quiet.

382
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,590
<i>So why aren't we indicting
for the murder of the girl too?</i>

383
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,100
<i>We don't have a body
- And we don't know where the crime was committed.</i>

384
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:26,660
And we can't prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that Lucas did the killing.

385
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,104
<i>So you think you can get it in
as a prior bad act?</i>

386
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,666
<i>It goes to motive, and we can
link it to both Peluso and Lucas.</i>

387
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,440
<i>You identify the girl?
[Gaffney] Stephanie Davis.</i>

388
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,950
She's on the books for drug possession and
prostitution. Been missing for six months.

389
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,577
Her mother's driving down today
from Ithaca.

390
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,351
Stephanie ran away when she was 16-

391
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,617
almost two years ago.

392
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,496
Her father had walked out on us
and I was...

393
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:58,229
pulling overtime just to cover
the mortgage.

394
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:02,069
Ms. Davis, what happened to your
daughter had nothing to do with you.

395
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,574
It's not your fault.

396
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,736
<i>She called...</i>

397
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,280
to say she wanted to come home.

398
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:15,082
That's when I found out
she was living with Lucas.

399
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,849
And she was on drugs.
I could tell.

400
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,325
<i>After a while I stopped expecting...</i>

401
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,827
to see her on the doorstep,
you know?

402
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,593
You're absolutely sure...

403
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,399
that it's her?

404
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:50,110
I called a few months ago,
looking for her.

405
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,087
I just felt like she needed me.

406
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,955
Lucas got on the phone...

407
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:04,229
and said that she was
never coming home again.

408
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,396
[Sobs]

409
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,074
And now I know,

410
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,143
because she's dead.

411
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,586
<i>So they're saying I had Peluso
killed over the tape.</i>

412
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,751
<i>It's strong evidence.</i>

413
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,796
If they'd had it at your arraignment,
you'd have never made bail.

414
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,032
You know, the girl-

415
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,735
Stephanie-

416
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,580
She gave the performance of her life.

417
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:04,728
I'm gonna fight to keep the tape out,
but I may not win.

418
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,730
<i>Phelps is gonna testify for them?</i>

419
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,790
He'll cut some kind of deal,
tie you and Peluso to the tape.

420
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,428
<i>Will they believe him?
They might.</i>

421
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,996
It's hard to make him look worse than he
does now, for buying a video like that.

422
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,804
So where does that leave me?

423
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,277
Probably looking at a conviction.

424
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,548
[Sighs]

425
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,176
You're honest.
I like that.

426
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,488
You watch the tape?

427
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,452
Wasn't really my thing.

428
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,495
Oh.

429
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,589
So what is your thing?

430
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:48,596
<i>It's Molineaux evidence that supports
motive in the murder of Kenneth Peluso.</i>

431
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,109
- It has clear probative value.
- The video tape is compelling, Ms. Blair.

432
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,702
<i>Compelling only
in its prejudicial value.</i>

433
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,045
How so? Miss Kibre's insinuating,
not proving, my client's culpability.

434
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:03,451
There's no proof he harmed the woman on
that tape, or even knew her, for that matter.

435
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,183
- Let the jury assess its value.
- It's bait and switch.

436
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,556
The murder depicted on that video has not met
any burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,

437
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,029
but the jury certainly will be judging
my client on that alleged crime.

438
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,862
Do you have someone that can tie
the defendant to the tape?

439
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,494
We do. We also have testimony stating...

440
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,232
that the defendant
had Mr. Peluso killed...

441
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,742
in order to silence him
about this woman's murder.

442
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,243
Ms. Blair, you'll have ample time
to cross examine the People's witness.

443
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,873
Your Honor
- I'll give limiting instructions, but I'm going to let the jury see it.

444
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,883
Video tape's in.

445
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,189
<i>[Ortiz] I knew Peluso usually came
home from work around 4:00 a. M,</i>

446
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,192
so I figured I'd get him then,

447
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,229
but I fell asleep in my car
and woke up at 8:00.

448
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,560
Thought I missed my shot.
And that's when you saw...

449
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,658
Mr. Peluso and Detective Green
come out of the house?

450
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,862
Yeah. Walked right up to Kenny
and shot him.

451
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,600
I had to shoot the other guy. I mean, he
saw my face. I didn't know he was a cop.

452
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,338
Why did the defendant
want Mr. Peluso killed?

453
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:04,178
Well, Lucas said Kenny knew about a murder he'd done
- Some girl.

454
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,241
When Lucas found out
he was talking to the cops-

455
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:10,048
<i>In fact, he was testifying in
another trial, an unrelated case.</i>

456
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,419
Did the defendant mention this to you?

457
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,050
<i>[Ortiz] Yeah, Lucas didn't know what
it was about. I mean, he was paranoid.</i>

458
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,027
<i>You know? He thought Kenny
might tell them about the murder.</i>

459
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,088
So he offered me 10 grand
to kill him.

460
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,770
Nothing further.

461
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,772
Why did you kill him?
I thought you and Mr. Peluso were friends.

462
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,577
<i>Friends? No. No, no, no.
He helped me out, I helped him out.</i>

463
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,916
Strictly business. Once he stopped being
a cop, he wasn't doing nothin' for me.

464
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,615
- So it was an easy decision?
- Objection.

465
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,783
<i>[Judge]
Sustained.</i>

466
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,557
What did you do with the money
Mr. Lucas allegedly paid you?

467
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,622
Spent it. He only paid half
of what he owed me.

468
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,501
So the money's gone, and we're just supposed
to take your word this payoff actually happened?

469
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,598
<i>Did you attempt to collect the rest
of the money you say you were owed?</i>

470
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,734
The cops set up a sting
to get Lucas to pay.

471
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,608
- They wanted to have it on tape.
- Objection.

472
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,413
<i>Sustained. Did Mr. Lucas pay
you the money for the murder?</i>

473
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,716
- No.
- Because he never actually hired you to kill Kenny Peluso.

474
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,756
<i>Objection.
Sustained.</i>

475
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,087
<i>[Blair]
No further questions.</i>

476
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,696
- [Screaming]
- [Gasps]

477
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,898
<i>[Gunshot]
[Gasps]</i>

478
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,411
Did the defendant tell you
where he'd obtained this video?

479
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,116
<i>He said he'd made the film himself.</i>

480
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,250
I was assured of its authenticity,

481
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,228
and I paid him quite well
for it- $50,000.

482
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,131
How was Kenneth Peluso involved?

483
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,900
<i>Mr. Peluso delivered the videotape
and I gave him the money,</i>

484
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,874
and that was the only time
I ever saw him.

485
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,678
Nothing further.

486
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,044
I think we've had enough for today.

487
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,016
Ms. Blair, you can cross-examine
this witness tomorrow.

488
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,591
<i>Get dressed. We're going out.</i>

489
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,684
Where?

490
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,752
Just do it.

491
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,923
It's 2:00 a.m.

492
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,733
You'll like it. I promise.

493
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,882
What are we doing here?

494

didn't kill Stephanie Davis-

660
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,748
<i>Yeah. She was just a messed up kid.</i>

661
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,590
- She helped us get Lucas.
- Better than rotting in potter's field.

662
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,893
<i>You gonna plead Lucas out this time?</i>

663
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,366
[Scoffs]
Not on your life.

664
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,199
Jury already let him walk once.

665
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,364
That's on me.

666
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,409
Well, you can't retry him
for killing Peluso again.

667
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,410
No.

668
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,878
But I can still make him
answer for it.

669
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,471
