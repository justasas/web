1
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,395
What? What is it?

2
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,700
It's not good enough.

3
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,104
It has to be good enough.

4
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,300
It is good! It is exactly the same!

5
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,076
I like the red one.

6
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,178
That one?

7
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,917
The pink one, the pink one!

8
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,754
All right, the pink one.

9
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,458
Listen, listen! Look, I'm the
expert, and I say the work is good.

10
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,162
Go get the car.

11
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,369
Thank you.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,535
Come on, little one.

13
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,305
Somebody stop him, please!

14
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,740
Tiananmen! Tiananmen!

15
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,276
Tiananmen!

16
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,317
So, who is she?

17
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,551
It doesn't matter.

18
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,321
She recognized you. We have to do something.

19
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,862
No one will listen to her. Just go!

20
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,106
Thank you for watching them.

21
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,231
You all right?

22
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,936
Yes, thank you. It was
someone I thought I knew.

23
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,186
It's me. I need to talk to you, okay?

24
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,679
We're all fine, John. Just call
me as soon as you hear this.

25
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,323
Come on, little ones. Everything's fine.

26
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,321
We're going home now. Come.

27
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,197
We'll go see Daddy. He'll make everything fine.

28
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,635
Mommy.

29
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,235
Mommy.

30
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:46,904
Mommy.

31
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,209
Mommy.

32
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,275
Mommy.

33
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,794
Her name's Annie Ming Littleton.

34
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,768
Two in the back, right in front of her kids.

35
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,862
The GSR pattern's tight.

36
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,430
The shooter couldn't have been
more than two feet away.

37
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,340
One of the witnesses clocked
the shots at 3:06.

38
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,540
She made a call at 2:56 to a
number programmed in her phone.

39
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,715
Someone named John.

40
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,683
Could be her husband, John Littleton.

41
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,414
He's over there with the kids.

42
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,978
He's hooked up with the Feds.

43
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,158
Yeah, his father is with
the Treasury Department.

44
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,626
That's why we got called in.

45
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,492
She'd been shopping.

46
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,734
I was in a meeting.

47
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,201
Annie wanted me to call her back right away.

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,398
She sounded upset,

49
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,067
but she said that she and the kids were fine.

50
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,109
Was she downtown for any special reason?

51
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,578
Just to shop.

52
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,581
Annie liked the energy in Chinatown.

53
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,341
It reminded her of home.

54
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,314
Beijing.

55
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,790
Pink's my favorite color.

56
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,449
Did Mommy buy this for you?

57
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,990
Before she called Daddy?

58
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,701
Where did she buy it?

59
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,033
At the store. Then Mommy ran away.

60
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,167
Do you know why she ran away?

61
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,637
No. She ran down the street. She was shouting.

62
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,813
And then she came back.

63
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,953
Mommy is sleeping now.

64
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:17,161
She say, "Fa pi chi saran."

65
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,124
Something like that. And then she run.

66
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,630
"Fa pi chi saran"? What does that mean?

67
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,732
I don't know. You know why?

68
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,704
She yelled in Mandarin.

69
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,573
And you speak Cantonese.

70
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,700
Yes.

71
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,572
Thanks.

72
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,139
That's her.

73
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,551
I told the officer that this
lady almost knocked me down.

74
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,586
She was shouting and chasing somebody.

75
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,245
Did you get a look at who it was?

76
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,448
No.

77
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,850
What was she shouting?

78
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,892
I didn't understand. Nobody understood.

79
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,189
And then she yelled in English, "Stop him."

80
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,888
And then she said, "Tiananmen."

81
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,124
"Tiananmen?"

82
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,257
Yeah, Tiananmen. Over and over.

83
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,667
"Tiananmen, Tiananmen." And
then people understood.

84
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,999
I'll bet they did.

85
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,142
I met Annie in Beijing in the spring of '92.

86
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,504
I had an internship with the State Department.

87
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,475
How did you meet?

88
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,949
She was...

89
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,815
She was a student.

90
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,957
How often do you go back to China?

91
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,855
Annie's parents still live in Beijing.

92
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,296
We try to go at least once a year.

93
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:31,097
How's your Mandarin? Must be pretty good.

94
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,663
It's all right.

95
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,636
What does "Fa pi chi saran" mean to you?

96
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,570
I don't know.

97
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,308
"Fa pi chi saran."

98
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,040
Your wife was yelling it
at the person she was chasing.

99
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,182
I don't know.

100
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,121
Mr. Littleton, we think you do know.

101
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,958
"Fa pi chi saran," it
means "screaming killer."

102
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,131
Doesn't it?

103
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,532
She was in Tiananmen.

104
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,500
Wasn't she?

105
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,474
She saw what happened there
in '89 to the students?

106
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,678
We're not allowed to talk about it.

107
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,080
Is that some kind of condition?

108
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,348
How she was allowed to leave China?

109
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,381
I'll never be able
to take my children back

110
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,790
if they know I talked.

111
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,556
It stays in this room, Mr. Littleton.

112
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,598
Annie told me that the PLA,

113
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,039
the People's Army,

114
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:49,414
just fired into crowds of unarmed students.

115
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,045
The ones they didn't kill right away,

116
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,347
they crushed under their tanks.

117
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,648
"Fa pi chi saran."

118
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,323
That's what the students
called one of the officers

119
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,120
because he was a screamer.

120
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,758
Screaming, "Shoot, shoot, shoot!"

121
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,570
A butcher.

122
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,470
Half the Chinese immigrants in New York City
served in the People's Liberation Army.

123
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,842
It's the Chinese army.

124
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,246
It's compulsory military service.

125
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,251
It's not exactly illegal.

126
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,652
This character was an officer
during the massacre of students,

127
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,554
the State Department doesn't
keep records of folks like that?

128
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,684
Neither we nor the Chinese government

129
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,423
consider what the PLA did to be illegal.

130
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,633
I deplore Ms. Littleton's death,

131
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,726
I hope you find her killer,

132
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,362
but I'm sorry, I can't help you.

133
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,132
You already have.

134
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,940
He was helpful to you?

135
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,071
Yes.

136
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,475
If it's not illegal to be a screaming
butcher in Tiananmen Square,

137
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
then why did our guy run?

138
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,983
It's just a few more days, Lucille.

139
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,355
They've cleared the border.

140
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,985
I mean, isn't that right, Pang?

141
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,530
It's just that it's never
been like this before, Stuart.

142
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,065
You know it hasn't. Liam, tell him.

143
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,901
It's the papers we're concerned about.

144
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,433
The papers are fine.

145
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,606
It's just that it's so much money.

146
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,043
And then there's all this mystery.

147
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,373
What are you saying, Lucille?

148
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,143
I'm saying I'm uncomfortable.

149
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,150
The price stands.

150
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,525
Would you excuse us for just a minute?

151
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,392
I can't...

152
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,401
If we just offer her a slight discount.

153
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,459
I see how you handle things.

154
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,937
Every unhappy woman terrifies you.

155
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,335
The price stands.

156
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,281
She stand right there, looking at the vests.

157
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,148
What was she doing when she saw him?

158
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,990
She pay for the vest.

159
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,119
She put change in her purse.

160
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,686
Was she holding her purse? Did
she have it on her shoulder?

161
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,288
On her shoulder. Here.

162
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,460
So she would have turned this
way to put her change away.

163
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,737
So right here she said, "Fa pi chi saran"?

164
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,934
Yes.

165
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,945
That's when she saw him.

166
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,279
Across the street.

167
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,715
Yes. She run across the street.

168
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,681
She was sure it was the right guy?
She got a good look at him?

169
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,585
Full face, not in profile?

170
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,420
He wasn't just walking by.

171
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,275
No, he came out of the doorway.

172
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,080
The windows, the second floor.

173
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,512
The old man move in 3 weeks ago.

174
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,525
Looks like this old man already moved out.

175
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,651
He sign a lease?

176
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,887
No, no lease.

177
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,952
He paid cash. Two months in advance.

178
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,396
He ever have visitors?

179
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,490
Good-looking young guy. Chinese.

180
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,331
Sometimes he's with a white guy,

181
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,166
not so good-looking.

182
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,804
That's all I know.

183
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,171
How about yesterday afternoon, 3:00?

184
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,039
Yeah, they both here.

185
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,572
Eames.

186
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,082
Aha. Illegal baking.

187
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,543
Baking documents.

188
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,119
The old man's a forger.

189
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,688
Forging what? Passports?

190
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,917
Something worth more than passports.

191
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,365
Something worth a life.

192
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,704
This good-looking guy killed Ms. Littleton

193
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,241
because he was worried about
getting hooked up to fake ID's?

194
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,073
He was probably worried about
another kind of document.

195
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,379
Now, what am I looking at?
A Chinese jigsaw puzzle?

196
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,749
The lab says it's standard 30
weight, good quality rag paper.

197
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,680
But it's been aged.

198
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,383
Soaked in tea and mineral oil and then baked.

199
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,153
This bit of red is wax.

200
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,888
Probably to imitate an official seal or stamp.

201
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,987
But that's not the most interesting part.

202
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,226
This type of calligraphy,
the elongated character,

203
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,098
the sharp brush strokes,

204
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,161
is in the Imperial style of early
Qing Dynasty, 18th century.

205
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,106
It evolved from the "thin gold" calligraphy

206
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,336
developed by the Emperor Huizong.

207
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,811
He got that off his box
of Wheaties this morning.

208
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,479
Actually, the curator of the
Chinese galleries at the Met.

209
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,143
I faxed him a copy of it.

210
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,379
This curator have an idea
who might've written this?

211
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,858
Calligraphy is one of the great
achievement of the Chinese people.

212
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,522
But our children

213
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,925
do not study it.

214
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,161
They told us at the Met

215
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,830
you were the best practitioner
of it on the East Coast.

216
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,236
Thank you.

217
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,108
Is this really that hard to do?

218
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,576
Because it doesn't look that hard.

219
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,739
Do you think that I could

220
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,146
pick it up?

221
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,946
If you study hard, sure.

222
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,782
Which is the easiest style?

223
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,378
Is it this one?

224
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,582
That's Han Confucian form of style.
Very old. Not so easy.

225
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,389
I like this.

226
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,225
Do a lot of people write in this style?

227
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,765
Yeah, the Flowing Grass style.

228
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,165
I know maybe 10 people who are very good.

229
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,570
And this one?

230
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,101
How many people here have mastered this one?

231
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:56,136
Not many. The Imperial Classic style.
The most difficult.

232
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,213
But you've mastered it?

233
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,374
Yes.

234
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,614
And you know everyone that has.

235
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,514
For example,

236
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,793
do you know what person did this?

237
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,167
I don't know who did it.

238
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,769
Maybe it's the same person
who did this scroll.

239
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,238
No. I did this.

240
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:28,234
Every stroke has the
personality of the writer.

241
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,113
His energy and vitality.

242
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,582
An expert could compare the two

243
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,823
and find that they were done
by the same person.

244
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,416
And that expert

245
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,193
could trace the writing

246
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,763
to the brush that you used.

247
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,964
We need to know who hired
you to do this, Mr. Hsu.

248
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,711
I don't know his name.

249
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,373
But he know my nephew's name in Ningpo.

250
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,272
I can't say no.

251
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,817
This man is PLA.

252
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,684
What did he have you write?

253
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,686
"The Court of Emperor Qianlong

254
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:24,062
"welcomes esteemed guest Lord Pembridge

255
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,896
"and request that he accept this gift

256
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,504
"from the Imperial Bronze Collection."

257
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,574
Did he say what it was for?

258
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,774
No explanation.

259
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,611
Just write and take it
to the Hotel St. Francis

260
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,278
and leave it at the desk for room 516.

261
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,054
Room 516? That would be Mr. Pembridge's room.

262
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,250
Mr. Pembridge?

263
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,317
Actually, he calls himself
the Fifth Lord Pembridge.

264
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,095
Would he be in his room?

265
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,789
I just saw him a couple of minutes ago

266
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,423
heading for the sundry store.

267
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,764
He has an ascot. You can't miss him.

268
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,178
Lord Pembridge?

269
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,475
Could we speak to you for a minute?

270
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,747
Well...

271
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,110
Dear, I don't know what for.

272
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,623
It's about some packages
that were delivered to you.

273
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,853
Packages? I wouldn't know
anything about packages.

274
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,558
Where are you from, Lord Pembridge?

275
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,292
From? Ah, my family's estate

276
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,561
is just outside a little town called Leeds.

277
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,494
A little town called Leeds?

278
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,504
And what's the purpose of your visit here?

279
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,597
- Pleasure. And friends.
- What friends?

280
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,642
Oh, well, I just had a dinner
from Mick and the boys.

281
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,177
Sent them off on their world tour.

282
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,837
And then I saw Gwynnie and Hugh.

283
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,938
Lovely people, just lovely.

284
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,677
Cut it out.

285
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,810
Isn't that the worst English
accent you've ever heard?

286
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,356
Next to the Irish Spring guy,
it's the worst accent, period.

287
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,446
I beg your pardon.

288
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,050
The mishmash of Cockney, Welsh.

289
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,623
But miraculously, I think I heard
a shred of the north of England

290
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,823
in one of your "R's."

291
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,026
There are so many sounds in
there, how can you tell?

292
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,762
Really, you are absurd.

293
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,138
I don't think he's trained.

294
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,470
Well, of course I'm trained.
With Strasberg himself.

295
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,942
I suppose you went to Yale.
Now, are we gonna play this or what?

296
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,945
No, we're gonna play this.

297
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,243
Is that a real gun?

298
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,512
Oh, my God, you're really cops, aren't you?

299
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,278
"George Weems."

300
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,023
What it says here on your SAG card.

301
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,725
You look familiar.

302
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:33,196
My last gig. I was the plump and happy
raisin in a snack food commercial.

303
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,291
Am I in trouble?

304
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,697
You tell us.

305
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,359
You checked into a hotel
under an assumed name.

306
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,769
Forged papers were delivered to your room.

307
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,297
An associate of yours is
suspected of murdering a woman.

308
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,243
You don't look so plump and happy now, George.

309
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,442
No, I didn't know anything
about a murder. I...

310
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,711
I was just hired to play a part, that's all.

311
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,081
Hired by whom?

312
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,644
I don't know. I never met
the guy. He called me.

313
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,817
He said his name was Jean.

314
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,416
That he saw me in this
Gilbert and Sullivan thing,

315
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,189
and that he wanted me to play some
Brit Eurotrash, Lord Pembridge.

316
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,924
For what? A movie?

317
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,865
Performance art. Improvisational.

318
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,226
Who were the other actors?

319
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,167
I don't know. I was meeting them today.

320
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,102
Where was this performance to take place?

321
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,299
In real settings.

322
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,205
They were picking me up
and driving out to JFK,

323
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,504
and it was gonna go from there.

324
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,772
Jean said they had a room
for me at the St. Francis.

325
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,973
That if anybody asked,
I was Lord Pembridge.

326
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,941
And you thought that we were
part of the performance.

327
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,144
Yes.

328
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,515
It never occurred to you that
something illegal was afoot?

329
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,393
I'm an actor. I'm constantly broke.

330
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,159
It was a couple of nights at the St.
Francis. It sounded like fun.

331
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,158
Fantastic.

332
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,728
What was the scene at JFK?

333
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,407
Lord Pembridge picks up a piece
of art from the cargo department.

334
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,842
A family heirloom.

335
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,878
That's it? One scene?

336
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,141
No, no, there were two scenes.

337
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,705
Lord Pembridge delivers the heirloom

338
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,546
to some posh apartment on Fifth Avenue.

339
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:05,881
Here it is.

340
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,549
One crate, household items.

341
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,092
Consignee, Lord Robert Pembridge.

342
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,388
He picked it up this morning.

343
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,519
This morning?

344
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,325
Yeah, this morning.

345
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,489
- Did he show ID?
- Yes.

346
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,625
And he had the waybill. It was all in order.

347
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,102
I don't need any more grief about this.

348
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,900
What other grief did you get?

349
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,575
Two guys came in a couple of hours ago.

350
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,507
I told them Pembridge already picked it up,

351
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,670
and I thought they were
gonna have a heart attack.

352
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,940
Especially that white guy.

353
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,913
- And the other guy?
- Chinese.

354
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,180
But then they said they must've gotten
their signals crossed with Lord Pembridge,

355
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,276
and they left.

356
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,352
This extra charge, what's that?

357
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,325
A re-crating charge slapped
on by the freight forwarder.

358
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,089
It says the amount was charged
to an existing account.

359
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,030
The freight forwarder can tell
you whose account that is.

360
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,361
I'm deadly serious. I need
an answer right away.

361
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,831
Someone's here. Let me get rid of them.

362
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,169
Are you Stuart Gaston?

363
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,739
Yes. I'm sorry, I'm very busy right now.

364
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,546
Too busy for us?

365
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,314
I have a kind of a situation.
How can I help you?

366
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,880
Your account number turned up on the
waybill for a shipment from Hong Kong

367
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,448
addressed to a Lord Pembridge.

368
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,960
Oh. I don't see how that's possible.

369
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,394
I don't know any Lord Pembridge.

370
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,988
Do you have a copy of the waybill?

371
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,157
Thanks.

372
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,394
Yeah, I do have an account with this company,

373
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,267
but I certainly didn't ship
any household items.

374
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,237
They must've jumbled the numbers.

375
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,503
This must be some kind of
situation you got on your hands.

376
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,542
Why do you say that?

377
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,046
Well, you've loosened your tie,
you got a drink on your desk,

378
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,846
you got three phone lines blinking,

379
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,683
and you're chewing the inside of your
cheeks like some kind of frantic chipmunk.

380
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,020
Are you under a lot of stress?

381
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,661
You lost something.

382
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,997
No. I don't know...

383
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,766
No, I think you lost something
in transit, didn't you?

384
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,575
I'm sorry, you're wrong.

385
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,804
It's late and I need to close up.

386
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,079
Thank you for bringing that
billing mistake to my attention.

387
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,256
He smuggled that piece into the country,

388
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,348
and someone stole it right
out from under his nose.

389
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,756
Don't look so happy.

390
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,924
The obvious move is that Stuart
Gaston's Chinese partner

391
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,194
had an accomplice pick up
the package on the sly.

392
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,896
Well, that's all fine and good, but
we have no leverage against Gaston

393
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,063
to make him give up his Chinese partner.

394
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,765
No evidence he's involved in smuggling,

395
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,536
no idea even what it is he's smuggling.

396
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,474
It's a Chinese antique. A bronze.

397
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,978
- A fake?
- No.

398
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:46,538
If it were, they wouldn't go through all
this trouble to smuggle it into the country.

399
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,677
What's being faked is the
documentation, the provenance.

400
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,346
Because it's probably stolen.

401
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,548
Have you checked with Interpol?

402
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,251
They have no record of any
theft of major Chinese art.

403
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,453
That leaves one possibility.

404
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,921
That it was stolen from an
archeological dig in China.

405
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,896
A Chinese national treasure, and
Gaston found a buyer for it.

406
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,668
We find that buyer, maybe we find
evidence against Mr. Gaston.

407
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:15,074
Well, I'd guess that the piece
in question dates from the Han Dynasty,

408
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,340
First century AD.

409
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,143
It's most likely a funereal piece.

410
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,547
Why would you think that?

411
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,676
Well, of all the bronzes,
it would be the most valuable.

412
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,879
Otherwise, why go to all the trouble?

413
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:28,119
No, a rare and important and legal
piece can fetch easily $1.5 million.

414
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,387
$3 million, if it's a smuggled piece.

415
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,326
But that's a risky business.

416
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,359
You know all the collectors

417
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,493
that Stuart Gaston usually deals with.

418
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,897
Which one would risk it?

419
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,101
For a special piece?

420
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,804
Most of them would take the risk,
otherwise they wouldn't be collectors.

421
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,337
How about just the ones who can afford
to lay out $3 million in cash?

422
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,814
I'd be hard pressed to say.

423
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,583
Are any of the collectors holding off?

424
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,245
- Careful.
- Oh, sorry.

425
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,280
You know, holding off making
acquisitions? Building up a cash reserve?

426
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,089
Well, I can't speak for every auction house.

427
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,457
Come on.

428
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,224
We know you compare notes.

429
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,392
Why don't we take this outside?

430
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,233
I'd be happy to get you both a cup of coffee.

431
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,704
There's a café. We could talk about it...

432
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,777
I'll bet you this camel

433
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:25,048
that you all know who's buying and who's not.

434
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,983
You think about that.

435
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,854
I'm gonna have a look at the other,

436
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,391
you know, lovely stuff that you...

437
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,451
No, wait. You know, there is Lucille Mobray.

438
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,758
She's one of Gaston's regulars.

439
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:47,327
I haven't purchased anything recently
because I haven't seen anything worth buying.

440
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,729
This moon vase is stunning.

441
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:56,305
I've read about the Imperial
ceramic factory in Jingdezhen.

442
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,445
Was it made there?

443
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:02,213
Yes. It's from the collection
of Pere D'Entrecolles himself.

444
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,980
I love this teapot.

445
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,490
Is it old?

446
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,782
3,000 years old.

447
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,419
How'd you get interested in Chinese art?

448
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,294
I lived in Shanghai when I was a girl.

449
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,558
My father worked for the National City Bank.

450
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,367
He gave me my first piece, a terracotta doll.

451
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,209
It was a magical time.

452
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,107
This collection,

453
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,146
it's your legacy.

454
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,581
Stuart Gaston help you put it together?

455
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,056
Yes. I've always relied on Stuart.

456
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,085
He made sure that each piece
had the proper provenance,

457
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,290
to show that it wasn't, you know,
smuggled out of China yesterday.

458
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,834
Of course.

459
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,907
Because owning smuggled art is a violation
of the National Stolen Property Act.

460
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,500
The Chinese could go to
court and have it seized.

461
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,544
That's perfectly true. But what
does that have to do with me?

462
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,513
It has to do with Mr. Gaston.

463
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,882
We suspect he smuggled something into
the country a couple of days ago.

464
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,946
Stuart?

465
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,422
No, I don't think he's capable
of anything like that.

466
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:16,386
No, see, he's capable of it, and a lot more.

467
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:20,020
And once we arrest him, he's liable
to make all kinds of accusations,

468
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,826
just to save his skin.

469
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,357
Someone's entire collection
could come under suspicion.

470
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,562
A whole legacy tainted.

471
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,106
I mean, no reputable dealer or auction house

472
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,142
is gonna do business with a person like that.

473
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,574
No more acquisitions.

474
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:38,547
Of course, it's possible such a
person was being duped by Mr. Gaston.

475
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,515
We are discreet with innocent victims.

476
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,585
If they behave like innocent victims.

477
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,567
Stuart told me he had an exceptional piece

478
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,533
From the Lord Pembridge estate.

479
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:05,734
He assured me the provenance
was well documented.

480
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,870
What's the piece?

481
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,075
All he told me was that it was a
bronze from an Eastern Han tomb.

482
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,950
He said that the Fifth Lord Pembridge

483
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,852
was bringing it himself from Hong Kong.

484
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,593
Gaston has a Chinese associate?

485
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,886
You must mean Pang.

486
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,725
A very crude individual.

487
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,797
You know where we can find him?

488
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:32,995
Yes.

489
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,269
Stuart told me where he works.

490
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,102
You'll never guess.

491
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,984
Hey! They're gonna charge you for that.

492
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,257
Bad day, Mr. Pang?

493
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,365
What a good soldier. He
knows when to surrender.

494
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,872
One down, one to go.

495
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,809
Where's this contraband my
client's accused of smuggling?

496
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,204
Is there even a photograph?

497
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:21,480
What we have is what we
found in his gallery.

498
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:29,191
Forged documents attesting to
the object's phony provenance.

499
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,261
It's just paper and ink.

500
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,659
Novelties.

501
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,823
Yeah, well, these "novelties"

502
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,262
match materials we found in an apartment

503
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,203
across the street from where
this woman was killed.

504
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,138
Killed because she recognized
your partner, Mr. Pang.

505
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,615
Also known to his admirers as the
Screaming Butcher of Tiananmen Square.

506
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,913
Oh, you didn't know that?

507
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:07,425
Oh, sorry. I didn't know you were in here.

508
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,406
Mr. Houghton,

509
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,708
say hello to your client's business partner,

510
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,706
Pang Chiangji.

511
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,982
We'll be next door.

512
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,303
My client might have a statement to make.

513
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,167
(ON TAPE) He shot that woman.

514
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,271
She recognized him. He
went back and killed her.

515
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,476
I didn't even know that he did it until
it was in the newspaper the next day.

516
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,042
He killed her. He double-crossed me.

517
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,381
I should never have trusted him.

518
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,447
So ends another beautiful friendship.

519
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,551
This being the land of
second chances, Mr. Pang,

520
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,063
you do get to tell your side of the story.

521
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,871
My friend, an officer in the PLA,

522
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,834
he wrote to me.

523
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,777
He works on an excavation in the Gobi Desert.

524
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,080
He said if we can get a piece out,

525
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,513
people pay millions for it here.

526
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,720
Two years it took us to get it out.

527
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,419
I'm dishwasher here.

528
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,790
Gaston the pig takes my future,

529
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,727
and now I have nothing.

530
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,129
I go back to China, they kill me.

531
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,265
What do I have here?

532
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,868
(ON TAPE) I did not shoot this woman.

533
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,170
She recognized me. So, so what?

534
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,768
I told him nobody cares,

535
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,012
but he wanted me to do something.

536
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,175
So I left. I went home.

537
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,775
But I didn't...

538
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,916
He's like a crocodile,

539
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,480
lying in the water pretending
he's a big lump of nothing.

540
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,524
But then he shoots this woman in the back.

541
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,926
He steals from me. It's all lies.

542
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,390
I didn't shoot that woman.

543
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,330
I don't even own a gun.

544
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,800
There's no evidence Mr. Pang does either.

545
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,497
Nor is there any evidence he stole the object.

546
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,473
Why would I steal it from him, a killer?

547
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,239
What do you think, I'm crazy?

548
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,876
Maybe you thought you could pull a
fast one on some poor dishwasher.

549
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,348
Poor dishwasher?

550
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,548
What, Pang? No, he owns
a factory in Hong Kong.

551
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,657
You know this for a fact?

552
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:56,561
No. But why would I ever get
into business with a dishwasher?

553
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,335
We searched the dump he lives in.

554
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,776
He owns two suits, two pairs
of shoes, and a clock radio.

555
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,006
No factory.

556
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,345
Evidently Mr. Gaston never checked
his client's employment record.

557
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,781
But someone else did.

558
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:21,051
Now, tell me where you're going,
Liam, in case I need to find you.

559
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:24,219
I'm not terribly interested in
being found right now, Lucille.

560
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,194
I'm not liking what I'm
hearing about these police.

561
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,290
No, no, no. They think poor Stuart
and that Mr. Pang did everything.

562
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,732
It's perfectly safe.

563
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,930
I'll make my own decisions
on that, if you don't mind.

564
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,806
You went above and beyond this
time, Liam. I do appreciate that.

565
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,981
I might try to get up into Bhutan.

566
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,679
See what I might catch coming out of Tibet.

567
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,880
Oh, that sounds so exciting.

568
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,354
I'll keep you in mind.

569
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,025
Goodbye, Liam. And thank you.

570
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,836
Lucille Mobray a murderer?

571
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:13,502
My God, Carver, this is a 73-year-old
woman we're talking about.

572
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:18,241
A very rich 73-year-old woman who can get
anything she wants done for a price.

573
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,408
And that's your probable cause? She's rich?

574
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,418
She knew where Mr. Pang worked.

575
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,512
The only way she could have known
was by having him followed.

576
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,752
Look, this search warrant application
can't even describe this, this, this...

577
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,624
What is this, a rice steamer?

578
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,057
You want me to sign this, you
put some meat on the plate.

579
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,600
Can we give the man what he wants?

580
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,262
Maybe Lucille Mobray can.

581
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,634
Given the right performance,

582
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,543
by the right performer.

583
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,414
For heaven's sake, sit down.

584
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,682
I was just being polite.

585
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,923
You make some vague threat on the phone,
and now you're being polite? Please.

586
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,966
You said you had something to
show me. Let's get on with it.

587
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,197
This is the documentation for the...

588
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,398
I know what it is. What are you doing with it?

589
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,668
It was delivered to my
room at the St. Francis.

590
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,142
I'm the person who was supposed
to deliver the object to you.

591
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,303
You?

592
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,074
The Fifth Lord of Pembridge.

593
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:28,106
This magnificent object has been
in my family for 300 years.

594
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,211
I see. Stuart thought that
accent would fool me?

595
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,984
It's a perfectly acceptable
English music hall accent.

596
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,856
What makes you think I'd want this?

597
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,054
I did some research.

598
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,391
The Chinese are very paranoid

599
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,160
about people stealing national
treasures. They're very litigious.

600
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,064
So I thought this might come in useful.

601
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,796
You expect me to pay for this?

602
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,132
Did you know that the Chinese
consulate's not very far from here,

603
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,469
on 42nd Street?

604
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,203
I just learned that in my research.

605
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,869
Did you bring your checkbook?

606
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,579
Write a check out to cash.

607
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,752
What amount?

608
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,149
$10,000.

609
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,957
My grandchildren are waiting for me.

610
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,562
Have a nice existence.

611
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:23,563
Frankie, be careful. You don't wanna spill it.

612
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,040
I want to play with my fire truck.

613
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,268
That's fine, sweetheart, but
you've just got to be careful.

614
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,509
Hello, Ms. Mobray.

615
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,643
That's a cool fire truck.

616
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,448
My grandma bought it for me.

617
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,115
Grandma got me a carriage with two horses,

618
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,851
but I had to leave it at home.

619
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:47,196
The privileges of being a grandmother.
You're allowed to spoil them a little bit.

620
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,595
Excuse me.

621
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,530
I see that you've spread your
generosity around a lot lately.

622
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,597
Look what we have here. Forged documents.

623
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:01,604
Why in the world would you spend so
much money for forged documents?

624
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,509
I thought it would be fun to have them.

625
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:07,539
We think it would be fun if you accompanied
these gentlemen down to our offices.

626
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,319
Everything here is listed
on her insurance declaration.

627
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,592
Same story with the
items at her storage vault.

628
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,327
Piece isn't here.

629
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,963
The doorman says a Liam Montgomery

630
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:30,666
visited Ms. Mobray a number of
times in the last few weeks.

631
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,735
It so happens

632
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,072
there was a Liam Montgomery
registered at the St. Francis

633
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,703
around the same time as Lord Pembridge.

634
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,408
Probably the guy she had keeping
tabs on all the players.

635
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,179
In other news, the Captain wants
to know what we've turned up here.

636
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,220
Squat, that's what we turned up.

637
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,185
These books and catalogs of Chinese bronzes,

638
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,317
I want Latent to go through them,

639
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,225
page by page.

640
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,063
On these pages we have a partial thumb,

641
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,730
index, partial palm, here, here and here.

642
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,375
She spent a lot of time looking at these.

643
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,533
How fresh are these prints?

644
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,513
Well, the oils are still viscous.
A couple, three days.

645
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,703
And that one.

646
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,732
It's beautiful.

647
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,571
"A heavenly horse
with a flame-shaped forelock.

648
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,343
"Bronze horses are extremely rare."

649
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,016
We need another search warrant.

650
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,522
Wonderful. Another gray room.

651
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,788
Please have a seat.

652
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,830
Liam Montgomery. Do you know him?

653
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,177
He runs an art consulting
business out of London.

654
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:21,283
Your doorman said he's made periodic
visits over the last seven years.

655
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:24,010
Yes, he's helped me. I'm an old woman.

656
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,579
I'm easy pickings for the
like of Gaston and Pang.

657
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,319
I need to protect myself.

658
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,195
And your acquisitions.

659
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:38,359
Which he seems uniquely qualified to do.

660
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,870
He has some kind of police record in Britain.

661
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,638
If you have questions about Mr.
Montgomery, ask Mr. Montgomery.

662
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,543
He's left the country. He got the job done.

663
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,871
But he made your dream come true.

664
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,884
What is this, a toy?

665
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,518
Not a toy.

666
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,688
Your granddaughter was sorry to see it go.

667
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,430
Detective, please, please.
This is irreplaceable.

668
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,661
Lucille.

669
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,965
Have you ever seen anything so exquisite?

670
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,540
To think it was made
during the time of Christ.

671
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:23,278
I'm prepared to be conciliatory
in view of your client's age.

672
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,816
You knew what it was
before you actually saw it?

673
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,043
Yes.

674
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:35,791
Liam bribed someone in Hong
Kong and snuck a peek.

675
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,022
He sent me a photograph.

676
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,926
Lucille, please. Oh, enough
of the charade, Harry.

677
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,794
They're making us an offer.

678
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,528
Six months in a minimum security prison.

679
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,765
A fine. A substantial fine.

680
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,202
We'll take it, Harry.

681
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,274
It's just... To have owned it
even for such a short time.

682
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,781
Even just to look at it.

683
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,477
The contours, the workmanship.

684
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,655
It's so precious.

685
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,089
There were...

686
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,996
There were two little men in the carriage?

687
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,431
Yes, there were. Where's the other one?

688
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,474
Well, maybe they're in here.

689
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,077
Oh, look at this. It's Gaston and Pang.

690
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,013
They were in Chinatown.

691
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,942
Gaston. You know, Pang.

692
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,718
Someone else I forgot. Oh, let's see.

693
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,051
Annie Littleton.

694
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,025
She was in Chinatown, too.

695
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,309
And she saw Pang, and she
screamed, "Tiananmen, Tiananmen!"

696
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,608
Detective, please, please.

697
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,272
Then it looked like trouble.

698
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,908
Oh, yes.

699
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,246
Oh!

700
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,753
There looked like there was gonna be trouble.

701
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,118
But don't you worry.

702
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,651
Don't you worry.

703
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,755
Liam Montgomery.

704
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,334
'Cause he has his eye on things.

705
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:33,204
He told you there was
trouble, and he called you.

706
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,107
"There's trouble, Mrs. Mobray."

707
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,641
And you said, "Take care of it," and he did.

708
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,310
And bang, bang, Annie Littleton.

709
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,883
No, I did no such thing.

710
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,893
But... But then, all hell broke loose,

711
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,657
and Gaston and Pang, they were fighting.

712
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,457
Pang wanted it, Gaston
wanted it, Pang wanted it...

713
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,127
Stop it! This is not a joke.

714
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,296
These are precious, precious artifacts.

715
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,668
They're priceless, in fact.

716
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,071
Priceless?

717
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,341
And that's why you had him
kill Annie Littleton.

718
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,433
No.

719
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,742
Never mind that she had two kids.

720
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:16,110
Oh, they can get along fine
without their mother. Why not?

721
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,114
You did.

722
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,452
After your parents were killed.

723
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,160
After the Japanese bombed Shanghai.

724
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,957
There you are. Little Lucy
and her loving parents.

725
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,194
Living an enchanted life.

726
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,602
And there's your handsome father,

727
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,837
who, every day, brought you a new treasure.

728
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,045
"Here, Lucy.

729
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:51,776
"Here's a beautiful terracotta
doll for my most special girl."

730
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,596
Those were the happiest days of your life.

731
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,033
Then they were finished by a bomb burst.

732
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,642
But this toy, it takes you back.

733
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,945
And that's what makes it priceless.

734
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:21,380
'Cause you would do anything to
get back to that magical time.

735
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:28,583
And, well, Annie Littleton
just got in your way?

736
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,721
She...

737
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,698
She was going to ruin everything.

738
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,600
I just had to have it!

739
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,323
Chinese should be happy to get that back.

740
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,426
It's the only one of its kind.

741
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:16,131
Annie Ming Littleton was one of a kind.
