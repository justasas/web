<i>We responded to a panic button.

bodies in there. Okay. Let's go! Come on.

13
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,793
I see three hit.
No sign of the shooter.

Sir, do you work here?
I'm the manager.

17
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,728
- How many shooters were there?
- One.

18
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,069
- Which way did he exit?
- He didn't.

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,842
I did it.

20
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,781
I shot them.

21
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,143
I think she's dead.

22
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,644
The bank has a prescribed procedure,
a plan I was supposed to follow,

23
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,683
but I froze.

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,719
I did nothing while he fired.

25
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:38,155
I saw those people fall.
I'll never forget that.

26
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,887
Was Mr. Soin holding the gun
when you first saw him?

27
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,397
<i>I heard a shot. I just ran.</i>

28
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:50,368
It was as if something had grabbed me
by the arm and hurled me to the floor.

29
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,870
<i>I was lying there. I saw him.</i>

30
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,635
He shot another person.

31
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,767
I thought-

32
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,813
It was the wrong thing to think,
but I thought,

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,781
thank God he's not
shooting at me again.

34
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,784
That's it.

00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,758

<i>Docket number 394405,

Charge is murder in the second degree
and assault with intent to murder.

47
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,730
- Can I say something?
- Sure. " Guilty" or " not guilty.' '

48
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:56,826
This is an injustice. I called the police
switchboard and I told them I had a gun.

49
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,894
From my home I called them.

50
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,840
Mr. Guzman, does your client need
a psychological evaluation?

51
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,104
<i>I don't believe so, Your Honor.
I'm not crazy.</i>

52
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:10,309
<i>I'm t-telling you what happened.
I called, and they hung up on me.</i>

53
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,011
<i>I waited for an hour.
No one came.</i>

54
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,987
Keep this up,
you're not making bail.

55
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,751
<i>I'm not guilty.

<i>Save it.</i>

59

Due to the gravity of these charges
and the strength of the evidence,

60
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:35,999
the defendant is remanded to the Department
of Correction without bail and on a short date.

61
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,238

- I'll look into the phone call.

<i>[Judge] Mr. Spivak, how do you

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,349
Sleep. It's a perk
of private practice.

66
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:56,828
You planning to run with this alleged
phone call? If you got it, flaunt it.

67
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,364
She still using that one?
All the time.

68
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,662
Trying to make me feel dated?
Did it work?

69
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,668
You wish.

70
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:09,040
<i>Lfhis attorney has any sense, there'll be a message
waiting on my voice mail when I get back to my office.</i>

71
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,406
I wouldn't offer a plea
even if there was interest.

72
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:16,346
<i>Man gets up from his desk,
opens fire in front of five video cameras.</i>

73
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,750
Why would you want to make a deal
on a case you can win so easily at trial?

74
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,550
I hear Guzman has this one.
How's he doing?

75
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,057
You can still take his word
to the bank.

76
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,993
Word has it that all he has
is this supposed phone call.

77
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,861
It is the only thing
that could muddy the waters.

78
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:38,495
But if Soin really did call for help, wouldn't
there be a recording of the conversation?

79
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,698
Only 911 records incoming calls.

80
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,209
The police switchboards don't, and
that's who he's claimed to have called.

81
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,542
Well, don't let this become
a game of operator.

82
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,606
<i>Verify that they never received
Soin's call and put him away.</i>

83
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,451
<i>Are they gonna turn over the phone records
so we can prove I made the call?</i>

84
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,289
That'll be part
of the discovery process.

85
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,296
What does that mean?

86
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,356
There are certain things the prosecution
is required to hand over before trial.

87
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,800
- We should have it in a few weeks.
- That's a long time, isn't it?

88
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,306
Andrew, I think it's in
your best interest to let me-

89
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,241
Could we keep this formal?
Excuse me?

90
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,768
I call you Mr. Guzman.
Fine.

91
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,308
Mr. Soin.
Is the operator going to testify?

92
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,319
If need be,
we can get a subpoena.

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,719
How do we do that?
Mr. Soin, please.

94
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,952
Why don't you let me worry
about the logistics.

95
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,222
We can draw up a motion
and file it with the clerk's office.

96
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,763
Now, about a plea.

97
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,665
The D.A.' s gonna want to milk this.
It's a clear win for them.

98
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,396
But-We're not finished here.

99
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,961
You seem to have
your whole case worked out.

100
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,406
<i>I'm not gonna set up a negotiation
if you won't consider a plea.</i>

101
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,935
I will consider it.

102
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,381
<i>So you were answering calls on the
afternoon of February the fourth?</i>

103
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,479
I'd have to check my card.
Your sergeant already did.

104
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,719
I need to ask you
about Andrew Soin.

105
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,929
He shot up the Midtown Savings Bank,
killed a woman.

106
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,091
Yeah. Name sounded familiar.

107
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,830
Well, he claims that he called this
switchboard, said he had a gun, needed some help,

108
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,134
and the operator hung up on him.

109
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,766
I think I'd remember
a call like that.

110
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,710
Look, you gotta understand that this
switchboard, it hardly ever rings.

111
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,410
And when it does, it's usually
personal calls for the guys on duty.

112
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,352
If a call like that came through,

113
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,083
you can bet
I wouldn't hang up on it.

114
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,491
<i>It's not the slam dunk
Branch was hoping for.</i>

115
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,589
The operator? Far from compelling.
Says he never got the call.

116
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,294
You don't believe him?
[Chuckles] He broke into a sweat.

117
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,360
Sure looked like
a guilty conscience to me.

118
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,168
The victim's husband's waiting
in the conference room.

119
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:59,735
Hey, put a rush on Soin's phone records. We
need confirmation that call never happened.

120
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,645
And tell Salazar and Ravell
to dig into Soin.

121
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:07,311
Let's find out what made him walk
into work that day and open fire.

122
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:12,255
I keep asking myself why, but the truth is, I
really don't care what made the guy do what he did.

123
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,555
I just want him to pay.

124
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,561
She didn't deserve this.

125
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,861
<i>I wanted to try to have the funeral
as soon as possible.</i>

126
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,924
I only have a few days' leave.

127
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,403
It would be helpful if her family could
be here for as much of the trial as-

128
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,702
There is no family. I'm it.

129
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,609
How long were you
and Dana married?

130
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,942
Just over a year.

131
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,006
We went to City Hall
a month before I shipped out.

132
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,411
I'm in Fallujah, and Dana gets shot trying
to cash a check in downtown Manhattan.

133
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,185
<i>Do you mind?
I only get five minutes.</i>

134
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,859
People say you're the one to talk
to about Soin. You guys buddies?

135
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,959
Soin didn't have buddies.

136
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,095
Word is you two
took smoke breaks together.

137
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:03,039
<i>I felt bad for the guy. He was
going through a lot. Such as?</i>

138
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,043
Ugly divorce.

139
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,545
I've been there myself, but I didn't
use my office as target practice.

140
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:11,413
His wife dumped him for some doctor she
met when their son wrecked the family car.

141
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,215
- When'd this happen?
- Three, four years ago.

142
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,654
Three, four years ago?
That's a long time.

143
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:22,456
<i>Why'd he snap now? Since last month he's
been acting kinda weird, even for him.</i>

144
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,395
Did he tell you why?
He didn't talk about it.

145
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,432
Not to me anyways.

146
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,491
Anyone he did talk to?

147
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,863
<i>That's the beauty of group.
People feel free to unburden themselves.</i>

148
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,068
You help them with their pain.
We try to help each other.

149
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,112
<i>Well, now we need your help. Andrew
Soin's caused a lot of suffering.</i>

150
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,342
<i>I'm not at liberty to say
if a Mr. Soin is even in this group.</i>

151
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,908
Look, what gets said in this room stays
in this room. It's the only way it works.

152
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,854
Yeah, it works so well that
someone's dead. I'm sorry.

153
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,414
Help yourself.

154
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:59,088
Soin must be quite a guy. Shoots three
people full of holes, everyone's got his back.

155
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,793
So, you were in group
with him?

156
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,634
Why call it "group"
if it's always about him?

157
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,505
<i>He ever mention his divorce?
Are you kidding?</i>

158
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,272
So he blamed his ex
for his problems.

159
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,906
The man could teach a master class
in the blame game.

160
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:20,043
Rent checks were getting lost in the mail.
Doctors were double billing him.

161
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,317
<i>- Everything was someone else's fault.
- So he came here to unload.</i>

162
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,018
He came here 'cause he was terrified.
He'd just gotten mugged.

163
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,527
- When was this?
- About a month ago.

164
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,655
He said that he reported it to the cops,
but nothing came of it.

165
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,292
Even went
and bought himself a gun.

166
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,461
He didn't just buy it, he used it.

167
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:41,529
His final session he was so depressed,
he said he felt like he was gonna explode.

168
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,167
What do you mean
by "his final session"?

169
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,576
His insurance didn't cover therapy.
Couldn't afford to keep coming.

170
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,379
Soin's phone records.

171
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,749
He did call the police for help.
The operator lied.

172
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,722
- A lot went wrong for the guy.
- Don't tell me you feel sorry for him.

173
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,251
Don't shrug it off. Tell me.

174
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,559
Are you saying a run of bad luck
justifies a shooting spree?

175
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,758
I'm just thinking like a jury will.

176
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,324
You honestly think a jury
could be sympathetic?

177
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,133
If Guzman focuses
on Soin's character, yes.

178
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,196
The guy never took a sick day.

179
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,801
He just got passed over for a promotion
by someone fresh out of college.

180
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,869
He's a hard worker.
No criminal record.

181
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,882
Ajury of his peers might relate
to him. It's not a stretch.

182
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,919
At the very least,
it could affect sentencing.

183
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,319
That's why
I'm offering him a plea.

184
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,156
<i>How do I hang up
on a call I never got?</i>

185
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,188
I'm gonna give you a minute
to think about it.

186
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:42,496
- What's this?
- Soin's phone records from February 4.

187
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:47,437
There's a 52-second call from
Soin's apartment to your switchboard.

188
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,372
Look, I can't lose my job, all right?
I'm diabetic.

189
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,914
Without medical, I'm dead.

190
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,417
So, you did talk to Soin.

191
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,420
He talked, I listened.
Mm-hmm.

192
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,150
They're gonna fire me
when they hear about this.

193
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,658
We put you under oath,
you lie- that's perjury.

194
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,661
Jail time.
Oh, God, no.

195
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,391
Did Soin tell you he had a gun?

196
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,732
I told him I was unauthorized, I hadn't
been trained to take a call like that,

197
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,294
that I was gonna
connect him to 911.

198
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:24,934
Now, we might have got disconnected,
but I did not hang up on him.

199
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,001
I swear it.

200
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,573
Man one.
Oh, Miguel, come on.

201
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,984
Murder two, concurrent sentences
on the non-fatal victims.

202
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,751
It's a shot at some distant parole.
Are you following this?

203
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,588
Yes. Yeah.
We should consider it.

204
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,491
I want man two.

205
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,122
I want a beach house
in the Hamptons.

206
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,294
<i>Mr. Soin, I've tried to make you
understand, if this went to trial-</i>

207
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,930
- That's exactly where it is going.
- I can't promise we'll do as well with a jury.

208
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,270
I know.

209
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,333
That's why you're fired.

210
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,345
- What?
- Unbelievable.

211
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,610
Mr. Soin, it's a decent offer.
I think I know how this should be done.

212
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,483
Clearly, you don't.
I've decided to represent myself.

213
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,262
<i>A man who has no concept of the law
attempting to defend himself.</i>

214
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,323
It's his right, Arthur.

215
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,529
Ringmaster at a three-ring circus,
in your courtroom.

216
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,700
<i>Barring he clucks like a chicken at
his competency exam, my hands are tied.</i>

217
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,801
A man who serves as his own lawyer
has a fool for a client.

218
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,746
And every man has a
constitutional right to be a fool.

219
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,980
- Did you invite me to lunch just to complain?
- You'd deny me such a simple pleasure?

220
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,545
<i>You worry too much.
I think I can control my courtroom.</i>

221
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:54,164
<i>Mr. Soin, I've reviewed your psychiatric
evaluation and find you competent to stand trial.</i>

222
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,361
Okay. If you're permitted
to represent yourself,

223
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,234
<i>you'll have to fully comply with the
rules of evidence, criminal procedure...</i>

224
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,332
and the orders of this court,
even if you disagree with them.

225
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,901
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Please stand when addressing the bench.

226
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,746
<i>You cannot make speeches
or try to testify.</i>

227
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:16,049
<i>And when questioning witnesses, you will remain
courteous at all times. Is that understood?</i>

228
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,055
Yes.

229
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,524
<i>It will be more difficult for you to get
access to research, evidence and witnesses...</i>

230
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,392
due to the restrictions under which
you are presently housed.

231
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:28,524
I'm aware of that, but I know what
happened better than anybody else.

232
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,594
<i>For the record, I think it's unwise for
any defendant to proceed without counsel,</i>

233
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,435
<i>especially in a case
with this degree of significance.</i>

234
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:40,342
<i>That said, I'm satisfied that you understand what
you're doing by waiving your right to counsel...</i>

235
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,812
and I'm allowing you
to proceed pro se.

236
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,373
Can I talk now?

237
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,319
Thank you...
for giving me a chance here.

238
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,324
I really believe-

239
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,952
Mr. Soin, I think you should probably
save your opening for trial.

240
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,189
Right. Okay.

241
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,562
And I'd like to file a request
for visitation rights.

242
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,160
<i>Visitation of whom?
My son, Joey.</i>

243
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:09,264
He's out at the Furndale Clinic, and I usually go
there every Thursday. I'd like to keep doing that.

244
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:14,074
<i>I'm afraid your situation has
changed dramatically. Request denied.</i>

245
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,480
<i>What's he saying I did now?</i>

246
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,149
You divorced Mr. Soin
four years ago.

247
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,557
Acrimony still run
that deep? You married?

248
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,788
No.
Choose wisely.

249
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,388
What does he want,
more money?

250
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:37,231
Actually, I'm not representing your
ex-husband. I'm with the D.A.' s office.

251
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,967
So, where'd you go on vacation?

252
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,372
Costa Rica. Rain forest.

253
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,242
What is this about? You haven't spoken
to Mr. Soin since you've been out of town?

254
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,338
I haven't spoken to him in years.

255
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,408
The closest we get are the accusatory
messages he leaves on my voice mail.

256
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:57,387
What is this about?
Mr. Soin's been arrested for murder.

257
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,187
Oh, my God. Who did he-

258
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,356
He shot and killed a woman at his bank. About
these messages he's been leaving you, what are they-

259
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,662
No. No. I don't think I can talk
to you anymore. I'm sorry.

260
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,331
What did the ex-wife have to say?
Not too much.

261
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,738
So I pulled everything
I could on Soin.

262
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,800
He's not the type
to make headlines.

263
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,369
Most of it's
on his son's accident.

264
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,440
<i>Drunk driving? It happened
on the way home from the city.</i>

265
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,384
<i>The kid was celebrating
his 18th birthday.</i>

266
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,922
<i>He's been in a coma ever since.</i>

267
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,356
This is getting operatic.

268
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,553
The Soins filed a civil suit against the bar
where their kid got loaded.

269
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,892
Let me guess. They lost.
Mmm.

270
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,695
His ex met her new husband,
the boy's doctor. She ditches Soin-

271
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,827
All of which he'll try
to bring in at trial.

272
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:48,498
Valid reasons why a person
might snap. Oh, please!

273
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,042
We've all got laundry lists
of reasons to snap.

274
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,578
<i>Come on, Tracey.
Soin's at a breaking point.</i>

275
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,546
He keeps asking for help,
and no one listens.

276
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,846
<i>He shot a two-inch hole
through Dana Burge's sternum.</i>

277
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,682
She's dead. He pulled
the trigger. End of story.

278
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,924
<i>But why did he subpoena me?
You were a paramedic at the scene.</i>

279
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,359
He might want someone impartial
to walk the jury through the aftermath.

280
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,159
I just got off the phone
with legal services at Rikers.

281
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:17,032
Soin's been requesting medical
books from the library. So?

282
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,560
So, he's doing his homework. We know the
subject is medicine. What we don't know is why.

283
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,607
When you guys first entered
the bank, where was Soin?

284
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:30,080
On the floor with the victim,
complaining about response time.

285
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:34,552
And after the panic button was hit, how
long was it before you entered the building?

286
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,145
Twelve minutes. Response
time was seven minutes.

287
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:41,454
We had to wait another five
for the cops to secure the scene.

288
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:45,088
- If you had gotten there sooner-
- How? Fly?

289
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:49,897
If you had gotten to Dana Burge sooner,
is it possible she could have lived?

290
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,129
We did our job.

291
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,232
It's possible.

292
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,969
You got a minute?

293
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,149
- Everybody's guilty except the guy who did the crime.
- Maybe not.

294
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,248
Remember why Soin said he needed
space on the therapy couch?

295
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,125
Yeah, he got mugged. And made a big
deal about how the cops dropped the ball.

296
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,757
Well, I checked it out. There's no
record of him ever reporting a mugging.

297
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,802
- He lied.
- Why would he lie about that?

298
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,461
I don't know.

299
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,199
Okay, if we're gonna use this,
we've gotta cover our asses.

300
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,299
Check everything
- the E.R.' s, the local clinics, people who saw him at the time.

301
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,310
Everything.
Okay.

302
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:40,079
[Ringing]

303
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,150
Kibre. [Operator] Collect call from-

304
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,321
[Soin] Andrew Soin. Will
you accept the charges?

305
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,329
I will.

306
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,661
Burning the midnight oil?

307
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,724
What can I do for you,
Mr. Soin?

308
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,963
I could use
your order of witnesses.

309
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,528
I'm under no obligation
to give you that information.

310
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,541
Just trying to get
a fair trial here.

311
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,375
Seems like everyone's going out of
their way to make that impossible.

312
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,044
Ms. Kibre?

313
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,178
You still there?
I'm still here.

314
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,747
Good. For a minute there I thought
you had hung up on me too.

315
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,317
When people do that,
bad things tend to happen.

316
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,061
Is that it?
For now.

317
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,179
<i>[Kibre] All of which will
prove, beyond a reasonable doubt,</i>

318
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,243
<i>that the man sitting before you...</i>

319
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,586
<i>is guilty of murder
in the second degree.</i>

320
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,152
Approach.

321
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,465
<i>That means you too,
Mr. Soin.</i>

322
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,064
<i>Mr. Soin, we discussed this.</i>

323
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,610
You're permitted to wear
your street clothes during trial.

324
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,146
I want the jury to see me as I am.

325
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,375
They can hear him in the stalls,
Your Honor.

326
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:21,783
<i>Mr. Soin, let's get one thing clear-
my courtroom is no place for games.</i>

327
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,378
However, I cannot force you
to change out of your prison garb.

328
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,152
<i>- Your Honor, I'm gonna have to-
- Please proceed.</i>

329
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,305
One thing Ms. Kibre got right-
I'm just a man.

330
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,602
[Chuckles]
I work in a bank.

331
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:47,304
<i>The only time I ever stepped into this
building was when I hadjury duty, like you guys.</i>

332
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,042
The reason I'm here now
is because I can't trust anyone...

333
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,175
to care as much
about this case as I do.

334
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,848
<i>They're gonna tell you what I did,
but they won't tell you why.</i>

335
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,188
<i>And I'm sure that they have
expert witnesses and visual aids.</i>

336
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,820
<i>I know that they have law
degrees. [Judge Ross] Mr. Soin.</i>

337
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,693
<i>Do I have to remind you
of the rules we agreed on?</i>

338
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,699
Sorry.

339
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,705
The best that I can do-
in fact, the only thing I can do-

340
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,368
is to tell you my side of things
as honestly as I can.

341
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,879
<i>I know that theirjob is
to make you believe I'm a bad guy.</i>

342
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,881
<i>But if you hear me out,</i>

343
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,077
I think you'll find I'm just like you.

344
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,384
<i>[Kibre] Mr. Reddy, were you
shot by the defendant, Mr. Soin?</i>

345
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,325
In the arm.
He shattered my humerus.

346
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:40,354
I'd like to show what's been
previously marked...

347
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,366
as People's 37.

348
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,562
- You may publish it.
- Objection.

349
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,969
You'll have to tell me the basis of
the objection before I can rule on it.

350
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,531
The images on that tape-
they're deeply disturbing.

351
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,874
- I don't think the jury needs to see them.
- Overruled.

352
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,573
- Can't she just describe what happened?
- Mr. Soin, sit down.

353
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,209
- Why were you in the bank?
- To get some dollar coins.

354
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:35,345
My daughter's first tooth fell out, so
it was going to be from the Tooth Fairy.

355
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,356
<i>When did you first see Mr. Soin?
When he entered the lobby.</i>

356
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,790
I thought he was going to lunch.

357
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,762
<i>Then what happened? Well, I saw he
had a gun, and hejust began to fire.</i>

358
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,193
Was Mr. Soin panicked
or distraught?

359
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,499
<i>No. His face was a blank.</i>

360
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:57,406
He- He looked
completely at peace.

361
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,874
- That's all for this witness.
- Mr. Soin.

362
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,054
Mr. Reddy, I know it doesn't sound like
much coming from the man who shot you,

363
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,820
<i>but at this moment
it's all I have to give.</i>

364
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,329
- I'm so deeply sorry.
- Objection!

365
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,388
This isn't a confessional.

366
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,059
Mr. Soin, do you have
an actual question for this witness?

367
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,333
I've put Mr. Reddy and all the other
people that I hurt through enough already.

368
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,931
No, I don't have any questions.

369
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,344
It sucks,
putting your life on hold.

370
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,352
Yeah, tell me about it. I've got
an 86-year-old mother at home.

371
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,514
<i>She probably burned the house down by
now. At least we got an interesting case.</i>

372
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,819
Think so?

373
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:51,488
Buddy of mine spent two weeks on a civil jury
listening to people argue about a root canal gone bad.

374
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,827
I'd take boring over this
if we'd be home sooner.

375
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,834
At least, if the guy had himself a lawyer,
they wouldn't waste so much time on all-

376
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,029
Hey, guys.
Is, uh, he coming back?

377
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,774
You guys weren't, uh,
talking about the case, were ya?

378
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,509
What are you, the jury nazi?

379
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,848
Anybody want coffee?
I'm buying.

380
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,286
No, thanks.
Makes me jumpy.

381
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,195
Well, you did really well up there
on the stand. Well, that was easy.

382
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,498
I already knew the questions
Ms. Kibre'd be asking.

383
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:37,201
It's the next part
- I mean, what's Soin gonna wanna know that I haven't already said?

384
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,573
I buried Dana next to
her parents. Mr. Burge-

385
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,942
Do I know you?
You killed my wife.

386
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,675
No, no. Look, I promise you
- You could have sent someone to stop him.

387
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,651
If you'd just talked to him a few
minutes longer, just kept him on the line.

388
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,019
I blame you.

389
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,093
It's okay.

390
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,934
<i>Certain jurors may have been inadvertently
exposed to out-of-court statements...</i>

391
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,166
which could affect their ability
to remain impartial.

392
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,175
What has led you to this belief?

393
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,235
<i>They witnessed an altercation between
a witness and the victim's husband.</i>

394
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,440
<i>We believe this requires
an immediate inquiry.</i>

395
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,282
<i>Did you see anything in the hallway
as you returned to thejury room?</i>

396
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,221
Yeah. I think it was the victim's husband.
He was talking to the operator, Mr. Mudgett.

397
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,782
<i>Did hearing that conversation impact
your ability to remain fair and impartial?</i>

398
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,624
Um, no.
I can honestly say that it didn't.

399
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,187
[Sighs]
If it did, could I get to go home?

400
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:38,066
Did it cause you to form an opinion
for or against one party or the other?

401
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,435
<i>It didn't change it. So you're admitting
that you've already formed an opinion?</i>

402
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,997
They're making it impossible not to.
I mean, come on.

403
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,475
He's up there alone against people
who do this for a living.

404
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,811
In my instructions to the jury, I explained that
Mr. Soin made the choice to represent himself.

405
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:55,114
And he's doing a pretty good job of it
too. He's kicking those girls' asses.

406
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,781
<i>[Judge Ross] As you can see, juror number
nine has been replaced by an alternate.</i>

407
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:02,258
<i>You are not to speculate
as to the reason why.</i>

408
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,387
Mr. Soin, you may begin
your cross-examination.

409
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,265
What experience do you have
on the switchboard?

410
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,534
Three years. I'm there on
account of my medical condition.

411
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,542
I guess I have to
be more specific.

412
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,101
Did you ever go through
any official training,

413
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,739
<i>sit in on any calls before you
answered them yourself?</i>

414
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:27,012
No.
How long is your shift?

415
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,315
I just work lunch.
That's just an hour.

416
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,617
What do you do
the rest of the time?

417
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,818
Fix things.
Burnt-out lightbulb.

418
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,954
Sometimes a toilet
in the holding cell backs up...

419
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,863
<i>or a desk drawer gets stuck.</i>

420
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,924
Pretty much
whatever the guys need.

421
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,335
When you were first asked if I called the
police switchboard, you lied, didn't you?

422
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,771
Yes.
The D.A. Ever investigate you?

423
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,606
<i>No.
Prosecute you?</i>

424
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,670
No. You lied to the authorities,
you obstructed justice.

425
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,648
Objection. Badgering.

426
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,380
I'd like to request
a motion to dismiss...

427
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,550
<i>for prosecutorial misconduct.</i>

428
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,116
- Your Honor!
- Chambers.

429
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,525
Mudgett's testimony was given
in exchange for not being punished.

430
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,194
<i>There was no offer in this case.
There was an agreement.</i>

431
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,998
It wasn't disclosed.

432
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,335
<i>That's a- a Brady violation.</i>

433
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,398
Someone's been studying.

434
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,378
Unless your office intends to open an
investigation into Mr. Mudgett, he has an argument.

435
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,279
- Your Honor!
- The defendant's motion to dismiss is denied.

436
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:35,581
However, I will instruct the jury that they may
consider the possibility that the operator's testimony...

437
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,589
was induced by a promise
not to prosecute.

438
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,591
Thank you.

439
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,122
<i>Are you and Mr. Soin friendly?</i>

440
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,530
We work together.
We get along, sure.

441
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,468
Have you ever been to
his apartment? Once.

442
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,536
Did you go there from the bank?
Yeah.

443
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,702
- How long did it take you to get there?
- Ten minutes maybe.

444
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,342
<i>Ten minutes.
You're sure of that?</i>

445
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,350
Yeah.

446
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,944
No further questions.

447
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,790
How did the police know to
come to the bank? Objection.

448
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,260
<i>Calls for speculation.
Sustained.</i>

449
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,059
- Did someone hit a panic button?
- Yes.

450
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,123
<i>How many buttons do we have?
Three.</i>

451
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,135
<i>Where are they?</i>

452
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,104
Nora Phelps has one at her counter,
but she was out sick.

453
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,164
<i>Who has the second button?
I do.</i>

454
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,675
- Did you trigger it?
- No, I didn't.

455
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,975
<i>Where's the third button?
At your desk, Andrew.</i>

456
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,283
I'd like to cue up
the bank videotape.

457
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,925
<i>That's the bank lobby.</i>

458
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,587
<i>That's me, standing at my desk,
before the shooting started?</i>

459
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,291
<i>Yeah.
So who hit the panic button?</i>

460
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,230
- You did.
- Objection!

461
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,429
Sustained.

462
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:08,569
<i>Damn it. Did you see thejury?
They're buying what he's selling.</i>

463
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,638
So we'll redirect. No, it's
too late. We dropped the ball.

464
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:15,083
The jury's not listening to the facts. They're
listening to the guy who's avoiding them.

465
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,644
And right now he's a hell of a lot
more compelling than we are.

466
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:21,317
- Is it safe?
- That depends. You got something to cheer me up?

467
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:24,759
Your victim doesn't have a bank account
at Midtown Savings in her name.

468
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,765
Well, that can't be right. Dana Burge
cashed her paycheck there every other Friday.

469
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,824
Dana Burge didn't.
Dana Landin did.

470
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,871
I ran the social.
She uses her maiden name still.

471
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,635
- How did I miss that?
- Miss what?

472
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:41,668
Dana Landin is the bartender who served
Joey Soin the night of his accident.

473
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,210
The shooting wasn't random?
Soin knew the victim?

474
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,276
It was vengeance.

475
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,986
The jury's gonna listen to that.

476
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,554
Where was your son
on the night of his accident?

477
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,465
In the city, celebrating
his 18th birthday.

478
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,003
Where?
At a bar.

479
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,801
- Why is this even relevant?
- Mr. Soin! Sit down!

480
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,503
<i>Did he ever come home that night?</i>

481
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,671
You know he didn't.

482
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,683
<i>You and your ex-husband,
the defendant,</i>

483
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:23,881
<i>filed a civil suit against the bar
and lost, didn't you?</i>

484
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,855
Yes.

485
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:29,382
<i>Did Mr. Soin say that he blamed
the bar for your son's accident?</i>

486
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,918
They served a child
half a bottle of tequila.

487
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,489
- Can't you see she's upsetting her?
- Let's move it along.

488
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:40,766
<i>Did Mr. Soin know the victim,
Dana Landin Burge?</i>

489
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,399
- Objection.
- Overruled.

490
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,908
<i>Dana Burge was the bartender...</i>

491
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,105
who served your son on the night
of the accident, wasn't she?

492
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,741
- You don't have to answer that!
- Mrs. Webber?

493
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,842
Yes.

494
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,853
Yes, she was.

495
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,891
<i>Thank you. No further questions.</i>

496
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,131
When did our marriage end?

497
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,865
When we realized our son
was never coming home.

498
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,964
This isn't helping.

499
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,604
After the accident,

500
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,146
<i>I started taking medication,
didn't I?</i>

501
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:27,082
Yes.
It was for depression, wasn't it?

502
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,552
- Objection. Foundation.
- Sustained.

503
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,556
We'd just lost our son.

504
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,716
I told you I was depressed, didn't I?

505
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,921
<i>Objection. Hearsay.
Sustained.</i>

506
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,488
<i>Your Honor, may we approach?</i>

507
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,066
Your Honor, if Mr. Soin wants to testify,
I suggest he do it from the stand.

508
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:57,137
- Do you have anything further for this witness?
- No.

509
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,683
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.
You may step back.</i>

510
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,413
Mrs. Webber,
you may be excused.

511
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,790
<i>The prosecution rests.
Mr. Soin?</i>

512
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,818
Then I'd like to call myself, Andrew Soin,
to the witness stand.

513
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,159
<i>Mr. Soin, can you tell us
what happened...</i>

514
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,830
on August 7, 1982?

515
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,998
Yeah. My son Joey was born.

516
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,804
Mr. Soin, I think a simple narrative
will work just fine.

517
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,811
Oh. Okay.

518
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,847
He was an only child.
[Chuckles]

519
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,246
We really wanted a boy.
[Chuckles]

520
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,514
Well, we got one.
Being a father changed everything.

521
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,521
- Objection. Relevance?
- You know, it goes to my state of mind.

522
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,716
I'll allow it.

523
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,057
<i>On the day of the accident,
Joey was at football practice.</i>

524
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,289
<i>Starting fullback.</i>

525
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,663
<i>[Sighs]
Afterwards I took him out,</i>

526
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:53,795
and I, uh
- [Chuckles] I bought him a wakeboard for his birthday...

527
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,135
<i>to use at the lake.
Your Honor.</i>

528
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,665
Mr. Soin is facing a murder charge,
not stumping for Father of the Year.

529
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:04,738
Mr. Soin, you have to limit yourself
to the facts of this case.

530
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,149
<i>Joey is this case.
Mr. Soin!</i>

531
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,210
You want to know
what he did today?

532
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:13,587
He had his catheter changed and got
dialysis, which he gets twice a week.

533
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,149
<i>Mr. Soin, if you don't stop,
I'll have to hold you in contempt.</i>

534
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:20,061
<i>And do what? Throw me in jail? What can you
take from me that hasn't already been taken?</i>

535
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:24,397
- Guard.
- Please. Look at this. This is my son. This is who he was.

536
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,563
<i>- Your Honor! Objection!
- [Judge Ross] Mr. Soin!</i>

537
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,833
<i>This is Joey now.
Objection!</i>

538
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,034
<i>[Judge Ross] Get him out ofhere.
That's my son. For God's sakes.</i>

539
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,738
<i>All right, all right.</i>

540
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,451
<i>[Judge Patel] Are you going
somewhere? Exorcizing my demons.</i>

541
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,084
There's a good chance the jury
won't see through Soin's act.

542
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,960
If you plan on making a go of the bench,
may I suggest looking for the silver lining?

543
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,195
Justice is about to take a detour.
Where's the silver in that?

544
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,965
Oh, the appellate courts don't review
not-guilty's, so you won't get spanked.

545
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,803
<i>For what?
Ah, no, no.</i>

546
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,706
Don't make me the bad guy.

547
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,076
Why break a habit? Seriously, Your Honor,
what would you have done differently?

548
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:13,140
Huh? I would have forced the issue
of stand-by counsel,

549
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,583
found someone
who could control Soin.

550
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,144
I followed the letter of the law.
We're not talking procedure.

551
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,783
We're talking practicality,
not to mention self-interest.

552
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,419
You can't deny it's an issue.
Of course I'm denying it.

553
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:28,955
And I would not have let the case get bogged
down with the investigation of the operator.

554
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,765
That was a necessity. L-
That was a distraction.

555
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,102
Please, you're catering
to an amateur.

556
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,037
<i>How are we feeling?
Cooperative, I hope.</i>

557
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,242
Yes, Your Honor.

558
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,785
<i>Ms. Kibre?</i>

559
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,151
Mr. Soin,

560
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:54,191
you called
the police switchboard for help.

561
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,192
Why not 911?

562
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,990
I asked for help.

563
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,054
I don't know why it matters
who I called.

564
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,863
<i>Well, you didn't dial 911 because you
knew that they could find you and stop you,</i>

565
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,336
<i>and you didn't want
to be stopped, did you?</i>

566
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,339
Of course I did.

567
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,740
<i>Well, then why didn't you go
to the precinct and turn yourself in?</i>

568
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,712
You didn't do that, did you?
You went to the bank.

569
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,080
And the first thing I did
was press the panic button.

570
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:24,349
<i>Only after you saw Dana Burge
enter the bank.</i>

571
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,721
<i>Yeah.
She came in every other Friday.</i>

572
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,228
And every time she came in,
it all came back-

573
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,231
the call from the police aboutJoey's
accident, the drive to the hospital-

574
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,735
It's why I called for help.
I couldn't take it anymore.

575
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:44,366
<i>So you alerted the police to a crime that you
knew would be over by the time they arrived?</i>

576
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,809
<i>- It's not my fault that they took so long.
- Oh. Right.</i>

577
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,347
The police dropped the ball
once before, didn't they?

578
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,577
- Objection. Relevance?
- Goes to credibility.

579
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,642
I'll allow it.

580
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,984
I was mugged.
They were useless.

581
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,524
<i>Which precinct
did you report that to?</i>

582
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,689
- Who was the officer who took your statement?
- I don't remember his name.

583
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:11,098
You don't remember his name because you didn't
report it because the mugging never happened, did it?

584
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,967
[Chuckling]
I filed the report.

585
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,506
If the police lost it,
it is their fault.

586
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,270
Well, nothing's ever your fault.

587
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,210
<i>She can't say that, can she?
No, she can't.</i>

588
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,875
The jury's instructed
to disregard Ms. Kibre's remark.

589
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:31,443
You called the switchboard for help,
and they hung up?

590
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,581
Yes.

591
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,627
And you waited in your apartment
one hour for someone to come?

592
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,185
- That's right.
- Okay.

593
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,130
If you called the switchboard...

594
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,692
at 12:36 and waited one hour,

595
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,800
how did you get
to the bank by 12:58?

596
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,608
- O-Objection.
- What is the basis of your objection?

597
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,308
No. The time on the videotape
must be wrong.

598
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,374
<i>- Overruled.
- Mr. Soin.</i>

599
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:05,821
<i>The operator transferred you to 911,
and you hung up, didn't you?</i>

600
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,882
[Chuckles]
That's not how it happened.

601
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,294
<i>You walked into the bank, you pressed
the panic button and started shooting,</i>

602
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,561
<i>knowing that the police wouldn't
be able to get there in time.</i>

603
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:20,661
You faked a mugging
to justify getting a gun permit.

604
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,672
No.

605
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,972
<i>Isn't it true that you blamed Dana Burge
for your son's accident,</i>

606
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,808
and now you're blaming
everybody else...

607
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,314
for the murder you committed?

608
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:44,491
She took my son away from me,
and she went back to her normal life.

609
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,122
No more questions.

610
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,690
I'm- He'll ne- never know
a normal life again.

611
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,636
You're dismissed, Mr. Soin.

612
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,431
He was my son.

613
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,169
He was my responsibility.

614
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,825
<i>Let the record reflect all parties
have had the opportunity...</i>

615
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,496
to read the note I received from
the jury foreman, Sharaud Williams.

616
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,438
Mr. Williams, this meeting
is highly unorthodox.

617
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,069
It could compromise the sanctity of the
jury room, not to mention the verdict.

618
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,204
I'm just asking you
to hear me out.

619
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,646
If it has to do
with deliberations, I can't.

620
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:42,413
Then we've got a problem, 'cause the group's
having a hard time limiting ourselves to the facts.

621
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,649
As I instructed the jury before,
that's the only thing to consider.

622
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:49,887
Stick to the evidence. Don't be swayed by
your emotions for one side or the other.

623
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:56,226
With all due respect, what you're asking for's
just not gonna happen. He's got no lawyer.

624
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,259
<i>That was his choice
and not an issue for you to consider.</i>

625
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,499
He called for help. His son is-

626
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,371
I can't talk about deliberations.

627
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:10,278
<i>Everybody has an obligation here
- Ms. Kibre had to prove her case beyond a reasonable doubt,</i>

628
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,579
<i>Mr. Soin had to defend himself,
and I had to keep it all in line.</i>

629
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,950
But now you have an obligation
to decide where justice is in this case.

630
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,012
No one else can do that.

631
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,424
- That's all you can give me.
- I think that's enough.

632
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,231
<i>[Gate Lock Buzzing]</i>

633
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,300
<i>I wasn't sure you'd come.</i>

634
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,902
You called. I was curious.

635
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,813
- Jury's taking an awfully long time.
- Could mean many things.

636
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:50,582
- Like it's going my way.
- You're half right.

637
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,115
Man two.

638
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,823
Five to seven years
for killing Dana Burge,

639
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,388
not to mention
the other two people you shot?

640
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,094
- It's not gonna happen.
- You won't look bad.

641
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,627
The guy on the street doesn't know the
difference between murder two and man two.

642
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,174
- I do.
- Okay.

643
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,904
But if you walk out of here without a
deal, and that jury comes back in my favor,

644
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,142
you only got yourself to blame.

645
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,844
I'm sensing a theme.

646
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,676
Please be seated.

647
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:00,517
<i>[Judge Ross] Mr. Soin, would you
please stand and face thejury?</i>

648
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,721
Has the jury reached a verdict?

649
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,392
We have, Your Honor.

650
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,968
On the charge of murder in the
second degree, how do you find?

651
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,369
We find the defendant guilty.

652
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,748
<i>On the charge of assault in the
first degree, how do you find?</i>

653
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,720
We find the defendant guilty.

654
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,561
Thank you.

655
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,810
Uh, excuse me. Can you give this
to Mr. Soin for me, please?

656
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,591
Soin got his revenge.

657
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,927
And a guilty verdict.

658
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,332
Neither of which
will bring back his son.

659
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,597
Tragedy begets tragedy.

660
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,662
You won't find this one
in Euripides.

661
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,470
He filed for bankruptcy
a week before the shootings.

662
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,240
No wonder he pushed so hard
for man two.

663
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,771
He'd have got five to seven
and walked with a clean slate.

664
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,341
Now he's looking at 25 to life.

665
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,910
For that,
I'll gladly take the blame.

666
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,979
<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>

667
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,710
<i>[Howling]</i>
