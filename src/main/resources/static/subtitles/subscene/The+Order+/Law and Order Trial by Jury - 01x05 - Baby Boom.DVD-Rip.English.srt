She's right here. She's right next to me.</i>

A.D.A. Gaffney?
Hi.

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,960
I didn't know this was your case.
Yeah. The child lived in my precinct.

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,658
- This is Detective Terrano.
- Hi.

18
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,796
- So where do we stand?
- The doctor just told me they're taking the child off life support.

19
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,896
It's gonna be a homicide.

20
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,339
<i>What else are they saying?
They wanna show us X-rays.</i>

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,901
Looks like shaken baby.

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,712
Retinal hemorrhaging. You can actually see that the
eyes have slammed against the back of their sockets.

23
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,743
How long would you say she was shaken?
At least 30 seconds, possibly a minute.

24
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,883
But the scan also shows an acute
subdural hematoma. Brain bleed.

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,123
We operated to relieve the pressure, but
the damage was too severe. She's brain-dead.

26
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,495
<i>Well, that couldn't have
happened from just being shaken.</i>

27
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:45,266
Right. The skull is fractured. Now, the temporal
bone lacerated the middle meningeal artery.

28
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,272
Well, could it have been an accident,
maybe a fall?

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,036
<i>Yeah, they'll say that.
But this was no accident.</i>

30
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,638
The nanny had sole care of Marissa
since 6:30 this morning.

31
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,343
I'll order up some surveillance,
make sure she stays put.

32
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,718
So you've talked to the parents?
Single mom.

33
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:06,452
She adopted Marissa from China six months ago.
Needed a nanny because of her work schedule.

34
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,256
Enter Katie Nevins
from rural Pennsylvania.

35
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,059
What do we know about her?
She moved here six months ago.

36
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,226
Told the mother she wants to be a
handbag designer. What, in her spare time?

37
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,235
That was the problem.

38
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,205
This morning she asked for the day off.
Dr. Downey said no.

39
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,765
They had words.

40
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,311
Dr. Downey?
That's her-

41
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,042
Dr. Emily Downey, on staff
here. She's the mother.

42
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:33,677
She was in surgery when the call
about Marissa came in.

[No Audible Dialogue]

44
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:43,361
I told her you were coming. Wait.
I don't think that we should, um-

45
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,763
I think she's... saying good-bye.

46
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,246

- At 1:00 in the morning?

49
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,628
Katie, this is
Assistant District Attorney Gaffney.

50
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,157
You're, like, a lawyer?
Exactly like.

51
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,433
What's going on?
I have some questions to ask you.

52
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,202
Well, I already told them everything,
but whatever y-

53
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,108
<i>Actually, I'd like to do it
down at the precinct.</i>

54
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:38,117
Well, how's my friend gonna get home? We were
gonna take the train together. I'll be okay.

55
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,918
Come.

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,656
How's Marissa? Is she doing
all right? What do you think?

57
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:43,276
Now, is it true that your client was in the
process of fleeing the city when she was brought in?

58
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:48,548
Katie was on her way to Queens
to spend the night with a friend.

59
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,988
<i>Now, last I heard,
sleepovers were still legal.</i>

60
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,858
See, this is how the D.A.' s office
distorts things when they don't have a case.

61
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,226
And believe me, they don't.

62
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:03,463
Peter Betts. I'd lay money he leaked that "fleeing
town" story himself just so he could refute it.

63
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,061
<i>Who's pickin' up his tab?
[Kibre] The nanny agency.</i>

64
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,836
<i>Waverly Nannies can afford Peter Betts?
[Branch] Their insurance company can.</i>

65
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,173
If they get an acquittal,
they avoid civil litigation.

66
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:17,649
<i>I'm thinking manslaughter would look reasonable and play
against the evil stereotype Betts is framing us with.</i>

67
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,983
<i>[Branch] What
- we go paws up because we can't take being called names in the press?</i>

70
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,193
Tracey, if the baby was just shaken-

71
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,756
nanny's frustrated, doesn't mean to really hurt her
- that's manslaughter,

72
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:40,773
but when she then smashes the baby's head because
the shaking didn't stop the crying, that's intent.

73
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,536
<i>There you go.
And with intent, you've got murder two.</i>

74
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:47,511

so if you ladies will excuse me-

83
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,280
Not guilty.

84
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,546
- Bail?
- Your Honor, we ask that Katie Nevins be remanded pending trial.

85
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,419
<i>Go ahead. The defendant has
no job, no place to live-</i>

<i>Now, she is eager to have her day in court so she can

91
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,904
<i>Well, my wife and I
have offered her our guest room.</i>

92
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,741
And Katie's mother has taken leave
from her job as a teacher's aide...

<i>to come and be

94
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,976

<i>Emily Downey will not have the
opportunity to raise her child, Your Honor.</i>

98
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,963
[Quietly] A million dollars?
Uh, the insurance will pay.

99
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,468

101
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,839

<i>No, the bad news.

00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:42,353
<i>Patel is an ex-legal aid attorney.
He's not D. A. - friendly.</i>

105
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:47,297
I've seen a case go south with him
on his rulings that had a smoking gun,

106
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,028
a confession and an eyewitness
that was a nun.

107
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,036
Great.

108
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,596
And with Katie out on bail,
there's no chance of a plea.

109
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:59,406
Can we do anything? Pray the clerk
made a mistake and we didn't get Patel.

110
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,642
Resorting to prayer, huh?

No.

Are you? I'm Irish. It's mandatory.

113
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,726
<i>So in your statement at the precinct, you
said you took Marissa to the park that morning,</i>

114
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,893
and that she might have fallen
and banged her head.

115
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:27,907
She was chasing after these older kids, and I turned
my back for one second, and she was on the ground.

116
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:33,105
Well, my point is, you didn't mention this the
first time you talked to the police at the apartment.

117
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,409

Well, I said she might have. Well, I would
think even the possibility of a head bump...

120

<i>is worth mentioning.
I wasn't really thinking straight.</i>

121

00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,456

123
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,726

- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, good. You should be,

themselves over the inconsistencies in your statements,

and they're figurin' out all the
ways they can to brand you as a liar.

132
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,659
And that fall in the playground
is way number one.

<i>But that's not-
I know it's not.</i>

135
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,777
Yeah.

Westchester. Maybe she worked there first.

On her application for Emily Downey, Katie

00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,309
Don't they keep you

Mind telling us what happened? Well,
my sister was gonna move in with us.

- Did she?

152
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,775
- Um-
- So she didn't move in.

- Being uninvolved. I know.

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,788
<i>Our firm's attorney said that my experience
with Katie is probably not even relevant.</i>

157
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,766
<i>Why don't we go to his office,
have a little talk with Clarence Darrow?</i>

158
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,895
<i>Please don't drag him into this. Call him
on the phone. Conference in your husband.</i>

159
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,033
We can all talk about how you're avoiding
helping a mother who just lost a child.

160
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:26,747
She spanked my four-year-old.
Hard. He had welts.

161
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,018
He found a piece of fabric in her room
and made a cape out of it. He's four.

162
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,184
He thinks he's a superhero.

163
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:40,358
I guess it was expensive fabric
for a purse she was designing, and...

164
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,129
he kinda trashed it.

165
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,136
But welts?

166
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:57,773
<i>I've been looking at the case law on shaken baby,
and typically these cases are not murder two.</i>

167
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,445
<i>Uh, this isn'tjust shaken baby.
The child's skull was shattered.</i>

168
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,715
All the same, you don't think
you're overreaching here?

169
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,280
<i>[Kibre] No, Your Honor.
We honestly don't.</i>

170
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,121
By "we," you mean
yourself and Mr. Branch?

171
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,788
Uh, the D.A.' s office in general.

172
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,321
<i>Well, the office that Mr. Branch heads
at the discretion of the voters.</i>

173
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,632
Too bad that district attorney
is not a lifetime appointment.

174
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,162
He would be free of political necessity.
He could make decisions based on the law.

175
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,769
- Which is how this decision was made.
- Well, I hope so,

176
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:32,113
'cause it would be a tragedy to destroy a young
girl's life for the sake of public opinion.

177
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:36,177
<i>We feel the tragedy here is the depraved
indifference to Marissa Downey's life...</i>

178
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,246
displayed by the defendant.

179
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:46,198
Okay then. If you feel you can meet the burden
of proof for murder two, go ahead and try.

180
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,098
Next case.

181
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,433
The autopsy confirmed that the decedent
died as a result of a subdural hema-

182
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:57,807
Liz, remember, always refer to her as " Baby Marissa.'
' We need to humanize her as much as possible.

183
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:03,816
That's a good point, 'cause I was gonna call her "
case number 4235-11.' ' [Chuckles] Okay, gimme a break.

184
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,944
I'm dealing with Judge Patel, who has already made
it clear he doesn't think we can make second degree.

185
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,320
All right. Well, I'm here to make your life
easier. Look what else showed up in the autopsy.

186
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:17,351
There. That's a buckle
fracture of the right wrist.

187
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,365
What, a result of the shaking? Yeah,
that's what I thought too, but see,

188
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,901
the bone's begun to knit.

189
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:28,099
<i>This injury must have occurred a good
six weeks before Baby Marissa's death.</i>

190
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,699
And no one noticed?
Well, that happens with infants.

191
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,303
The child can't explain where it hurts
and compensates by using the other arm.

192
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,646
And we already know that Katie
struck the Rawlings kid out of anger,

193
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,742
so if she did this to Marissa-

194
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,254
I'd say you have
a pattern of behavior.

195
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,423
<i>Emily met Marissa when she was in China
working with a group of surgeons...</i>

196
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,024
who volunteer
in underdeveloped countries.

197
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,504
You know, if we use this picture from the orphanage,
we highlight her work with Operation Smile and-

198
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,509
That reinforces her as being abandoned. Jury's
not gonna care if her birth mother didn't.

199
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,206
- How about this one?
- No, that one looks expensive. No portraits, unless they're from Sears.

200
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,216
Oh, this one's good.

201
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:18,052
- Really?
- Yeah. Every juror's got a picture of their kid or niece or granddaughter...

202
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,353
with spaghetti sauce
all over their face.

203
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,558
You know, I thought seeing her
in the hospital was bad, but this is-

204
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,429
<i>Exactly. That's what I want
thejury to feel.</i>

205
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,766
- Dr. Downey's here.
- [Quietly] Okay.

206
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:40,712
So the judge will sit here, prosecution will
be over there, and you'll sit here with me.

207
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,304
Where will Emily sit?
Well, she's a witness.

208
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,316
She'll only be allowed in
when she testifies.

209
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,318
She'll sit over there.

210
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,617
What if she freaks out at me? No,
she won't freak out. [Chuckles]

211
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,680
You don't know her.

212
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:58,094
She may seem all sweet and nice, but you
should see her when she gets pissed off.

213
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,427
Whoa. Whoa.
Wait a minute.

214
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,729
She gets upset?

215
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,328
I need to know this. Sit
down. Tell me all about it.

216
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,000
<i>Katie started in right away
about this woman,</i>

217
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:15,138
a buyer for Anthropologie who had
agreed to take a look at her designs.

218
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:21,153
She asked me if I could come home for an hour that
afternoon or let her drop Marissa at my office.

219
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,657
Apparently she'd already set up the
meeting. And what did you tell her?

220
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:30,127
I told her I had surgery. Maybe
if she'd given me more notice-

221
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,165
<i>And how did she react?
She started crying-</i>

222
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,169
begging me, asking if maybe
a nurse could watch Marissa.

223
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,865
I told her, " No.
They have their job to do.' '

224
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,706
<i>So how did you leave it with Katie?
I had to go to work,</i>

225
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,440
so... I left.

226
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,218
I left Marissa there with
her. [Voice Breaks] I'm sorry.

227
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,519
This is just
- [Sobs Quietly] It's okay, Emily.

228
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,025
Showing emotion on the stand
is not a bad thing.

229
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:08,628
I went back to work three weeks after
I brought Marissa home from China.

230
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,261
I told myself it was the best thing.

231
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:16,536
Wouldn't it be easier for her to get used to
the routine and the nanny right from the get-go?

232
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,547
- But was I really thinking about her?
- Okay, stop.

233
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:27,051
You can't let the defense get
even a whiff of self-doubt.

234
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:31,112
You're not guilty, Emily.
Katie is.

235
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,692
[No Audible Dialogue]

236
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,695
So based on the defense witness list,
how's Betts gonna play this?

237
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,731
Well, for sure, accidental death.
Yeah.

238
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,859
Katie's stuck with her statement about Baby
Marissa possibly hitting her head on the playground.

239
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:49,875
And their experts-for-hire will testify that Marissa's injuries
are consistent with a fall and Katie's attempts to revive her.

240
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:54,470
And we counter with
- Doctors who went to med schools you've actually heard of. [Chuckles]

241
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,980
Who argue the injuries
couldn't be accidental.

242
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:01,611
We further destroy their claim of accidental death
by establishing a pattern of violent behavior.

243
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:06,317
All right. Whenever Katie feels powerless,
she takes it out on someone less powerful.

244
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,294
Mm-hmm. Four-year-old Kevin
Rawlings destroyed expensive fabric.

245
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,321
Baby Marissa got in the way
of a really important interview.

246
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,769
Someone get Ravell and Salazar to see
if she had any career setback six weeks ago...

247
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,828
that would coincide with a wrist fracture.

248
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,568
<i>[Woman] Already done. They
interviewed Katie's friend.</i>

249
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:28,477
Eve Walsh says Katie missed a sign-up deadline and
was shut out of a class at the Fashion Institute.

250
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,643
Great. Now if we can just get
the evidence pastJudge Patel-

251
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,186
That just got a lot more difficult.

252
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:40,191
Motion to quash our subpoena of
Kevin Rawlings, filed by his parents.

253
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,795
<i>Aside from the obvious competency issues,
where is the relevance, Miss Gaffney?</i>

254
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:52,394
- Once Your Honor hears the witness testimony, it will
be- - That's not what I asked. I asked you to tell me-

255
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:57,204
- As we stated in our brief- - I read your brief. If that's
all you've got, I'm going to allow the motion to quash.

256
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,508
Mr. And Mrs. Rawlings, your child
does not have to appear in this matter.

257
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,105
<i>Moving on. I've taken the
liberty of reviewing...</i>

258
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,675
<i>the pre and postmortem
photos of the decedent.</i>

259
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,778
I find them to be unduly prejudicial.

260
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:15,487
<i>- Your Honor, Stevens clearly states that relevant
photographs- - Stick it in your appeal file, Miss Gaffney.</i>

261
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:19,998
<i>Next, the admissibility
of the wrist fracture, a previous injury.</i>

262
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,363
[Quietly]
You do it. He's out to kill me.

263
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,528
- [Clears Throat Quietly]
- Miss Kibre?

264
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,735
<i>Your Honor, Neer states, in cases of child
abuse when the crime occurred in the home,</i>

265
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,542
prior injuries are relevant in establishing
that the death was not accidental.

266
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,380
- Mr. Betts, I assume you want to be heard on this?
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.

267
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:45,014
Uh, admission of further injuries would lead to
juror confusion and be prejudicial to my client.

268
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,456
You want to give me some cases, Mr. Betts?

269
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,359
<i>Well, obviously the Neer case.</i>

270
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,557
<i>[Judge Patel] The case that Miss
Kibrejust cited? [Betts] Yes.</i>

271
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,793
<i>[Judge Patel] You're gonna
have to do better than that.</i>

272
00:18:55,868 --> 00:19:00,237
Based on that argument, I have no choice
but to allow the prosecution's motion.

273
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,296
<i>[Gavel Raps]</i>

274
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,178
[Sighs] Reassign me.
I'm hurting the case.

275
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,840
Stop making this personal.
Patel's making it personal.

276
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,146
Because of me, we lost the motion to
quash, the admissibility of the photos-

277
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,413
You missed the biggest thing
that happened in there.

278
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,888
Why did Betts fold on the wrist fracture?
Why didn't he fight us?

279
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,256
He wants it in.
Because it works for him.

280
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,194
Stop worrying about Patel
and worry about that.

281
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:29,633
If I err on the side of caution
- Caution? You're misinterpreting the law.

282
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:34,138
<i>Stevens is about inflammatory images.
Exclude the autopsy photos, fine.</i>

283
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:38,666
But to exclude something- What- a picture of an
adorable baby in the arms of her loving mother?

284
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,407
You're supplying the adjectives, Sam, not
me. Yes, b-but- but that's the subtext.

285
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,110
See, all babies are adorable,
just as all mothers are loving.

286
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:51,213
If that doesn't inflame the jury into a thirst for
vengeance, even if the facts don't sustain the argument-

287
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,728
You're withholding facts- what the baby
looked like healthy, her- her size, her weight.

288
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,922
I'll give them measurements.

289
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:04,401
- Where is this coming from? - Certain
people are so hell-bent on trying to turn-

290
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,097
<i>What- "certain people"-
What- do you mean women?</i>

291
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:13,008
<i>Hey, it might even be a good thing, you know, a
Darwinian advantage- uh, mothers protecting their young-</i>

292
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,809
but with women, there is an inability
to be rational when a baby is involved.

293
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:21,148
[Chuckling] Yeah. Do you
know how sexist this sounds?

294
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,417
Well, slapping a label on it
doesn't make it any less true.

295
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,720
<i>Ah, so you're going to
personally defend this girl...</i>

296
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,785
against vindictive women like me,
hopped up on estrogen?

297
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:35,060
I am going to make sure that she gets
a fair trial based on the facts.

298
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,000
I very much doubt that.

299
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,768
Well, thank you, Amanda.
You've actually proven my point.

300
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:51,479
<i>Only one person had the motive and the
opportunity to commit this terrible crime:</i>

301
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,484
Katie Nevins.

302
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,783
<i>We will prove that Katie was frustrated-</i>

303
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,757
panicked that her big opportunity
was passing her by.

304
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:07,322
<i>The prosecution's job is to
convince you and to prove to you...</i>

305
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,836
that Katie Nevins
killed that little girl.

306
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:17,136
All I have to do is raise a reasonable doubt in your
minds, and I can do that. But I'm gonna go you one better.

307
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,144
After all, a little girl died here.

308
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:24,649
<i>I'm gonna prove to you this
terrible tragedy was an accident,</i>

309
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:29,210
<i>and I'm gonna prove-
prove to you-</i>

310
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,780
that my client did not cause it.

311
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,452
<i>Thank you.</i>

312
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,161
He can't prove anything. It's all smoke
and mirrors. Well, he's not stupid.

313
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,728
He wouldn't have raised expectations if
he didn't think he could deliver something.

314
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,674
What? There are no witnesses. Katie said in
her statement that she was alone with Marissa...

315
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,473
from 6:00 a.m. When Emily left
until the paramedics arrived.

316
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,480
Well, what if she wasn't alone?

317
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:00,609
What if at the last minute she got someone
to babysit for her and something went wrong?

318
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,951
The cops already checked the security
tapes from the Downey building that day.

319
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,718
Yeah. Well, now our people
are gonna check them.

320
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:14,122
<i>We're gonna need coverage of the lobby and
the corridor outside the Downey apartment...</i>

321
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,066
from 5:00 a.m. To 5:00 p.m.
The day Marissa was murdered.

322
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:21,435
We maintain coverage, uh, goin' back eight
months. There's cameras in every public space.

323
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,705
<i>- A shame you don't have any footage from inside the apartment.
- [Typing]</i>

324
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,713
I guess for the Paris Hilton stuff
the tenants are on their own.

325
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,545
<i>That morning,
I went into her room, and...</i>

326
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:36,451
she was in her crib, smiling.

327
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,116
She had this little stuffed panda
that she liked to sleep with, and...

328
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,561
she was kissing it and then
holding it out for me to kiss.

329
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,063
It was a sign to me
of how well she was doing.

330
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,226
<i>What do you mean by that?
She was showing affection-</i>

331
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,898
<i>feeling attached
to her things, to me.</i>

332
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:58,067
<i>After a year
of institutional care in China,</i>

333
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,078
she was really blossoming.

334
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,114
How was her health?

335
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:08,778
<i>Her pediatrician and I did a thorough
work-up. Marissa was in excellent health.</i>

336
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:15,420
So during this exhaustive workup, did your
pediatrician detect Marissa's wrist fracture?

337
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,827
- No.
- And you're a physician, are you not?

338
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,923
- Objection.
- Sustained.

339
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,938
You say you bonded
with Marissa rather quickly.

340
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,439
I loved her from the moment I saw her.

341
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,238
- And when you say "love," what do you mean by that?
- Objection. Relevance?

342
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,177
<i>Dr. Downey's never been married.
She doesn't have any other children.</i>

343
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,375
Now, I know she is a respected
and admired professional.

344
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,251
I'm just trying to understand
if she can separate love from being loved.

345
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,482
Move on.

346
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,688
I call your attention
to the People's exhibit 13.

347
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,360
Do you recognize that?

348
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,462
Yes. Those are the notes I took
when Katie called me.

349
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,873
<i>The call informing you that your daughter was
gravely ill and being rushed to the hospital.</i>

350
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:09,175
<i>- [Downey] Yes.
- So your daughter's dying, you have the presence of mind to make notes?</i>

351
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,216
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

352
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,188
Read the last sentence, please.

353
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,691
"Child non-responsive
to repeated auditory commands.' '

354
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,491
<i>And by the "child," you're
referring to Marissa, your daughter?</i>

355
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:31,161
- It's a habit.
- Referring to Marissa generically as the "child"?

356
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,227
No. It's medical shorthand.

357
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,706
Uh-huh.

358
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,542
<i>[Betts Sighs] Now, exhibit
24. [Paper Rustling]</i>

359
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,844
<i>Would you tell thejury what this is?</i>

360
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,085
It's an organ donation form.

361
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,417
Yeah. And that is your
signature there? Yes.

362
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,425
<i>And this time here, I believe, refers to the time you signed it
- the time you agreed...</i>

363
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,654
to donate your daughter's organs?

364
00:24:56,728 --> 00:25:01,597
<i>Can you read that time?
"1:37 a.m., November 3.' '</i>

365
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:06,535
<i>Marissa didn't actually die
until 8: 13 that morning, did she?</i>

366
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,438
No.

367
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,571
So for a good seven hours before that,

368
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:18,582
you're giving away her eyes
and her kidneys and her lungs.

369
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,118
She was effectively-

370
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,089
- Her E.E.G.
- Your daughter isn't even dead yet, and you're giving away her heart?

371
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,718
- Objection!
- It's standard protocol when-

372
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,729
<i>[Betts]
Withdrawn.</i>

373
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,789
I'm done.

374
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,826
[Sniffles]

375
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:49,238
<i>At least two mechanisms were
involved in Baby Marissa's death:</i>

376
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,442
The first, a violent shaking
or swinging of the head,

377
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,418
the second, a severe blow to
the head against a blunt surface.

378
00:25:55,487 --> 00:26:00,186
Now it is possible that one of these
mechanisms could have occurred accidentally,

379
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:06,197
<i>but two together in a short space of time-
the chances of that are practically nil.</i>

380
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,824
Thank you.

381
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:15,840
- Doctor, are you familiar with a condition called "talk, deteriorate, and die"?
- Yes.

382
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:21,004
And in these cases, isn't it true that even
though these patients suffer severe head trauma,

383
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,513
they continue to behave normally?

384
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,575
It's a very rare condition.
But it happens?

385
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:32,521
- Uh, well, yes- - So isn't it possible that
Marissa Downey sustained her skull fracture...

386
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:37,028
at an earlier date and still continued
to walk around as if nothing were wrong?

387
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,620
<i>Objection. Calls for speculation.</i>

388
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:43,464
<i>Your Honor, the People
put up this witness as an expert.</i>

389
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,764
I'll allow it.

390
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,603
Please answer the question.

391
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,610
In this case,
the likelihood of that-

392
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,442
Is it possible, Doctor? Yes or no.

393
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,642
The possibility is so remote that I wouldn't even
- Is it possible?

394
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,653
Yes.

395
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,712
Thank you, Doctor.

396
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:11,219
Oh, one other... thing. You testified
that Marissa fractured her wrist...

397
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,230
six weeks before her death.

398
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,394
<i>That would be, uh, September 22.</i>

399
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,398
- I would have to look at a calendar.
- Oh, well, I have one. It's, uh-

400
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,875
It's one of those... ones you get
at the dry cleaners. [Chuckles]

401
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,978
Yes. September 22,
give or take a few days. Sure.

402
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,216
Thank you, Doctor.
Nothing further.

403
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:45,854
<i>[Typing] My shift is over.
Nick here can help you out.</i>

404
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,128
You mind? We're on a tight
schedule. [Nick] Yeah.

405
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:55,495
This again? How many times do I gotta stare
at the footage of this friggin' corridor?

406
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:59,031
I mean, first the cops, then that P.I., and what
- now you guys?

407
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,204
Whoa, whoa. A private investigator
asked you to play this footage?

408
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,738
Yeah. This hallway, but a different
day. It was like six weeks earlier.

409
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:09,082
Look. I burned the guy a DVD.

410
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,251
<i>- [Judge Patel] Arguments?
- Where do I begin?</i>

411
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:19,763
Apart from the fact that the footage is inflammatory
and prejudicial against the mother of the victim,

412
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,061
there's also the issue
of unfair surprise.

413
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,864
Mr. Betts obtained this footage a
week ago and has been sitting on it.

414
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,871
<i>Mr. Betts, is this true?
No.</i>

415
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:32,933
I only recently got my hands on a copy and didn't
get a chance to watch it until yesterday, Your Honor.

416
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,945
<i>Miss Kibre?</i>

417
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:39,712
<i>Well, unless you have evidence to refute Mr. Betts's
story, I'm gonna have to take him at his word.</i>

418
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,718
With that in mind, I'll allow it.

419
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:45,779
<i>Then what about the fact that not only is
it irrelevant, but also too remote in time?</i>

420
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,917
<i>Need I remind you, counselor, that it
was the People who insisted on having...</i>

421
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:52,827
the prior wrist fracture
admitted as evidence?

422
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,389
You made your bed on this one.
I'm calling back the jury.

423
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:01,997
<i>[Betts] Now, this is surveillance video recorded
in the hallway outside Dr. Downey's apartment.</i>

424
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,203
<i>Now pay particular attention
to the force this woman uses...</i>

425
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:10,304
<i>to grab her child's wrist
and yank her from the elevator-</i>

426
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:16,183
<i>a desperate mother supercharged by
adrenaline, unconscious ofher own strength.</i>

427
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,815
<i>- And what is the date on this footage?
- [Nick] September 22.</i>

428
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,522
September 22?

429
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:30,535
That's the same day that the medical
examiner said Marissa had fractured her wrist.

430
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,313
I guess I kinda knew
something was wrong.

431
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,850
For those last few weeks,
Marissa had been really irritable.

432
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,479
She was crying a lot,
unable to get comfortable.

433
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,853
Did you say anything to Emily?

434
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,518
<i>Well, l- I figured she's a doctor.</i>

435
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,858
If the baby was sick,
she'd do something.

436
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,899
And the one time I did say something,
she kind of blew it off.

437
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:07,233
What did you say? She had just come
home. It was about 8:00 at night.

438
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,435
Emily always had calls to return,
and she liked... it to be quiet.

439
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,410
And Marissa was just being
really fussy, and...

440
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,880
I said she'd been like that all day
and maybe she was sick.

441
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,110
And how did she respond to that?

442
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:23,643
She handed me a cookie
and told me to give it to Marissa.

443
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:28,954
<i>Did you? All that sugar that late?
Marissa would never have gone to bed.</i>

444
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,987
I guess since Emily was never really
there at bedtime, she didn't realize the-

445
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,660
- Objection.
- Miss Nevins, please answer the question.

446
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:41,432
<i>No, I didn't give her the cookie.
I ate it myself.</i>

447
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,236
<i>[Betts]
One last question.</i>

448
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,278
[Sighs]
Just to be clear,

449
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,405
did you shake Marissa Downey...

450
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:55,919
and then slam her head into a blunt, hard
surface, causing those horrible injuries?

451
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,251
No, sir.

452
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,521
I loved Marissa. I never would
have done anything to hurt her.

453
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,654
Thank you, Katie.
Nothing further.

454
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,469
What kind of cookie?

455
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,332
Oh, um, I think it was-

456
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,775
Is this relevant?

457
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,283
I'll withdraw the question.
I've already gotten my answer.

458
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,979
Please ignore Miss Kibre's last remark.

459
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:35,452
<i>Can you show me exactly where
Baby Marissa was in relation to you...</i>

460
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:40,225
when you told the 911 operator,
"She's right here, right next to me"?

461
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:49,335
Okay. And then the operator told you
to tilt her head back and check the airway?

462
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,572
I just kind of opened her mouth.

Thank you.

Mr. Betts wants you
to "believe your own eyes,"

and by that he means
the video footage that he played for you.

501
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:23,877
Well, that video shows a mother
protecting her own child.

502
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,150
Emily didn't hurt Baby Marissa-

503
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:31,457
not to the extent that we all saw
on the X-rays and the C.T. Scans.

There's no way the defendant had enough
time to follow the operator's instructions.

517
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:34,386
<i>I could barely get the baby's head back.
She didn't check the airway.</i>

518
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,451
Why? Because she knew
there was nothing blocking it.

519
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,862
She knew exactly what was wrong
with that baby.

520
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:45,130
She had just smashed her head in.

00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,299
<i>She needed to get to that interview,

so she started shaking her to shut her up!

- All right, Miss Kibre. We get the idea.
