NARRATOR: Le Vaillant was
struck by the hypocrisy

12
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,770
of killing fellow human beings
in the name of religion.

13
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:31,859

professed belief in the same God.

The Fazar, Le Vaillant's written
account of his experiences,

15
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,241
tells us he wandered
the streets of Jerusalem

16
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,120
for days after that bloody battle,

17
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,789
until he found
the entrance of a cave

18
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,209
that ran beneath
the length of the holy city.

19
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,921
Inside that cave, he began
to record his epiphany,

20
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,300
which became the basis
for a new religious sect.

21
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,511
An order combining
the fundamental tenets

22
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,598
of the three major religions
of his day.

23
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,934
His first converts were
Christian knights

24
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,354
who'd also become disenchanted
by the bloodshed.

25
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,568
The force of his convictions even won
over a number of Muslims and Jews.

to be added as the final chapter.
