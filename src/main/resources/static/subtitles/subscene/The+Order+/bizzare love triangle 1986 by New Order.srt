1
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,200
Every time I think of you

2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,200
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue

3
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,200
It's no problem of mine

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
But it's a problem I find

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Living a life that I can't leave behind

6
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,700
But there's no sense in telling me

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,300
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
But that's the way that it goes

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,700
And it's what nobody knows

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Well every day my confusion grows

11
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,300
Every time I see you falling

12
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,200
I get down on my knees and pray

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm waiting for that final moment

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,300
You say the words that I can't say

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,700
I feel fine and I feel good

16
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,300
I'm feeling like I never should

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,300
Whenever I get this way

18
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,500
I just don't know what to say

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,700
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday

20
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm not sure what this could mean

21
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,700
I don't think you're what you seem

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,500
I do admit to myself

23
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,700
That if I hurt someone else

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,900
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,300
Every time I see you falling

26
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,000
I get down on my knees and pray

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,300
I'm waiting for that final moment

28
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,200
You say the words that I can't say

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,900
Every time I see you falling

30
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,700
I get down on my knees and pray

31
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm waiting for that final moment

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,900
You say the words that I can't say

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,200
Every time I see you falling

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,000
I get down on my knees and pray

35
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm waiting for that final moment

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,100
You say the words that I can't say
