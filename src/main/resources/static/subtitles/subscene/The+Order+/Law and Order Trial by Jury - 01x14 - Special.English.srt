You ran from the Winslow and stopped
- Down here.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,413
He had a hold of her.

8

<i>Where?
Uh, here. Here.</i>

9
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,020
He had her up against the wall,
this homeless guy.

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:33,088
H-He was pressed against her,
and then she was screaming.

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,226
And then he started swingin' at me,
so I swung back.

12
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,236
But I didn't mean-

13
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,740
That-That's how come I called 911.

Officer Montez was first
on the scene.

18

The victim is a vagrant,
mid to late thirties, no I.D.

Not anymore. The
doorman? Andres Voychek.

<i>Where is she now? We let her
go. She lives at the Winslow.</i>

23

25
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,012

- He's fine. He's down at the precinct answering some questions.

Yes.

You're not addressing Congress, Andres.
Just tell the people what happened.

64
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,645
Tell them the truth. But I told the
police, and that got me arrested.

65
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,808
I didn't do anything wrong.
I saved her.

66
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,113
And the grand jury needs
to hear that directly from you-

67
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,120
Your innocence,
your deep remorse.

68
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,817
That way, in the unlikely event this were ever to go to trial
- Trial?

69
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,622
But you said all I do is explain
to the grand jury and this is over.

70
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,890
I'm sure it will be.
When they hear from Abigail-

there's no chance they'll indict.

Yes.

<i>I was on door.

81
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,504
I heard the screaming, and l-I just
started running toward the sound.

00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,510
<i>[Kibre]
And what did you find?</i>

83
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,241

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,514
Mr. Ashford.

85
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:24,750
<i>He had Ms. Phillips by the wrists
up against the wall.</i>

86
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,918
She was trying real hard
to fight him off,

87
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,430
but he was too strong for her,
so I grabbed him.

88
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,024
You pulled him away?
Yeah.

89
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:40,766
L-I figured he'd run, but instead
he started beating on me.

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,936
- And you fought back?
- I had no choice.

91
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,574
I am real sorry for how
it turned out.

92
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,378
Questions?

93
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,519
Had you ever seen
the homeless man before?

94
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,853
Once or twice, but not regular.

95
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,359
Were you afraid for your life?

96
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,554
I didn't stop to think.

97
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,691
L-I saw she was in trouble,

98
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,259
I did what any person would do.

99
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,538
Thank you, Mr. Voychek.

100
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,907
Excuse me, are you Ms. Kibre?
Yes.

101
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,470
They told me you're trying
the Voychek case.

102
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,142
The man he killed-
he was my brother.

103
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,620

Oh, Justine.

him a hero. Did you know that?</i>

106
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,659
I took off work today,
but they told me I'm not allowed inside.

107
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,131
Well, the grand jury testimony is sealed,

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,101
but you'll be allowed in the
courtroom if it goes to trial. Lf?

109
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,963
Uh- I read the papers.

110
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,235
I know what a good story
this makes.

111
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,574
But I also knew my brother.
There's no way he attacked that girl.

112
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,637
He had no reason to.

113
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,482
<i>I had dinner with some friends
in SoHo.</i>

114
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,248
And we shared a cab back uptown.

115
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,813
They dropped me off on my corner
so they could cut across the park.

116
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,190
When did you first see
the man who attacked you?

117
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,822
<i>[Abigail] When I was a block from the
Winslow. He was walking towards me.</i>

118
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,527
<i>- I was gonna cross the street.
- Why didn't you?</i>

119
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,230
Can you believe
I didn't wanna be rude?

120
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,002
I could see my building up ahead,
so I thought l-

121
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,339
I thought I'd be okay.

122
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,514
<i>Do you need a minute?
No.</i>

123
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:33,018
He pulled me into the alley
and down the stairs...

124
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,349
and pushed me up against the wall.

125
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,480
He had my hands above his head.

126
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,718
<i>I could smell him.
It felt like a badjoke,</i>

127
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,159
like this isn't what happens
to me, is it?

128
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,561
I was shaking and started screaming,

129
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,622
and then there was Voychek.

130
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,863
So Mr. Voychek pulled
Mr. Ashford off of you?

131
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,500
He had the guy by his shirt. But when
he let go, the man started swinging.

132
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:01,172
They fought?
I only saw it for a minute. But-

133
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,842
'Cause I ran up the stairs.

134
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,819
So you feel safer now?
For the first time in four months.

135
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,389
The man was stalking me.

136
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,691
Ms. Phillips, what do
you mean by stalking?

137
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,537
I'd get up to 15 calls a night.
Hang ups.

138
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,075
Sometimes he would just
sit on the line, listening.

139
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,542
<i>At first I thought it was
a fax or a wrong number,</i>

140
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,546
<i>but there were never cranks
on my machine.</i>

141
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,048
The calls only started
once I got home.

142
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,755
- Anything else?
- Letters full of personal information.

143
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,883
Like what I'd worn that day
or who I'd had lunch with.

144
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,225
Did you contact the police?
File a report?

145
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,460
<i>I did call the police,
but I never followed through.</i>

146
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,401
I wasn't gonna let someone
get to me like that.

147
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,133
The man who attacked me
was the man who was stalking me.

148
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,973
But how exactly did you
make that connection?

149
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,305
Just before he approached me
he said my name.

150
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,978
How else could he know my name?

151
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,816
I need you to pull Abigail Phillips's
phone records.

152
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,557
- The girl with the guardian angel? - We're looking
to tie the victim to some late-night phone calls.

153
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,326
<i>The homeless guy?</i>

154
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,666
Well, I guess you don't need an Upper West
Side address to reach out and touch someone.

155
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,107
I'm gonna need them today.

156
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,167
No problem. I'm fast.

157
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,509
That's what I hear.

158
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,685
You didn't like the grand jury? It was
like they were judging me on everything-

159
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,348
How I spoke, what I
was wearing. They were.

160
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,790
And you survived.
My guess? It's over.

161
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,454
A little help from my friends.
Thanks, Greg. The least I could do.

162
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,896
I can't tell you how good it feels
to have my life back.

163
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,332
Hey. Wait a minute.

164
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,997
I hate to ask, but could you
take Voychek something for me?

165
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,735
I don't know what says
thank you for saving my life,

166
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,040
<i>but flowers are universal,
right? [Man] Thank you.</i>

167
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,071
Oh, and this is for you.

168
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,118
He doesn't know I'm covering this
for him, does he? Haven't said a word.

169
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,381
Let's keep it that way.

170
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,721
I tied all those crank calls Abigail
Phillips's been getting to a prepaid cellular.

171
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,819
That's virtually impossible to trace.
Eh, for some.

172
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,296
Stop dancing.
What do ya got?

173
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,166
Not impossible if you have a taped
conversation coming from the same cell phone.

174
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,698
<i>That 911 call the doorman
made at the scene...</i>

175
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,335
came from the same cell phone
as all the calls Abigail's been getting.

176
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,005
Voychek's her stalker.

177
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,222
So a good guy does a good thing.
Will the grand jury see a problem?

178
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,453
All I see are coincidences.

179
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,826
There's no coincidences in murder.

180
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,331
After four months of calls and letters,

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,063
the girl just happens to get jumped
on his watch?

182
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,163
Not a straight line to murder two?

183
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,678
Andres Voychek was so obsessed with Abigail
Phillips, maybe he would kill for her.

184
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,873
That's where I'm heading.

185
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,247
I'll get a search warrant
to look into his apartment.

186
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:31,017
Every day there's another puff piece
about Andres Voychek.

187
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,550
Where he gets his uniform pressed,
how he takes his coffee.

188
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:40,190
And my brother, whenever they
mention him, is simply the victim.

189
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,734
He doesn't even get a name.

190
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,736
William.

191
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,306
He preferred Billy.

192
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,844
Justine, you're my only
connection to Billy.

193
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,847
I need you to help me
put a face on him.

194
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,546
How did he wind up on the streets?
Did he have a history of mental illness?

195
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,553
He was tested.

196
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,455
He had problems with focus, boundaries,

197
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,961
but there was no official name
you could hang on it.

198
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,329
I checked his police records. There's
no bookings for aggressive behavior.

199
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,166
No, just the opposite. It was him
who was usually getting roughed up.

200
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,400
Always wanting to make friends
with people who didn't want any.

201
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,102
Do you know where
he was staying most recently?

202
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,770
He mentioned the Bowery.

203
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,275
I wish I could be more specific.

204
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,080
Okay, well, thank you.

205
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,645
If there's anything more,
we'll call you. Okay.

206
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,759
Oh, sweet dog.
When did he go missing?

207
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,628
Um. The night Billy was killed.

208
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,633
The dog was his.

209
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,169
Winston.

210
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:55,367
I figured the least I could do
for Billy now was to find him.

211
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,808
- Uh, could I take one of those?
- Oh, sure.

212
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,869
Thank you.

213
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,752
<i>Pretty nice for a doorman. [Salazar]
Wonder ifhe needs a roommate?</i>

214
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,759
We're dealing with a freak.

215
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,061
Why? 'Cause he's anal?

216
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:26,196
No. Because no one but our guy
has ever set foot in this place.

217
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,231
You employing some sort of
female intuition technique?

218
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,642
Date enough in this town,
you get a sixth sense for freaks.

219
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,680
This guy doesn't get out much.

220
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,775
<i>He doesn't need to.
He's got all his friends right here.</i>

221
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:45,050
Wow. Good to have hobbies.

222
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:49,857
We should check out the storage space. The
landlord was kind enough to give us the key.

223
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,833
It's divided up into apartments.

224
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,335
I can't believe people
still hold on to this junk.

225
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,998
One man gathers
what another man spills.

226
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,007
Yeah, well,
it still looks like junk.

227
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,067
<i>It's right here.
[Lock Clicks]</i>

228
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,621
Ooh. Look at this.

229
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,019
That's not Abigail.

230
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,964
Looks like Voychek's
got more than one crush.

231
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,399
Let's just hope
this one's still breathing.

232
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,137
<i>Her name is Blythe Cotton.</i>

233
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,734
Blythe Cotton also lived
at the Winslow.

234
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,973
Voychek's playground.

235
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,107
March of last year she took off,
leaving five months on her lease.

236
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,449
Tell me this doesn't lead
to a landfill in Jersey.

237
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,853
More like Portland. She moved there
for a promotion. It checks out.

238
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,449
<i>So Voychek exhibits a pattern ofbehavior.</i>

239
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:59,896
But we have no evidence beyond some
year-old grocery receipts and some snapshots.

240
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,069
What are you saving for last?
How about a police report?

241
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,473
Ms. Cotton filed this two months
before catching her flight.

242
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,473
She was being stalked.

243
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,143
<i>[Man] Great. I wanna get another. Um,
give me a big heroic smile. Thank you.</i>

244
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,347
Are these boys bothering you,
Andres? [Laughs] Hello, Ms. Phillips.

245
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,982
How about a shot of
the hero and the girl?

246
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,992
Do you mind?

247
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,654
<i>[Woman] Aw. This way, Ms. Phillips.</i>

248
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,822
<i>[Woman]
Over here. Over here.</i>

249
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,794
<i>Andres, over here.
[Woman] Can I get one more?</i>

250
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,703
[Sniffs]
Hey. It's Kelly, right?

251
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,832
Yeah, good memory.

252
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,933
I was wondering if we could talk.

253
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,447
<i>[Voychek] Um, I really don't
think it was that heroic.</i>

254
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,449
[Man] How do you feel
about your new status?

255
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,850
First time in months
I've done the reservoir.

256
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,289
Yeah, I love to run. But the D.A.' s office
requires a vow against leisure activities, so-

257
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,623
For a while I didn't wanna risk it.
But now things are back to normal.

258
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,822
Well, the grand jury's still open.

259
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,492
That's just a formality, right?
I mean, I've got my life back.

260
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,628
- Ms. Phillips- - And once this is
over, Voychek can get on with his.

261
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,503
Okay. Abigail,

262
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,306
we traced the calls that
you've been getting to a cell phone.

263
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,404
William Ashford did not make them.

264
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,678
<i>Of course he did. I told you-
Andres Voychek did.</i>

265
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,719
That's not-You're wrong.

266
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,720
I wish I were.

267
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,349
- We searched his apartment. We found pictures of you.
- No.

268
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:38,226
- I saw them, Abigail.
- That's crazy. He's barely even looked me in the eye.

269
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,698
You know the type. He's awkward
but harmless. He's a decent guy.

270
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,600
<i>We also found proof that
he's done this before. Stop.</i>

271
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,264
Right now. I don't wanna hear it,
and I don't believe you.

272
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,365
<i>Well, I understand why
you don't want to believe me,</i>

273
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,535
but right now I'm concerned
for your safety.

274
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,377
<i>I want you to pack a bag,
call a friend that you can stay with.</i>

275
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,042
If you have any vacation time,
I suggest that you take it.

276
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,011

277
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,950
<i>When I made thejump over

278
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,518
<i>I never figured I'd be on
pooch patrol. [Dog Barking]</i>

279
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,394
You never said why you made that
jump. You're right. I didn't.

280
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,866
Can I have some change? How do we
know whoever has the dog knows our vic?

281
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:21,338
People give their cars to valets,
their babies to nannies. But a dog-

282
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,932
A dog they give
to a trusted friend.

283
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,569
Hey. He friendly?

284
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,579
He looks rough,
but he's friendly.

285
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,581
Hey there, big fella.

286
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,709
You had him long? Aw, he's not
mine. He belongs to a friend.

287
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,152
His name wouldn't happen
to be Billy Ashford?

288
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,155
[Laughs]

289
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,350
Looks like you're gonna be
dog-sittin' for a while.

290
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,156
<i>Yeah, we think we might have seen
your friend Billy uptown.</i>

291
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,891
Any reason you could think of
he'd be there? Say, upper 80s?

292
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,162
- Oh, yeah. Doin' a run.
- What do you mean, a run?

293
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,329
The buildings up there, they have funds.
Try to keep their stoops clean.

294
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,339
Yeah. We take turns hittin' 'em up.

295
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,841
If he's up there workin',
he'll be back soon.

296
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,845
I'm afraid he's not coming back.

<i>Your friend attacked a woman.</i>

[Sighs]
Oh.

300
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,582
He was only supposed to scare her.

301
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,087
<i>Who?
Some girl.</i>

302
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,287
Billy was about pleasing people.

303
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:23,562
- You said he was supposed to scare somebody?
- The man said it was his girlfriend.

304
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,935
<i>[Man] You know who this guy
was? We knew him from our runs.</i>

305
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,838
A doorman.

306
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,711
Why? You told me to tell my story
to the grand jury. I did that.

307
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,716
Why-Why is this not over?

308
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,218
I can't continue representing you.
There's a conflict.

309
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:45,017
- What conflict?
- Abigail was paying me to represent you.

310
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,025
The prosecutors have filed a motion
to disqualify me. I won't oppose it.

311
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,255
Abbie was paying you for me?

312
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,458
She was concerned for you.

313
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,902
- I am not alone.
- Mr. Voychek,

314
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,202
<i>I came to give you the name of
- Abbie, she's on my side.</i>

315
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,799
I would never let anyone hurt her.

316
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:13,008
- You want to make me the bad guy, but she won't believe you.
- That's not what this is about.

317
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,019
I'm gonna call her.

318
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:19,387
- No, no, no. I'll go to her apartment
and explain- - No, you can't do that.

319
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,153
I have to talk to her.
No.

320
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:25,993
I'm advising you to stay away
from Abigail Phillips.

321
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,527
- What's this?
- An excellent lawyer.

322
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,663
I've spoken with him.
He wants to take the case.

323
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,507
You'll need him.

324
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,011

00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,183
Yours.

328
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,622
True bill.

329
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,367
We got him.

330
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,312
Did you get my message?
The grand jury indicted.

331
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,844
A friend of mine went by my
apartment today and picked up my mail.

332
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,424
Did you read them?
One was enough.

333
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,659
Well, this will help.

334
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,760
I honestly thought he'd saved my life.

335
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,601
That was the point.

336
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,938
Killing William Ashford
was just a consequence.

337
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,682
He tried to run.

338
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,211
- Who?
- The man-

339
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,520
Mr. Ashford. He tried to run, but
Voychek held on. He kept hitting him.

340
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,757
- Would you testify to that at trial?
- Will it matter?

341
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,666
I've been in the papers, on TV,
calling Voychek a hero.

342
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,298
Who will believe me now?

343
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,371
<i>[Bailiff] Docket number 267805,
People versus Andres Voychek.</i>

344
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,383
<i>Murder in the second degree.</i>

345
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,182
<i>Could representing counsel
and defendant please step forward?</i>

346
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,884
<i>[Judge] Mr. A dler. What's
prompted you to visit the plebeians?</i>

347
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,484
I believe an innocent man
deserves the best defense.

348
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,688
If it comes attached
to a long line of zeros.

349
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,857
My client is a doorman,
Your Honor.

350
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,526
- How do you plead?
- N-Not guilty, sir.

351
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,002
<i>Kelly Gaffney for the People,
Your Honor.</i>

352
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,665
Based on the serious allegations
involving violence,

353
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,140
and the strength of the People's case,
we ask for a remand.

354
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,201
This was a tragic accident.
Mr. Voychek has no prior record.

355
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,737
He's had the same job and lived in
the same apartment for the last eight years.

356
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,979
<i>Glad to hear it.
I'm setting cash bail at 500,000.</i>

357
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,419
The building in which my client
is employed set up a fund.

358
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,686
- We'll post this afternoon.
- The defendant also stands accused of stalking Abigail Phillips.

359
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,989
The People ask Your Honor
for an order of protection.

360
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,996
Granted.

361
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,362
Mr. Voychek, you are to
stay away from Ms. Phillips.

362
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,924
<i>No phone. No mail.
No personal visits.</i>

363
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,199
Stay away means exactly that-
stay away.

364
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,206

[Judge] Mr. Santos-</i>

"Motion to suppress the box

369
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,715
Surprise.

370
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,896
<i>[Voychek]
I don't remember.</i>

371
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,956
<i>[Adler] You hear a woman's screams
and don't remember what you were doing?</i>

372
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:53,437
<i>[Voychek] Like I said, I was
working. I was up front by the door.</i>

373
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:58,135
Inside or out?
I don't know. Out, I guess.

374
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,374
Oh. So you could actually see
Ms. Phillips walking up the street...

375
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,381
before she was attacked?

376
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,383
No. L-I mean,

377
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,784
I didn't know it was her
until I ran over.

378
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,983
So, you were standing outside
on the sidewalk,

379
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,118
but you had no idea it was
Ms. Phillips walking toward you?

380
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,254
Maybe I was looking the other way.

381
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,159
Isn't it more accurate,
Mr. Voychek,

382
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:30,573
to say that you were acutely aware
of Ms. Phillips's comings and goings...

383
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,576
because you have
intimate feelings for her?

384
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,444
Why do you keep asking me that? No!

385
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:40,417
<i>I already told you, no.</i>

386
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,080
Okay.

387
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,585
Who believes him?

388
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:56,457
Okay. The rest of you, any thoughts?

389
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,168
He's all over the place, like he's
making it up as he goes along.

390
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,199
<i>He can't look you in the eye.
He keeps looking up or down.</i>

391
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,337
I'm sorry, but I don't trust the man.

392
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:12,247
<i>Okay, this has been
a tremendously helpful exercise.</i>

393
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,251
I wanna thank you all very much.

394
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,847
Now, if I could ask the ladies to kindly
step outside for a moment, please?

395
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,518
Thanks again for your time,
ladies.

396
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,628
Thank you.

397
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,687
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

398
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,558
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,241
That's what matters.

400
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,002
All we need is one.

401
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,242
Abigail is a beautiful girl.

402
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,616
I do not want you to deny
your feelings for her, Andres.

403
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,678
<i>I want you to express them.</i>

404
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,848
Your crush-

405
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,121
your chivalric love for Abigail Phillips-

406
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,219
is our defense.

407
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,368
Good news travels quick.

408
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,962
Nine times out of 10
not in our favor.

409
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,030
Yeah, well, the city wanted a hero.

410
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,872
Yeah, you know they got
a wolf in sheep's clothing.

411
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,435
[Scoffs]
Well, savor the moment.

412
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:20,110
Judge Hafner's about to rule on the
admissibility of our major piece of evidence.

413
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,552
The box was found in a storage
space in Mr. Voychek's building.

414
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,954
Meaning the search exceeded
the scope of the warrant.

415
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,993
The defendant has no standing
to challenge this search.

416
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,756
It's a common area
accessible to all the residents.

417
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,025
<i>Ms. Kibre has a point. [Adler] Fine.</i>

418
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:38,365
But if the area was accessible to any one
of the 86 residents living at that address,

419
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,428
then you'll have to agree
the tie between the box,

420
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,634
its contents
and my client is tenuous.

421
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:49,237
That should govern the weight, given the evidence,
not the admissibility. Let the jury decide.

422
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:53,410
The box contained pictures and personal
records of a woman that lived at the Winslow.

423
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,886
That same woman filed a police report
stating she was being stalked.

424
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,651
The report states that
her stalker was unknown.

425
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,318
<i>[Gaffney] In light of the evidence,
we plan to call her as a witness.</i>

426
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,328
That's your prerogative-
Not why we're here.

427
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,991
<i>I reviewed the contents of the box,
and given their nature,</i>

428
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:13,163
I believe their prejudicial effect
outweighs their potential probative value.

429
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,229
<i>The box is out.</i>

430
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,278
<i>Uh, there was a total of
12 pictures of Ms. Phillips.</i>

431
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,576
Six were attached to the fridge,

432
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,014
one in a frame by the bed.

433
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,518
And in any of those photographs...

434
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,613
was Ms. Phillips looking
directly at the camera?

435
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,921
No. They were all candid shots.

436
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,326
Thank you. That's all.

437
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:44,860
Exhibits, uh, 13 and 14.

438
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:49,964
Mr. Salazar, do either of these pictures
look familiar to you?

439
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,635
No. They were attached
to the refrigerator...

440
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,909
<i>alongside the pictures of, uh,
Ms. Phillips. They could have been.</i>

441
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,212
The, uh- the cat.

442
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,685
He belongs to Mrs. Raul
up on the fifth floor.

443
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,087
<i>And the elderly couple
are the Harpers.</i>

444
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,421
They've been in 10A for 20 years.

445
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:13,226
They, uh, always remember to give Mr. Voychek
a little something extra for his birthday.

446
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,132
- Objection. He's testifying.
- Let's find the point, Mr. Adler.

447
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,704
You assume Ms. Phillips's pictures
on his refrigerator...

448
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,742
mean that Andres Voychek
was stalking her?

449
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,176
I wasn't sent to assume.
I was sent to execute a search warrant.

450
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,738
<i>That turned up pictures of a cat.</i>

451
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,580
Now, did you think my client
was stalking it too?

452
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,416
Your Honor.

453
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,388
<i>That's enough of that, Mr.
Adler. [Adler] Apologies.</i>

454
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:43,257
So, you searched high and low,

455
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,058
<i>and the only evidence
you discovered...</i>

456
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:50,568
<i>were a few pictures of residents and pets.</i>

457
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,626
That's all.

458
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,833
<i>You also said
he wouldn't make bail.</i>

459
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,433
But an order of protection stipulates
- I know.

460
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,479
I'm sorry.
I understand.

461
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:05,346
But our case is strong. We have a
witness to the solicitation of the victim.

462
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,351
We have your testimony-
Abigail!

463
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,252
- Abigail! Did you get my letters?
- Officer-

464
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,347
- They won't let me see you!
- Get away from me!

465
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,155
<i>Don't scream! You have to know I didn't
- [Gaffney] Mr. Voychek, please.</i>

466
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:21,187
<i>- [Man] Take it easy!
- She wants to talk to me! She wants to talk to me! Abigail!</i>

467
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,699
<i>[Man] Calm down! Abigail-</i>

468
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,529
I'm- I'm sorry.

469
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,676
We've got a situation.
Abbie just called.

470
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,275
She and the friend
she's staying with ordered pizza.

471
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,584
When, uh, she answered the door,
she found dead flowers on her doorstep.

472
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:49,650
They were the flowers she sent to Voychek,
back when he was her hero.

473
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,789
<i>Where is she now?
Checked in a hotel on our dime.</i>

474
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,299
[Sighs]
Maybe we should have told her.

475
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:01,669
- What?
- That an order of protection is just a piece of paper.

476
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,307
<i>What am I supposed to tell
Abigail Phillips? Trust me?</i>

477
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,576
We request that
Mr. Voychek's bail be revoked.

478
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,243
<i>Abigail wants to see me.
[Judge Hafner] Mr. Voychek,</i>

479
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,583
you have explicitly violated
the terms of your recognizance.

480
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,952
<i>[Adler] Your Honor,
if it even appears to thejury...</i>

481
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:23,119
that Mr. Voychek is in custody,
they could draw a negative conclusion.

482
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,994
It's unfair to infer his guilt before he's
even had a chance to prove his innocence.

483
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,192
<i>I'm not depriving him
of that chance, Mr. A dler.</i>

484
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,031
I'm merely changing
where he spends the night.

485
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,095
<i>I'm remanding the defendant.
[Gavel Raps]</i>

486
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:40,270
<i>[Dr. Link] It's usually an idiosyncratic
thing that attracts the stalker.</i>

487
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:44,008
<i>She's nice.
Helpful, yet unattainable.</i>

488
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,778
But not unattainable
in his mind.

489
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,649
Well, he believes she understands him,
as he does her,

490
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,622
in a real and tangible way.

491
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,215
So why maintain the distance?

492
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,659
Like, why call and then hang up?

493
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,062
His calling would have
an erotic surround to it.

494
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,159
<i>[Kibre] I'm sorry. Can you break down
the terminology for the rest of us?</i>

495
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,967
<i>If she answered, he'd be pleased
that he knew she'd be home.</i>

496
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,702
If she answered again, he'd imagine
she was waiting for the call.

497
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,574
<i>Or if there was
an answering machine turned on,</i>

498
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,807
<i>that she wanted to capture
his message.</i>

499
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:20,544
Now, a woman in this situation,

500
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,883
is there anything at all
that she could do...

501
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,924
to avoid this unwanted attention?

502
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:31,087
No. There is no response
that would slow the progression.

503
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,096
Oh.

504
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,257
Doctor, in your experience,

505
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,393
have you ever known a stalker
who would set up a situation...

506
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,903
where he could then play
the role of a hero?

507
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,406
Absolutely.
The heroic act is a kind of...

508
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,843
<i>reaction formation of
the stalker's building rage.</i>

509
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,939
<i>Rage? Rage fueled by what?</i>

510
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,678
<i>His belief that
the object ofhis affection...</i>

511
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,744
doesn't understand
the depth of his feelings.

512
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,949
It's his way of showing her.

513
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,418
Thank you, Doctor.

514
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,693
How many phone calls would it take
to, uh- to make me a stalker?

515
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,869
That would depend on the case.

516
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:17,431
<i>If Mr. Voychek did feel
an intense bond to Ms. Phillips,</i>

517
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,966
<i>it is possible he felt a similar bond
to others in the building, hmm?</i>

518
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,411
Not to the extent of
his feelings to Ms. Phillips.

519
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,506
But a connection nonetheless.

520
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,848
Meaning, had any one of them-

521
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,445
any of them been threatened-

522
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,286
<i>he would have risked his own life
running to their rescue.</i>

523
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,260
- Objection. Conjecture.
- Sustained.

524
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:43,233
<i>- Seems Mr. Voychek was only guilty of doing his job well.
- You've made your point.</i>

525
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,735
Oh, well. Nothing further then.

526
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,037
So you lied?
No.

527
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,010
Well, Andres Voychek goes from
being the guy who saved my life...

528
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,410
to a depraved sexual predator?
That's what he is.

529
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,848
Which one? You keep changing
your mind. I can't keep track.

530
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,479
You bought him presents, you paid for his legal defense
- I didn't know.

531
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,022
If I had, do you-

532
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,423
He took away my life.
And quite a life it was.

533
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,588
You're recently divorced,
aren't you, Ms. Phillips? Yes.

534
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,326
<i>This your personals page

535
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,925
It got 30 hits on the first day.

536
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,698
<i>You had so many potential boyfriends
to blame it on,</i>

537
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,003

- Tracey.

538
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:27,101
Stop it. It's disgusting.

539
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:36,483
Mr. Adler's client
is looking at murder two.

540
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,650
He doesn't give a rat's ass
about tarnishing your reputation.

541
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,218
I'm all you've got, aren't I?

542
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,933
You're losing.

543
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,869
I didn't ask for this. Oh, my God.
He's not gonna walk?

544
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,702
Not if we're prepared.
We stay focused-

545
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,742
Tell me they won't acquit.

546
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,405
Oh, well.

547
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,210
A lawyer who does that is a liar.

548
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:16,920
<i>[Gaffney] You're currently taking
the drug Geodon for schizophrenia?</i>

549
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,986
Yes.

550
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,562
<i>And you're a heroin user?
I was.</i>

551
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,625
I'm in a meth program now.

552
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,570
Some people from the church,
they come to the Bowery where I live...

553
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,971
and got me signed up.
The Bowery?

554
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,443
That's where the defendant,
Mr. Voychek,

555
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,946
<i>approached you and Mr. A shford?</i>

556
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,279
Yeah, but I told him
it sounded all wrong.

557
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,545
He was really asking Billy.

558
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,747
Did Mr. Voychek ask Billy
to scare Ms. Phillips?

559
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,916
<i>[Man]
He said that she was his girlfriend.</i>

560
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,756
He told Billy where
she'd be and when.

561
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,819
Thank you.

562
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,496
You say it sounded all wrong,

563
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,368
and yet you, uh-
you didn't go to the police?

564
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,273
I did. I called my uncle.

565
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,141
Your uncle?
He was a cop once,

566
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,010
only now he's in Costa Rica.

567
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,607
You can reach him
through the U.S. Embassy.

568
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:18,314
- Is that how you reach him?
- I used to call him direct, before I lost my Spanish.

569
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,486
<i>I can speak seven different languages.
Only not anymore.</i>

570
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,896
I'm sorry. You-You do or you do not
speak seven languages?

571
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,900
<i>[Man]
Just the one now.</i>

572
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:36,406
Before I could speak Vietnamese,
French, Russian, Middle Eastern.

573
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,842
Mr. Johnson, can you say, uh,

574
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,905
"Good morning" to us in,
uh, Middle Eastern?

575
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,155
Not anymore, no.

576
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,748
<i>Is that because Middle Eastern
is not a language?</i>

577
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,785
<i>- Objection. Your Honor.
- [Judge Hafner] Get to the point.</i>

578
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:03,732
When you witnessed this supposed conversation
between my client and Mr. Ashford,

579
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,792
were you loaded?

580
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,167
I don't remember.

581
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,806
He knew that Billy would say yes.

582
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,317
<i>- Billy said yes to anything.
- Mr. Johnson, that's enough.</i>

583
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,478
<i>You killed Billy!
Mr. Johnson, please.</i>

584
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:27,388
<i>- Shut up, you liar!
- You're out of order.</i>

585
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,325
<i>Court officers, restrain that man!
Mr. Voychek!</i>

586
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,225
<i>[Shouting]
Order in this court!</i>

587
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:36,892
<i>- Mr. Voychek, that's enough!
- [Voychek] He's lying! He's lying, Your Honor!</i>

588
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,869

to close it for him.

591
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,516
That's it.

00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,281
<i>One hour recess.

593
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,588
Ready to talk?

594

Come on.
We both have problems.

595
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:11,830
Is your client willing to deal?
I'll test the waters.

596
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,637
Why's he so eager to plea?
Case has lost its glamour.

597
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:21,576
No, I mean Voychek. He didn't
seem like a man ready to give in.

598
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,240
There's only one reason
he would want to-

599
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,409
To protect the very thing that
got him here in the first place.

600
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,419
Abigail.

601
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,853
How do you know Adler
is using her as bait?

602
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,756
<i>'Cause that's exactly what
I would do. [Buzzer Buzzes]</i>

603
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,385
No, no. No plea.

604
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:41,397
Let me take the stand.
Tell things from my side.

605
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,696
Li-Like in the grand jury.
I was a hero.

606
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,567
I can't let you do that.
Why not?

607
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,701
The fact that your last lawyer was
stupid enough to let you testify...

608
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,574
is exactly the reason
I can't let you testify now.

609
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,579
<i>You'll perjure yourself.</i>

610
00:36:56,647 --> 00:37:01,550
<i>People admired me.
She admired me.</i>

611
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,587
I am not guilty.

612
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,147
So you don't want to accept the plea?

613
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,423
All right. Now...

614
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,431
you listen to me.

615
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,900
<i>We still have a shot
at winning this.</i>

616
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,803
Kibre puts Abigail on the stand,

617
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:25,330
I put somebody on her credit report
dating back to college.

618
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,810
We put a call in to her ex-husband.

619
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,838
<i>On cross, we will systematically
tear her apart.</i>

620
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,148
Her story, character.
Her credibility.

621
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,383
We'll paint her as a slut,
a piece of trash.

622
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,391
No!

623
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,520
I'll stand up and say I did it
before I'd let you do that to her.

624
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,830
You say I should plea,

625
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,169
I will plea.

626
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,573
Ravell's on line one.
Something about Abigail.

627
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,781
I wanna run the plea by her, but if
we wait much longer, it could go away.

628
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,585
<i>Yeah. Where are you?</i>

629
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,786
Uh, what are you saying?

630
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,388
Well, find her. I can't push for a plea
without the girl.

631
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,530
Abigail's apartment's
been cleaned out. She's gone.

632
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,400
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Is there a case without her?

633
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,371
Not much.

634
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,374
She could be halfway
to Timbuktu by now.

635
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,343
If Voychek's lawyer doesn't know
Abigail's missing-

636
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,848
<i>Are you suggesting we push for a plea
without our eyewitness?</i>

637
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,877
What if Voychek doesn't take it?

638
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,921
<i>Oh, he'll take it.
But what ifhe doesn't?</i>

639
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,220
They ask for us to provide a witness
and we can't. We lose all credibility.

640
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,817
<i>It's a bluff.
Other D.A.' s have gone there.</i>

641
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,591
We're obligated to inform
his defense lawyer.

642
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,532
<i>Only if we're absolutely certain
that she's slipped.</i>

643
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,035
We don't know that.

644
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,572

00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,746
- Yeah. You got her?
- Alive and well.

654
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,213
Now go get the bad guy.

655
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:54,020
<i>[Judge Hafner] Mr. Voychek, after
listening to your statement of facts,</i>

656
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,616
<i>I accept your plea to
manslaughter in the first degree,</i>

657
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,754
<i>with a sentence to be imposed
of eight years,</i>

658
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,162
as negotiated by both sides.

660
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,607
I am not guilty.

661
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,676
It's still a lose-lose situation
for Abigail.

662
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:26,451
Some crimes don't end at sentencing.
Not for the victim.

663
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,749
We do what we can.
