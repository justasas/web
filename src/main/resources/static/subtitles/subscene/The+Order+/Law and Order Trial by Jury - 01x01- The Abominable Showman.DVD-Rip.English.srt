She was in love with him.

I tried to warn her.
All clichés are true.

7
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,821
But naiveté shouldn't be
a death sentence.

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:34,329
Everybody in this office knows that
Kurt Lascher murdered my daughter.

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,030
- You've known for 19 months.
- Unfortunately, Mrs. Blaylock,

10
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,902
knowing and proving
are very different things.

11

- Her blood-
- Was in the car, but that's inadmissible.

12
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,473
You know that.
It was contaminated.

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,482
So you're saying what?

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,747
A murderer gets to walk free
just because he's famous?

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,483
No, I'm saying it's very difficult to
convict a murderer if there's no evidence.

16
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:02,153
Well, that's why I'm here-
evidence.

17
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,789
I found this in her trench coat pocket.
It's an obstetrician's card.

18
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,062
There's a date on the back.
It's for the day before she disappeared.

19
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,503
This is great.
We'll look into it.

20
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,176
Yeah. It's not right.

21
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,081

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,448
No.

00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,733
He just got a phone call.

They think I killed Dede Blaylock.

The man is custom-tailored scum,

<i>And the reason I had you
hand this case offlast year...</i>

71
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,386
is because I didn't see how a jury
would convict this guy...

72
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,322
without the blood evidence,
not to mention without the body,

73
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,350
and I didn't want my executive assistant
to lose a celebrity case at trial.

74
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,363
Why would I want one of
my bureau chiefs?

75
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,993
<i>Because it's a very strong circumstantial
case, and we know he did it.</i>

<i>Are you absolutely certain there's
no way we can get the blood in?</i>

78

The people at the lab told me categorically
that Dede Blaylock's blood...

was in the rental car,

80

a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.

81
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,518
Exactly what they said
a year and a half ago.

82
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,850
It's circumstantial,
but the circumstances are compelling.

83

85

The doctor will testify that
Dede Blaylock was pregnant.

86
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,533
Will this doctor testify that
Kurt Lascher was the father?

[Sighs] Well, let's see if
we can even indict this jerk.

Has he indicated he wants
to testify before the grand jury?

89

Kelly gave Behrens
a 19050 at the arraignment.

90
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,008

that Lascher is going to.

<i>I'll notice him to appear
- [Branch] He'll miss the date.</i>

You'll get the indictment.

93

<i>Which sets up a motion to dismiss
for failure to give Lascher...</i>

94
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,228
an adequate opportunity
to testify before the G.J.

95
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,230
A case this big,
some judges might give it to them.

96
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,062
- It's just delaying the inevitable.
- Since when is anything...

97
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,603

116
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,223

117
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,128
reinterview everybody the homicide detectives
talked to, go over all the paperwork.

118
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,827
Yeah, see if the precinct guys
screwed up. Yeah, it happens.

119
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,339
You know, Lennie, I was a precinct

If it wasn't for this squad,
I'd be on permanent disability.

Well, it helps pay the alimony.
So who's up first?

You guessin' she's an actress-
That's a no-brainer.

139

Two a week, sometimes more.

Not a smart thing to do.

148
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:45,006

- Once a week for three or four months.

149
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,918

The night she disappeared?
Yeah, the night she disappeared.

156
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,696
Well, they seemed happy.
Lascher had a couple of vodkas,

157
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,471
and then he ordered
a magnum of Cristal.

158
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,479
She said they had
something to celebrate.

159
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,981
They had a magnum?
They drink the whole thing?

160
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,645
Well, she just sipped at one glass,
but he turned it into a dead soldier.

161
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,690
He get smashed?
Lascher never got smashed.

162
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,056
<i>Check that.
He never looked smashed.</i>

163
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,894
- He did some coke in the men's room.
- Oh? How do you know that?

164
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,627
Because he's been doing coke in the
men's room ever since I've been here.

165
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,693
Anyway, he came back to the table...

166
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,331
and sent his chauffeur home,

167
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,500
then tells me to get him a rental car.

168
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,704
- He do that often?
- Try never.

169
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,940
<i>Never is an absolute.</i>

170
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,313
He'll testify to never? In the
12 years he's been working there,

171
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,080
he said he never saw Lascher
send his driver home.

172
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,178
He didn't even know
Lascher had a license.

173
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:00,248
And Dede just had the one glass of
champagne? Yeah. She didn't even finish that.

174
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,453
I mean, she sure acted like
she had a bun in the oven.

175
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,224
<i>Based on the fact that Lascher
made his last child support payment...</i>

176
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,390
for his illegitimate son
three months ago-

177
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,902
<i>Seventeen and a half percent of
his annual income for the last 18 years.</i>

178
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,167
A pregnancy would probably
really piss him off.

179
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,266
<i>- No wonder he drank the whole magnum.
- [Kibre] I'm probably gonna be able to get...</i>

180
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,177
the grand jury to indict, but when we go to
trial, we're gonna need a lot more to convict.

181
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,738
I want you to enhance the case.

182
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,843
<i>And welcome to the squad, Detective.
You're one ofJack McCoy's favorite cops.</i>

183
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,889
Thanks. It's better than hanging out
at the O.T.B.

184
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,722
- You're really worried.
- I'm always worried.

185
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,703
<i>They were dating for about six
or seven months.</i>

186
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,772
I'm not quite sure how long they were going out,
because she didn't tell me when they first got together.

187
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,573
- And why was that?
- It was Kurt Lascher.

188
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,582
He's notorious.
Notorious. For what?

189
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,078
<i>[Karen]
Okay. How's this?</i>

190
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,179
<i>He's also 33 years older than Dede.</i>

191
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,457
I knew she was gonna get hurt.
I didn't think she was gonna get killed.

192
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,562
What did you say to her
when she told you she was pregnant?

193
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,260
That I would go with her
for the abortion.

194
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,463
<i>And what was her response?
She said she was having the baby.</i>

195
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,167
- Was she upset?
- She was ecstatic.

196
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,269
She said they'd get married,
and... I lost it.

197
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,076
I told her she was kidding herself.

198
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,176
<i>We started fighting,
yelling at each other.</i>

199
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,915
I left.

200
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,184
I never saw her again.

201
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,591
<i>Thank you, Karen. Questions?</i>

202
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,424
Uh-
[Clears Throat]

203
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,022
- Mr. Duzshinsky?
- Did she say...

204
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,090
whether she had told Lascher...

205
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,261
how many other men
she had slept with?

206
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,999
<i>What? In her life?</i>

207
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,371
<i>No, no.
The week she disappeared.</i>

208
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,639
- She wasn't sleeping with anyone else.
- Oh, you know?

209
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,613
What, you are psychic too?
She's an actress.

210
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,089
No wonder Russians hate jury trials.

211
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,993
Can you imagine 12 Duzshinskys
trying to reach a unanimous verdict?

212
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,462
<i>[Door Opens]
Here it is.</i>

213
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,892
Thank you.

214
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,830
Murder two.

215
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,574
You wanted enhancement?
I got you enhancement.

216
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,210
It's all irrelevant and totally inadmissible,
but it certainly enhances your perspective.

217
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,086
Today, Ted. Did you know that
Lascher used to be an attorney?

218
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,454
What do you mean, used
to be? He was disbarred.

219
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,052
In 1968, he was working
for Texana Oil as a lawyer.

220
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,495
<i>He drew up over 200
leases for ranchers in Oklahoma.</i>

221
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,500
Every one of them had a fatal flaw
in favor of the ranchers.

222
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,196
He quit Texana Oil
and goes to work for the ranchers.

223
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,034
- How many of them signed up?
- A hundred and eighty-one.

224
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,074
<i>Contingency?
Thirty percent.</i>

225
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,576
It cost Texana Oil $68 million.

226
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,239
<i>Sixty-eight million 1968 dollars.</i>

227
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,814
<i>22,666,000.</i>

228
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,855
22,666,000 for him.

229
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,584
Texana Oil went after his ass.

230
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,558
Full ethics investigation.
Disbarred.

231
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,460
- Why didn't they sue?
- Bad publicity. They made a deal.

232
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,055
He surrendered his license
but kept the money.

233
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,692
That's how he produced
his first plays.

234
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,100
Lascher had been skating
his whole life.

235
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,469
- Is the calendar out?
- We got Anderlee.

236
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,705
- Amanda's my kind of judge.
- I want to get the Texana Oil story out.

237
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,907
Don't leave any prints.

238
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,315
<i>[Behrens] I've already
drafted our motion to dismiss.</i>

239
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,354
<i>What grounds? You were deprived
of an opportunity to testify...</i>

240
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,254
and an assistant district attorney
plowed ahead and voted the indictment.

241
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,258
All right, all right. Best case?

242
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,487
It should buy another
60, maybe 90 days. What?

243
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,759
By then it'll be almost two years
since she disappeared. Oh, no. No, no.

244
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,824
It's out of the magazines.
Out of sight, out of mind. No.

245
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,837
No. News management.
I want to get my side out.

246
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,739
So you call Dominick Dunne,
invite him to dinner at Alain Ducasse.

247
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,833
I'll buy a bottle of La Tâche.
Kurt-

248
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,845
Peter, please.
I know how to control the press.

249
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,212
<i>The D.A.' s are already talking to him.
There's a Vanity Fair article coming.</i>

250
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,274
Oh, really? When were you
planning to tell me that?

251
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,752
I just found out this afternoon.
What's the spin?

252
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,881
Good-looking woman D.A.
Takes on the king of Broadway.

253
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,057
You're fired.
Excuse me?

254
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,097
You're fired.
I need a woman.

255
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,734
<i>Here's what's going on, Kurt.
The fat lady's about to sing.</i>

256
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,074
You're being arraigned in two days...

257
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,944
on a criminal charge
of second degree murder.

258
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,006
There's gonna be a trial.
Twelve people,

259
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,575
who probably can't even afford
to go see one of your plays,

260
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,213
are gonna decide whether you go
to prison for the next 25 years.

261
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:02,454
- You're not gonna let that happen.
- If I decide to take the case.

262
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,053
But I'm not going to unless I know
you're going to help me.

263
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,895
<i>I don't care if you did it.</i>

264
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,631
<i>I'm not interested in proving
you innocent, just not guilty.</i>

265
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,173
I have to keep as many damaging facts
away from the jury as possible.

266
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,235
Why am I being arraigned again?
I was arraigned.

267
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,679
<i>That was on a criminal complaint.</i>

268
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,411
<i>This time, it's with the trial judge
who will advise you...</i>

269
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,249
<i>on the indictment
and the actual charges.</i>

270
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,524
You really want to know?

271
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,685
Yeah, I have to know.

272
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,089
I liked her.

273
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,998
We had a nice short run.

274
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,963
My life's an open book.
I've been a bachelor for 19 years.

275
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,670
<i>I'm not known for my parenting
or my monogamy skills.</i>

276
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,947
She walks into the Des Artistes
and lays that on me?

277
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,212
So what did you do?

278
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,821
I ordered a magnum of Cristal,

279
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,880
thought about how
to make her disappear.

280
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,683
You sent your driver home.

281
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,696
<i>Get a rental car delivered
to the restaurant.</i>

282
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,723
<i>I told her we were gonna drive
up to Connecticut to celebrate.</i>

283
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,735
We got in the car and headed up.

284
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,266
She wouldn't shut up.

285
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,810
So I finally I told her
I'm never getting married again.

286
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,871
<i>It was nothing against her,
but I'd never subject anybody...</i>

287
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,143
<i>to being married to me.</i>

288
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,947
<i>And I told her
she couldn't have the baby.</i>

289
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,146
She flipped out.

290
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,386
Started yelling and screaming
up the West Side Highway.

291
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,089
I hit her, knocked her head
into the windshield frame,

292
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,098
and that's how the blood
got in the car.

293
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,604
<i>She was out cold.</i>

294
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,904
So I drove up to northern Westchester,

295
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,346
went out to Allen Watross's place,

296
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,373
because I knew that there was
a very deep abandoned well,

297
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,683
and Allen was never there
during the week.

298
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,723
I strangled her,

299
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,315
threw the body down the well,

300
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,327
drove home.

301
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,991
Nobody saw me.

302
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,056
Obviously.

303
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:32,171
- Any other questions?
- Dozens.

304
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,405
- Hundreds.
- Fine.

305
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,980
- I have one.
- How much?

306
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,958
<i>When are Briscoe
and Salazar coming in?</i>

307
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,792
Tomorrow or the day after.
They have four more names to reinterview.

308
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,197
<i>- Is it just me, or are the cadets getting younger?
- And taller.</i>

309
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,301
Notice of change of counsel.
Who?

310
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,975
Maggie Dettweiler.

311
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,072
I've heard she's good. Is
she that good? She's better.

312
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,712
<i>[Piano] Graydon set a land
speed record for a cover story.</i>

313
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:20,656
<i>I talked to Nick. I told him all about
Brunei and the sultan's party girls.</i>

314
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,194
<i>It's all in there.
Good.</i>

315
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,231
Unfortunately, it's the only good thing
in there for us in a 3,000-word story.

316
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:31,201
<i>Your quotes weren't.
He makes you sound like Rasputin.</i>

317
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,229
<i>You may have forgotten that his daughter
was murdered by her boyfriend.</i>

318
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,604
And that expression-
"I'd like to strangle this bitch"?

319
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,840
I would lose that
from my physical palate.

320
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,874
<i>You may have noticed that thejudge
and both prosecutors are all bitches.</i>

321
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,178
Why do you think you're here?

322
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,692
So, what's my
seven-figure defense?

323
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,819
This is a girl who went
to Brunei twice. Mm-hmm.

324
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,728
She spent nine months singing
in Japan when she was 19.

325
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,427
Oh, so she's a slut. Who knows
where she is? If the shoe fits.

326
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,970
<i>What's the significance
of the Brunei trips?</i>

327
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,007
Am I missing something?
You know about the sultan?

328
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,770
Yeah, he's, what, like the third
richest guy on the planet?

329
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,643
<i>He's also very generous to his friends,
especially his male friends.</i>

330
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,547
He flies in young girls
as party favors.

331
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,814
Dede was there for five weeks
the first time, two months the second.

332
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
- A lot of parties.
- And a lot of favors.

333
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,583
- Is there anything else?
- Japan.

334
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,060
- What aboutJapan?
- She spent six months there when she was 19.

335
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,427
- Doing what?
- Singing.

336
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,990
- She's a singer?
- Not before or since.

337
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,903
How come this wasn't in her file?
Didn't they check her passport?

338
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,635
<i>Never found it. [Briscoe]
And it's still valid.</i>

339
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,906
And we know she doesn't mind
long flights.

340
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,971
- Are you sure, counselor?
- What? That Lascher murdered her?

341
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,278
That she's dead.

342
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,865
Is that your justice-is-blind look?

343
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,565
Oh, the voice that launched
a thousand appeals.

344
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,644
- What's it like working for a Republican?
- Better than working for a killer.

345
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,647
- Alleged killer.
- Oh, yeah.

346
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,649
Sticks and stones
may break his balls,

347
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,185
but I gotta insist
on a victim to convict him.

348
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,252
Necessity is the mother of invention.

349
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:43,657
<i>If you're talking "multi-illogical
alterizations" of this crime,</i>

350
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:48,172
<i>let's just say Dede Blaylock didn't have
a good discriminative taste in men.</i>

351
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,765
Any names?
Oh, yeah.

352
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,640
<i>How about Michael Feltscher?</i>

353
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,012
How about Sean Murray?

354
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,383
A road company Michael Bolton
with no pipes.

355
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:06,390
<i>How about Matt Mandebach?</i>

356
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,552
A B-level producer.
But there's something else.

357
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,926
There's something-
Some actress-model-

358
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,366
- Oh, Amy Woodbury.
- Disappeared without a trace.

359
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,427
<i>That's right. [Man] A friend of
mine out in Los Angeles there-</i>

360
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,873
Robbery Homicide- tells me
that this guy Matt Mandebach...

361
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,275
was and still is the main suspect
in her disappearance.

362
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,838
- When did they go out?
- When she got back from Japan.

363
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,850
Okay. It is not worth as much...

364
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,386
if we hand them the name
as if they find it themselves.

365
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,445
They already have it.

366
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,456
Name and number.

367
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,458
<i>Kibre does?
The cops.</i>

368
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,517
When they searched my house,
they found her Filofax.

369
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,961
She was obsessive about phone numbers.

370
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,432
If she knew him, he's in there,
especially if he was a producer.

371
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,231
So I'll ask for it.

372
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,764
They will go through every name in that
book before they hand it over. Trust me.

373
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,572
You're batting a thousand.
Excuse me?

374
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,841
Your case just got worse.
Your vic may not even be dead,

375
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,247
but if she is, there's a lot better suspect
in there than Kurt Lascher.

376
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:10,618
<i>Who's that? [Briscoe] One Matt
Mandebach, who was and is...</i>

377

the prime suspect in the disappearance
of a model...

378
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,091

380
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,620
He'd been dating Dede Blaylock
right around the same time.

381
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,996
The cops go to question Mandebach
about Amy Woodbury,

382
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,467
Dede Blaylock's in his apartment.

383
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,470
<i>[Briscoe]
It gets worse.</i>

384
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,802
Don't see how it could.

385
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,968
Mandebach was in New York
when Dede Blaylock disappeared.

386
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,238
<i>You didn't know about this guy?
[Kibre] The police assured me...</i>

387
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,837
they'd followed up
on all the physical evidence.

388
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,248
<i>An address book isn't physical evidence?
[Kibre] Let's not take our eyes off the prize.</i>

389
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,286
<i>Lascher did it.
We know he did it.</i>

Everything else is immaterial.
Exactly.

391
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,484
Exactly wrong.
Beyond a reasonable doubt.

393

<i>Are you sure you don't want
to reconsider this?</i>

394
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,598
- We have an indictment.
- Well, an indictment doesn't mandate a trial,

395
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,602
especially in an election year.

396
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,431
If I lose, I'll resign.

397
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,807
I'm sure I'll find that very comforting
on election day when I lose.

398

<i>[Kibre] The police are
checking the names in the book.</i>

so they can complete their investigation.</i>

400
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,622
You know, silly me. I was always
under the ridiculous illusion...

401
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,124
that a trial was a search
for the truth.

402
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,320

a search for admissible evidence.

an acquittal, 50,000 for a hung jury.

00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,249
<i>How did it play?</i>

481
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:16,253
Well, they're not crazy about
the alternative killer theory.

482
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,760
The State has had information
about another suspect-

483
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:27,287
a much more compelling suspect
- who was never even investigated. [Beeping]

484
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,001
- I guess I'm taking that out of the opening.
- But look at this.

485
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:39,500
As a matter of fact, the State will be
unable to prove that she's even dead.

486
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:44,640
All they'll be able to tell you is that no
one's seen her for the last 18 months. [Beeping]

487
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:50,984
I'd open with, " Ladies and gentlemen,
where's the body?"

488
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,718
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
where's the body?</i>

489
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,747
<i>All rise.</i>

490
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,079
Give your attention,
and you shall be heard.

491
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,415
The HonorableJudge
Amanda Anderlee presiding.

492
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,712
No. To my personal knowledge,

493
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:30,659
Mr. Lascher never had a rental car
dropped off at the restaurant.

494
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,822
Thank you. Oh, sorry.
One last thing.

495
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,696
Do you think Kurt Lascher
is a dangerous misogynist?

496
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,363
<i>Objection, Your Honor.
Calls for an opinion.</i>

497
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,599
Withdrawn.

498
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,507
Your witness.

499
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,670
How long has Mr. Lascher
been coming to your restaurant?

500
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:53,550
Apparently for more than 20 years,
but I've only been there the past 12.

501
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,519
<i>[Dettweiler] Have you seen him
with other women over those years?</i>

502
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,318
<i>- [Maîter d'] Many other women.
- Mm-hmm. And has Mr. Lascher...</i>

503
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,120
displayed a variety of moods
with those other women?

504
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,890
What was the 911? One of our
witnesses is changing her story.

505
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,194
What? Who?

506
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,200
Briscoe and Salazar are on it.

507
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,396
- Have you ever see him get angry with any of those women?
- Yeah.

508
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,201
Did he kill any of them?
Objection!

509
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,575
- Withdrawn.
- Since it's after 4:00,

510
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,239
we'll resume at 9:00
on Monday morning.

511
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,321
<i>- [Woman] I want to see your badges.
- We don't need no stinkin' badges.</i>

512
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:35,257
<i>What? What did you say? I said, "
Yeah, people need to see our badges.' '</i>

513
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,919
I told that D.A.
What's her name? Gaffney?

514
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,931
<i>Gaffney.
I told her...</i>

515
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,467
<i>I had to speak to her
about changing my testimony.</i>

516
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,469
Last year, you told the detectives
why you left the show-

517
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,233
that stuff about Lascher
slapping you around.

518
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:53,334
- That's why I have to talk to the D.A.' s.
- Talk about what?

519
00:31:54,612 --> 00:32:00,278
I lied to those cops last year,
but I can't lie under oath.

520
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,819
<i>You think there's any way
to get her new story in?</i>

521
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,355
Not on direct.
It's beyond prejudicial.

522
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,584
It will probably get him a mistrial.

523
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,594
But if we got Maggie Dettweiler
to ask the wrong question-

524
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,460
Even if it got in, Anderlee
would instruct the jury to ignore it.

525
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,056
It's completely irrelevant.
Irrelevant?

526
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,762
It's the definition of irrelevance.

527
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,963
It's pretty hard
to un-ring a bell that loud,

528
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,406
no matter how the judge
instructs the jury.

529
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:29,777
I've got to figure out how to start
pushing Maggie Dettweiler's buttons. What?

530
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,111
Dettweiler will never ask questions
she doesn't know the answer to.

531
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,153
Any lawyer can be made
to ask the wrong question.

532
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,348
<i>[Woman]
I had appeared in eight Broadway shows,</i>

533
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,654
three national touring companies
and six dinner theaters,

534
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,524
where I started in the chorus,
and then I was a featured dancer-

535
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,723
Let's just keep it a little simpler.
I'll say, " Ms. Sterba,

536
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,360
"you were a veteran stage
dancer and singer...

537
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,769
<i>"when Kurt Lascher asked you
to play the lead in Separate Beds,</i>

538
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,037
"but you had limited acting experience.

539
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,204
<i>Is that correct?"
And then you'll just say, "Yes.' '</i>

540
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,182
And then I'll say,
"Well, why do you think he did that?"

541
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,014
Because we were
having an affair?

542
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,989
<i>- Just make it a statement, not a question.
- [Gaffney] You should lower your eyes a little.</i>

543
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:16,993
<i>- You know, try to look a little embarrassed.
- Yeah, okay.</i>

544
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:21,896
<i>Then I'll say, uh, "Well, that seems
like a huge career move for you.</i>

545
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,059
Why did you leave the show
before it opened?"

546
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,901
- You want the whole story?
- No. No. No.

547
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:32,375
<i>How about, "He terrorized me
during rehearsals, so I left"?</i>

548
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,310
He terrorized me during
rehearsals, so I left.

549
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,371
<i>[Kibre]
Okay, just stop there,</i>

550
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,042
and then you look at the jury
and tell what he said to you.

551
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,884
- In rehearsal?
- No. Don't say anything about that.

552
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:47,584
Just the threat.
The way we discussed.

553
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,718
- He terrorized me during rehearsals, so I left.
- [Mouthing Words]

554
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,787
<i>And then I look at thejury.</i>

555
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,595
Kurt Lascher is a monster.

556
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,770
Oh.
[Clears Throat]

557
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,863
<i>Kurt Lascher is a monster.</i>

558
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,071
One night he told me that he could make
me disappear, like that. [Snaps Fingers]

559
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,808
<i>Thank you, Ms. Sterba.</i>

560
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,141
Your witness.

561
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,080
<i>You've testified that you
left Separate Beds...</i>

562
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,283
because Kurt Lascher
terrorized you?

563
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,418
<i>Among other reasons.
Let's talk about those other reasons.</i>

564
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:27,225
<i>Isn't it true that you left because
Mr. Lascher ended your affair?</i>

565
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,758
<i>No.
No?</i>

566
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:34,362
No. It was something
that he told me...

567
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:38,170
that was so disturbing that it made it
impossible for me to continue.

568
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,701
A moment, Your Honor?

569
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,249
Am I gonna hear something here
that's gonna hurt us?

570
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,685
I called her a stupid cooze.

571
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,989
Sue me.

572
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:05,833
So your testimony is that you
threw your whole career away...

573
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:09,532
because Mr. Lascher,
in a moment of anger,

574
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,701
made a disparaging
personal comment?

575
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,110
<i>No. He did that every day.</i>

576
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,574
The day I quit,

577
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,950
I was playing a woman
who had been beaten by her husband.

578
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,956
<i>We were rehearsing a scene.
You bitch.</i>

579
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,152
<i>- Mr. Lascher.
- [Sterba] Kurt told me...</i>

580
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:33,857
<i>that I should make the audience understand
that I still loved my husband.</i>

581
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,695
He said it was like
when you strangle a dog.

582
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:40,897
<i>- Your Honor- - [Sterba]Just before
they die, they fall in love with you.</i>

583
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,668
They look into your eyes
and wag their tail.

584
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,834
Objection, Your Honor.
[Clears Throat]

585
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,844
<i>Sidebar.
Overruled.</i>

586
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,380
You can hardly object
to the answer to your own question.

587
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,747
- Then I move for a mistrial.
- Motion denied.

588
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,584
But I will instruct the jury to disregard
Ms. Sterba's last statement.

589
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:02,490
<i>You will not refer to the statement in
any way or let it color your deliberations.</i>

590
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,728
The People rest, Your Honor.

591
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,698
Pissed off voice message from Briscoe.
They're 11 years back, and there's nothing.

592
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:17,867
Well, call him and remind him
I said to go back 15, and do it faster.

593
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,172
No, it would be a huge mistake.
I agree.

594
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,441
- And I have no choice.
- It's exactly what Kibre wants.

595
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,746
- She could go anywhere on cross.
- Just let me explain the dog thing.

596
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:31,549
I would not like to be convicted
just because I wanted to manipulate...

597
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,386
<i>a performance out of
an untalented chorus girl.</i>

598
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,551
She was pretty compelling
on the stand.

599
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:40,290
Yeah, I would lose
the "untalented chorus girl" descriptor.

600
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,466
<i>You may be a ballbuster,
but when you're right, you're right.</i>

601
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,598
Fourteen years, three months. You're
not only right, you're lucky too.

602
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:54,304
Oh. Lascher the dog lover.

603
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,884
<i>I've loved dogs my entire life.</i>

604
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,887
I grew up with 'em.

605
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:08,722
The idea that I would hurt a dog,
or any animal, is ludicrous.

606
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,694
But you did say what
Ms. Sterba said you said?

607
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:15,095
<i>Yes, I did.
I was giving her direction.</i>

608
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,101
Penny Sterba is... great in bed,
but she's a lousy actress.

609
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,903
<i>I would have said anything
to get a performance out ofher.</i>

610
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:30,778
But an inexperienced actress, uh,
confused direction with reality.

611
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,316
Thank you, Mr. Lascher.

612
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,318
Your witness.

613
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,786
- Let's talk some more about dogs.
- Objection. Irrelevant.

614
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,420
- Ms. Dettweiler opened the door, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

615
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:52,034
You've testified that
you're a true dog lover.

616
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,266
- My entire life.
- Then why do you kill them?

617
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,708
That's ridiculous.

618
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,445
I'd like this entered
as People's 67,

619
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,450
but I'd like Mr. Lascher
to verify its accuracy.

620
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,817
- I'd like to see that.
- So would I. Sidebar.

621
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,633
This compounds other irrelevant
and immaterial...

622
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,539
material already entered
into evidence.

623
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,409
Again, Your Honor, I must strenuously
object. And again, I must overrule.

624
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:40,210
Your client has no one to blame but himself.
Step back. You may approach.

625
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,986
Do you recognize
those documents, sir?

626
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,993
Oh, for God's sake.

627
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:54,088
- I take it that's a "yes"?
- This is completely out of context.

628
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,099
<i>[Kibre] Let the record
show that the defendant...</i>

629
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,432
is looking at a bill for $150...

630
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,939
<i>for putting three dogs to sleep...</i>

631
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,341
on May 4, 1989
in Mt. Kisco, New York.

632
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,344
I had just moved back to the city.
These were country dogs.

633
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,354
They would have had to been
walked on leashes.

634
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,118
So you killed them.

635
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:30,228
One might conclude that one of your
problem-solving solutions is killing things.

636
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,134
Is there a question in there,
Your Honor?

637
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:38,198
<i>Your Honor, I have no more questions
for New York's favorite animal lover.</i>

638
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,548
Not guilty. Guilty.

639
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,821
Guilty. Not guilty.

640
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,727
Eight guilty, four not guilty.
This is ridiculous.

641
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,231
Eight of you want to convict
somebody of murder...

642
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,097
<i>for euthanizing his own dogs?</i>

643
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:09,037
Me? I'd like to give him a medal
for keeping my shoes free of all dog crap.

644
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:13,008
<i>I can't get the image ofhim
strangling a dog out of my head.</i>

645
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,807
<i>- He said he was just trying to elicit a performance.
- Please! W ho's kidding who?</i>

646
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,647
<i>This guy's a sociopath. And we all
read that article in Vanity Fair.</i>

647
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,380
State police called an hour ago.

648
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,253
But they found the body a week ago?
Six days ago.

649
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:31,488
Home inspection of a mortgage company.
The bottom of a well on an estate.

650
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,496
Are they sure it's Dede Blaylock?

651
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,465
The dental records match.
We'll have the D.N.A. In the morning.

652
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,729
Four days late and a dollar short.

653
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,431
It doesn't make any difference.
It's in the hands of a jury.

654
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,837
If they acquit, he walks.

655
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,933
What, your jury's still out?
Five days.

656
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,535
Well, they, like juries
all over the tristate area,

657
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,013
will be rendering verdicts tonight
and tomorrow.

658
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:55,245
You know this.
I know this.

659
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,585
How?
Because play-offs start tomorrow.

660
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,328
<i>Not guilty.</i>

661
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,956
Guilty. Guilty.
Eleven to one.

662
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,568
Please, you know in your heart
he killed her.

663
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:20,576
I'm not even sure she's dead.
She could be in Japan or Brunei.

664
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,910
She's dead, she's dead, she's dead,
and Kurt Lascher did it!

665
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,576
Fine. Let's just
pick this up in the morning.

666
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,246
<i>No, no, no. Let's stay here
until we get this settled.</i>

667
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,387
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

668
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:45,026
- We have, Your Honor.
- How say you?

669
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,497
We find the defendant,
Kurt Lascher, guilty.

670
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,566
[Murmuring]

671
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,121
Thanks.

672
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,377
Never saw it coming.
Thank God.

673
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,313
That was a buzzer beater.
That was a three-point buzzer beater.

674
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:36,717
You convicted a guy on cruelty to animals,
not evidence.

675
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,778
Life's a bitch.
Yeah, and some days,

676
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,882
the one holding the scales
is blind, deaf and dumb.

677
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,326
