1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,067
<i>[Man Narrating]
In the criminal justice system...</i>

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:07,072
<i>all defendants are innocent
until proven guilty,</i>

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,440
<i>either by confession,
plea bargain or trial byjury.</i>

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,877
<i>This is one of those trials.</i>

5
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,249
<i>[Woman]
I was coming home from work,</i>

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:22,982
<i>and I turned the corner
onto Lenox Avenue...</i>

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,047
and I see Ana.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:31,756
I know it's not her.
I mean, I know she's dead,

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:35,062
but there she is.

10
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,797
[Sighs]
And I freak.

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,736
They're all dead-

12
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:44,209
Max, Ariadne, Jose, Ana.

13
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:48,008
<i>And I'm standing
right there in the street,</i>

14
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,049
<i>and I can't move.</i>

15
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,744
It's like eight years ago,
and I'm right back there...

16
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,279
in that restaurant
feeling like I'm gonna die.

17
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,121
<i>When was this?
Two days ago...</i>

18
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,890
right after I heard he was getting out.

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,758
<i>I thought life without parole
meant he was gonna die in prison.</i>

20
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,769
<i>What happened?</i>

21
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,432
<i>[Gaffney] The fingerprint
expert lied on the stand.</i>

22
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,910
<i>The print that put Kenny Thompson
at the crime scene wasn't his.</i>

23
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:23,438
<i>Marisol, I know that your injuries made
you unavailable for the first trial.</i>

24
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,076
But this time around,
your testimony will be crucial.

25
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:31,249
I wish I could help you, but...

26
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,454
I don't remember anything
that happened that night.

27
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,462
Nothing.

28
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,102
Kenny. It's been awhile.

29
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,298
This man's my lawyer.

30
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,707
Been working two years on my appeal
pro bono. That means for free.

31
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,215
Do me a favor, Roy.
Uncuff me so I can shake his hand.

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,420
You're a good man, Roy.

33
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,048
A good man in a bad place.

34
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,359
Thanks to you,
I'm gonna be free.

35
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,227
I owe you my life.

36
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,628
<i>[Kibre] I heard Thompson's getting
a new trial. That's too bad.</i>

37
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:22,641
That fingerprint was the only piece of
evidence linking Thompson to the crime scene.

38
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,576
Well, cut yourself a break.
It's not your fault, Nick.

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,073
<i>Everyone's had a witness lie.</i>

40
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,379
The F.B.I. Guy said it was a match.

41
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:36,821
Apparently, this guy Tanner's been
giving bogus testimony on cases for years.

42
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,883
Justice has launched an investigation
into every case he's ever testified on...

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,691
and every D.A.
He's ever testified for.

44
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,860
And right now,
I'm in the bull's-eye.

45
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,564
I just came from Branch's office.

46
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,573
I've been sidelined.

47
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,905
Oh.

48
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,171
You're gonna replace me.

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,174
The only reason
I didn't argue about it.

50
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:10,589
Trace, Thompson can't stay
on the streets.

51
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,822
<i>[Kibre]
I know. He's a bad guy.</i>

52
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,385
<i>[Nick]
No. We see bad guys all the time.</i>

53
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,160
<i>Kenny Thompson is a bad guy.</i>

54
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,451
I say we plead him out.

55
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,953
Man one.
Time served plus 10.

56
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,286
Nick Forster says we can't win it.

57
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,588
Well, that's because he just
had a conviction overturned.

58
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,629
He's spooked.
That makes two of us.

59
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:27,188
If we plead out, it looks like we're admitting
Forster did something wrong.

60
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,761
Look, just have a look
at Thompson's confession.

61
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,111
<i>We don't want no trouble, man. That's why
we had everybody taped up on the floor, man.</i>

62
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,875
Everybody cooperate, nobody
get hurt. [Man] Oh, really?

63
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,884
So how'd your boy Colfax
end up dead on the floor?

64
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,388
Then the side door opened, and this crazy bitch
come runnin' out of nowhere and she capped Sean.

65
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,424
Uh-huh. So you shot her?
I thought she was trying to kill me!

66
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,984
It was self-defense!
So why'd you shoot the rest of'em?

67
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,624
I want a lawyer, man.
What's the matter, Kenny?

68
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,535
He wants a lawyer. Seeing your
buddy die make you piss yourself,

69
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,371
so you shoot four helpless people?

70
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,206
<i>I don't feel so good.
I want a lawyer.</i>

71
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,042
Sure you don't want your mommy? Come on.

72
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,747
<i>You wanna know what really
happened? [Kibre] Right there.</i>

73
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,288
<i>That's what got
the whole confession thrown out.</i>

74
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:27,383
The judge felt Thompson invoked his right to
counsel, and the cops kept questioning him.

75
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,520
<i>Thejudge is an idiot.
Thompson reinitiated on his own.</i>

76
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,223
Yeah.

77
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:37,133
Thompson talked about those murders
like some guys talk about sex.

78
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:41,333
Like he got off
on killing those four kids.

79
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:45,707
I don't want this guy back
on my island in 10 years.

80
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,216
No plea? You must have been
very convincing.

81
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,219
The tape sold him.

82
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,586
So do we find new grounds
to reargue the confession's admissibility?

83
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,457
It's worth a try. This case
could sure use a nice, juicy confession.

84
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,089
Half the witnesses are either dead,
missing or in rehab.

85
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,633
Sounds like a list
of my ex-boyfriends.

86
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,700
Did we pass it?
No, this is it.

87
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,673
<i>It must be a beauty salon now.
Manicure?</i>

88
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,644
<i>Oh, thanks.
Some other time.</i>

89
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:24,206
Wow. It's hard to imagine
this is the site of a massacre.

90
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,684
It was a spring night.
People were outside.

91
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,214
That must be where
Charlie Lansing lived.

92
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:37,729
That's the stoop he was sitting on
when Thompson and Colfax walked by.

93
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,670
Charlie!

94
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,571
You must have the wrong guy.
Name's John.

95
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,077
You're a hard man to find.

96
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,741
You change your name,
move out of the city.

97
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,614
- Nothing wrong with wantin' to start over.
- You read the papers lately?

98
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,416
Yeah. Kenny Thompson.

99
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,687
I'm not gettin' involved. I got death threats
the first time around from Thompson's boys.

100
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,923
Thompson doesn't have boys anymore.

101
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,091
Papers are sayin' he might be
innocent. There's new evidence?

102
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,965
Nothin' new.
Some old evidence gone bad.

103
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,129
I didn't actually see him
commit a crime.

104
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,571
<i>You saw Thompson and Colfax
outside the restaurant...</i>

105
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,609
five minutes before
the robbery began.

106
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,373
- That's good enough.
- Wish I'd never seen anything.

107
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,143
Talk about being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

108
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,014
Those four dead kids,
they were in the wrong place.

109
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,053
And their families, they're grateful
you saw what you did.

110
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,851
We need you, Charlie.

111
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,128
<i>Kenny. Come on in.</i>

112
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,633
Hey.
This is my wife, Leigh.

113
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,760
She's one of the partners here.
How you doin', Leigh?

114
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:55,399
I am doing well. We get a lot of pro
bono requests, and accept very few cases.

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,636
Your passion for justice is impressive.

116
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,270
Passion's easy. What's hard
is getting anyone to listen...

117
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:04,646
when you're just another black kid
with a return address that says " Sing Sing.' '

118
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,049
But Todd here stepped up.

119
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,053
He certainly did.

120
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:13,524
Listen, uh, Leigh's on the board
of the Exonerated Project,

121
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,527
and they're having
a benefit next week.

122
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,588
It's a heavy-hitting crowd. Might be a good
place to start getting your side of the story out.

123
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,225
<i>Just tell me where and when.
Great.</i>

124
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,326
I'll let you two get to work.

125
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:31,937
<i>So, I've got their witness list.
Married the boss, huh?</i>

126
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,340
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

127
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,509
<i>No surprises here.
Looks like the prosecution case...</i>

128
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:44,022
<i>rests with your association with Colfax and the
fact that you had worked at the Burger Kastle.</i>

129
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,685
So did every other
16-year-old on my block.

130
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,220
They're the only place that would hire
kids from the projects.

131
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,960
We need to make a list
of every kid that worked there...

132
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,764
<i>and ask if they were questioned.</i>

133
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:02,774
<i>Point up the fact that
this is a rush tojudgment.</i>

134
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,640
<i>I'd be happy to talk to her, Tracey.</i>

135
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,612
But I'm a forensic psychiatrist,
not a therapist,

136
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,411
and Marisol is a witness,
not a suspect.

137
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,648
Without the fingerprint, I have nothing
that puts Kenny Thompson at that restaurant.

138
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,987
Now, the police report says that when they found
Marisol in the basement, she was still conscious.

139
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,220
But she doesn't remember anything.

140
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,822
Memory loss is common
in trauma victims.

141
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,893
- It's a survival mechanism.
- So how do we access those memories?

142
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,666
We probably don't.

143
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,402
Humor me, Richard.
Just for a minute, be an optimist.

144
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,277
<i>Sometimes,
you can stumble on a trigger-</i>

145
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,283
a visual cue,
a sound, even a smell,

146
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:49,617
<i>and the memories come pouring out.</i>

147
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:57,260
We've got the place to ourselves.
They don't open till 9:00.

148
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,855
[Marisol] Like I told you, the
two guys came in wearing masks.

149
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,334
The bigger one told us to get downstairs.

150
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,634
And after that, l-I don't remember.

151
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,641
We know.

152
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,337
We're not trying to pressure you. But
being here at the scene of the crime...

153
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,278
might unlock memories,
fill in the missing pieces.

154
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,647
- I'm not sure.
- Any time you wanna stop, we'll stop.

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,881
You're the one in charge.

156
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,654
Okay, Marisol.

157
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:33,062
So where were you when
Thompson and Colfax came in?

158
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,636
Sitting in the counter.

159
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,672
I was right about here.

160
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,838
<i>Okay. So they came in...</i>

161
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:49,244
and they told everybody
to get downstairs.

162
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,749
And you-

163
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,055
So let's go downstairs.

164
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,204
The meat locker's still here.

165
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,905
Well, they found you
around the corner here.

166
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,685
<i>[Richard] How are you doing? I'm okay.</i>

167
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,699
<i>You were found
in this corner here,</i>

168
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,758
so you would have had
a full view of the office door...

169
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,737
<i>when Ana came out and shot Colfax.</i>

170
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,703
I just don't remember.

171
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,304
<i>Maybe if you came over here
and knelt down on the floor?</i>

172
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,933
Anything?

173
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,753
[Sighs]
I'm trying. I really am.

174
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,812
<i>I know you are, Marisol.</i>

175
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,418
<i>Even a fragment, a feeling.
[Door Opens]</i>

176
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,363
Oh. You scare me.
I forgot you were coming this morning.

177
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,627
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

178
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,531
I gotta go. I gotta get
out of here. Marisol.

179
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,634
Tracey, we're done here.

180
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,607
[Woman]
So, what do you think?

181
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:09,051
You the artist?
No.

182
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,988
Good, 'cause I don't like it.

183
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,617
And if I said yes, I was the artist?

184
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:20,495
I like it. Kind of reminds me
of early Rauschenberg. You paint?

185
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,898
No. I just read about it.

186
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:27,029
The library had a lot of books,
and I had a lot of time.

187
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:31,372
Eight years of wrongful incarceration
is one hell of an art appreciation course.

188
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,970
Maya Sullivan.
Being bitter wouldn't do me any good.

189
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,208
I admire your attitude, Mr. Thompson.

190
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:42,243
Kenny, having a good time?
Yeah, but I'm gonna take off.

191
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,552
My boys on the N.Y.P.D.
Iook kind of tired.

192
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,752
- You have cops following you?
- 24-7.

193
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,626
<i>Is that even legal?
I'm black.</i>

194
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,063
"Innocent until proven guilty"
doesn't apply.

195
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:58,968
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get all political,

196
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,530
especially with all the pretty pictures
and pretty people.

197
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,940
Catch y'all later.

198
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,875
There's gotta be something
you can do. File a motion-

199
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,216
It's a public street.
They're harassing your client.

200
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,778
Surveillance is hardly harassment.
Leigh?

201
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,088
Thanks for letting me know
who's who.

202
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,562
You're not offering a plea?
No.

203
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,157
I told Branch I thought that was the way
to go. Well, I think this is winnable.

204
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,863
Without the fingerprint evidence,
this is an entirely circumstantial case.

205
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,962
I wish people would stop saying that
like it's bad.

206
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,100
Most cases are circumstantial,
and these circumstances are compelling.

207
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,772
Both Colfax and Thompson
spent time in juvie for armed robbery.

208
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,816
Marisol heard his voice.
We can bring her in for a lineup.

209
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,977
Tracey, I lived this case for a year.

210
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,455
I drank the same Kool-Aid you're sipping
right now, and I'm telling you, you can't win.

211
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,659
Wow, Nick.
If this is your idea of a pep talk-

212
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,061
You got it all figured out.

213
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,292
Read this.
What is that?

214
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,269
A letter I got from one of
the jurors after the trial.

215
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,500
He says without the fingerprint,
they would have acquitted.

216
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,271
Don't try this case again.

217
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,939
Plead it out, or you'll lose.

218
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,982
This letter states that
the jury in the first trial...

219
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,652
relied entirely on the fingerprint evidence
to convict Thompson.

220
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,321
So it's evidence we don't have.
Right.

221
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,661
So what investigation
was done on the money trail?

222
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,724
Well, we know the robbery
netted Thompson about three grand.

223
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,963
In small bills,
none of which were ever found.

224
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,599
The original case detectives searched
Thompson's place, the grandmother's.

225
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,041
There was no sign of any cash
or night deposit bags.

226
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,578
Well, we also checked large purchases,
and nothing.

227
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,581
You check any girlfriends?
If he had 'em, no one found 'em.

228
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,583
Is he seeing anybody now?

229
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,449
They get out, they usually
dip into the same old pool.

230
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,887
Surveillance says he likes to spend time
at Sylvia's up on Lenox.

231
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,187
Says he likes the waitress up there.
Kim Evans.

232
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,456
Find out what she sees in him.

233
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,431
Why you gotta harass me at work?
You see I'm in the middle of the lunch rush.

234
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,935
Kenny Thompson grew up in the same building with
you, and he was tight with your brother Manny.

235
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,937
Last thing I heard,
he was locked up.

236
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,463
He wasn't with you the other day?
A couple of cops saw him talking to you.

237
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,670
You and Kenny were hanging out the other
night. Narcs tell us you bought some weed.

238
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,713
Did he ask you to do that?

239
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,409
[Chuckles]
Nice. Having your girl buy the drugs.

240
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,385
Okay, arrest me
for scoring a joint. Go ahead.

241
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,945
We don't want to,
'cause we pulled your jacket the other day,

242
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,583
and that would be
a violation of your parole.

243
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,786
It looks like you got
a good thing going on here.

244
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,261
Busy place, good tips.
I don't know anything.

245
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,924
$3,000 was taken
from the Burger Kastle.

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,400
That was, like, eight years ago.
I had nothin' to do with that.

247
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,927
Maybe you saw Kenny flush that weekend?
I never saw Kenny with any money.

248
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,940
Maybe he bought you a gift?

249
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,033
We talkin' about the same
Kenny Thompson?

250
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,929
Face forward.

251
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,866
<i>Really listen to their voices.</i>

252
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:25,137
Please step forward one at a time
and say, " Get downstairs.' '

253
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,706
Get downstairs.

254
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,481
Get downstairs!

255
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,920
- Get downstairs.
- Louder, please.

256
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,388
Get downstairs!

257
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,828
<i>[Man #4] Get downstairs!
[Man #5] Get downstairs.</i>

258
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,661
It could of been any of them.

259
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,971
One more time, please.

260
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,404
Get downstairs.

261
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,242
<i>[Man #2]
Get downstairs!</i>

262
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,748
Get downstairs!

263
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,615
<i>[Man #4]
Get downstairs!</i>

264
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,745
<i>[Man #5]
Get downstairs!</i>

265
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,054
Uh, we're good.

266
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,691
She couldn't I.D. A ham sandwich.
[Chuckles]

267
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,065
So our only problem now is Lansing?

268
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:28,095
I wouldn't worry about him.
I can muddy up his story on cross.

269
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,734
Wait. Talk to him now,
see if his story has changed.

270
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,406
He's a prosecution witness, Kenny. He won't
talk to me. They can fight us even seeing him.

271
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,679
The rules of discovery entitle you
to talk to any witness on their list.

272
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,687
They can decline to answer questions, but you
make that son of a bitch do it to your face.

273
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,560
But you're the lawyer.
It's your call.

274
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,736
<i>[Kibre] Mr. Lansing changed
his name and moved his family...</i>

275
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,569
<i>out of fear of retribution
from Mr. Thompson.</i>

276
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,806
Your Honor can understand why
I'm reluctant to provide the defense...

277
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,713
with Mr. Lansing's
address and phone number.

278
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,750
It's called discovery, Miss Kibre.

279
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,719
Defense wants a meeting, come up
with a neutral place for it to happen.

280
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:19,018
Your Honor, regarding
the readmissibility of the confession-

281
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,925
<i>I've read your brief, Ms. Gaffney.
You've touched on some new grounds.</i>

282
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,657
<i>Your Honor-
But I find none of them compelling.</i>

283
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,690
<i>The confession stays out.
On to the defense's motion...</i>

284
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,670
to preclude the police from coming
within 200 feet of the defendant.

285
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:38,369
<i>Your Honor, the police have engaged in
a pattern ofharassment and intimidation.</i>

286
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,241
<i>Mr. Thompson is
a dangerous felon who,</i>

287
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,545
through some loophole in the legal system,
has been released on an unsuspecting public.

288
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:50,486
I take offense that you refer to perjured
testimony as a loophole, Miss Kibre.

289
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,581
<i>What I meant, Your Honor-
I know what you meant.</i>

290
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,116
Obviously, I can't stop the police
from conducting surveillance,

291
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,062
but I can keep them
at a reasonable distance.

292
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,692
<i>Not only will I grant your motion,
Mr. Eckhart,</i>

293
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,633
I will add 100 feet.

294
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:15,980
This is all for show.
The defense is trying to rattle you.

295
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,347
I really don't have to answer any
of their questions? Absolutely not.

296
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:23,218
This is a formality.

297
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,279
Okay?

298
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,625
Thank you.

299
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,140
Kenny. What the hell are you doing
here? What? I can't see my own lawyer?

300
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,608
Not here.
How did you know I was gonna be here?

301
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,010
What'd you get out of Lansing?
Nothing. The guy stonewalled.

302
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,311
We gotta get outta here.
They could arrest you for-

303
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,442
Yo, Charlie!

304
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:58,080
Come on.
I know what I'm doin'.

305
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,852
Oh, geez.

306
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,560
Don't you ever grab me
like that again.

307
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,768
I promise you,
I had no idea he was gonna be here.

308
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,243
He could know where I live,
where my daughter goes to school.

309
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,337
The police are picking up
your wife and daughter,

310
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:26,145
and they're gonna take the three of
you to a hotel until he's in custody...

311
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,982
<i>and for the duration of the trial.</i>

312
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,491
You're gonna be okay, Charlie.

313
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,926
I'll be right back.

314
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,735
Have we located Thompson?

315
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,864
We're covering all his known hangouts,
but nothing yet.

316
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,113
<i>[Kibre] If we don't pick him up here, we've
papered his neighborhood with reward posters.</i>

317
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,515
<i>Ten grand for any information.</i>

318
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,110
Tracey, it's almost 5:00.

319
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:07,557
He's checked in at Pretrial Services
every day since he was released.

320
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,187
If he was gonna show up,
he'd have been here by now.

321
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,130
Maybe he realized he screwed up
and took off.

322
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,861
And spend the rest of his life
on the run? No.

323
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,268
This guy thinks he's gonna beat us at trial.
He'll show.

324
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,939
Suspect spotted on foot crossing 137
th Street. All units, go. Go! Go! Go!

325
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,339
Kenny Thompson!
You're under arrest.

326
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,214
<i>I'm not resisting. You're under
arrest for intimidating a witness.</i>

327
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:38,780
You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that
right, anything you say can and will be used against you.

328
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,722
Kibre. Put Lansing on.

329
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:44,956
Hello?
Charlie, they just arrested Thompson.

330
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,999
So how does that help me
or my family?

331
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,967
What if you lose the case and he gets out?

332
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,970
I don't think I can help you.
No.

333
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,632
You're still gonna have to testify, but-
I'm not saying another word.

334
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,937
- Charlie?
- Do what you want to me.

335
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,409
Charlie, listen to me.

336
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,413
Damn it!

337
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,742
He's in custody.
You got what you wanted.

338
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,322
So did he.

339
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,029
He totally played me.
He's-He's orchestrating things.

340
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,123
He got me to arrange a meeting
with Lansing to intimidate him.

341
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,294
You did nothing unethical. You're
covered. But that's not the point, Leigh.

342
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,601
What is the point, Todd? Why would he
intimidate a witness unless he was guilty?

343
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,198
Oh, come on. Whatever he might
have done, it was a long time ago.

344
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,575
He's a different person now. Back to
earth, Leigh! He killed four people!

345
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,342
Keep your voice down!

346
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,281
Do you wanna be a litigator or not?

347
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,751
The man's a sociopath.

348
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,947
So if one of our corporate clients has a
product that causes cancer, we don't defend them?

349
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,047
We only defend the good guys?
That's totally different.

350
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,614
No, it's not.

351
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,128
Your client just did you a favor
by scaring off their one eyewitness.

352
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,960
You can either whine about that
or win with it.

353
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,528
<i>I was reading the transcript
of the original trial.</i>

354
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,541
Your closing's good.

355
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,101
"You wake up, look outside,

356
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,513
<i>"and the ground is blanketed
with untouched snow...</i>

357
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,017
"except for a set of footprints...

358
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,986
leading to the mailbox and leading away.' '

359
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,024
"You find mail in the box.

360
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,616
"You can safely assume
the mailman was there.

361
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,288
<i>"No one saw him,
but the circumstantial evidence...</i>

362
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,196
is compelling
beyond a reasonable doubt.' '

363
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,291
It's a great analogy.

364
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,632
I'm afraid it didn't have
the desired effect on the jury.

365
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,036
<i>I got the feeling they'd wanna compare...</i>

366
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,837
a plaster cast of the footprints
to the mailman's boots.

367
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,837
I think...

368
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,115
I'm in trouble, Nick.

369
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,983
I open tomorrow,
and all I've got is Lansing.

370
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,922
And I had to subpoena him
to compel him to appear.

371
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,953
Then you'd better pray he stays strong,

372
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,258
'cause everything else
is the mailman's footprints.

373
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,271
<i>When you were sitting on your stoop...</i>

374
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,502
and asked the man for a cigarette,
how far away was he?

375
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:17,307
A few feet. But it was dark,
and the guy was really dark-skinned.

376
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,782
I really didn't get a good look.

377
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,116
<i>[Kibre]
Mr. Lansing?</i>

378
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,418
Charlie?

379
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,221
<i>But you identified the man you talked to
as the defendant, Kenny Thompson?</i>

380
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:33,697
I guess I did.
But now, I'm not so sure.

381
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,394
Mr. Lansing, is it true that last week,

382
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:44,238
contrary to the order of this court,

383
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,142
Mr. Thompson sought you out
and threatened you?

384
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,340
That's not-

385
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,816
Look, I was pushed into
making this I.D. Eight years ago.

386
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,513
Who pushed you?
You came forward on your own.

387
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,284
You testified under oath
before a grand jury.

388
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,393
That's not how I remember it.

389
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,668
Permission to treat the witness
as hostile.

390
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,102
Go ahead.
At this time,

391
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,970
<i>the People wish to enter into evidence
Mr. Lansing's testimony...</i>

392
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,272
from the original
grand jury transcript.

393
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,574
We're doing great.

394
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,046
<i>[Judge]
That goes back a long way, Miss Kibre.</i>

395
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:28,745
<i>[Kibre] The witness made several
sworn statements. Very well.</i>

396
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,619
I just got a text from Dr. Link.
Marisol remembers something.

397
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,490
Find out what.

398
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:44,695
<i>I saw Ana open the office door.</i>

399
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,967
And I must have started screaming,

400
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,771
'cause I see the guy
look up at Ana and goes,

401
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,472
"Trey, she's got a gun.' '

402
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,345
Who said,
"Trey, she's got a gun"?

403
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:03,479
Colfax- the guy that Ana shot.

404
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:09,726
Thompson's arrest record
lists "Trey" as one of his aliases.

405
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,093
<i>[Kibre] When exactly did you
remember someone saying...</i>

406
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,894
<i>"Trey, she's got a gun"?</i>

407
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:20,097
A few days after
I revisited the crime scene.

408
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,140
Did you remember anything else?
Yeah.

409
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,704
Before he shot me,

410
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,248
he put the gun...

411
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,446
in the back of my head...

412
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,254
and he said,
"Don't worry.

413
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,594
It'll be fast.' '

414
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:54,105
<i>Marisol, after these memories
came back to you, what did you do?</i>

415
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,073
I called Dr. Link.

416
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,269
He's been helping me.

417
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,581
Thank you.

418
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,948
Dr. Link, how did you
get involved in this case?

419
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,457
Tracey Kibre asked me
to evaluate Ms. Rodriguez.

420
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,653
Evaluate or influence?

421
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,687
When Ms. Kibre called, I was careful
to make my role very clear.

422
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,529
I don't believe in trying
to force or shape a patient's memory.

423
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,434
And yet, you participated in
an obvious attempt to trigger a memory,

424
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,369
<i>a visit back to the crime scene.</i>

425
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,034
<i>[Dr. Link] Because Ms.
Rodriguez wanted to be there.</i>

426
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:36,479
I discussed the dangers as well as the
potentially therapeutic outcomes. She chose to go.

427
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,073
Did Marisol Rodriguez ever
spend time in your waiting room?

428
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,618
Yes, before her sessions.

429
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,746
- I imagine, like most doctors, you have magazines there?
- Yes.

430
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,418
<i>So while she waited, Marisol Rodriguez
could have read those magazines.</i>

431
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,825
<i>Maybe even a back issue
of Manhattan Minute?</i>

432
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,887
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

433
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,833
Do you know whether
she read the magazine?

434
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,803
I don't know whether
she did or she didn't.

435
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:05,309
I subscribe to that magazine, and there
are back issues in my waiting room.

436
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:09,904
<i>I offer into evidence a copy of
Manhattan Minute from April 2003.</i>

437
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,313
I call your attention
to the article on page 28...

438
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,613
which profiles
the Burger Kastle massacres...

439
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:18,178
and refers more than once
to Kenny Thompson as " Trey.' '

440
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:23,592
I believe her memory came from the
actual experience, not something she read.

441
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,686
I have no doubt, Dr. Link,
that you have the ability...

442
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:30,133
to distinguish between
real memories and mere suggestion.

443
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,466
But does Marisol?

444
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:44,679
I did see Kenny with some money
the day after the robbery.

445
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,047
Why didn't you tell
anyone this before?

446
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:51,987
Because we were together then, and he
wasn't the kind of guy I wanted to piss off.

447
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,183
So you're not together anymore?

448
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,784
He's all uptown now.
Told me I need to lose some weight.

449
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,463
So you're angry at Kenny,

450
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,994
see a chance to get back at him
and make some money in the process.

451
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,471
Look, do you want my story or not?

452
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,169
How much money
did you actually see on Kenny?

453
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,144
Like a couple thousand.
And it was all weird too,

454
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,306
<i>like rolls of coins and lots of ones.</i>

455
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:20,351
What was the money in?
Hmm?

456
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,352
Was it loose or in a bag-

457
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,287
Yeah, it was in a bag,
like one of those night deposit bags.

458
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,756
<i>- What color?
- Color?</i>

459
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,227
<i>Yeah. What color was the bag?</i>

460
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:36,324
Um- I'm not sure.

461
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,897
Was it green?

462
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,247
She's lying.

463
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,476
She knew the money
was in a night deposit bag.

464
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,541
That wasn't released to the press.
She's a waitress.

465
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,213
Of course she knows at closing,
money goes into bags.

466
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,347
Okay, I get it, Kelly.
You didn't buy her story.

467
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,891
Neither did you.
Well, you're wrong.

468
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:05,862
I did. And even if I didn't, it's not
my problem. It's up to a jury to decide.

469
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,694
Well, you made it your problem
when you told her what to say.

470
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,963
- I refreshed her memory.
- Call it what you want. I call it prosecutorial misconduct.

471
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,936
Hey, watch it.

472
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,463
- You put her on the stand, you'll be suborning perjury.
- You're crossing a line.

473
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,069
No, you are, and it's the same line
that Nick Forster crossed eight years ago.

474
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,137
<i>A decision which will probably
get him disbarred.</i>

475
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,241
Look, tomorrow morning, when I put Kim
on the stand, you're either with me...

476
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,718
or you take a sick day.

477
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,797
<i>[Eckhart]
What is she going to say?</i>

478
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:44,096
For 10 grand, she'll say anything.
She'll say I confessed to her.

479
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,659
Did you?

480
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,298
Were you wearing gloves
that night, Kenny?

481
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,740
Is that how you were so sure
the fingerprint expert was lying?

482
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,837
All you gotta know about Kim Evans-
she's got a rap sheet longer than mine.

483
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,974
Even you should be able
to discredit her.

484
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,384
<i>[Bailiff] Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you give will be the truth,</i>

485
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,287
<i>the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God? Not so sick after all.</i>

486
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,820
Actually, I am.

487
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,893
<i>Please state your name for the record.
Kim Evans.</i>

488
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,129
What is your relationship
to Mr. Thompson?

489
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,104
I was his girlfriend.

490
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:26,234
<i>Did you see Mr. Thompson
on April 9, 1997,</i>

491
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,302
the day after the Burger Kastle killings?

492
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,779
Yeah, I saw him that day.

493
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:35,547
Did he show you-

494
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,054
Did he-

495
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,135
Your Honor, a moment, please.

496
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,671
All right.

497
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:03,873
Nod. Write something in your pad
like I'm giving you instructions.

498
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,509
Get your cell phone and make believe
that you're making...

499
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,214
a really important phone call as you leave
the courtroom, and meet me in the hallway.

500
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,152
I have no further questions
for this witness.

501
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,197
But-
Mr. Eckhart?

502
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,228
Nothing for this witness, Your Honor.

503
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,566
<i>[Judge]
Do the People rest, Miss Kibre?</i>

504
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,265
Actually, Your Honor,
we'd like to request a recess.

505
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,069
We'll adjourn until tomorrow.

506
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,021
I hate it when you gloat.

507
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,958
<i>Combed through the old case file,
witnesses, evidence.</i>

508
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:55,625
So what's new? What do we have that Nick
Forster didn't other than a weaker case?

509
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,601
- Marisol's testimony.
- Well, her story is all over the place.

510
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,866
- It doesn't even jibe with Thompson's confession.
- How so?

511
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:06,501
<i>Thompson claims that all of the employees
were blindfolded, bound and gagged...</i>

512
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,545
when Ana came out of the office
with guns blazing.

513
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,205
That's how the police found them.

514
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,748
Yeah, well, Marisol claims that...

515
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,479
she saw Ana come out of the office
and then started screaming.

516
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,750
Now, if I'm blindfolded, I can't see.
And if I'm gagged, I'm not screaming.

517
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:23,886
So Thompson and Colfax were in the process
of gagging Marisol when Ana came out.

518
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,020
Okay.

519
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:30,932
Okay, so Thompson is in the process
of gagging Marisol.

520
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:35,837
Or Colfax was doing it, which would explain
why he yelled, "Trey, she's got a gun.' '

521
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:41,106
So Ana shoots Colfax
before he gets a chance to gag Marisol.

522
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,377
Then Thompson shoots Ana. But now he's
gotta subdue an hysterical Marisol.

523
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:50,285
So he picks up the tape. And how do you
rip tape off a roll while holding a gun?

524
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,413
Maybe he uses his teeth.

525
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,119
Let's hope so.
Where's Marisol's gag?

526
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:03,229
It's useless. It was in that box of
exhibits that had bad water damage.

527
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,667
<i>What about the roll of tape
the gag came off of?</i>

528
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,296
<i>A different box.
We might still have it.</i>

529
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:12,638
- It could have tooth marks or-
- D.N.A.

530
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,338
I'll call the crime lab.

531
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:19,282
Ms. Kibre,
a delay at this point in the trial-

532
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,511
Just until the test results come back.

533
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,384
Your Honor, there's a lack
of fundamental fairness here.

534
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,516
At the last possible minute, Ms. Kibre is
conducting a complicated technical procedure.

535
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:32,529
A procedure which may exonerate
his client and put an end to this trial.

536
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,998
<i>We expect mitochondrial results
back within 24 hours.</i>

537
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,558
The People request
a continuance until that time.

538
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,969
I'll grant the continuance, Ms. Kibre,

539
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:46,203
<i>but I trust the People can firmly
establish the chain of custody?</i>

540
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,144
The jury's gonna wanna know whose hands
this roll of tape passed through...

541
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,341
from the moment it was picked up
at the crime scene until today.

542
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,044
<i>[Kibre]
Yes, Your Honor.</i>

543
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,883
Where do we stand on the
chain of custody? Not so good.

544
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:04,985
The C.S.U. Detective who bagged the tape at
the scene died in a car accident four years ago.

545
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,087
Oh, come on.

546
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,895
Well, somebody else must have seen him
put that tape in the evidence bag.

547
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,936
Somebody did.
Nick Forster.

548
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,303
Having me anywhere near the case
weakens it for you.

549
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,569
We've got a D.N.A. Match.
I just need you.

550
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,577
I can't do it.
I'm not asking.

551
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,580
- I'm calling you to the stand.
- Beer?

552
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:27,846
- Nick-
- Don't you get it?

553
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:31,082
I cannot testify
without perjuring myself.

554
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:36,559
Oh, my God.
You knew the fingerprint was bad.

555
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:42,065
After the confession was tossed,
I was desperate.

556
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,763
<i>How's a guy kill four people and not leave
a single sign ofhimselfbehind?</i>

557
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,370
I'm having dinner one night
with this F.B.I. Guy-Tanner.

558
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,375
He begs me to let him help me.

559
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,747
On cross, Eckhart is gonna ask you
point-blank about the fingerprint.

560
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,387
- I'll lie.
- You do and get caught, Thompson goes free.

561
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,417
Do you realize what you're asking me?

562
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:14,794
Yeah. Step up and admit
what you did.

563
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,462
You know I can't do that.

564
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,836
Forget about the job.

565
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,137
I could go to jail.

566
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,613
The man I know wouldn't be able to live
with those bodies on his conscience.

567
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,320
<i>Ariadne Iberra, Ana Pacheco,</i>

568
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:48,593
Max Loeb and Jose Ruiz.

569
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,829
You were the original prosecutor
in the murders of these individuals?

570
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,199
I was.

571
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,037
Do you recognize this duct tape?
I do.

572
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,637
It was the roll of tape found at
the crime scene on April 8, 1997.

573
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,739
Where was it found?

574
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,376
Right here,
outside the meat locker.

575
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,716
And what was done with it?

576
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:15,350
I saw Crime Scene Unit Detective Sonnenberg
bag it and enter it into evidence.

577
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,190
<i>[Kibre] And then what? I
personally supervised gathering...</i>

578
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,457
all the evidence at the scene...

579
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:25,730
and transported it from the restaurant to
the intake technician at the 39th Precinct.

580
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,500
<i>Sojust to be clear,
you saw Detective Sonnenberg...</i>

581
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:33,009
bag this roll of duct tape
and enter it into evidence?

582
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,011
Yes.

583
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,620
<i>Isn't it true that the reason
you're not trying this case today...</i>

584
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,824
is because you're currently
under investigation...

585
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,596
for falsifying fingerprint evidence
in the first trial of Mr. Thompson?

586
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,399
Yes.

587
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,600
Did you falsify the fingerprint?

588
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,339
L-

589
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,531
Yes.

590
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:35,933
You admit you've lied before.
Why should the jury believe you now?

591
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:40,136
Because I've just admitted
that lie under oath.

592
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,238
Because I'll probably be disbarred,

593
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:48,877
and I have nothing left to lose.

594
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,887
I'm finished.

595
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,591
Guilty on all counts.
Thank you.

596
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,650
Oh!

597
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:38,497
The firm has decided
to sever our relationship with you.

598
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,662
We'd be happy to recommend
a public defender.

599
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,434
- No.
- Excuse me?

600
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:48,376
Sullivan & Sterling will continue as
counsel on my case. Why would we do that?

601
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:53,383
Because I have at least seven examples of ineffective
assistance of counsel committed by our boy Todd here.

602
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,180
That's a lie.
Maybe.

603
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,653
But do you really wanna put yourself
and the firm through a hearing?

604
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,883
I'll be in touch.

605
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,298
Branch fire him?
Nope. He resigned.

606
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:19,502
Smart. This way,
he gets to collect his full pension.

607
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,511
I don't think that entered into it.

608
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,706
You give people too much credit.

609
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,614
You don't give people enough.

610
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,879
Big risk calling him
to the stand.

611
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,978
I had no choice.

612
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:34,354
But why not wait for Eckhart to crucify
him? He would have lied to Eckhart.

613
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,518
Then I'd have known
he was giving false testimony.

614
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,154
He could just as easily have
lied to you. I knew he wouldn't.

615
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,529
Come on.
You've known the guy for 15 years.

616
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,467
You're telling me
he never lied to you?

617
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,970
Yeah, he lied to me.

618
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,438
Just not about the law.

619
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,905
