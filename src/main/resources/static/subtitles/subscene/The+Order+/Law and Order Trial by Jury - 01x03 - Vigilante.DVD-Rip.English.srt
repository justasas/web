<i>This is one of those trials.</i>

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,816
He destroyed my life.

6
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:22,514
There's still a part of me
trapped in that room with him,

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,888
terrified, in pain,

8
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,554
wondering if he's gonna kill me.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,065
And on my worst days,
I wish he had.

10
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,167
I was 12 years old
when he raped me,

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,900
and every day
I have to deal with what he did.

12

LyleJoynes isn't safe.

13

And he will always be sick!

- Ms. Gaffney?
- LyleJoynes has previously been held for offenses in Manhattan and Queens.

18
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:09,762
He's classified as a level-three
sexually violent offender.

19
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:13,294
<i>And since his release, he's moved
back into the same home in Astoria...</i>

20
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,241
where he assaulted Denise Bell
12 years ago.

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,972
Not revoking his parole
would be an invitation to tragedy.

22
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,777
Has Mr. Joynes complied
with all his registration requirements?

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,842
Absolutely, sir. I'd like to ask,
where's the violation?

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,287
<i>What has he done wrong?
The D.A. Is just speculating here.</i>

25
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,951
<i>A dozen kids live in the neighborhood.
His parole states no contact with children.</i>

<i>[Man] Thank you, Ms. Gaffney.
I'll review your memo.</i>

Mr. Joynes,
you can make a statement.

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,065
They keep harassing me, sir.
I can show you the hate mail.

29

I worked hard for my early release.

00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:02,554
I go to therapy five times a week,
and I'm genuinely sorry for what I did.

<i>- Joynes is just looking for another-

38

<i>Are we supposed to wait until he re-offends

<i>Yeah! [Woman] That's right!</i>

40

You didn't make much of a case.

41
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,554
The case was fine until you spoke out.
Look, I agreed to do this,

42
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,391
even without clear evidence
of a violation.

43
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,490
They're just bureaucrats.
They don't care about these people.

44
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,535
Well, you didn't help
by pissing them off.

45

<i>After reviewing the evidence,
we do not find sufficient probable cause...</i>

46

<i>to believe that Mr. Joynes has violated
the conditions ofhis release...</i>

47

<i>in any important respect.</i>

48
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,747
Now, as much as we sympathize
with the community's position,

49
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,617

Hey, you Gaffney?

- That's right. Over here.
- What happened?

Weren't you working some case
about that child molester, LyleJones?

59
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,548
Joynes. Yes.
God, what did he do?

60
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,820
He got himself murdered.

61
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,980
Joynes left his shrink at 5:05.
Got killed 20 minutes later.

62
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,495
Therapist says he was catching
a train at 14th Street.

63
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,292
And stopped to loiter
at a jungle gym?

64
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,857
We're sure he wasn't mugged?
Nah, no robbery.

65
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,335
Witnesses say they saw
a man walk up to him,

66
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,066
words were exchanged
and, bang, six rounds.

67
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,541
My guess-
Joynes knew his killer.

68
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,908
<i>Any obvious suspects?
You see his sheet?</i>

69
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,275
The line of people who hated
this guy goes down the block.

Nothing.

- Then who's working this case?

- [Clears Throat] The murder of this pervert's not a high priority around here.

All I'm saying is...
I'm not gettin' much help.

80

Well, then, you could team up with

<i>So we're talkin' about a
vigilante. [Kibre] I think so.</i>

84
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,106
So what's the plan?

85
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,668
Start with the people from his neighborhood.
Look for a match to the D.N.A.

86
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,180
You really think those people
are gonna volunteer to help?

87
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,183
I'll open an investigative grand jury.

88
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,583
In other words, a fishing
expedition. Oh, come on, Arthur.

89
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,248
We can't endorse street justice.
We have to send a message.

90
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,848
The press has already
picked up on the story.

91
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,259
And, as you know, they're ready
to canonize the man who did it.

92
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:15,323
<i>Well, make sure you have solid
probable cause on any D.N.A. You collect.</i>

93
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,928
Believe me, if I find a smoking gun,
I'm not gonna let it get suppressed.

94
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,939
If I find the shooter,
I want a conviction.

95
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:25,239
And I want results... fast.
Or we move on.

96
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,316
<i>They swabbed my mouth,
gave me some kind of receipt.</i>

97
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,217
Said if it didn't match,
I'd get the sample back.

98
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,278
They called it voluntary.

99
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,483
Yeah, but it's some cop askin' me.
What was I gonna say? No?

100
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,790
- They can do this?
- It's obviously coercion,

101
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,796
but, yeah, they can do that.

102
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,889
The D.A.' s strategy here is simple.

103
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,732
<i>They ask you for a voluntary sample.
You refuse.</i>

104
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:56,400
They feel justified in asking you
to testify before the grand jury.

105
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,410
So what? I'd still refuse.

106
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,879
<i>Well, then they serve you a subpoena,
which means you have to show up.</i>

107
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,941
If the D.A. Thinks
you're withholding information,

108
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,215
they can use that
to get an order for your D.N.A.

109
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,348
<i>Hey, look. I don't like it either,
but I got nothin'to hide, all right?</i>

110
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,893
- I didn't kill the creep.
- That's not the point.

111
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:19,625
- If it gets 'em off my back- - You know, they found
Joynes's body beside a playground, for God's sake.

112
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,897
Well, you think anyone here is gonna
shed a tear that piece of crap's dead?

113
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,733
No.

114
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,672
You know what? They can't treat us
like we're the bad guys, you know?

115
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,266
'Cause they're the ones who got him
out of jail in the first place.

116
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,744
Jimmy is right.
They cannot do this to us.

117
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,249
<i>Roy, you're okay. You're off the hook,
'cause you bent over for 'em already.</i>

118
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,774
Okay? But no one else
should cooperate.

119
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,515
Karla, you think that'll work?

120
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,526
They're sensitive to politics here.
We embarrass the D.A.' s office,

121
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:53,691
stall the investigation,
they could drop the case.

122

my hand didn't even shake.

125

I shouldn't have spit in his face.
That was stupid.

126
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,451
But he gave me this look, like, uh-

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,114
l-l-I find him leering at a bunch of kids,

128
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,589
and he's lookin' at me
like I'm in the wrong place.

My client's not volunteering
anything, Detective.

161
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,852
We know you're fishing
for a murder suspect.

162
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,090
<i>It's about eliminating suspects.</i>

163
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,659
Mr. Colby gives us his D.N.A. Saves
us a hassle. Saves him a trip downtown.

164
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:15,400
For a grand jury, right?
That's blatant intimidation.

165
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,772
<i>My client has answered
your questions.</i>

166
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,869
Well, sorry it didn't work out.

167
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:25,406
<i>Mr. Colby, we'll be in touch. I hope you give
this some thought about where this is going.</i>

168
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,115
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sweetheart.

169
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,628
We're just talkin' some business.
Your mom made you some breakfast.

170
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,389
You can let yourselves out.

171
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,569
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

172
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,870
<i>Colby matches the general description of the
shooter, and his alibi sucks-home watchin' TV.</i>

173
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,876
What about the car?

174
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,311
Uh, no match, no hit on the gun,
nothing registered in Colby's name.

175
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,373
But he lives two doors down from Joynes
with a 12-year-old daughter.

176
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,811
So maybeJoynes looked at his kid,
and that set him off.

177
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,415
- It's not a hard scenario to see.
- It's still not enough for probable cause.

178
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,427
<i>If we could tie him to the gun-
Check out his family and friends.</i>

179
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,622
See if he's got any access to a.38.

180
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,930
So Grizano-What's with her
"woman of the people" act?

181
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,405
<i>Oh, she spoke out of turn atJoynes's
hearing, pissed off the parole official.</i>

182
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,409
I think she liked the attention.

183
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,811
Well, if she likes an audience,
maybe you should invite her to lunch.

184
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:37,179
<i>The publicity from this could be
devastating for District Attorney Branch.</i>

185
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,589
Prosecuting the case
doesn't make us advocates forJoynes.

186
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,786
But that's the perception.

187
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,695
You let pedophiles
back into the community...

188
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,257
and then don't do anything
to protect families?

189
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,236
Then you harass them?

190
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,000
Is this for real, Karla?

191
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,042
What's that supposed to mean?

192
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,512
Our negative publicity works for you.
Gets your name in the paper.

193
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,848
Kelly, what law school
did you go to?

194
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,512
<i>Boston College.
Huh. Good for you.</i>

195
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:12,353
I took night classes in a
storefront law college in the Bronx.

196
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:16,656
<i>I did it while raising my son
without his deadbeat father.</i>

197
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:21,223
So spare me the cynical attitude.
You don't get it.

198
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,792
I have a connection to these people.
I am the only one-

199
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,395
the only one standing up for them.

200
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,676
We're gonna get an order
for your client's D.N.A.

201
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,738
What's that gonna win you?
These people felt helpless.

202
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,376
The courts wouldn't protect them.

203
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,443
That failure resulted in a killing.

204
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,081
Whose fault is that?

205
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,924
<i>Our detectives discovered
that Mr. Colby had access...</i>

206
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,493
to a.38-caliber handgun,
the same as the murder weapon.

207
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,768
The gun was registered to Mr. Colby's
brother and kept at his place of business.

208
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,775
It's now missing.

209
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,937
<i>Can they prove my client took the gun?</i>

210
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:11,278
Can they even prove that it was
the weapon used in the crime?

211
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,549
<i>I don't think it's the only.38
in the five boroughs, Your Honor.</i>

212
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,149
<i>A gun store clerk
has identified Mr. Colby...</i>

213
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:25,186
and said that he purchased.38-caliber
ammunition on the afternoon of the murder.

214
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,198
This is a grand jury order,

215
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,791
and I tend to allow them latitude
in their investigation.

216
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:35,535
Your Honor, it's an abuse of power
to unfairly target my client.

217
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,977
Ms. Kibre has been threatening residents
with grand jury subpoenas...

218
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,479
if they refuse to cooperate.

219
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,675
I'm sorry, Ms. Grizano.

220
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,414
I'm sensitive to coercive tactics,
but I don't like coincidences either.

221
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,955
Your Honor-

222
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,288
Motion denied. Mr. Colby will submit
a blood sample for D.N.A. Testing.

223
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,319
Make it quick.

Don't make any statements.

231
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,585
I'll see you at the arraignment
in the morning.

232
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,323
Maybe talk to my brother
about bail.

233
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,865
I'll handle it.
All right. Let's go.

234
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,094

Anything at all, please, Mr. Colby.

240
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,887
<i>Anything. A nything you'd like to say
to theJoynes family?</i>

241
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:10,563
Mr. Colby's bail has been set
at $300,000.

242
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,732
His family, his friends, his neighbors
have raised the money...

243
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,002
and will post that amount today.

244
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,739
He pled not guilty. How do you
reconcile that with the facts?

245
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,510
Is there any question
why a law-abiding citizen...

246
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,642
<i>was forced to protect his family?</i>

247
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,415
<i>Did Mr. Colby attempt
to contact the police?</i>

248
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,888
Of course he did.
His neighbors did.

249
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,482
<i>I even appealed to the district attorney,</i>

250
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,825
and A.D.A. Kelly Gaffney couldn't...

251
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:42,390
and wouldn't put LyleJoynes
back into prison where he belonged.

252
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,402
Ms. Gaffney, any comments?

253

This office has a stellar reputation

00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,845
and here we are letting some lawyer
from Queens sully that.

- First-degree manslaughter?
- Ten to 15.

266

Short of all charges dropped,
my client doesn't want to hear it.

267
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,180
Colby traveled from Queens
to Manhattan to huntJoynes down.

268
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,417
That's clear premeditation. The facts
come out, "defense of others" won't play.

269
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,153
And I won't argue it. We're going
to be asserting E.E.D. Instead.

270
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:47,130
Extreme emotional disturbance?
That's creative.

<i>An E.E.D. Defense drops the charge to
man one. It's the same as our offer.</i>

Does he?
Or is that what you want?

274
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,371
You're gonna see him walk

<i>He admits he kills a man,</i>

297
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,191

Just like I said.

299
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:38,568
Okay. Okay. But my defense-
I don't like sayin' I was crazy.

300
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,375
No, not crazy. You lost control.

301
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,382
It doesn't matter what we say.

302
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,216
No jury's gonna send you to prison
for killing that monster.

303
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,390
Trust me.

304
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,027
<i>You say murder two, Ms. Kibre.</i>

305
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:05,593
I think there's an adequate justification
for a jury to consider E.E.D.

306
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,539
Your Honor, E.E.D. Might as well
stand for " excuses, excuses defense.' '

307
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,634
It allows the jury to ignore the facts
and decide the case...

308
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,771
based on their feelings
of sympathy for Mr. Colby.

309
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,112
<i>We've submitted multiple reports
from psychological experts,</i>

310

and they say my client's
been emotionally disturbed.

311
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,979
These reports
are of dubious psychological value.

312
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,324
So put your expert on the stand in rebuttal.
I see a sufficient legal basis here.

313
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:35,389
<i>And there's the other motion I filed-

like to be heard further on this matter-

315
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,337
Save it. The spotlight's off. From
here on, try your case in the courtroom.

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,511
<i>Some residents may testify, especially
ones who contributed to Colby's bail.</i>

317
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,984
Well, I want someone to do a registry and record
check of every person in that neighborhood.

318
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,111
I'm on it.
Everything, Sigrun.

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,686
We should also compile a summary of every case in
the past three years that used E.E.D. As a defense.

321
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,752
Uh, I'll do it.

322
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,821
Yeah, also research
Grizano's last few cases.

323
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:11,494
You know, I remember at the parole hearing, Joynes
said he kept hate mail from the neighborhood.

324
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,267
- Now, if any of it tied to Colby- - Let's
talk toJoynes's mother. See what she's got.

325
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,274
Mine.
Mine.

326
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,546
<i>They're animals-
how they treated Lyle.</i>

327
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,777
We're sorry for your loss.

328
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:32,119
They painted terrible things on my door.
Sick things. Broke my windows.

329
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,627
<i>Mrs. Joynes, your son mentioned that he kept
notes and letters sent to him by your neighbors.</i>

330
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,062
Do you know where those are?
Vile words.

331
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,329
Oh, the things they said about him!

332
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,737
Lyle was a nice boy.

333
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,337
<i>E- Except with dogs.
Didn't like dogs.</i>

334
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,401
Did he maybe keep them
in a secret place?

335
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,915
- The notes?
- [Inhales]

336
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,412
I don't think this room's been cleaned out
sinceJoynes went upstate.

337
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,421
Yeah, a lot of hand lotion
and comic books.

338
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,152
- Stunted adolescence.
- You think she did something to him?

339
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,057
She who? The mother?

340
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,529
<i>You know, turned him into a freak,
like the movie Psycho.</i>

341
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,930
Does that poor old lady
look like Mrs. Bates to you?

342
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,061
Stuff her and put her in a fruit cellar,
I can see it.

343
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,537
- Can I help?
- Yeah, you wanna zip it?

344
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:26,168
<i>All right. But in two years, I'm a
prosecutor. You're working for me.</i>

345
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,109
- Get Gaffney.
- What do you got?

346
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:40,118
- Hypos. Steroids.
- I don't get it.

347
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,127
He was injecting testosterone.
Puttin' the lead back in the pencil.

348
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,528
<i>Score one for Colby.
Maybe he had a point.</i>

349
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,998
<i>[Gaffney] We found a few threatening
letters toJoynes in a kitchen drawer.</i>

350
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,010
I'm having them analyzed
for fingerprints.

351
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:04,139
Well, hopefully we'll get a hit. Take some
of the heat off this steroid discovery.

352
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,946
The M.E.' s office double-checked
the autopsy report.

353
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:11,478
Turns out the serum testosterone levels
in Joynes's blood were abnormally elevated.

354
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:16,789
So he was definitely shooting the stuff.
And violating the terms of his release.

355
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,558
Probably looking for his next victim.

356
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,226
Well, it's not enough to justify murder.
Colby didn't know about it.

357
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,101
<i>Well, whether or not the defense
knows about it, we have to turn this over.</i>

358
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,505
Notify Grizano.
We'll argue to keep it out.

359
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,102
<i>What's the point of me checking it
if you know this stuffbetter than I do?</i>

360
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,943
[Laughs]
This kid's smarter than her old man.

361
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,643
[Laughs]
Bye.

362
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:45,588
<i>[Door Closes] So that son of a
bitch was shooting testosterone...</i>

363
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,319
so he could-

364
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,691
so he could do it again?

365
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,357
We need the jury
to hear about this evidence.

366
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,561
But you need to have known
Joynes was using the drugs,

367
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,434
otherwise we can't get it in at trial.

368
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,498
Okay, but l- I didn't know.
Are you sure?

369
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:09,775
It's possible a package for him
was delivered to your house by mistake.

370
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:14,285
<i>You know what I mean?
You opened it. You realized-</i>

371
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,378
Karla, I don't want to lie.

372
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,687
<i>Jimmy, this is important evidence.</i>

373
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,354
<i>I know, but I shouldn't
have to lie, you know?</i>

374
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,331
I did the right thing.
Everybody says so.

375
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,699
People respect me now.
If I lie-

376
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,831
I want people to know
the whole truth about that deviant.

377
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:42,272
Jimmy, it makes what you did
all the more right.

378
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:52,749
<i>He was injecting testosterone to counter
the effects of the Depo-Provera?</i>

379
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:57,625
The chemical castration was a major
condition ofJoynes's early release.

380
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:03,430
This violation was obviously
an act of predatory behavior.

381
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,905
<i>And it's obviously inadmissible.
It has no probative value.</i>

382
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:12,603
It's relevant to an atmosphere of fear
that led to my client's loss of control.

383
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,111
Was he aware of the steroid use
by Mr. Joynes?

384
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:19,512
Well, um, I knew-

385
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:23,987
I mean, uh, I had seen him
receiving packages in- in the mail,

386
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:28,185
<i>which the postman said
contained mail-order drugs.</i>

387
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,560
[Sighs]
Um, no, I didn't actually know.

388
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,123
<i>I'm sorry. The evidence is out.</i>

389
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,007
<i>Hey! Grizano!</i>

390
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,976
When am I getting an interview
with your client?

391
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,606
Hi, Mike. You know we can't talk to you.
The judge would hold me in contempt.

392
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,311
Well, how 'bout we don't tell her?
Uh, you're not talking to anyone.

393
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,752
Give me a minute.

394
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,217
I hear you lost out
on the testosterone.

395
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,387
You're gonna run the story?
My lead for tomorrow.

396
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:08,694
That judge is siding with a dead pedophile
over a neighborhood hero.

397
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:12,726
Not allowing that evidence in
says as much.

398
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:17,741
I hear rumors about a safe streets committee
drafting your name for city council.

399
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,970
Fifty-third District?

400
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,843
News to me.
Come on.

401
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,905
Colby's rocket fuel for you.

402
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,611
[Laughing]

403
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,984
Hey, I still want my interview.

404
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,353
Everything okay?
Better than okay.

405
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,624
<i>We all remember
how he hurt little Denise,</i>

406
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,860
so we watched Joynes
around the clock.

407
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,369
If we had turned our backs,
it could've been one of our kids next.

408
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,429
<i>Did Mr. Colby
help monitor LyleJoynes?</i>

409
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,942
Oh, yeah. He helped organize shifts
and took it very seriously.

410
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,604
Told me he cut back
his hours at the restaurant...

411
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,773
so he'd be at home when
his daughter got out of school.

412
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,113
So he had real concerns
for her safety?

413
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:04,246
Oh, he was terrified for Brianne.
I mean, it was no secret.

414
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,291
<i>That creep had a thing for girls her age.</i>

415
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,350
<i>[Grizano]
Thank you.</i>

416
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Did Mr. Colby ever tell you
he wanted Mr. Joynes dead?

417
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,836
We all wanted him dead.
You think we had any options left?

418
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,375
Could you please answer the question?

419
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,037
I'm proud ofJimmy.
He stood up for us.

420
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:32,049
<i>If Mr. Joynes had so much
as looked wrong at a child,</i>

421
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,051
he would've been sent back to prison.

422
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,679
- Did you know that?
- It wasn't that simple.

423
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:40,213
Oh, sure it was. You could've called
Joynes's parole officer or the police.

424
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,421
The police patrolled the neighborhood to
protectJoynes, not us. You people didn't care.

425
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:49,331
<i>When you letJoynes out of prison,
you put every one of us in one.</i>

426
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:55,768
Mr. Baker, if you so firmly believe...

427
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,640
<i>that Mr. Colby did the right thing,</i>

428
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:04,546
why didn't you pick up a gun
and killJoynes yourself?

429
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:11,055
<i>They changed the route.
The bus dropped me off early that day.</i>

430
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,955
So your father wasn't there
to meet you like he usually did?

431
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,586
<i>No, but it's only three blocks.
I used to walk it by myself.</i>

432
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:21,393
<i>You mean before LyleJoynes
moved back into the neighborhood?</i>

433
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:25,562
<i>What happened
when you passed by his house?</i>

434
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,902
I saw Mr. Joynes
sitting on his porch.

435
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:33,034
- What was he doing?
- Smoking a cigarette.

436
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,605
<i>- Did he talk to you?
- He asked me where I lived.</i>

437
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:42,744
<i>- Did you tell him?
- He already knew.</i>

438
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,915
He said I was Jimmy Colby's daughter.

439
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:51,451
Said he grew up with my dad.
I only talked to him for a minute.

440
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,965
Did he say anything else?

441
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,593
He said-

442
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,835
He said he'd come visit my house.

443
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,108
<i>We'd be friends.</i>

444
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,906
I ran home and locked the door.

445
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,144
<i>[Grizano] Did you tell your
father when you came home?</i>

446
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,950
I'd never seen him so mad.

447
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,349
His face got red.

448
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,523
He punched the wall.

449
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,532
It scared me.

450
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:34,864
Mr. Joynes didn't seem bad at first,
not like everyone said.

451
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,539
I didn't know.

452
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:47,148
<i>[Grizano]
It's okay, Brianne. You did great.</i>

453
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,982
<i>No more questions, Your Honor.</i>

454
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,526
Brianne.

455
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:08,766
<i>You're very brave
to come and talk to us today.</i>

456
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,206
Are you okay?

457
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,740
Now- [Clears Throat]

458
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,912
When you told your father
that Mr. Joynes had talked to you,

459
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,386
did your dad say that
he was going to hurt him?

460
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,650
Objection. Hearsay.

461
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,919
Overruled. You may answer.

462
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:35,159
I don't know.
He made me go up to my room.

463
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,667
Did you hear your dad leave the house?

464
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,164
Not then.

465
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:45,608
I wanted to call my friend Rachel,
but my dad was on the phone.

466
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:57,787
I pulled the LUDS. The, uh, call in question
was placed to Karla Grizano's cell phone.

467
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,757
<i>Colby called his attorney?
Spoke for nine minutes.</i>

468
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:04,761
Now, that's enough time to get some legal
advice before committing a major felony.

469
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,390
<i>Make that two felonies
if she knew he planned to kill Joynes.</i>

470
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,934
Oh, there's no way to know that.
She'd claim privilege.

471
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,903
Well, privilege or not,
I don't think she was in the dark.

472
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,963
Maybe we take a look at Ms. Grizano.

473
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,737
Closing arguments are in the morning.
Jury'll have this case by lunch.

474
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,146
I'll hustle.

475
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:29,612
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
as you deliberate,</i>

476
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:34,590
we need you to focus on the two
most important questions in this case:

477
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,724
How could they let that monster out?

478
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:43,358
<i>How could they let him prey
on our children...</i>

479
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:47,768
and not expect
reasonable people to act?

480
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:57,412
<i>[Kibre] MaybeJames Colby is a
good man who killed a bad man,</i>

481
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,612
but your solemn duty is to render
a verdict based on the law.

482
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,985
Not on sentiment. Not on sympathy.

483
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:09,925
The defense claims
a justification for murder,

484
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:15,193
<i>but that is the first step down a slippery
slope of exceptions and excuses...</i>

485
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,498
that others will use to twist the law
to their own ends.

486
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,405
Who will be safe...

487
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:27,035
if we justify people
murdering other people...

488
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,138
in our streets or in our homes?

489
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,078
And if that happens,

490
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:39,920
how will we ever be able to tell
the good men from the bad?

491
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,661
<i>We got lucky.
We found the getaway car.</i>

492
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,671
Vehicle's registered
to her ex-husband, Dominic Grizano.

493
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,333
I thought the car fleeing
the scene was a Cutlass.

494
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,866
Well, this year's Buick
looks pretty similar. Easy mistake.

495
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,675
- And Grizano had access to it?
- We talked to the ex.

496
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:08,048
It's his car per the settlement, but he's pretty
sure she has a key. We're lifting some prints now.

497
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,850
Found this under the driver's seat.
578 Perry?

498
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,484
Wait. That's the address
ofJoynes's therapist.

499
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,832
Colby's getaway car,
and his attorney is behind the wheel.

500
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:35,711
Helped her own client commit murder.
Dare I ask why?

501
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,941
Reaping the rewards
of Colby's notoriety.

502
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,246
Win or lose,
Grizano's star has risen.

503
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,253
She's been playing the press
with an eye on the city council.

504
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,380
Fifty-third District,
from what I hear.

505
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,390
Charlie Kleber's seat.

506
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,892
You know, I'm not sure Colby's aware
of her political ambitions.

507
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,397
Maybe if he knew that
she was using him to step up-

508
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,523
Can't approach him
without his attorney being present.

509
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,764
- But what if we did it in front of her? Moved for a mistrial?
- Based on what?

510
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,806
Rumor that she wants to run for office?

511
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,900
You already say you can't tie
the car evidence to the day of the murder.

512
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,537
Still might be enough
to get her disqualified.

513
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,638
We'll get more evidence.
The jury's out.

514
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,309
You're right up against a verdict.
No time.

515
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,478
<i>We get Colby convicted,
we'll have more leverage to flip him.</i>

516
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,387
And this case is a slam dunk, right?

517
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:24,826
We don't convict him,
Colby and his attorney take a walk.

518
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:29,428
<i>We should be nailing Lady Macbeth,
not some working stiff from Queens.</i>

519
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,094
The car alone isn't enough
to get her on the murder.

520
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,263
If Colby gets convicted,
we'll offer him a deal.

521
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,772
If he gets convicted.
You taking bets?

522
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,809
On verdicts? Never.

523
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,305
Possibility of that woman
walking away from this-

524
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,811
I want to get her.

525
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,547
You have something in mind?

526
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,784
What if Colby spoke up
before the verdict came in?

527
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,658
Went to the judge, told him that
he wanted new counsel and said why?

528
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:01,129
- That his lawyer was an accomplice?
- Yeah.

529
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,158
Then the judge would rule a mistrial,
Colby would take a deal,

530
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,466
and we'd get Grizano.

531
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:10,132
How do you provoke him?

532
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,440
How about we make
Colby believe that Grizano...

533
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,844
deliberately got him indicted?

534
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:22,045
<i>Like maybe she tipped us off
to some evidence.</i>

535
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,454
<i>I've got a connect at The Ledger.
I think I got something that might work.</i>

536
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,152
<i>[Grizano]
How you doin', Jimmy?</i>

537
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,824
How do you think I'm doin'?

538
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,465
A reporter called me. He said, um-

539
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,336
He said someone told the police
where I got the gun.

540
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,501
- An anonymous caller.
- What?

541
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:50,411
<i>No one at the restaurant even knew the gun
was gone until the police came to search.</i>

542
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,644
Except you.
You're the only one who knew.

543
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,983
Don't fall for this trick, Jimmy.

544
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,750
Be smart for once in your life.

545
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,292
Why would the reporter lie?

546
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,352
The D.A.' s behind it.
They're bluffing.

547
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,422
Don't you get it?
They want you to react.

548
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,231
- How?
- Turning us against each other.

549
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,033
Getting you to take a plea.

550
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,666
Look at me.

551
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:25,813
Their best deal is going to send you to prison,
and I'm not gonna let them muck it up.

552
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,613
We are so close, Jimmy.

553
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:37,286
I don't sleep at night either.

554
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,926
But I'm here.
I'm right here, standing by you.

555
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,335
I took Brianne out
for ice cream last night.

556
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,300
You know, I want her
to remember me as, uh-

557
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,869
- No, don't go there! Don't-
- They're gonna convict me!

558
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:04,281
No way. I've got that jury
on your side.

559
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,815
Three of them had tears in their eyes
when Brianne was on the stand.

560
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,225
<i>They're going to acquit.</i>

561
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,457
Trust me, Jimmy.

562
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,972
[Sighs]

563
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,977
Mr. Colby.

564
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,239
Excuse me. L-
I need to talk to you.

565
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:32,510
No. You're not supposed to be-
Just a minute of your time, please.

566
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,051
No, I'm not allowed to speak to you
without your lawyer present.

567
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,246
That's why I need to talk to you.

568
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,280
Well, if you have a problem with your counsel,
you need to bring it up to the judge, not me.

569
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,691
No. Please!
Listen, this is highly inappropriate!

570
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,161
I'm sorry. I can't.
Yeah.

571
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,527
Did anyone see you talking to him?
He approached me on the street.

572
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,867
Oh, great. So only half the city
witnessed it! Why didn't you walk away?

573
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,272
I did. He was very insistent.
Oh, he was insistent.

574
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:02,870
All Grizano would have to do
is get Colby to say that you approached him,

575
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,178
get some witness to back him up
and then report us to the bar.

576
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,218
Let's just see if he talks to the judge.

577
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,719
Tracey?
What?

578
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,880
The clerk called.
The jury's back.

579
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,229
<i>[Gaffney]
I think Colby'll flip.</i>

580
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,231
I'm gonna need more than a hunch.

581
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,530
Tracey, we need him. We've got nothing
on Grizano without his testimony.

582
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:29,062
I'm not gonna pressure him in court
and have it blow up in my face.

583
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,308
All rise.

584
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,637
Be seated.

585
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:41,482
<i>As you know, we have a verdict.
I'm going to bring in thejury.</i>

586
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,919
Better be right about this.
Your Honor?

587
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,980
Yes, Ms. Kibre?

588
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,356
Your Honor, we'd like to ask
that the verdict remain sealed.

589
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,658
- What?
- This is highly unusual.

590
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,198
Yes, I understand that.

591
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,064
These jurors want to go home.
If you're trying to somehow delay-

592
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,901
New evidence has come to our attention
which implicates Ms. Grizano...

593
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:05,203
<i>as a coconspirator in theJoynes murder.</i>

594
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,710
Your Honor,
this is totally without basis.

595
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:11,373
<i>We're opening a grandjury investigation
into her role in the crime.</i>

596
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,542
Oh, come on!

597
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:18,111
<i>There's a manifest necessity to seal
the verdict until this matter can be resolved.</i>

598
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,784
This is an illegal ploy to get me
disqualified as Mr. Colby's counsel.

599
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,794
<i>Your Honor, this man is facing
conviction and sentencing.</i>

600
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,763
He may go to prison
for the rest of his life.

601
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:32,599
<i>It's our duty to make sure that there was
no conflict of interest with his legal advice.</i>

602
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,468
<i>I want this evidence right now.</i>

603
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:45,547
We found the car Ms. Grizano used
to chauffeur her client to the murder.

604
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:49,882
- Your Honor, these are outrageous lies.
- Enough, Ms. Grizano.

605
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:55,321
All right. In view of this claim, I'm
going to excuse the jury for 48 hours...

606
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,885
and seal the verdict until
I can review this evidence.

607
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,727
Then I'll decide
whether we have a mistrial.

608
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,496
What about Mr. Colby's counsel?
Given the possibility of a conflict,

609
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,232
he should be allowed to dismiss
his attorney should he see fit.

610
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:13,140
<i>Kibre, I'm gonna file
misconduct charges at the bar.</i>

611
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,737
- Your Honor?
- Jimmy, sit down.

612
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:20,306
- Your Honor, I want a new lawyer.
- You're asking to dismiss your attorney, Mr. Colby?

613
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,285
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- Because you believe there's a conflict?</i>

614
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,152
Yes, ma'am, I do.

615
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:30,785
Ms. Grizano, where are you going?
Counselor, we're not done!

616
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,262
<i>Come back here, or I'll hold you
in contempt! Officers!</i>

617
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,265
Mm-mmm.

618
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,874
<i>I had to talk to someone.</i>

619
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,967
He went after my kid.

620
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,842
Brianne couldn't see it,
but he was-

621
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,611
<i>Seducing her?
Yeah. I was out of my head.</i>

622
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,618
I was so angry.

623
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,849
Karla was like this calm voice
at the other end of the phone.

624
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,357
I didn't know what to do.

625
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,562
She said I should killJoynes.

626
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,961
The people would thank me for it.

627
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,999
She picked me up.
We drove into Manhattan.

628
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,041
She knew where he'd be.

629
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:22,841
Afterwards,
she got rid of the gun.

630
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,473
I went home...

631
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,983
and hugged my daughter.

632
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,988
I thought I was doin' the right thing.

633
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,095
He consents to a mistrial,

634
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,260
testifies against Grizano,

635
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,964
we'd drop the charge to man one.

636
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:52,668
It's a serious crime,
so I can offer you five years.

637
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,338
I'll take it.
I just want this to be over.

638
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:02,178
And then we're going to indict
Karla Grizano for murder.

639
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,528
<i>Short meeting.</i>

640
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,587
Came all this way for nothing.

641
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,758
Grizano rejected the plea?

642
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:21,134
Didn't even want to hear it.
I'm happy to go to trial.

643
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:25,801
You know, I never asked you-
What did you think Colby's verdict was?

644
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,937
You mean the sealed verdict in the
back of some file cabinet somewhere?

645
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,948
I don't speculate.

646
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,213
Four days of deliberating?
I know what I think.

647
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,278
Yeah? Well, you're wrong.
They convicted him.
