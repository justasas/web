1
00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:02,287
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,287 --> 00:00:05,938
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:07,150
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,798
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:13,678
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,395
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,941
Come out, come out.
Wherever you are.

8
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:23,814
You can't hide from me.
I know you're in there.

9
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:25,374
I'm gonna get you.

10
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:27,709
Police!
Drop your weapon.

11
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:30,096
- Don't move.
- Don't... don't shoot.

12
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,687
What are you doing with that?

13
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:34,901
I just kill the nasty creature.

14
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:54,368
Help me.

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,775
I saw she said, "Help me."
I think, she's in shock.

16
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:00,128
Well, did you get a name 
or what happened to her?

17
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:02,994
Ashley Tyler.
16, raped, beat to hell.

18
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:04,286
Okay, I'd better ride along.

19
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:07,437
I've caught your mook red-handed. 
Name is Cyrus Stewarts.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,302
He was waving a murder weapon
around like a banshee.

21
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:12,412
Whoa, take it easy there pal.

22
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:15,731
First of all,  she's alive 
so, that's not a murder weapon, right?

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,325
Right. / Mr. Stewarts, 
I'm Detective Stabler.

24
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,883
- Is it your machete?
- Yes, sir.

25
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,439
So, what happened to you, you get 
carried away, take it out on the girl?

26
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,784
No, I only came out to kill the rats 
and squirrels in my garden.

27
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:30,550
Well, don't lie to me, Cyrus.

28
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,801
My partner is in that ambulance
with the girl.

29
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,615
She's gonna tell us who attacked her.

30
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:37,421
She's all yours, Detective.

31
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:41,340
Ashley, I'm Detective Benson.
I need to ask you couple of questions.

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,107
- Get away from me.
- I'm here to help you.

33
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:45,295
- Leave me alone.
- Ashley, you're safe now, honey.

34
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,546
No, stop it.

35
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:49,982
- Let her down, I'll sedate her.
- Get away.

36
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:51,744
- Get away.
- It's okay, honey.

37
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,232
- Stop it!
- Calm down.

38
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:56,047
- It's okay.
- Leave me alone.

39
00:01:57,072 --> 00:01:58,556
Go to hell.

40
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:08,285
I never seen a rape vic attack a cop.

41
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,788
Neither do I.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2008/04/15

59
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,940
Ashley went to bed early last night.

60
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,840
We didn't even know she snuck out. 
Until the hospital called.

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,444
Do you have any ideas where she went?

62
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:07,816
No, did she tell you what happened?

63
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:10,728
She became violent in the ambulance
and had to be sedated.

64
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,927
Does Ashley have a history
of emotional problems?

65
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,259
- I don't think so.
- You're not sure?

66
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,841
We're her foster parents. Ashley's 
only been with us a couple of months.

67
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,934
- Why is she in foster care?
- Abuse.

68
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,333
- What kind of abuse?
- Please.

69
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,425
We'll talk later.
Right not we need to see her.

70
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,243
Oh, sweetheart.
We're so sorry.

71
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:34,870
Don't worry, Ash.
Everything's gonna be okay.

72
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:40,278
Why is she here?

73
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:42,630
Ashley, I need you to make a statement.

74
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:45,300
- Right now?
- Well, it can wait.

75
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,361
But I do need you to sign
a consent to release the rape kit.

76
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,728
What's that?

77
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:53,929
When you were asleep the nurse 
examined you and we collected evidence.

78
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:56,532
She touched me?
Hank, can they do that?

79
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:59,199
Ashley, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

80
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,408
We need the evidence so we can
convict your attacker when we catch him.

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,019
- Make her go away.
- You should come back later.

82
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,448
I... I understand that you're upset,
but the longer we wait...

83
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,638
I don't wanna talk about it.

84
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:11,412
Ashley, I know that this is really hard.
But I need your help.

85
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,783
Please, make her stop.

86
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,215
Leave.

87
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,122
Now.

88
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:24,944
Ashley's too afraid to talk.
Perp's gotta be somebody she knows.

89
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:27,312
CSU says the crime scene was clean.

90
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:28,848
Guy even dug up plants.

91
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,992
What about the victim?
He leave anything on her?

92
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,131
Oh, the nurse found fluids.

93
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:35,548
But without Ashley's consent
the hospital won't release the rape kit.

94
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,624
Well, we can't force her to cooperate.

95
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:40,542
No, but we can keep the case open
if we suspect abuse.

96
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:43,453
Well, what about the 
machete-wielding gardener?

97
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:45,326
Yeah, he's a fruitcake, 
not a rapist.

98
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,110
I still like the foster dad for it.

99
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,639
Or maybe you're just looking
for a reason to keep investigating.

100
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,139
Captain, the girl was traumatized.

101
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,580
She was raped until evidence
proves she wasn't.

102
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,290
You got the rest of the day.
Find something or move on.

103
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,257
ACS says the foster parents are clean.

104
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,148
No police record,
no complaints.

105
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,367
Okay, but that hardly rules them out.

106
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:06,383
They said that Ashley has 
a history of abuse. Any record of that?

107
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:09,521
Nothing so far.
But Ashley's mother, Risa,

108
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:12,088
is doing 12 years
up at Sealview on a drug rap.

109
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:13,811
Sealview?
I thought they closed that dump.

110
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,664
Corrections had to reopen it.

111
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:17,574
Locking up a lot more
of the ladies these days.

112
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:19,241
What about her father, 
he molest her?

113
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:21,322
Out of the picture
since before she was born.

114
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,413
Hold on a second.

115
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:26,260
After Ashley's mom was sent away
she moved in with her uncle, Rick Tyler.

116
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,772
So why'd she leave?

117
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,404
Because uncle Rick
molested her when she was ten.

118
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:32,855
I found them in bed together.
He was naked.

119
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:34,137
Surprise home visit?

120
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:36,684
I knocked, no answer,
door was open, I went in.

121
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:38,130
He didn't even get out of bed.

122
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,654
- You file on him?
- Damn skippy.

123
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:42,034
But Ashley loves her uncle,
denied everything.

124
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:44,435
- So you sent her to a group home?
- I had to.

125
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:48,198
For six years, uncle Rick's been 
scaring off potential foster families.

126
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:50,565
- You let him have a say?
- Soon as I get her placed,

127
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:53,500
he shows up at all hours
demanding to see Ashley.

128
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,573
This guy, he's got a real thing for her.

129
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:58,141
- He use his thing to rape her?
- Wouldn't surprise me.

130
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:00,543
So why didn't you get an 
order of protection for Ashley?

131
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:03,875
I did.
Which led to his latest scheme.

132
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,731
Refiles for custody,
that's pretty ballsy.

133
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:07,896
He have a shot?

134
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,484
Over my dead body.

135
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,477
This guy's a perv.

136
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:15,596
APARTMENT OF RICK TYLER
263 EAST 97TH STREET
BROWNSVILLE, NEW YORK
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21

137
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:21,618
Dirt bag's taking a shower.

138
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:28,351
Hey.

139
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:31,745
Happy family before 
mom went to prison.

140
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,249
Check out the boots.

141
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:35,377
Look like garden soil to you?

142
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:39,027
- Rick Tyler.
- That you, baby?

143
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,969
I got soap in my ears.

144
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,366
You left the door open.

145
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:45,625
Open for you.

146
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:00,641
- Well, I got it now.
- What?

147
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,728
Police.

148
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,641
Let's go, little Ricky.

149
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:08,660
I haven't seen Ashley
since they too her away.

150
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:11,674
Frigging child services
won't let me near her.

151
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,002
Because you molested her?

152
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:17,138
That ACS worker has a filthy mind.

153
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,025
Her mom was locked up
when she was ten.

154
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,544
She was scared to be alone.

155
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:23,171
So you invite her into your bed.

156
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:25,816
Ashley's my niece.
I love her.

157
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:27,693
I swear nothing happened.

158
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:29,318
Uncle Rick would never hurt me.

159
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,752
Then what was he doing
in bed, naked, with you?

160
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:35,252
Sleeping. All you people
thing about is sex.

161
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,604
He didn't abuse me.
He loves me.

162
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,014
Start loving her long distance.

163
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:41,678
You're looking at ten years
for possession.

164
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,020
Those pills are legit.
I got a scrip.

165
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,365
Really?

166
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:49,136
Did doctor feel good also
writing you a scrip for the pot?

167
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,928
Ashley, you're not supposed
to be around your uncle,

168
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,853
let alone watering his pot plants
in the middle of the night.

169
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:56,798
The weed was for his pain.

170
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:59,841
Please don't arrest him.
He's only family I've got.

171
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:02,685
- What about your mother?
- She's in prison.

172
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:05,600
- For dealing drugs, I know.
- My mom's not a drug dealer.

173
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,098
Well, then what was she doing with 
a couple of kilos of Marijuana in her car?

174
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:12,047
Risa wasn't selling.
She was buying for me.

175
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,058
She went to jail because
she got caught with your dope?

176
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,630
That's why I've been fighting.
To take care of Ashley.

177
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,540
- I gotta make things right.
- So help us out.

178
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,249
Get Ashley to tell us
what happened to her.

179
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,591
This is way above your pay grade, man.

180
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,103
What does that mean?

181
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,399
You know who did this to your niece.

182
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,215
You know.

183
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:45,753
You don't love Ashley. If you did, 
you'd be telling me who raped her.

184
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,534
You're only gonna protect him.

185
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:51,985
You're telling me it's a cop, now.

186
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:53,993
Prison guard.

187
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,834
Where my sister's locked up.
He's dealing to the inmates.

188
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,008
Well, you're his supplier,
so tell me his name.

189
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,685
- I don't know. I've never seen him.
- You don't know. You've never seen..

190
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:05,602
He tells Risa what he wants,
where to leave it,

191
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:10,080
- and she gets word to me.
- All right... all right.

192
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,325
Tell me how this all got started.

193
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:18,240
He knew Risa got busted
with a load of pot.

194
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:22,620
Told her she better start supplying him 
or he's make her life hell.

195
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,175
So when's the next drop?

196
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,463
Risa made me stop.

197
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,504
Told me I gotta get clean
to get custody of Ashley.

198
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:33,861
The bastard raped you
when his pipeline dried up.

199
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:35,891
Yeah.

200
00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:38,595
Ashley, how did he find you?

201
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,446
He must have followed me
to the garden.

202
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:43,457
What's his name?

203
00:09:43,755 --> 00:09:45,186
I don't know.

204
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:48,882
- Describe him.
- White, tall.

205
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:53,236
He attacked me from behind.
I never saw his face.

206
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,268
Did he say anything?

207
00:09:57,077 --> 00:10:01,268
"I gave your mother a message,
but she didn't listen.

208
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,014
Now I'll give it to you."

209
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,762
And then he raped me.

210
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:09,166
Ashley.

211
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,507
You gotta give me the rape kit.

212
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,960
It's the only way
we're gonna ID this guy.

213
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,060
Okay.

214
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:28,152
But what if he finds out?

215
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,667
We'll protect you.

216
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,944
Who'll protect my mom?

217
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,234
He's raping her too.

218
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,102
Gotta be 300 or 400
guys working at Sealview.

219
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:43,182
No judge is gonna let us
swab them all for their DNA.

220
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,205
Maybe we'll get lucky and the
DNA's already in the system.

221
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:47,750
Dr. Reyes needs a suture kit 
in trauma three. / Excuse me.

222
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,964
Yeah? / We're here to pick up
the rape kit for Ashley Tyler.

223
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:53,732
Don't you people talk to each other?
One of your guys already picked it up.

224
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,142
I need a name.

225
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:58,449
And I got a bus accident on fifth.

226
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,783
Been nonstop all day.

227
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:02,642
I could sworn he signed for it.

228
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,589
- You sure he was a cop?
- He had a badge.

229
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:08,013
Like mine? / No, like what
your uniform cops wear.

230
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,129
- Okay, do you surveillance cameras?
- If only they worked.

231
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,328
Carey, we have a patient seizing in two.

232
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:16,328
I wrote his badge number down.
It's on the chart.

233
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:22,486
- Badge number C10834.
- That's New York State corrections.

234
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:26,216
Perp flashes it quick,
anyone can mistake it for a cop's.

235
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:28,371
Only this one is a retired number.

236
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:31,161
Prison guard knows how the system works.
He needed that rape kit.

237
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,088
- Nurse give you a description? 
- Place was a zoo.

238
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:35,421
She didn't even notice
that he forgot to sign the log.

239
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:38,431
And all Ashley caught was a glance.
Tall and white.

240
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,858
Well, then without
that rape kit we got nothing.

241
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:43,372
Except Risa Tyler.

242
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,499
She's dead if the perp
finds out she's talking to cops.

243
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:49,731
Who said anything
about talking to a cop?

244
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:53,961
SEALVIEW
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
VISITATION ROOM
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 22

245
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,213
Can we have a little
attorney-client privilege?

246
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:06,762
Have a seat.

247
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,831
- You're not my lawyer.
- Pretend I am. Have a seat.

248
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm a detective with the city.
I'm here about your daughter.

249
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,667
- Ashley? Is she all right?
- Keep it down.

250
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:22,090
She was attacked, but she's fine.

251
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,526
Oh, my God. My baby.

252
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,888
You gotta keep her safe.
Promise me. / We will.

253
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:33,142
Never should told my brother
to stop supplying him.

254
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:37,273
- Nothing can stop him.
- Shh, listen to me.

255
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,236
Gimme a name.
Who is he?

256
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,358
- I can't.
- Visitation's over.

257
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:47,326
- We're not finished here.
- Yes, you are. Let's go, Tyler.

258
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:50,469
You denied my client
a right to legal counsel.

259
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,833
- Ask me if I care.
- I wanna see the Warden.

260
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:54,619
Be my guest.

261
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:59,602
You can see her in 30 days.
We found contraband in your client's cell.

262
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,372
Contraband just magically turned up?

263
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:04,006
We search the cells twice a day.
Found marijuana and a Shiv.

264
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:07,312
Ms. Tyler sharpened her toothbrush
to a nasty little point.

265
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:09,706
She goes straight to the hole.
You know the regs, counselor.

266
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,511
Yeah, I'm not her counselor.

267
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,679
Detective Stabler, NYPD.

268
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,289
You better have a damn good reason
for your little charade.

269
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:22,708
Look, one of your officers
raped a 16-year-old girl.

270
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,341
- Who?
- I'm not sure.

271
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:26,651
You have evidence?

272
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,958
We had his DNA, but he stole
the victim's rape kit from the hospital.

273
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,593
Look, if one of my staff
commits a crime,

274
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,280
I want him out of here
as much as you do.

275
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,752
I need a list of all the officers
with abuse complaints in their jackets.

276
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,312
Do you have a warrant?

277
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,508
I was hoping for a little
professional courtesy.

278
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:43,504
My cooperation does not include trampling
on my employees' right to privacy.

279
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:47,506
Well, the officer that you're protecting
is also smuggling drugs into your prison.

280
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,815
I'm not protecting anyone.

281
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:51,662
I'll show you.

282
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:55,363
Look up there.
Every move my COs make is recorded.

283
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:57,127
They're randomly piss tested
once a month.

284
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,129
But he's not using,
he's dealing to the inmates.

285
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,761
If you'd just let me take to Risa,
maybe she'd give me a name.

286
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:06,339
Look, Detective, this facility
has a zero-tolerance drug policy.

287
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:08,447
Any drugs come in here,
we find them.

288
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,128
Now, I won't deny most of the women 
locked up here are addicts,

289
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:13,058
which is why you can't believe 
a word they say.

290
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,266
Including Risa Tyler.

291
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,080
Sealview is clean.

292
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,896
Nobody's raping anyone.

293
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,305
- That's not what the inmates say.
- How do you know?

294
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,638
Prison rape elimination act
requires all prisons

295
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:27,628
to submit a list of complaints
to the department of justice.

296
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:30,939
Okay, so last year, 42 women claimed
they were raped at Sealview, huh?

297
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:35,102
And of those, 20 were unsubstantiated.
Another 20 unfounded.

298
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:38,981
Only two of those make it the DA's office.
And none of them were prosecuted.

299
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:42,773
Why? / Well, because it comes down
to a crack whore's word against a CO.

300
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,892
Don't you call my mother a whore.

301
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,986
Ashley, we know that she's not.

302
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,991
If you know so much,
tell me why my mother's in solitary.

303
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,108
Her cellmate called,
said the grapevine's buzzing.

304
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,783
About a cop who showed up
asking questions.

305
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,788
What the hell did you do?

306
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,200
Why don't we go talk
someplace more private?

307
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,412
Ashley, your mother is in the hole
because they found pot in here cell.

308
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:06,655
Are you stupid?

309
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,705
The guard who raped me
must've planted it.

310
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:10,585
He knows you're on to him.

311
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:12,143
We don't even know who he is.

312
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:15,746
You said you'd get him
if I gave you the rape kit.

313
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:19,538
- He stole it from the hospital.
- He's smarter than you are?

314
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,222
We're not giving up.

315
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:25,222
I never should trusted you.

316
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,355
- Ashley, wait... wait.
- Screw you.

317
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:29,858
You're gonna get my mother killed.
Just leave us alone.

318
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:32,511
Ashley, listen to me.
Listen to me.

319
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:35,809
Now, I know that you're scared.
But if we don't stop him,

320
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,447
he's gonna keep on hurting your mother
and lots of other women at Sealview.

321
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,373
You think locking him up
is gonna make a difference?

322
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,396
Yes, I do. / You don't know
what she goes through.

323
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:45,897
Half the guards 
in there mess with her.

324
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,065
Ashley, come here.
Tell me.

325
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:52,935
Tell me.

326
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:03,134
- When I visit...
- Yeah?

327
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:07,812
Afterwards, they strip-search her.

328
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:13,198
A guard sticks his hand
inside her

329
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,341
and says,
"Feels good, doesn't it?"

330
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:24,602
And if I send a photo instead,
they rip it up right in front of her.

331
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,409
Every day they try to break her.

332
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,621
So don't tell me you can help.

333
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,507
Cause there's nothing you can do.

334
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:49,383
Send me to Sealview.
Undercover.

335
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,723
- Not a chance.
- Why?

336
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:53,832
- Because it's a suicide mission.
- I've done it before, I can do it again.

337
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:56,589
With tree huggers, not convicts
and corrections officers.

338
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,315
Captain, you know that I can handle it.

339
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:02,167
You go inside, you have no authority,
no right, no backup.

340
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:05,820
And if we don't stop this guard,
he will continue to rape and abuse women.

341
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,784
You don't know 
that he's raping anyone.

342
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:09,207
42 complaints?

343
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,624
Inmates have a lot of reasons
to file a complaint.

344
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:14,981
- Retribution, losses.
- So you don't believe Ashley's mother?

345
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,310
It's not our job
to police the prisons.

346
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,900
And what should I tell Ashley,

347
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,158
that your mother is an inmate,
so she doesn't really count.

348
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:22,711
She's not a real victim.

349
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,597
The Warden stonewalled Elliot.

350
00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:27,523
She's not gonna go along with this.

351
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:28,980
So don't tell her.

352
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:34,245
Do you have any idea what
you're getting yourself into?

353
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:44,227
I'll see if I can convince
the corrections commissioner.

354
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:48,249
Work with Huang.
Put together a bulletproof cover.

355
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:57,123
I developed your prison person a
based on a behavioral analysis

356
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:59,711
of inmate profiles at Sealview.

357
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,703
I've been using drugs since I was 13?

358
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,754
And then started mulling
to support my habit.

359
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:08,344
Prescription pills, mostly,
but you won't say no to the hard stuff.

360
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:12,879
- What's my name?
- Katrina Rae Lewis.

361
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:18,270
I hearby sentence you to five years 
at Sealview correctional facility.

362
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,145
You're not a recreational user.

363
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:23,178
You're a hardcore drug addict
facing withdrawal.

364
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:27,700
You won't survive unless you get your hands
on some pharmaceuticals.

365
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:33,474
Move it, ladies.
Single file.

366
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,887
Hands at your waist at all times.

367
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:39,416
Abusive father, abusive husband.

368
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,487
Just like all the other inmates.

369
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:44,303
You're a target for abuse.

370
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,655
Every man's punching bag.

371
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:53,078
Put your clothes in the basket
and then hand them to the officer.

372
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:56,510
This will be a full body
and cavity search.

373
00:18:57,866 --> 00:18:59,742
You'll have no privacy.

374
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:07,245
You will shower, sleep, dress, and use 
the toilet in full view of other people.

375
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:17,898
At times, you will feel humiliated 
and degraded.

376
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:52,073
30 seconds, finish it up.

377
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:56,544
You're going to see things
you wanna stop

378
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:58,995
with every fiber of your being.

379
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:01,404
Hands against the wall,
spread them.

380
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:03,412
Hold on, shouldn't a woman 
be doing this? / Shut up.

381
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,206
But you can't react.

382
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:09,392
- Ever.
- Someone's been working out.

383
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,258
Don't you touch me like that.

384
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:17,954
Stop. Stop. / Hey, new guy.
Enough already.

385
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:20,753
Hey, this ain't Rikers.

386
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,887
Now you get your head on straight,
or I'll write you up, you understand me?

387
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:26,781
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

388
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:30,554
Okay, Let me see.

389
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,849
Okay, you're all right, come on.
Let's get you to infirmary.

390
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,868
Come on.

391
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,882
Not bad for your first day on the job.

392
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,713
Let me give you some advice, hon.

393
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:52,458
Don't mouth off to the officers.
They don't mess around.

394
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,190
That's exactly what he was doing.

395
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,292
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
He could done a lot worse.

396
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,577
What guard did she piss off?

397
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:06,498
Risa?
She hung herself.

398
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,212
- Risa?
- Yeah, you know her?

399
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:12,600
No.

400
00:21:30,863 --> 00:21:32,440
I'm sorry, Ashley.

401
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,201
Leave me alone.

402
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,738
I promised your mother
I'd look out for you.

403
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:43,354
Right.
Like you looked out for her?

404
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:46,110
You went up to Sealview,
and you got her killed.

405
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:54,427
My mother. Didn't kill herself.
She'd never leave me like that.

406
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,892
I know she loved you.

407
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:01,156
Maybe things just got too tough.

408
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:04,637
No.
I know she was murdered.

409
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,952
How do you know?

410
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:09,524
I got a letter from her this morning.

411
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:15,463
"Baby, I know things are tough right now.

412
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:17,067
But you got to keep your head up.

413
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,729
Every time I feel low,
I think of you, and the good days ahead.

414
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,368
Be strong."

415
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:25,077
Did your mom say anything else?

416
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,702
Just to keep my grades up,
and that she couldn't wait to see me.

417
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:32,342
That sound like she was
going to kill herself?

418
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:36,001
- Risa did not commit suicide.
- How can you tell?

419
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:40,060
I pulled her autopsy report.
Her hyoid bone was broken.

420
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,278
Doesn't usually happen
in a hanging. / Right.

421
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,039
I think the whole scene was staged.

422
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,080
Right-handers generally
slip the knot over their right side.

423
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,533
Lefties over the left.

424
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,426
This knot's right at the base
of Risa's skull.

425
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:51,618
Risa was strangled.

426
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:54,303
Then the murderer strung her up
to make it look like a suicide.

427
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,401
So is the local ME gonna
change it to homicide?

428
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,706
He refuses to re-examine her.

429
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:02,244
Westerville's a poor county,
Sealview's their largest employer.

430
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:04,195
ME doesn't want to make waves.

431
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:07,262
So what's to stop this guy
from doing it again?

432
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,284
Nothing.

433
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:13,685
SEALVIEW 
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
EXERCISE YARD
TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26

434
00:23:30,064 --> 00:23:32,001
No no, come on.
Get it up.

435
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,451
- Hey, just off the boat, huh?
- Leave me alone.

436
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:38,349
Oh, you jonesin'.

437
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,339
And you got a hearing problem.

438
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:43,669
Have a nice week.

439
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:48,931
I uh...

440
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:53,564
I just need to get straight.
You know who's holding?

441
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:55,239
There's nothing here.
It's been dry for about a week.

442
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,723
- Okay, so when's the re-up?
- Simmer down, girl.

443
00:23:57,723 --> 00:24:00,049
- What's your name?
- Kat.

444
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:02,964
- You?
- Shawna.

445
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,528
Hey, Shawna, I just...

446
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,278
I just need a little taste
to get the edge off, you know?

447
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,635
The only way you're going
to score is by flat-backing.

448
00:24:12,974 --> 00:24:14,271
Whatever.

449
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:18,494
Well, you gotta make 
you merchandise a little more attractive.

450
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,852
You know, like, uh...
like that girl over there. You see her?

451
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:25,249
She gets whatever she needs.

452
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,814
Come on.

453
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:31,649
Later, baby.
Here come your buyers.

454
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:34,762
- Where'd you transfer in from?
- Rikers, but I worked men's.

455
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:36,323
This place is different.

456
00:24:36,323 --> 00:24:39,353
With women, it's less about violence.
It's more about mind games.

457
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,923
Like real life.

458
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:44,579
Feeling better today?

459
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:45,908
Peachy.

460
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:48,749
"Yes, thank you, CO."
Is the correct response.

461
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,503
Yes, thank you, CO.

462
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:56,280
Now apologize to officer Johnson.

463
00:24:57,104 --> 00:25:00,211
- For what?
- You got blood on his shoes.

464
00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:05,576
- He kicked me.
- Excuse me?

465
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:13,636
I'm sorry for getting blood on your shoes.
It won't happen again.

466
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,214
It better not.

467
00:25:22,776 --> 00:25:24,219
Pick it up.

468
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:29,043
If she gives you any problems,
you call me.

469
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,811
I'll take care of her.

470
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:40,490
Warner says Risa's death
wasn't a suicide.

471
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,159
Well, ask Elliot to check out
your new best friend. / Done.

472
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:51,159
Keep up the good work, 
sweet-cheeks.

473
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:57,736
CO Matthew Parker, 36.
No criminal record,

474
00:25:57,736 --> 00:26:01,641
but a couple complaints from his wife, 
before she was his ex.

475
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:04,193
Well, maybe she left him
after finding his porn collection.

476
00:26:04,193 --> 00:26:07,545
Our boy here's got
16 subscriptions to hardcore websites.

477
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:09,396
Who needs that much smut?

478
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:12,551
A guy who can't get it any other way,
unless he's raping inmates.

479
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,396
He's worked at six prisons
in the last nine years.

480
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:17,741
- All women's facilities.
- Easy pickings.

481
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,975
A guy like him moves on before any inmate
works up the nerve to report him.

482
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:22,755
Well, Risa Tyler had nerve,
and it got her killed.

483
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,053
We got to get Liv out of there.

484
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:26,245
If she wants out,
all she has to do is tell Fin.

485
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:28,349
Well, we got a suspect.
Maybe Ashley can ID him.

486
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:30,536
Speak of the devil.
Foster mom just called.


487
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:32,287
Ashley's back in the hospital.

488
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:37,884
MERCY GENERAL HOSPITAL
ISOLATION WARD 
365 WEST 32ND STREET
TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26

489
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:42,364
Is she dead? / No, no, I'm here
as a public health official.

490
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:45,656
She's been diagnosed
with multidrug-resistant TB.

491
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:49,176
- How bad?
- Deadly if it's in the advanced stages.

492
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:51,672
This strain doesn't respond
to most antibiotics.

493
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:53,436
It kills hundreds of thousands a year.

494
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:55,864
Well, I was with her yesterday,
and she was coughing.

495
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,542
You have to be tested.
Olivia too.

496
00:26:59,626 --> 00:27:03,010
- Yeah, she's not available.
- Well, make her available, Elliot.

497
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,619
She's at Sealview.
She's undercover.

498
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:09,364
I wish you had told me that.

499
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:11,244
She shouldn't be in there.

500
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,715
CDC has six confirmed cases
of MDR TB at Sealview.

501
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:18,871
It can't be a coincidence that Ashley was
the same TB that's going around that prison.

502
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,623
Only way to get it is through close contact
with an infected person.

503
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:23,157
Could she have gotten it
from her mother on a visit?

504
00:27:23,157 --> 00:27:25,849
Risa's autopsy report
was negative for TB.

505
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:28,908
She got it from the guard
when he raped her.

506
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:30,463
And we'll know who he is soon enough.

507
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:33,973
CDC is locking Sealview down,
testing all the guards and inmates.

508
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:36,743
Can you hold the CDC off for a few hours
while I get Liv out of there?

509
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:39,600
It's too late. The prison's frozen.
No one in or out.

510
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:44,849
Elliot, you can't leave 
without being tested. / Can you talk?

511
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,296
- Yeah, but not for long.
- Grab Liv, get out of there.

512
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:49,799
- Can't, we're on lockdown.
- Well, out yourself to the Warden.

513
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,762
Johnson, quit playing with it.

514
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:54,610
Report to the clinic for a TB test.

515
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,286
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

516
00:27:57,974 --> 00:28:01,357
Don't worry, I'll take care of it, baby.
Love you too.

517
00:28:04,587 --> 00:28:05,894
This is crap.

518
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,861
The nurse says we got to wait three days
for the damn test results.

519
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,259
So we got to camp out here?

520
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,516
Well, look on the bright side,
it's a hell of a lot of overtime.

521
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:16,160
- You better not snore.
- Oh, I'm not sleeping.

522
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,142
Night shift has its benefits.
Get what I'm saying?

523
00:28:19,142 --> 00:28:20,368
Good to go.

524
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,068
I got my eye on that fish
you tangled with.

525
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,894
Mighty tasty.

526
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,961
Oh, damn, I'm out of syringes.

527
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:31,321
You stay put, I gotta go back
to the dispensary.

528
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:32,969
How long's that gonna take?

529
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:35,084
- What's your hurry?
- I gotta start my shift.

530
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:39,106
Not before you're tested.
Don't worry, you won't miss the party.

531
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:45,274
What's up?

532
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:47,920
Some kind of outbreak.
I heard they quarantined D-block.

533
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,230
Could be TB.

534
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,396
When I was in the C-block,
my celly caught it and died.

535
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:55,251
- I thought that was hepatitis.
- She had that too.

536
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:58,172
I can't believe they're not
telling us anything.

537
00:28:58,172 --> 00:28:59,680
Get used to it.

538
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,018
Well, here comes officer friendly.

539
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:04,008
Get up, fish.
You're coming with me.

540
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,362
What for, CO?

541
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:06,958
For whatever I say.
Now, get up.

542
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,256
Uh, hold on, I didn't get my shot yet.

543
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:12,085
You'll get one later.
Maybe even two pricks.


544
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,543
Hey, hey, CO.
What the hell's going on here?

545
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:16,744
If there's some kind of outbreak,
we have a right to know.

546
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:17,795
Sit down and shut up.

547
00:29:17,795 --> 00:29:20,228
- We have a right to the truth.
- That's right.

548
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:22,294
- Tell us what's going on.
- Yeah.

549
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:25,684
Signal 13, request
backup in the mess.

550
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:28,875
- What's going on here?
- We've got a right to know.

551
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:31,752
- Sit down.
- No, not until we get some answers.

552
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:34,639
- Yeah, we want answers.
- I said sit down.

553
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,531
You can't treat us like that.

554
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:43,714
- On the wall.
- Take it easy.

555
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:47,576
Everybody down, now.

556
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:52,733
What do you think you're doing?

557
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,798
Who started this?

558
00:30:10,004 --> 00:30:11,599
This one.

559
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,277
Okay.

560
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:15,770
Looks like you're going to the hole.

561
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:29,207
The hole is over in C-block.

562
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:32,245
- What are we doing down here?
- Shut up.

563
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:36,667
Captain, I'm sorry I freaked
because of the outbreak. I apologize.

564
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,778
Oh, we're way past
apologies now.

565
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,730
Now shut up, 
and do what you're told.

566
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:46,895
No don't.
What do you want?

567
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:49,074
- What every guy wants.
- What do you...

568
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,001
And you're going to give it to me.

569
00:30:58,254 --> 00:31:00,135
Get off me.
Help. / Yeah.

570
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:01,991
Help!
Help.

571
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:04,172
Keep screaming.
No one can hear you.

572
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:07,976
You must like it rough.
Yeah, you ought to watch me now.

573
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:09,846
- Please don't.
- I'm going to take my time with you.

574
00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:10,794
- Please don't.
- Oh, yeah.

575
00:31:10,794 --> 00:31:11,740
- Please don't.
- Please don't.

576
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,223
Please don't.

577
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:16,424
Help.

578
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:20,584
- Come here.
- Help.

579
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:22,555
Somebody help.

580
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:23,980
Shut up.

581
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,178
Help me.
Help.

582
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,236
Help.

583
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:30,424
- Yeah, I love it.
- Help.

584
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,843
- Yeah, yeah.
- Help.

585
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:34,936
Okay, let's get you a little
more comfortable, huh?

586
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,593
You little bitch.

587
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:45,827
There's no way out.

588
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:48,516
Damn, how long's it take
to get a bunch of needles?

589
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:51,630
Man, you know how women are.
Probably had to fix her makeup.

590
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,637
- A lot of single guys work here.
- I'm married.

591
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,335
Hey, you can't go back to work
till you get tested.

592
00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:58,747
Who's gonna tell?

593
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,063
You wanna play games? Huh?

594
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:06,842
Good.

595
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,637
Cause I know them all.

596
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:12,908
You got two choices.

597
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:17,434
You can come out now
and make it up to me...

598
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:22,591
Or I could tell them
that you tried to escape.

599
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:25,939
And I had to use necessary force.

600
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:29,603
And you wound up dead.

601
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,551
Where's your celly?

602
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:35,593
- You're asking me?
- Yeah, I'm asking you.

603
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:37,073
Hey, CO.

604
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,993
I can help.
You got a smoke?

605
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,181
Maybe.
Where's Kat?

606
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:46,791
- Busy, but I don't got no date tonight.
- Okay, come with me.

607
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,090
- We could do it right here.
- I like privacy.

608
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,687
Take me where you guys go
where there aren't any cameras.

609
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:57,550
The longer I have to wait...

610
00:32:59,307 --> 00:33:01,027
The harder it's going to be.

611
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:03,555
You want to play 
hide and seek, huh?

612
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,333
Okay. But when I find you,
you're it.

613
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,220
Hello.

614
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:18,191
Guess whose ass is mine now.

615
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:22,771
Okay.
Okay, you win.

616
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:25,209
- You win.
- That's more like it.

617
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,648
Come here.

618
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:31,817
- Easy.
- Don't worry.

619
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,963
And that's to let you know
who's in charge.

620
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,288
Help me.

621
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,508
This is it.

622
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:50,632
Hey, keep your pants on.
I ain't going nowhere.

623
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:54,291
Yo, uh-oh, hold up, big boy.
We can't go down there. / Why not?

624
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,631
You see the doorstop?
When it's up, you don't go down

625
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:59,203
cause somebody else already is,
you get me?

626
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:01,667
Help me.

627
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:04,862
Help.

628
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,624
Come on, come on.

629
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:13,290
No, no.

630
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,893
- Shut up.
- No.

631
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:17,919
Let go of me.
Let go of me.

632
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,396
You bite me...

633
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:21,677
and you're dead.

634
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,782
- No. No.
- Shut up.

635
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:42,322
- Let her go, now.
- Get the hell out of here.

636
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:44,699
Police!
Move away from her. Move away.

637
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,264
She's trying to escape.

638
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:48,874
And you had to drop your pants
to stop her?

639
00:34:56,543 --> 00:35:01,293
Lowell Harris, you're under arrest
for raping Ashley Tyler.

640
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:04,105
And the attempted murder
of a police officer.

641
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:05,890
You're a cop?

642
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,337
Who's the bitch now?

643
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:18,070
17 years as a corrections officer.

644
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:21,705
11 different prisons.

645
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:26,084
It says here that the first ten stops
were maximum security men's facilities.

646
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:27,062
I go where I'm told.

647
00:35:27,062 --> 00:35:29,384
You go where you're not going
to get your ass kicked.

648
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:33,288
- What are you talking about?
- I read your evaluations.

649
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:37,407
They dumped you at Sealview because 
you didn't have the balls to handle men.

650
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,191
- Shut up.
- You know what I think?

651
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,522
I think you hate women.

652
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:46,361
That's why you rape them.

653
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:51,761
And if you hate women so much,
that must mean that you like men.

654
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:53,451
Shut up.

655
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:56,325
Shut up, you filthy whore,
do you understand me?

656
00:35:56,325 --> 00:35:57,988
Did I strike a nerve?

657
00:35:58,995 --> 00:36:01,904
Interview's over.
I'm representing Captain Harris.

658
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:04,316
When did he ask for an attorney?

659
00:36:04,316 --> 00:36:07,192
Mr. Hunter is here.
Courtesy of the corrections officers' union.

660
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:09,924
Which is not going to let you
smear this decorated officer

661
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:12,998
to justify your sleazy
undercover operation.

662
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:15,244
We expedited the test results.

663
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:18,632
Captain Harris is negative for TB.

664
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:21,635
As is Matthew Parker, the other officer
you named in your witch hunt.

665
00:36:21,635 --> 00:36:25,672
CDC traced Ashley's infection back to 
a group home she lived in a year ago.

666
00:36:25,672 --> 00:36:27,322
She didn't catch it from him.

667
00:36:27,322 --> 00:36:29,148
He almost killed me.

668
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:30,572
He didn't know you were a cop.

669
00:36:30,572 --> 00:36:32,391
And that gives him the right 
to attack me?

670
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:36,033
The law gives officers Harris every right
to strike an inmate to force compliance.

671
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,594
But not the right to try and rape me.

672
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:42,054
She's lying. / You raped Ashley Tyler,
and you murderered her mother.

673
00:36:42,054 --> 00:36:44,740
And Sealview is investigating
your allegations.

674
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,072
But right now,
I'm taking my client home.

675
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:54,180
This isn't over.

676
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,149
Maybe Ashley can ID him.

677
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:01,683
Liv, Ashley's taken a turn for the worse.

678
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:16,018
You okay?

679
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:18,260
Yeah, what are you still doing here?

680
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:20,714
Avoiding diaper duty.

681
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,652
Need a lift? / No, thanks.
I'm going to stay a while.

682
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:27,149
You'll get Harris.

683
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:31,258
For excessive force at best.

684
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:33,952
But more likely, he'll be
transferred and promoted.

685
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,488
Is he already back at work?

686
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:37,930
Yeah.

687
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:50,240
What happened in the basement?

688
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:56,707
Nothing.

689
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:03,139
I'm fine, El.

690
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:06,762
Detective Benson.

691
00:38:07,504 --> 00:38:09,045
I'll be right there.

692
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,136
Ashley's awake I gotta go.

693
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:20,208
MERCY GENERAL HOSPITAL
ISOLATION WARD
365 WEST 32ND STREET
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 27

694
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,944
Hi.

695
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:33,523
I want him to die

696
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:38,776
for what he did to me,
to my mom.

697
00:38:39,952 --> 00:38:41,450
I know.

698
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:43,710
It's so unfair.

699
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:46,573
I'm locked up, and he's free.

700
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:53,658
You know, I talked to the doctors,
and they said that the medicine is working,

701
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:56,020
and you're going to be
out of here soon.

702
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,353
So I'm just supposed to forget
about everything that happened?

703
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:06,064
I want to help you 
put it behind you.

704
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:08,997
How?

705
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:13,367
Trust me one last time.

706
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,055
See if you can ID him.

707
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:21,855
I told you I never saw his face.

708
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:24,011
But you saw his body.

709
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:28,234
- I don't want to think about it.
- Ashley.

710
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,427
It's the only way that we're
going to ID him.

711
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:37,663
- Don't make me.
- Ashley, please.

712
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:45,567
Was there anything about
his penis that was unusual?

713
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:47,991
A scar?

714
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:49,958
A tattoo?

715
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:52,709
Anything.

716
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:59,674
He has a big mole.

717
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:06,979
I said you can't use the phone.

718
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:08,994
But I got to call my kid.
It's his birthday.

719
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:11,574
I don't care.
Get back in your cell.

720
00:40:14,226 --> 00:40:15,725
Don't worry, Amber.

721
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,822
He's going to get
his own cell soon.

722
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:20,446
I got nothing to say to you.
Talk to my lawyer.

723
00:40:20,446 --> 00:40:22,478
You first.
You're going to need him.

724
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:25,998
- Warden?
- Get him out of my prison.

725
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:28,558
Lowell Harris, 
you're under arrest for rape.

726
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:30,006
You have the right to remain silent,

727
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:33,617
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

728
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:34,833
You have the right to an attorney.

729
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,638
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

730
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:48,546
Captain, huh?

731
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:50,695
You look more
like a private to me.

732
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:54,680
We'll have to enlarge it for the jury,
but it's right where Ashley said it was.

733
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,398
See you in 20 years, Captain.

734
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,968
How'd you know to ask Ashley
about the mole?

735
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:04,776
She remembered.

736
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:07,634
But you couldn't have known
she was right.

737
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,422
I saw it...

738
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:19,386
When he had me in the basement.

739
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:26,148
Olivia...
Did he rape you?

740
00:41:32,683 --> 00:41:34,624
It's the closest I've ever come.
