1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,749
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:06,459
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:07,662
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:11,181
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:14,255
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:16,361
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,000
You got us lost.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,151
And we haven't found
one thing on the list.

9
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,656
So what?
It's just a stupid Scavenger Hunt.

10
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:27,238
It's supposed to teach us how to use 
the GPS in case of an emergency.

11
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:29,262
I wanna get my tracking merit badge.

12
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,236
"I wanna get my tracking merit badge."

13
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:34,759
You're never gonna make it
in seventh grade, Randall.

14
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,817
I think we go this way.

15
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:39,425
Holy cow, Marcus.

16
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:41,418
What? You see a snake?

17
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:44,565
No.
It's a lady.

18
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:46,672
She needs help.

19
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,456
I can get my first aid merit badge.

20
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:53,189
It's too late, dork face.
She's dead.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,608
Julie Donovan, 17.

22
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,199
Two boys found her.

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,427
Cause of death?

24
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,096
Probably blunt force trauma
to the head.

25
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,414
Probably?
You don't sound so sure.

26
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,569
She's covered in bruises
and ligature marks.

27
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:09,029
Hard to tell what killed her,
beating or strangulation.

28
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:10,227
Any fluids?

29
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:13,603
I found semen inside of her,
so we should have the perp's DNA.

30
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:16,521
And this baseball cap
was next to her body.

31
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:19,577
That's a "C," victim could be
from Cincy or Chicago.

32
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:21,969
Her learner's permit
says she's from Long Island.

33
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,576
Side straps kinda big,
this could be the perp's hat.

34
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:26,501
Hey, lookee here.

35
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,317
What you got?

36
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:30,547
Busted cell phone.

37
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:34,629
Killer beat the crap out of her,
and kept whaling on this.

38
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,204
That kind of rage, he knew her.

39
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:40,228
And left her to die in the dirt.
It's pathetic.

40
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:43,141
- It's worse than that.
- What's that?

41
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,884
Her lips.

42
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:42,526
I'm telling you, you're wrong.
It's not Julie.

43
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:47,106
There must be some mistake.
Because, uh, she's all I got.

44
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:49,339
Her mother left her when she was two.

45
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,589
Drugs.
She's with her friends now.

46
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:55,472
And, uh, she didn't call me.
She forgets to call me.

47
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:57,642
Anybody you know
who doesn't like your daughter?

48
00:02:57,642 --> 00:03:01,421
No, everybody likes her.
She's uh... it's a problem.

49
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,595
What's that a problem?

50
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:09,016
Well, when she turned 13,
she started getting into hip-hop and, um...

51
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:10,774
And what?

52
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:13,501
Black guys.

53
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,996
No offense.
I didn't like it.

54
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,308
But I didn't want to fight 
with her about it.

55
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:19,819
Because I don't want her
to run off like her mother.

56
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:22,879
How did you handle this?

57
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:26,782
I told her that as long
as she kept her grades up,

58
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:29,162
I didn't care who she hung out with.

59
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,721
Are you ready, Mr. Donovan?

60
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:01,117
Detective?

61
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,236
We got a hit on the DNA.

62
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,508
You know?
You know who did this?

63
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,189
Mr. Donovan, you need 
to go home and let...

64
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,959
I wanna know who murdered 
my daughter.

65
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,676
I'm sorry, but we can't do anything...

66
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:14,902
Tell me who killed my daughter!

67
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:17,285
You know who did it,
you tell me who then.

68
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:20,280
Please, it's my baby.

69
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:35,273
DNA in the victim belongs to Mike Kona.

70
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:39,018
Collared for two burglaries and 
a rape charge that was later dropped.

71
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:40,843
Guy's a world champion fighter.

72
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:42,106
What is he, boxer?

73
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:44,818
Uh, technically, 
he's a mixed martial artist.

74
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,147
Mean them cats try to kill 
each other in a cage?

75
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:50,798
You know, where I come from,
we don't call that fighting.

76
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:54,103
You know, these guys 
are the greatest athletes in the world.

77
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,700
You sound like a fan.

78
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,711
I'm more than that.

79
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,042
Get out of here, that's not you.

80
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:04,865
- Bet your ass, it is.
- "Naptime wins in AC"

81
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:09,001
What, they call you Naptime because 
your boring stories put everybody to sleep?

82
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,246
Cause of my right hook.
When it hits your head, it's lights out.

83
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,605
This was my last amateur fight.

84
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,092
You know, I was gonna quit the force
and go pro?

85
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:19,820
- What happened?
- Tore my ACL.

86
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,778
Now the only Naptime you get
is when you fall asleep at your desk.

87
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:26,310
I still train.
There's only one MMA gym in Manhattan.

88
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,939
Sometimes Kona works out there.

89
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,781
You think he could 
be there right now?

90
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:31,987
He has a title fight
on pay-per-view tonight.

91
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,169
I bet he's already at the garden.

92
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:37,460
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17

93
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,637
He's out, he's out.
That's it.

94
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:13,905
I love you, baby!

95
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,956
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, baby.

96
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,508
Make room for the champ.

97
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:32,435
I don't care if you are cops.
Get out of my way.

98
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,077
Move down, boy.

99
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:36,239
- What the hell are you doing, bud?
- Mike Kona, you need to come with us.

100
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,733
What for?
He didn't do nothing.

101
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:38,736
Stay out of this, Traci.

102
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,785
Hey, look, bud, I just won 
a championship fight.

103
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:41,904
Why don't you cut me a break, huh?

104
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:45,506
Sure, the same kind
of break you cut Julie Donovan?

105
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,479
Let's go.

106
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,490
- I never seen that girl before.
- Really?

107
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:57,291
It's funny, cause we found
your semen inside of her.

108
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,750
Only one way for that to happen.

109
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:05,088
You know, your rap sheet
says you're charged with rape last year.

110
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:07,447
- You a good guy rapist?
- That charge was dropped.

111
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:10,392
- It's really not what you think.
- It never is.

112
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:14,569
Look, bro, man to man.

113
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,522
I want to believe you, 
but the facts are just making it real hard.

114
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,033
Look, the rap sheet 
says you raped Traci Bell.

115
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,272
Guess you couldn't fight off
the urge to rape again, huh?

116
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:26,219
I didn't rape Julie.
And I certainly didn't rape Traci.

117
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:28,291
She's my fiancee.

118
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:31,091
- Well, they said it was rape.
- Who's they?

119
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,073
The cops.

120
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:33,331
We were both really drunk

121
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,677
and making a loud racket 
underneath the sheets at this motel.

122
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:39,694
I guess someone heard my screams
and thought I was in trouble.

123
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:40,944
It was all a misunderstanding.

124
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:43,648
Yeah, right, like it was 
a misunderstanding last night

125
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:46,286
when he raped another girl
and then killed her.

126
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:47,234
Kona wouldn't have done that.

127
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,351
Then how's he get his DNA inside her?

128
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,866
Listen, I'm not going to help
you build a case against him.

129
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:55,092
Look, if you're afraid of him
and think he'll hurt you...

130
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:58,388
Honey, didn't you just hear me?

131
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:00,083
I'm a screamer.

132
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,740
I got this boy wrapped around my finger.

133
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,926
Well, if you're not afraid of him,
then why'd you drop the rape charge?

134
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:09,272
Because he bought me 
this big fat diamond ring.

135
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,228
Now I get it.

136
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:13,079
You guess he's your ticket 
out of this dump.

137
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,182
- Are you calling me a gold digger?
- No, I'm calling cold.

138
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:19,589
Your fiance raped and murdered 
a young girl, and you don't give a damn.

139
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,390
Probably one of those
groupie sluts he was banging.

140
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,610
And you don't care 
if he messes around?

141
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,060
Not as long as I'm number one.

142
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:29,821
You ever see Kona with this girl?

143
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:32,058
No, but I haven't checked the tape lately.

144
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:33,220
What tape?

145
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,584
I bought one of these nanny
cams at the spy shop.

146
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:39,608
It's a picture frame
with a video camera in it.

147
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:42,621
If we ever got married,
I wanted proof he was cheating.

148
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,257
- For what?
- For the divorce.

149
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:49,902
Open the back of the frame, and there's
a pullout USB flash drive.

150
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,391
- You look so hot, Kona.
- Yeah?

151
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:58,185
- Smile, baby.
- No pictures.

152
00:08:58,185 --> 00:08:59,306
Come on, just one.

153
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,104
I said no pictures.

154
00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:02,669
No pictures!

155
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,891
Oh, we got a sneak preview of the rest.

156
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,465
You know, we don't want to embarrass you,

157
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:09,984
but if Julie sold that picture, 
your new nickname would be Tiny.

158
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:12,561
And I thought the camera was supposed 
to make everything look bigger.

159
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:13,759
She didn't respect you, man.

160
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,710
She was gonna show 
the whole world your privates.

161
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,882
So you take her to the park.

162
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:18,779
She starts screaming and won't shut up.

163
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,751
Then you grab her by the face
and rip off her lips.

164
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:22,633
That would shut her up.

165
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,665
- I just gave her a little slap.
- Uh-huh.

166
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,616
You guys are crazy.

167
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:28,297
You never saw me hurt Julie.
We had sex, that's it.

168
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:30,293
You say sex, we say rape.

169
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:31,702
She wanted it.
You saw the tape.

170
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:32,879
The little nympho was all over me.

171
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,439
That's for a jury to decide.

172
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,728
This is Mr. Sullivan.

173
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:40,574
He represents prestige fighting alliance,
Kona's league.

174
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,656
Yeah, well, you got
an uphill battle on this one.

175
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,626
I don't think so, big guy.

176
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,899
Copies of the membership card swipes
from the gym Mr. Kona was at last night.

177
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,634
Someone else could've swiped his card.

178
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,380
Video on these tapes was taken
from the gym's surveillance cameras.

179
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,474
Showing exactly when Mr. Kona
arrived and left.

180
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:58,596
We still got him for battery.

181
00:09:58,596 --> 00:09:59,749
The girl is dead.

182
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:03,669
The only way to make that charge stick 
is by playing that tape in an open court.

183
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,341
It's a hell of a thing
for a grieving father to see.

184
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,019
Cut him loose.

185
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,014
I'll have your badges
for putting Kona through this.

186
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:15,038
He's lucky we didn't bust him
for the battery.

187
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:17,517
I see you on the street,
pretty boy, you're dead.

188
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,613
Well, bring it on.

189
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:21,193
Come on, Mike, don't waste your time.

190
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:25,388
Kona would've beat your ass.

191
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:27,409
I would held my own
for a couple of rounds.

192
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,455
I'd like to see that, but don't expect me
to cry at your funeral.

193
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,015
What the...

194
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:36,743
Hey, hey, drop that gun!
Drop it.

195
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:43,189
Somebody call a bus!

196
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,954
Terry, what the hell did you do?

197
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,045
It was for Julie.

198
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:03,970
How was Terry Donovan's arraignment?

199
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,056
No bail, Judge sent him to Riker's.

200
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:09,075
Poor guy.
Maybe the jury will go easy on him.

201
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,276
Guy's a murderer.
If he does 20 years, he'll be lucky.

202
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:15,181
DNA came back on the baseball hat
found at the crime scene.

203
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:18,225
Matches a Jadon Odami.

204
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,564
He's a sealed juvenile record,
that's all we know about him.

205
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:23,129
Uh, Captain?

206
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,325
I pulled some video footage 
from the smashed sim card

207
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,691
on Julie Donovan's phone.

208
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:30,249
Somebody's buying me lunch 
for this one.

209
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:36,112
Well, there's Jadon Odami
dancing with our victim.

210
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,069
Looks like they about to get it on.

211
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:40,076
Maybe Jadon was her boyfriend.

212
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,933
I guess he didn't like sharing.

213
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:46,415
check how Julie goes between, uh, 
Jadon and the other guy.

214
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:48,096
When was this shot?

215
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:50,631
Time date-stamped was
from the night of the murder.

216
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,449
Okay, so she does Kona,

217
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:54,848
then she goes to this party 
and hooks up with the killer.

218
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,114
Only question is where?

219
00:11:57,654 --> 00:12:02,283
Banner says Kappa Delta Alpha.

220
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:05,789
KAPPA DELTA ALPHA
FRATERNITY HOUSE
HUDSON UNIVERSITY
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18

221
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:09,699
Kappa Delta Alpha's 
one of the oldest fraternities on campus.

222
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:12,361
Looks like you guys study real hard.

223
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:14,852
We had a little party
a couple nights ago.

224
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:16,787
Was he there?

225
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:18,365
Sure.

226
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:20,163
Jadon rushed the frat last semester.

227
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:22,152
What's up with that flag?

228
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:27,588
Uh, KDA was founded by a direct descendant
of Jefferson Davis

229
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:30,108
We're very proud of our heritage.

230
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,845
You know you lost the war.

231
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:35,070
Why would a young black kid
want to pledge this fraternity?

232
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,505
A certain special interest 
group made wavers.

233
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:39,725
You mean Al Sharpton
picketed your ass.

234
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,405
Yeah, he forced us to let
the brothers in.

235
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:44,027
Free room and board.

236
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,740
The brothers?

237
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,176
You got a lot of balls
saying that to my face.

238
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:50,281
No, they're real brothers.

239
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,311
Jadon and Ezra Odami.

240
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,506
I'll take you to their room.

241
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:59,156
Did you see Jadon or Ezra 
with this girl at the party?

242
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,886
They were practically having sex with her
on the dance floor.

243
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:02,851
I told them to leave her alone.

244
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:04,224
Why?
Cause she was white?

245
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:06,253
Because she looked underage.

246
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,273
Was I right?
She filed charges?

247
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:11,157
She couldn't.
She was found murdered.

248
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,517
Hey, man.
What's going on?

249
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,619
Dudes, that girl you hooked up with 
at the party.

250
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,862
- She got killed.
- Hey.

251
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,213
I will not tolerate this type of chaos.

252
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:48,413
Chasing students around campus housing.

253
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,720
Would you rather have
a murderer on campus?

254
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,933
- Murderer? Who?
- His name is Jadon Odami.

255
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,783
Uh, Jadon.

256
00:13:55,783 --> 00:14:00,143
Yes, he and his brother Ezra exemplify
Hudson's commitment to diversity.

257
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:03,489
That's rich white guy speak for I'm gonna 
let a couple of poor ghetto kids

258
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:04,768
get a taste of the high life.

259
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:06,758
Can we see their files?

260
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:09,397
Usually you'd need a warrant.

261
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:12,581
But we'll forego the formality
since I'm expelling them.

262
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:15,025
What happened to innocent
until proven guilty?

263
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:18,585
Come on, Detective.
You said you were looking for a murderer.

264
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:21,751
I have a duty to protect
my students from thugs.

265
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:24,973
I haven't seen that many thugs
with straight "A"s.

266
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:28,401
Jadon and Ezra graduated high school
at the top of their class.

267
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,140
Yeah, well, that's not saying much.

268
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,674
Check out the address of their school.

269
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,497
Look familiar?

270
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:36,504
Prison school.

271
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:39,092
RIKERS ISLAND
ISLAND ACADEMY
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18

272
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:43,398
20 years at this school,
Jadon and Ezra were my best students.

273
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:44,715
They're good kids.

274
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:47,189
Your warden says Ezra
has three robbery collars.

275
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:49,140
You call that a good kid?

276
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,700
Those robberies were survival crimes.

277
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,342
They only stole for food
and a place to sleep.

278
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,134
Doesn't help the victim, does it?

279
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:58,936
Those boys would never hurt anybody.

280
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:00,093
Much less kill them.

281
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,712
If you're so sure they're innocent,

282
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:04,630
why don't you tell us where they are,
so we can help them get off the hook?

283
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,539
Look, I don't know where they are,

284
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,203
but once you read their files,
you won't be so quick to judge them.

285
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:15,093
The teacher was right,
the system failed Jadon and Ezra
the day they were born.

286
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:16,735
The system didn't make them
commit murder.

287
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,718
Well, look at the hand they were dealt.

288
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,797
Addicted mother, different absent fathers,
both in prison.

289
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,039
Life with mom was a revolving door.

290
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,428
Foster care when she was high,
back home when she cleaned up.

291
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,887
They got beat on by a bunch
of their foster parents.

292
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,451
These brothers were ticking time bombs.

293
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,592
They were just kids.

294
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:34,018
You know, they didn't have a chance.

295
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,223
What are you, a social worker now?

296
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:38,773
They lived in 19 different foster homes.

297
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:40,281
Someone's gotta help them.

298
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:42,233
Well, wait until you have
your own family.

299
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,420
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

300
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,419
It means that when you have
a daughter Julie Donovan's age,

301
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,373
your heart'll stop bleeding
for the mopes who killed her.

302
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:51,889
You're saying that I don't give
a crap about the victims?

303
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:54,277
We keep it civil around here,
or you're gone.

304
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:56,510
All right, go cool off.

305
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:02,997
We need to find Jadon and Ezra.

306
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:05,942
Let's start with their biological mother,
Janelle Odami.

307
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,539
She lives at the Marcy projects.

308
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:16,627
You boys look in need.

309
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:20,750
I'm gonna let the Mexican here
feed the cat his Horchata for twenty.

310
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,309
And the brother, since we tight,
I'm gonna let you hit it for ten.

311
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:27,740
Damn!

312
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:31,843
Hey.

313
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:34,013
Hey.

314
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:35,089
Hey, I ain't finished.

315
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:38,377
Pack it in, unless you
wanna stay at my place.

316
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,861
You just cost me twenty bucks.

317
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:46,093
- Your name Janelle Odami?
- Your name nasty ass pig?

318
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:50,790
Lose the attitude.
We're here about your sons, Jadon and Ezar.

319
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:55,853
My babies.

320
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:58,908
The teacher said they were geniuses.

321
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,622
They must have got it
from their fathers' side.

322
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:02,939
Hey, uncle Tom,
what's it like in the house?

323
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,707
Least I ain't selling it.

324
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:07,379
Damn, white, black, I'm getting
it from all sides today.

325
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:09,958
Hey, man, her pimp
called me a Mexican.

326
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,563
- Is that good or bad?
- Run.

327
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:14,583
- Pipe down, lady.
- Run, baby.

328
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,665
No, mama.

329
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:20,989
What are you doing here?

330
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:22,985
Giving myself up.

331
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,925
I killed that girl.

332
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,085
So why'd you kill Julie Donovan?

333
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:36,258
I don't want to talk about it.

334
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:39,753
What, you got the stones 
to walk in here and confess to a murder,

335
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:41,311
and you don't wanna talk about it?

336
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,873
Look, I already copped to it.

337
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:45,544
What, you need me to fill out
your paperwork too?

338
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:49,345
I'm done with him.

339
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:05,789
Jadon, where's your brother?

340
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:09,657
Ezra's got nothing to do with this.

341
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:16,714
You're looking at life.

342
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:21,430
You talk, maybe we can do
something for you.

343
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:23,903
No.

344
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:26,602
Thanks.

345
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,428
Thought you might wanna say good-bye
to your mother

346
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:34,397
before we take her down 
to central booking.

347
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:47,421
What they lock you up for, ma?

348
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,522
You know how it is, son.

349
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:59,193
Crackers got nothing better
to do than mess with my broke ass.

350
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,760
How you been?

351
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,044
Doing all right.

352
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:07,406
How about you?

353
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:11,029
This heroin's got your mom 
by the soul, baby.

354
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:14,221
Took me to places that Jesus won't go.

355
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,530
Come here, baby.

356
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:34,073
I'm so sick and tired
of being sick and tired.

357
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:40,829
All she's put him through,
and he still loves her.

358
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:45,051
When you don't have anything,
you take what you can get.

359
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,593
Visiting time is over.

360
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:55,150
You know, you could help me out here.

361
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,376
If I tell you what happened...

362
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:05,606
You let her go?

363
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,455
You talk, she walks out of here tonight.

364
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:10,372
I'm hurting so bad, Jadon.

365
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:12,298
I don't wanna kick in prison.

366
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,719
I need to get well.

367
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,542
Deal.

368
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,026
That's my baby.

369
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,943
Always looking after his mama.

370
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:46,036
ARRAIGNMENT PART 38
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18

371
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:50,999
Docket ending 2500,
People V. Jadon Odami.

372
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,929
One the charge of murder 
in the second degree, how do you plead?

373
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:55,485
Not guilty, Your Honor.

374
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:56,889
That's not what I told you to say.

375
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,951
You were coerced during interrogation.

376
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:00,191
Your Honor, there was no coercion.

377
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,651
- The defendant freely confessed.
- Really...

378
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:05,784
what, his mother just happened to pop 
in during the middle of his interview?

379
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:09,317
Your Honor, I killed Julie Donovan.
I plead guilty.

380
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:12,315
Listen to your attorney, son.

381
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:14,207
You fired.

382
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:21,973
Okay, he's not my lawyer now.

383
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,953
If you plead guilty,
you'll have to sign a waiver of appeal.

384
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:27,468
Which means you can't change your mind.

385
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:29,129
That's cool.

386
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:31,214
Your Honor, the people
have no objections.

387
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:33,779
In order for me to hear your confession,

388
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,805
you'll have to give the court
the details of your crime.

389
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,900
Me and my brother were
at a party at the frat house.

390
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:46,792
This white girl was dancing
with me all night..

391
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:52,276
After we had sex, I was walking her home
and tried to rob her.

392
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:56,082
She started fighting me off,
so I beat on her.

393
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,372
She wouldn't stop yelling.

394
00:21:58,372 --> 00:22:01,767
So I grabbed her face and squeezed it.

395
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:05,721
Something snapped
and everything went red.

396
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:08,860
Is the allocution sufficient, Ms. Novak?

397
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,821
It is, Your Honor.

398
00:22:11,022 --> 00:22:12,281
Very well.

399
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:15,552
Your plea of guilty is accepted.
Sentencing in two weeks.

400
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,422
Next case.

401
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,097
You're here early.

402
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:22,206
Someone's gotta close up
the Julie Donovan murder.

403
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:23,494
Where you been?

404
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:27,005
We locked up Jadon Odami last night.
He plead guilty at arraignment.

405
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:29,368
But the other killer's 
still on the street.

406
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:30,908
Jadon said he was solo.

407
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:34,436
Got a friend at family court.
Snuck a peek at Jadon's juvie record.

408
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,132
Every one of his crimes,
he had a partner.

409
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:37,583
- Guess who?
- Ezra.

410
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,717
Give that man a gold star.

411
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:43,464
Look, you got both your little angels
on video dirty dancing with Julie.

412
00:22:43,464 --> 00:22:44,819
Maybe she wasn't in the mood 
fro a threesome,

413
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:47,049
- things got rough, she got dead.
- And we got played.

414
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,350
Count on that.
I'm gonna grab breakfast.

415
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,087
Good luck finding Ezra.

416
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,495
Want to head down to Rikers
and talk with Jadon?

417
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:54,964
What's the point?
He's doing a life sentence for his brother.

418
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,720
He's not gonna give him up.

419
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,484
Guess I gotta find Ezra myself then.

420
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:05,697
Now, why would two brothers from Brooklyn
wear hats with the letter "C" on it?

421
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:07,516
Maybe it's a gang thing.

422
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:10,882
You know, if you're right,
then Ezra's hanging out with his homies.

423
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:12,848
That's his only safety net.

424
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:14,479
Well, what gang?

425
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,611
They're representing with a "C."

426
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:18,037
If they were crips, 
they wouldn't wear anything red.

427
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:21,494
I got a guy at gang crimes.
He'll hook us up.

428
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,447
They're the new kids on the block.

429
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:26,798
The "C" hats...
Real popular with the corner Hustlers.

430
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:28,197
Tell us about them.

431
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:31,248
Very small, very well organized.
Almost impossible to infiltrate.

432
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:32,935
Blood in, blood out.
And they mean it.

433
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:35,433
Yeah, we got a couple of members 
we wanna run by you.

434
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:38,002
Jadon and Ezra Odami.

435
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:40,014
I read about Jadon in the paper.
That your case?

436
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:42,518
Yeah, Ezra's in the wind,

437
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:45,241
and we think he's hanging out
with his fellow gang members.

438
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:47,202
Corner Hustlers center out
of the Marcy apartments.

439
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:48,826
That's where their moms lives.

440
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:51,762
You'll have a good luck getting
anyone in the projects to talk.

441
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:52,850
These guys run the place.

442
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,788
Hey, I thought the Latin kings 
ran the place.

443
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:57,504
It's a war between the two.

444
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:01,433
I bet the kings wouldn't mind
ratting out the competition.

445
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:05,000
MARCY COURTS 
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19

446
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,583
We're sitting ducks.

447
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,849
We're like honey to bees, man.

448
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:11,521
- Here come the bees.
- Yo, this is Latin king country, son.

449
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:13,161
What are corner Hustlers
still doing in Marcy...

450
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,683
- Gun!
- I ain't got nothing, man!

451
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:16,145
I'm just playing, man.
I'm just playing, man.

452
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:17,893
I ain't got nothing, man.
Yo, what's...

453
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:19,574
What is this?

454
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:21,196
It's for my art classes, man.

455
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:23,138
What, you a gang-banging Picasso?

456
00:24:23,138 --> 00:24:25,101
Man, I gotta express myself.

457
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:29,079
You gonna be expressing yourself
from Rikers, you don't tell us where he is.

458
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:33,456
Man, he used to hang out here, man.
But I think he got out before the beef.

459
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:35,626
What beef? / Yo, I could get shot
for talking with you all.

460
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:39,247
You're lucky we didn't shoot you
for reaching up under your shirt... speak.

461
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:43,244
Cat names Jimmy Mac started a crew
in Rikers Island about five months ago.

462
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:44,426
Called the Corner Hustlers.

463
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:46,788
Yeah, red hat with the "C."
It's their thing.

464
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:49,276
- What's Jimmy Mac's rep?
- That dude's crazy.

465
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:51,828
He makes his crew rape girls
before they can roll.

466
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:53,224
We don't need that kind of heat in Marcy.

467
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,568
So the kings put a price on his head.

468
00:24:56,567 --> 00:25:00,089
Jimmy Mac.
AKA James McDonnell.

469
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:01,728
Guy's a real scumbag.

470
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:05,399
His greatest hits
include pimping, assault, and robbery.

471
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,264
He's a repeat offender.

472
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:08,694
He catches one more felony,
he's going away for life.

473
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:10,736
McDonnell's the leader 
of the Corner Hustlers.

474
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:12,726
He could've ordered
an initiation murder.

475
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:15,531
Jadon and Ezra killed Julie
to get into the gang.

476
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:17,540
Just found McDonnell, he was at Rikers.

477
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,305
What for? / Jumping the turnstile 
at the station right by the park

478
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:22,967
where we found Julie's body.
He posted bail an hour ago.

479
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:25,533
He should be getting to the queens 
borough plaza any minute.

480
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,305
Let's go.

481
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:33,419
Corrections dump juvies off here
like it's a school bus stop.

482
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,496
Hell of a place to start over.

483
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:39,781
Heads up.
Here comes the bus.

484
00:25:39,781 --> 00:25:41,713
Yeah, we see it.

485
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:52,273
There's Jimmy Mac.

486
00:25:52,273 --> 00:25:53,563
We got him.

487
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:55,522
There's nobody around him.

488
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:57,334
Pick him up.

489
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:27,779
Ezra, stop!

490
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:48,996
Ezra, you're going away for a long time.

491
00:26:57,052 --> 00:26:58,765
Stop.

492
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:03,169
Hey, stop your truck!

493
00:27:04,714 --> 00:27:06,737
Help.
I can't get out.

494
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:09,595
Hey, you.
Hey, hey, stop the truck.

495
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:12,759
- Hey, stop the truck.
- Yo, yo, help.

496
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:15,900
- Stop the truck.
- I don't wanna die like this.

497
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,235
- Yo.
- Yo, help.

498
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,217
Yo.
Hey, stop the truck.

499
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:22,417
- Let me out.
- Hey, somebody's in there.

500
00:27:29,837 --> 00:27:32,027
- Where's my brother?
- We ask the questions, punk.

501
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,544
- Just tell me Jadon's all right.
- I said no questions.

502
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:36,547
Don't you understand no means no?

503
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:39,736
Maybe not, him and his brother did rape
and murder Julie Donovan.

504
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:42,702
- I had nothing to do with that.
- You just a wannbe cop-killer, huh?

505
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,266
You got things all wrong.

506
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,098
Hey, I don't care
how good your grades were.

507
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,609
Or how tough your life was.

508
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,327
You threw it all away
when you fired on us.

509
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,353
- I wasn't shooting at you.
- Oh, really?

510
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,679
Then who were you trying to kill?

511
00:27:55,334 --> 00:27:56,850
J-Mac.

512
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,045
I swear, I wasn't trying
to hurt anyone else.

513
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,392
- Just him.
- Why?

514
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:02,739
Doesn't matter.

515
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:04,707
Get your head up, 
we're not done with you.

516
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:07,398
Boy's the leader of your gang,
why would you wanna whack him?

517
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:11,513
Jadon and me only joined Corner Hustlers
in Rikers for protection from other gangs.

518
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:14,286
J-Mac's from the same project,
so we figured he'd look out for us.

519
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,854
Yeah, a little cat like you
must've needed protection.

520
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:19,624
What, McDonnell take care of you?

521
00:28:20,027 --> 00:28:24,027
Yeah. Till me and Jadon got
into Island Academy and started doing well.

522
00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:27,478
We got scholarships to college, and 
McDonnell told us to sell drugs on campus.

523
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:30,420
- So you're a drug dealer too.
- We never did it.

524
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,530
Jadon told him to get lost.

525
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,698
McDonnell went crazy, and said the only way
we're leaving the gang was in a body bag.

526
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:38,769
Blood in and blood out.

527
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:42,918
You were gonna kill McDonnell
to get out of the gang.

528
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:46,711
I was gonna kill him cause he set 
my brother up for that girl's murder.

529
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:50,526
Then why was Julie's blood
on your brother's baseball cap?

530
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,856
I don't know.

531
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:59,348
May...maybe she wore his hat home
from the party.

532
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:01,670
You gotta believe me.
J-Mac killed Julie.

533
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:06,761
If J-Mac's the killer, I suppose
we gotta led Jadon go.

534
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,290
Really?

535
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,875
For a smart kid,
you're really stupid.

536
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:16,673
Ezra, Jadon confessed.

537
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,141
- That's great work, guys.
- Thanks Cap.

538
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:41,113
Get your fives typed and over to Novak
so she can start prepping for trial.

539
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,773
I don't think those boys had anything 
to do with Julie Donovan's murder.

540
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:46,797
I swear I didn't see him smoking crack.

541
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:50,027
I think the real killer died
in that garbage truck today.

542
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:53,872
One brother confessed and the other one
tried to shoot you.

543
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,062
What more do you want?

544
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:58,897
Jadon and Ezra had too much to lose
by killing that girl.

545
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,816
Then why would McDonnell 
wanna frame them?

546
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:03,187
Because he's a psychopath.

547
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:06,467
He was pissed that the Odami boys
were leaving the gang

548
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,412
and making something of themselves.

549
00:30:08,412 --> 00:30:11,151
Pin a murder on them?
They're right back in the gutter.

550
00:30:11,151 --> 00:30:13,857
I'm sure that's what the defense
is gonna argue,

551
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:16,530
but we work for the prosecution.

552
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,960
- And if they're innocent?
- That's for the jury to decide.

553
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,539
- That's not good enough for me.
- Let it go, Chester.

554
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,935
This case is closed.

555
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,614
I know you're an insomniac,
but you ought to go home.

556
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,370
Why are you here this late?

557
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,655
Paperwork for trial.

558
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,925
You gotta watch yourself.
If you get too obsessed with these cases,

559
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,140
you'll lose more than sleep.

560
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,733
- Like what?
- Family.

561
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,595
What, are you trying to bust
my chops again?

562
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:59,968
I'm dead serious.
This job nearly cost me mine.

563
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:02,881
Well, I don't have to worry about that.

564
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:04,676
No family?

565
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:07,351
Or too many families.

566
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:09,866
Depending on the day.

567
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:18,691
You a foster kid?

568
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:29,892
You need any help?

569
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:32,871
You wanna risk the Captain
getting pissed at you?

570
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:35,077
Wouldn't be the first time.

571
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,168
All right.

572
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:40,151
In my gut, these boys are innocent.

573
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:43,082
But I don't know how to prove it.

574
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:46,872
All right. Well...

575
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:49,615
Fresh pair of eyes never hurt.

576
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:57,673
Stop it.
What was that burst of light?

577
00:31:57,673 --> 00:31:59,547
Go back.

578
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:07,538
It's a camera flash.

579
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,097
She look pregnant to you?

580
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,119
Yeah.

581
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,924
What's she doing at a frat party?

582
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:20,122
Taking pictures of Julie?

583
00:32:31,714 --> 00:32:33,717
I never seen her before.

584
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:36,222
Take a good look at her.

585
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:40,381
I got no idea who she is.

586
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:44,245
I'm trying to help you.

587
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:48,282
Come on, look at it.

588
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:50,877
Who is this, Jadon?

589
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:54,961
Hey, watch yourself.

590
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:58,362
I'm looking at life, so I'm not worried.
About taking yours.

591
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,011
You might now know this,

592
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:04,394
but I'm on your side.

593
00:33:04,842 --> 00:33:09,150
Look, dude.
My moms, the state, the schools...

594
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,594
They all failed me and my brother.

595
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:14,557
I got about this much left of me,
and I'm gonna use it to do this time,

596
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:16,709
so just leave me alone.

597
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,831
I came up through the foster system.

598
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:28,501
As soon as I was old enough,
I took the police exam.

599
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,108
I don't think I'd pass the background check.

600
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:40,934
When I was in the Academy,
my cousin and I went out drinking.

601
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:43,362
And we got in a fight.

602
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:48,158
One guy was hurt bad.

603
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:52,518
My cousin told me to take off.

604
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:58,484
He knew if I got arrested,
I'd get kicked off the job.

605
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,118
What's this bedtime story
gotta do with me?

606
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:09,343
He took the collar for me,
so I could have a shot.

607
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:18,399
You did the same thing for your brother.

608
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:24,541
And if I did, 
why would I give him up to you?

609
00:34:25,488 --> 00:34:28,303
Because Ezra didn't do it.

610
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:33,126
It was McDonnell, Jadon.

611
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,994
He set you up.

612
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,435
I wanna see Ezra.

613
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,005
Who beat you up?

614
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,146
Doesn't matter.
I can handle it.

615
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:58,760
No, you can't!

616
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,417
Look, why is he here?

617
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:01,985
I said I did it,
get him out of here.

618
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:04,360
I know you didn't... dude, 
why you saying you did? / Shut up.

619
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,941
How could you think I did it?

620
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:21,959
Because... I... I came back to the room
two hours later, and you weren't there.

621
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:29,536
When the cops got my DNA
off the hat Julie took,

622
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,708
I figured it was a lucky break.

623
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:33,934
Better me than you.

624
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:36,832
So I confessed.

625
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,940
Why?

626
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,489
Every time I passed that flag
in the living room,

627
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:48,860
and listen to those rich kids bitch 
about their perfect lives,

628
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,844
I wanted to start knocking dudes out.

629
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:57,913
Maybe it's better I'm locked up
before I do something I regret.

630
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,538
You don't belong in prison.

631
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:05,722
Who is this?

632
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:07,570
Look, I wasn't lying, I don't know her.

633
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,956
You confessed to murder.
You're getting sentenced tomorrow.

634
00:36:10,956 --> 00:36:13,824
She may be able to finger McDonnell.

635
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:19,290
If we don't find her tonight,
you're going down for life.

636
00:36:26,362 --> 00:36:28,557
I think I've seen her around Marcy.

637
00:36:28,557 --> 00:36:30,516
What's her name?

638
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:35,084
No idea.

639
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:40,626
We gotta find somebody in
the projects who can ID her.

640
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:43,645
I think I know someone 
who'll talk to us.

641
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:51,909
APARTMENT OF JANELLE ODAMI
479 MARCY AVENUE BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30

642
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:55,408
Janelle, open up.

643
00:36:58,415 --> 00:37:00,113
It's 2:00pm Tuesday afternoon.

644
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:02,283
I didn't mean to interrupt 
your beauty sleep.

645
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:03,573
I been working nights.

646
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:06,120
- We know.
- Cleaning offices.

647
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,917
By the Grace of God 
and Narcotics anonymous,

648
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,390
I got nine days clean and sober.

649
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,174
Well, that's good.

650
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:15,733
Do you know her?

651
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,656
I don't know nothing,
I ain't seen nothing.

652
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:19,936
So I can't tell you nothing.

653
00:37:20,522 --> 00:37:24,326
What kind of piece of trash mother lets 
her kids get taken away over and over again,

654
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,035
then when she finally gets a chance 
to help them, she turns her back?

655
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:30,173
Don't you dare talk to me like you know
what I've been through.

656
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:33,464
Every time children's services
snatched my boys,

657
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:37,853
it took all I had not to kill myself
the second the door shut behind them.

658
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:40,702
If you really care about your boys,
you'll tell us who this girl is.

659
00:37:40,702 --> 00:37:42,136
Jadon's in for murder.

660
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:45,577
Ezra's being charged
for attempted murder of a cop.

661
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:50,538
Tell us who this girl is, right now, 
or your boys will never see daylight again.

662
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:54,435
You stole the first half of their lives,
give them back the rest.

663
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:59,139
When I get 90 days clean and sober,

664
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:04,802
I'm gonna surprise Jadon and Ezra
and take them to Red Lobster.

665
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:13,255
Her name is Latrice Munez.

666
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:16,144
She lives in the building
right behind this one.

667
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:18,374
Unit 412.

668
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:23,608
Yeah, I'm Jimmy Mac's bottom bitch.

669
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:25,867
McDonnell was pimping you out
as his number one girl

670
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,265
with what you're carrying?

671
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:30,778
You're damn right.
Shoot, I still got it.

672
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:32,773
Tell us about Julie.

673
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:35,008
She thought being a ho was mad fun.

674
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,487
Like being one of them rap video hos,
or something like that.

675
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:39,949
How'd you meet up with
a white girl from Long island?

676
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:41,124
At the fights.

677
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:43,819
She got off watching dudes
pounding each other.

678
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:45,381
So I helped J-Mac turn her out.

679
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:48,867
Why did you take a picture 
of her at the frat party?

680
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:52,968
McDonnell wanted photos of her
having sex with Jadon and Ezra.

681
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:55,070
For proof he wasn't getting Georgia'd.

682
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,890
Look at you throwing around gang, Papi.

683
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,676
Acting like you know your thing.

684
00:38:58,676 --> 00:39:01,847
Little girl, I was through with it
before you knew what to do with it.

685
00:39:01,847 --> 00:39:02,999
Enlighten me.

686
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:06,438
A pimp has sex with a new girl
before she actually turns a trick,

687
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:08,254
it's called getting Georgia'd.

688
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:10,092
It's like the pimp got played.

689
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:14,100
McDonnell wanted to make sure
that Julie did what he said.

690
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,463
So he made me take the pictures.

691
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:19,633
I picked up Julie at her place.

692
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:21,721
This was when we was leaving 
for the party.

693
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:23,983
She was really feeling Ezra too.

694
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:26,725
She was all up on him that night.

695
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:29,075
She was supposed to do both brothers,

696
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,372
and then say that they raped her.

697
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:34,453
J-Mac was gonna blackmail them
for their tuition checks.

698
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:35,933
Why'd he beat her?

699
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:38,546
After she had sex with Ezra, 
we bounced.

700
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:42,374
Julie told J-Mac that she wasn't gonna say
that they raped her.

701
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,276
He just started beating on her like some 
type of animal, or something, you know?

702
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:51,649
I never seen him like that before.

703
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:53,897
So I just took the pictures.

704
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:55,641
Why?

705
00:39:57,465 --> 00:39:59,504
Insurance.

706
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:04,129
So he'd never come at me like that.
Never.

707
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:06,693
Get Jadon down to court, 
and I'll have him withdraw his plea.

708
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:08,095
What about Ezra?

709
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:10,920
I'll drop the attempted murder charge
because he wasn't shooting at you.

710
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,223
But there's nothing I can do
about the gun possession.

711
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:16,150
About the gun...

712
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,954
It got lost in transport from the scene.

713
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:24,113
Without the evidence,
I'll have to drop the gun charge too.

714
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:27,321
Just make sure they're both
in court at the same time.

715
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:31,389
Stuff happens.

716
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:38,160
Hey.
Thanks again.

717
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,461
Hey, no problem.

718
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:43,110
I talked to the dean, 
you guys are back in school.

719
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:45,652
So that's the big surprise?

720
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,710
No.
I have another one.

721
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:30,107
Hey, Fin. Where the hell are you?
We've been waiting.

722
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,365
I'll tell them.

723
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:41,823
Hey, come on, man.

724
00:41:41,823 --> 00:41:45,155
You gonna tell us what 
the surprise is, or what?

725
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:55,240
I'm taking you guys to Red Lobster.

726
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,246
Come on.
