1
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,100
Le Vaillant was
struck by the hypocrisy

2
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,770
of killing fellow human beings
in the name of religion.

3
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:31,859
Especially since these people
professed belief in the same God.

4
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,946
The Fazar, Le Vaillant's written
account of his experiences,

5
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,241
tells us he wandered
the streets of Jerusalem

6
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,120
for days after that bloody battle,

7
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,789
until he found
the entrance of a cave

8
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,209
that ran beneath
the length of the holy city.

9
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,921
Inside that cave, he began
to record his epiphany,

10
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,300
which became the basis
for a new religious sect.

11
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,511
An order combining
the fundamental tenets

12
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,598
of the three major religions
of his day.

13
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,934
His first converts were
Christian knights

14
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,354
who'd also become disenchanted
by the bloodshed.

15
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,568
The force of his convictions even won
over a number of Muslims and Jews.

16
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:19,907
Former enemies who now became
willing converts to the new faith.

17
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,410
Many years after completing
the original Fazar,

18
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,079
Le Vaillant had further revelations.

19
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:31,376
He wrote these down, intending them
to be added as the final chapter.

20
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,547
Around this time he and his followers
were being accused of heresy

21
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,175
by the crusader authorities.

22
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,512
On their way to Syria, he and
a group of disciples were intercepted

23
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,352
by some of the very same crusaders
he had once commanded.

24
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,638
During the battle that followed,

25
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,059
Le Vaillant died a martyr's death.

26
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:43,031
The final chapter he had written
was lost.

27
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,798
Do you have the alarm code?
And no guards, right?

28
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:05,178
You'll be like the fox in the henhouse.
Heh, heh. Take as many eggs as you like.

29
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,057
Yuri, it's Russian mob.
No mistakes on this one.

30
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,477
My friend, this is 1000 percent.

31
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,024
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be in New York making a deal.

32
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,652
And I'll be in Tel Aviv
waiting for my commission.

33
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,351
Visual is all clear.

34
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,616
Come on.
Done.

35
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,341
Way to go, Yuri. I'm in.

36
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,394
Do you see the egg?

37
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,564
It's beautiful.

38
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,857
Yes! Yes! Yes!

39
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,735
I'm going for it.

40
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,173
I got it.
Yuri's the man with the plan!

41
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,009
You're the man with the plan.
I told you...

42
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,430
Shit.
Rudy?

43
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,727
Are you okay?

44
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,692
Was that a gunshot?
No, I farted.

45
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,898
Yuri, guide me out of here.

46
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,463
Oh, shit, Rudy. I'm sorry.

47
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,096
Toilet!

48
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,909
Hey, pal, this is a taxi zone.
You wanna get towed away?

49
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,870
Sorry. Watch it for me.

50
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,622
Hey.
Thanks.

51
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,790
Right on.

52
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,379
Perhaps you've seen enough
stones and carvings. Come with me.

53
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,842
I will show you a garment.
A most controversial acquisition.

54
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,473
This was unearthed beneath
a false storage room,

55
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,893
situated by Theodosius
as a decoy against thieves.

56
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,814
But often success as an archeologist
depends on knowing where to dig.

57
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,733
Well, I can dig her. Heh.

58
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,362
Rudy! Would you take over?

59
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,155
Can I have your...?

60
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,532
Okay, everybody, follow me.

61
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,826
Dad, what's up? My main man!

62
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,163
Why must you always
attract attention?

63
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,540
Come on, I love people,
I love life...

64
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,335
You love to embarrass me.

65
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,296
I'm just having fun, Dad.

66
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,094
Anyway, you called. You want to talk?
Yes, but not here. Come on.

67
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,264
Tell me, are you still involved
with that same nonsense?

68
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,266
Hey, I'm legit now.

69
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,728
Straight. Import-export.
And I'm kicking ass.

70
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,107
Now, check this out.

71
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,486
Here, take it. For you.

72
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,782
Fancy watches, fast cars,
easy money.

73
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,911
What does it prove
in the grand scheme of things, Rudy?

74
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,498
Yeah?
You have the egg?

75
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,959
I've got it. Trust me,

76
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,377
it's in pristine condition.

77
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,879
Ten o'clock.
Yeah, I'll be there.

78
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,093
Later, tonight. Some business.

79
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,805
I hope for your sake it is legal.
A thousand percent.

80
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,306
Come on.

81
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,643
Damn plane tickets.

82
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,354
They are here somewhere.

83
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,192
Where you going? On a dig?
No, an interview.

84
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,613
Someone I've been trying to meet
for a very long time.

85
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,993
Don't touch that!
Sorry.

86
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,620
What is it?

87
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,791
The lost chapter of the Fazar.

88
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,169
Oh.

89
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,172
The Fazar happens
to be the holy scripture

90
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,424
for an obscure
Middle Eastern sect.

91
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:44,721
And, yes, to answer your inevitable
next question, it is quite valuable.

92
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,682
But only to practicing members
of the Order.

93
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:52,228
What can I say, Dad?
You have an exciting life.

94
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,441
Rudy, we need to discuss some issues.
Come by my apartment this evening.

95
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,028
Uh, I've got some business tonight.
Mm-hm.

96
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,948
In fact, uh, it's time to go.

97
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,659
All right.
Can you at least call me?

98
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,369
Of course.

99
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,622
Absolutely.

100
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:15,376
Tonight. It has to be tonight.
You've got it, Dad.

101
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,771
Be careful.

102
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,952
Mr. Cafmeyer, this way, please.

103
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,412
So let's see what
Santa brought for me.

104
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,164
Mm?

105
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,085
This egg was designed
by Peter Carl Fabergé.

106
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,547
A special gift to Czar Nicholas.

107
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,217
Look at the inlay.
Twenty-four-karat gold.

108
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,929
What can I say? One of a kind.

109
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,308
That's why it's so expensive.
You cannot find this on the Net. Ha, ha.

110
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,772
That's for sure. But stealing it
from the Russian mafia, come on.

111
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,858
Russian mafia?

112
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,446
In fact, he's got some friends.
Very nasty guys.

113
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,783
If they found out about this,
you'd end up with

114
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,578
your balls stuffed
and sewn inside your mouth.

115
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,748
Whoa. So the deal about...

116
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,042
No, no, no. Here's the deal.

117
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:43,381
I'm giving you an easy out.
I'll take this hot potato off your hands.

118
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:47,510
And I'll assume the risk.
Risk is my business.

119
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,262
You're not listening, Rudy.

120
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,182
Just a second, please.

121
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,977
Hello?
Rudy!

122
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,564
Where are you?
You promised to call me tonight!

123
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,066
Uh, I'm in a business meeting.

124
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,527
Really? Are you buying a disco?

125
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,906
Dad, please.
I can hear that music!

126
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,158
Hey, where are you going?

127
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,494
That is just what I'm trying
to explain to you.

128
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,374
Rudy, what is going on?

129
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,710
Give it to him.

130
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,170
Rudy.

131
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,924
Hey, come here!

132
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,177
Rudy?

133
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,938
My egg.

134
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,462
Move!

135
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,135
Oh, shit.

136
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,063
My eyes!

137
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,190
Got a problem here?

138
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,823
Hey, can I make a phone call
over here?

139
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:36,577
Not yet, Rudy.
Heard you had a big night last night.

140
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,956
How are you gonna pay for all that?
Sell your Ferrari?

141
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,500
Listen, I had a bad night, okay?

142
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,586
Why do I have to look at your face
in the morning? Huh?

143
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,465
Is your father Oscar Cafmeyer?

144
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,301
Yeah. Why?

145
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,388
Yesterday, there was
a manuscript in this case.

146
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,058
Last night,
security discovered it missing.

147
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,309
So what?

148
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,895
Your father was last
to leave the building.

149
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,857
This morning, nobody seems
to know where he is.

150
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,109
A case of like father, like son?

151
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,570
You're full of shit.
Rudy, relax.

152
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,157
Why should he break the glass
if he had a key?

153
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,661
Nobody's making any accusations. We
just wanna ask him some questions.

154
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,205
You have any idea where he is?

155
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,166
No.

156
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:49,650
Rudy, I've been trying
your mobile, but all I get is this recording.

157
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,197
Oh, never mind. I will try again later.

158
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,409
I'm staying at an old friend's home.

159
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,164
Remember Walt Finley? He is
teaching at Ben Gurion University.

160
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,168
Now, this is his number: 972...

161
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,547
Hello?
Rudy?

162
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,675
Dad, how are you?
Thank God you're there.

163
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,761
Where are you?
Israel.

164
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,639
Israel?
Pay attention, I beg you.

165
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,435
I was at the police station. You know
what they're saying about you?

166
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,815
Not now. I'm afraid I've gotten myself
into some big trouble.

167
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,235
What do you mean?
What are you doing? Hang up!

168
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,695
Dad! Who's that?

169
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,866
Book me on the first flight to Israel.
Tel Aviv. Right away!

170
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,710
Take your glasses off, please.

171
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,967
Visiting Israel on business
or pleasure?

172
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,219
Pleasure, always.

173
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,889
Excuse me, uh,
what's the delay?

174
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,228
Our database shows that
you've had several arrests

175
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,564
for illegally transporting artifacts.

176
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,775
Does it also show
I was never convicted?

177
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,736
Please open your carry-on.

178
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,038
Any artifacts which you
have not declared?

179
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,374
Oh, the Mona Lisa.

180
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,253
Hmm. You like to joke.
They say laughter opens up the soul.

181
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,256
Well, let it open the rest
of your luggage too.

182
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,218
You're joking, right?
Ha-ha-ha. No.

183
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,139
You know, this is bullshit.

184
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,143
No, Mr. Cafmeyer.
This is Israel.

185
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,236
I apologize.
Security is extra tight this month.

186
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,990
Muslims are making their pilgrimage
to Jerusalem for Ramadan.

187
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,533
Passport, please.

188
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,827
Rudy? Rudy Cafmeyer!

189
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,621
Who is this?
Walter Finley.

190
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,790
Professor of archeology
at Ben Gurion University.

191
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,085
And what is your relationship
to this man?

192
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,840
Not that it's any of your business,
I'm a friend of his father's.

193
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,426
I've known him
since he was in knickers,

194
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,388
which would have put you
in diapers.

195
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,100
Now, are there any more
insurmountable obstacles

196
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,478
we have to overcome here,
young lady?

197
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,024
Thank you for your cooperation.

198
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,152
Shalom.

199
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,906
Good to see you.
You too.

200
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:48,246
Where's my dad?
Look, let's get your bags into my car.

201
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,134
Watch where you go!
Up yours!

202
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,182
Ozzie Cafmeyer is a cranky old fool.

203
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,227
Calls me two days ago
to pick him up at the airport.

204
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,356
So I took him back to my house.
We had dinner, talked...

205
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,525
What was he doing here?

206
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,529
I'm getting to that!
What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?

207
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,491
A few years ago, he found scrolls
near the Syrian border.

208
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:31,289
The lost final chapter of the Fazar
written by Le Vaillant himself.

209
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,374
Was he translating it?

210
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,211
More than that.
He was writing a history of the sect.

211
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,047
An unauthorized history.

212
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,551
He's been e-mailing me his chapters,

213
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,304
having me lock them
in a safe-deposit box here.

214
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:51,350
Why a safe-deposit box in Israel?
Because he trusted me.

215
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,729
Here, here's the key.
You ought to have it anyway.

216
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,607
Okay, where can I find these guys?
I'll show you.

217
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:27,928
Their monastery is in east Jerusalem.
The other side of the Mount of Olives.

218
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,349
We're wasting time. Let's go.
The present-day Order

219
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,476
is just as reclusive as ever.

220
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,938
Fanatically adverse to publicity.
No contact to

221
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:42,109
the outside world. You'd do better
trying to get an audience with the pope.

222
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,906
Those are the guys that came by
the house and picked up your dad!

223
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,741
Hey! Hey, you!

224
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,285
Jump in. I'll drive.
You don't know the way.

225
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:57,583
You'll navigate, okay?
Be careful. This is a classic car.

226
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,931
Professor, buckle up.

227
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,814
Aah!
It's them!

228
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,077
Get down!

229
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,195
My car!

230
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,423
Shit. Sorry about the car.

231
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,520
There they are.
Let's just nail these sons of bitches.

232
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,534
You okay?

233
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,580
I'm fine.
Good.

234
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,114
Where's my father,

235
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,282
you son of a bitch?

236
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,957
I'm gonna kill you!

237
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,214
You okay?

238
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,507
Finley, look out!

239
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,430
Rudy...

240
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,940
Stay right there! Don't move!
He needs a doctor. Help me!

241
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,192
Hey, it's not me!
Up.

242
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,819
Get up.
It's not me!

243
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,287
And so you are telling us
these men kidnapped your father.

244
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,582
They took him somewhere.
No one's heard from him.

245
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,420
Mr. Cafmeyer,
I can smell bullshit a mile away.

246
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,714
You're only five feet from me.

247
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,634
I believe you're using
the alleged disappearance

248
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,595
as a cover to smuggle artifacts
out of Israel.

249
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,182
Alleged? My father was here.
Now he's missing.

250
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,686
This has nothing to do with
why you are in police custody.

251
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:31,148
You were found next to the corpse
of a prominent professor.

252
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,401
Let me guess.
You're accusing me of killing him?

253
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:39,156
Until we have more facts,
all options are open.

254
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:43,661
I'm placing you under house arrest.
You'll be taken to a hotel

255
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,748
until we complete our investigation
into the professor's death.

256
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,959
You know why
you're smelling bullshit?

257
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,087
Because you're up to your nose in it.

258
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,224
I'll be next door
if you need anything.

259
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:09,812
What about a taxi?
Within reason.

260
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:16,318
What about my father?
We're looking into it. Good night.

261
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:20,906
Good night, officer.
Lieutenant Barr. Dalia Barr.

262
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,160
How are you?
Okay.

263
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,203
Thanks.
Thank you.

264
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,118
Yuri.
Rudy!

265
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,371
Rudy, let me explain
what happened in Odessa.

266
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,791
Explain what? You left me hanging
like a piece of laundry.

267
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,127
But there was this cop...

268
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:24,381
Admit it! You little slimeball.
Or you'll never see your money.

269
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,218
What money?
I sold the egg. Remember our deal?

270
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,556
Ten percent.
That's 50 G's for you, my friend.

271
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,184
Lucky for you,
this place makes me generous.

272
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,561
Thank you, Rudy.

273
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,062
Thank you.

274
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,066
Rudy, do you have the cash with you?

275
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,360
it's under my mattress.

276
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,197
Of course I have it.
But I'm leaving tonight.

277
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,825
Tonight? Uh...

278
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,995
Can we meet first?
Come to my office in Tel Aviv.

279
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:59,708
I have a beautiful new penthouse
suite in the diamond district.

280
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,128
You'll be my special guest.

281
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,838
We'd like to use the phone.

282
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Rudy?

283
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,802
Uh... Yuri,
I have a much better idea.

284
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,193
Yuri.

285
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,905
Yuri.

286
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,325
Is that you, Rudy?

287
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,301
You slimeball.
You almost got me killed!

288
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,262
Hey, Rudy, it wasn't my fault!

289
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,225
You owe me.
Owe you?

290
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,185
You owe me.
What do you mean?

291
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,855
You owe me, I said!
Anything, Rudy. Anything.

292
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,610
Just tell me what I can do
to help, my friend.

293
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,739
I need this map translated.
Can you do it?

294
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,949
Sure.
Sure?

295
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,701
Sure.
Sure.

296
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,995
I'm positive! I'm a pro, my friend!

297
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,999
And this print.
Done. For you, anything.

298
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,168
Understand something.
I know where you sleep...

299
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,963
It wasn't my fault! There were cops...

300
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:33,260
Cops. Let's split up.
I'll call you. Go. Go.

301
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,871
Shalom.

302
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,209
Look, there he is. Stop!

303
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,130
Hey, you! Stop!

304
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,176
Cafmeyer! Hey, you! Stop!

305
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,537
Get away! Move! Hey, hey! Stop!

306
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,901
No.

307
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,283
Hey, you! Stop!

308
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,868
Stop!

309
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,912
Stop!

310
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,980
Come on! Come on!

311
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,880
Don't move!

312
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,563
Freeze!

313
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,932
Huh?

314
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,186
Excuse me.

315
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,695
Cuff them.

316
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,870
You know how much trouble I'm in
because of you? Do you know?

317
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,082
Let's have a coffee
and talk about it.

318
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,461
You have proved to me that
my original hunch was correct.

319
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,630
You cannot be trusted.

320
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,008
I came here to look for my father.

321
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,553
I did what I had to do
because nobody gives a shit!

322
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,847
We spoke to Immigration.

323
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,558
They have no record
of him entering the country.

324
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,851
That's impossible.

325
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,728
What's really going on?

326
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:39,232
Were you perhaps planning
to smuggle out a little something, hm?

327
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,653
Hey, those are mine!

328
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,863
What's going on?

329
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,491
Yes, we checked you out of the hotel.
Change at the airport.

330
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,035
You're going home.

331
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,246
You cannot do that.
I can, and will.

332
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,666
Can you take him to the airport
without him escaping?

333
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,752
Yes, sir.

334
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,839
What about Finley's murder?
You're no longer a suspect.

335
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,674
I'm still the only witness!

336
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:08,762
We have your testimony, thank you.
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Cafmeyer.

337
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,184
You're not helping me! You're
helping yourself! You're full of shit!

338
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,810
Move it!
What's going on?!

339
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,229
What did you find?

340
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:33,912
Today, as every year at this time,

341
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,458
we come to this special place
to commemorate

342
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:43,838
the departure of the knights
of Christendom from these shores.

343
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,302
Brother Cyrus will now lead us
in a passage from the Fazar.

344
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,013
Thank you, first disciple.

345
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,271
As was prophesied in
the Book of Tribulations, we await

346
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,690
the return of the Army of God,

347
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:08,488
who shall rise like a tide against
the sea of those who do not believe.

348
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:24,337
Cyrus, by what authority do you
quote from that disreputable source?

349
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,258
As second disciple,
you should know better!

350
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,971
I beg your forgiveness.
It was an unpardonable error.

351
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,892
Le Vaillant himself once followed
a false path toward God.

352
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:43,231
We must choose our words carefully.
Wars have started for less.

353
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:47,277
I will ask for forgiveness
at evening vespers.

354
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,728
Your flight doesn't leave
for a few hours. You hungry?

355
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,606
Someone here
actually cares about me?

356
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:29,068
We may be overly cautious
with security and our artifacts,

357
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,156
but we're not barbarians,
Mr. Cafmeyer.

358
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,952
It'd be a shame if you left without
sampling some fresh hummus.

359
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,085
You like?

360
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,298
I'd like it more without this.
Sorry.

361
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,259
Look, I came here
to find my father.

362
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:58,598
He told me he was in trouble.
He's the type of guy who never lies.

363
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,600
It sounds like
you really care about him.

364
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,604
The two of you must be very close.

365
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:12,320
He taught me everything about
paintings, antiques, you name it.

366
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,822
You certainly applied that knowledge.

367
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,368
Let's say I did.
I never meant to hurt him.

368
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,164
That's bothering you now?
Yes, because now he's missing.

369
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,751
And I'm just starting to realize
what I missed.

370
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,838
Why am I telling you all this?

371
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,590
You're tired.

372
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,637
You're jet-lagged. You'll feel a lot
better once you're back on a plane.

373
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,848
No, I'll feel better when I find him.

374
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:54,237
This attack was a brutal
and senseless act

375
00:42:54,655 --> 00:43:00,743
perpetrated on a man who devoted
his life to God and to peace.

376
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:05,123
His brothers and sisters
mourn his passing

377
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,418
and pray that those responsible
find repentance.

378
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,128
Who died?

379
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:14,340
Pierre Gaudet,
the leader of some religious sect.

380
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,384
You mean the Order?
Mm-hm.

381
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,494
Come on, this way.

382
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,630
Come on.
Please keep on moving.

383
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,072
Hello.
Get the prisoner off the plane.

384
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,658
I want him brought back here.
Why?

385
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,661
We've been informed
he's leaving with an artifact.

386
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:29,666
Customs checked him. I saw...
Just do it, lieutenant!

387
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,927
What's going on?
You're staying in Israel.

388
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,804
What?

389
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,640
They said you're trying
to smuggle an artifact.

390
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,351
Do you believe that?

391
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:54,190
Something is not kosher here.
I'm not trying to be funny, okay?

392
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:06,494
When I signal, run to the back stairs.

393
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:13,418
If you make it to the service road,
I'll be waiting.

394
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,254
If I make it?
Now push me.

395
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,047
Just push me.

396
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,595
Over here! He's escaping! Quick!

397
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,690
Unh!
Quick! I need assistance up here!

398
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:56,586
What?
What are you doing? Hey! Hey!

399
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,696
The stairs are slowing
him down! We can catch him!

400
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,341
Rudy! Get in the back. Hurry.

401
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,638
Get down. Get down!

402
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,931
You all right?

403
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,272
You missed him.
He went over the fence.

404
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,003
You're safe now.
Safe from what?

405
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,923
I've got some questions for you,
okay?

406
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,928
I used to belong to the Order.
What?

407
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,141
You should've told me this before.
I couldn't.

408
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:02,939
Of course not. You're part of it.
No, I didn't know this was related.

409
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:08,027
Oh, sure. You knew about my father.
Where are you going? Hey!

410
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,363
Hey!

411
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,282
I just risked my ass for you!

412
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,661
Why? So you can hand me over
to the Order?

413
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,663
I left the Order when I was 18.

414
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,375
Oh, you left the Order?
I wanted to create my own life.

415
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,170
So meeting you at the airport
was no accident.

416
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,799
Look, Rudy, let me explain
a few things to you, okay?

417
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,678
Most of the followers are peaceful
and life-affirming.

418
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,682
There is a small group of fanatics
who believe in a darker path.

419
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,976
They call themselves
the Army of God.

420
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,020
They've been on standby
for years.

421
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,399
And you think they took my father?

422
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,653
I don't know. They might
also be the ones who killed Gaudet.

423
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,915
Hey, Rudy, my friend!

424
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:07,962
Who's the cop?
Everything's fine. She's with us.

425
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:13,509
Uh-huh. My friend, look what I
printed out for you from the disc.

426
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:37,616
It's not translated yet, but... Uh-huh.
It looks like a map of Jerusalem.

427
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:42,079
Middle Ages, European design.
What's the language?

428
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:47,251
Aramaic. The language of Palestinian
Christians at the time the Crusades.

429
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,129
See these lines? Here and here?

430
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,257
They are caves and tunnels
beneath the old city.

431
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,302
They've remained hidden
since the holy wars.

432
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,471
Professor Finley told me
about those.

433
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,724
What he didn't tell you
is what they lead to.

434
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:07,271
Why would an archeology professor
bring the scrolls to New York

435
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:11,817
but leave the map in Israel
hidden inside a safe-deposit box?

436
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:16,947
Because the map leads to something
even more valuable.

437
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,001
The people who left forgot something.
Let's hide this.

438
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,222
Hands in the air!

439
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,434
Get them up! Move!

440
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,605
Where is it? Where is it?

441
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,153
Freeze!

442
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,697
Oh!

443
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,558
Oh.

444
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,143
Give me that.

445
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,438
Come on.

446
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,318
Hold on.

447
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,786
Rudy.

448
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,655
Thank you, Avram.

449
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:54,076
After all this time,
you come back to me like this.

450
00:56:56,996 --> 00:57:02,418
Avram, you know I've had
to make some difficult choices.

451
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,587
You chose to leave.

452
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,298
Please, can we talk about this later?

453
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,719
I really need some water
and clean rags right now.

454
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:22,229
Here's some water.
Thank you, Avram.

455
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,543
Where am I?
A friend's.

456
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,131
How long have I been here?

457
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:54,052
Two days now. Hey. Shh.

458
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,180
You really should rest.

459
00:57:56,389 --> 00:58:00,601
I'm okay.
Well enough to leave?

460
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:10,486
Israeli hospitality kills me.
No, it just saved your life.

461
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:19,036
Here. Your father's book.
Yeah.

462
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:24,791
I've been going through this.
You really should too.

463
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,596
The lost chapter
predicts a revolution,

464
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,891
one that is peaceful
and spiritual in nature.

465
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,603
This will not be good news
to the radical Army of God

466
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:49,399
who contend that Le Vaillant
prophesied a catastrophic holy war.

467
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,611
I suspect this militant faction
will stop at nothing

468
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,989
to suppress the true contents
of this final chapter.

469
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:58,158
Though my safety may be an issue,

470
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,453
I have requested an interview
with the first disciple

471
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,040
to make these matters known.

472
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,003
Your scholar seems to be
on the verge of enlightenment.

473
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,632
It wouldn't hurt you
to sample some of it yourself.

474
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:19,346
Dalia, the world is as filled with
temptations as it is with false prophets.

475
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,686
Onions. I need onions.

476
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,819
Is everything okay?
We were just...

477
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,988
We were discussing
the manuscript.

478
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,031
It's a fraud.

479
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,119
A fraud?
The scrolls, they were tested.

480
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,956
By whom? Secular scientists?
If you would open your mind...

481
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,917
To what?
To this, Avram.

482
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:56,133
What is this? What is this?

483
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,509
It's mentioned in the Fazar.

484
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:01,305
Solomon's gold. A treasure the
ancient Hebrews hid under the city.

485
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:05,892
Which might explain why people
with guns have been chasing us.

486
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,478
It explains nothing
but your ignorance.

487
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:13,317
The treasure is a metaphor
for the wisdom of the ancient sages.

488
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:18,196
Avram, I need to get to the monastery.
I think they're holding my father.

489
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,450
Impossible. No outsider is permitted.

490
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,036
What about an insider?

491
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:28,332
A member from overseas
that is here on pilgrimage?

492
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,086
That's Cyrus.

493
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,464
The new first disciple.

494
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:33,980
Children of God, I stand here
before you today in great sorrow.

495
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:37,734
For what should be
a celebration of hope and joy,

496
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,946
must instead be looked upon
as a call to action.

497
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:46,076
God's vengeance for this murderous
deed will be swift and without mercy!

498
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,208
May the eternal spirit
of Pierre Gaudet

499
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:56,044
guide us on
this path of deliverance.

500
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:04,386
Time to see if my father's alive.
Try the catacombs first.

501
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:13,395
That door leads to a small stairway.
Follow it all the way down.

502
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:17,941
Rudy. Be careful.

503
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,526
Rudy.

504
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,580
Dad! Are you all right?
Rudy. Yes.

505
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,124
Let me get you out of here. Unh!

506
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:21,004
No, no, I already tried.
No, forget about me.

507
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,924
You have to stop them.

508
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:28,929
Pull off that tarp. You will
see what this is all about.

509
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,681
Rudy, go. Go!

510
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,249
This looks like a...
A bomb?

511
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:04,506
Sorry we're late, but I could give
a shit about this coronation.

512
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:09,177
Tonight,
we will all witness a miracle.

513
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:13,181
As God's fury cleanses the souls
of those against us,

514
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:16,142
let the new age begin!

515
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,814
Where are you going?
To find Rudy.

516
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,358
Avram, we have to
put a stop to this.

517
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:28,780
All right, I'm coming with you.
This way.

518
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,493
Rudy!

519
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,621
Dalia, stop! It's a trap.

520
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,793
Now be a good girl, Dalia,
and come down here.

521
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,797
Since when did you take your
vows with the Order, major?

522
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,301
The day Cyrus vowed there was
treasure under the Temple Mount.

523
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,929
That's the day I found religion.
Ha, ha.

524
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,807
Hello, professor.

525
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,813
Dad, meet Dalia.
She's a good cop.

526
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:08,153
Now let's ask the major
what the big bomb is for. Huh?

527
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,241
It's Ramadan.

528
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,954
Islamic leaders from around the world
will be on the Temple Mount at noon.

529
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:22,918
What are you saying?
This nut case is gonna blow it up?

530
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,253
That will start World War lll.

531
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:30,342
Especially when they find the bodies
of an Israeli and an American.

532
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,178
No, no, you're crazy!
This is impossible.

533
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,890
You've completely misinterpreted
the words of the first disciple.

534
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,936
And you are a naive moron.

535
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,400
You have truly lost the way, Cyrus.

536
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:51,529
On the contrary, I've found it.

537
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,616
I want to thank you, young Cafmeyer,

538
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:58,078
for unwittingly providing
the final piece of the puzzle.

539
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,039
And thank you, Avram,

540
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,124
for your loyalty and devotion.

541
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,794
But, first disciple,
what they're saying here...

542
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,172
Avram, If you've read
the Book of Tribulations carefully,

543
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,969
you are aware that the holy war
is triggered by a singular event.

544
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,888
Behold the event.

545
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:24,187
And as my unwavering one, I shall
grant you the privilege of assisting us.

546
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:27,357
Bind him, and her too.

547
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,610
Now, where's my guide?

548
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,291
Unh! Dad!
No! Stop!

549
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:49,629
There is no need for that!
Then you will be assisting us too?

550
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,424
What's he talking about?
With the map,

551
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:55,468
your father can guide us
under the Temple Mount.

552
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,556
Cyrus, please. Millions will die.

553
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:03,893
It is written! I will raise Mount
Moriah and build a new temple.

554
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,938
That prophecy you are quoting
is a fabrication!

555
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,857
Unh!
Dad! Unh!

556
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,694
Don't do shit for him.

557
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:17,407
Apparently, stubbornness
is an ingrained family trait.

558
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,951
Beats a messiah complex
any day.

559
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:25,290
Aah! Unh.
Stop! I will do it. I will guide you.

560
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,125
God help us all.

561
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:32,630
He helps those who
help themselves, professor.

562
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:36,486
We are near the Temple Mount.
That is where the traps begin.

563
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:41,658
Perhaps we should use someone
expendable to lead the way.

564
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:46,621
Young Mr. Cafmeyer,
we have a job for you.

565
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,295
Rudy!

566
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,715
Rudy, be careful.
Okay.

567
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:01,970
Go.

568
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,057
Avram.

569
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:16,526
Avram! Somebody help him!
No! Let me go, damn it!

570
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:23,116
Careful, Rudy.

571
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,660
Come on, Avram.

572
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:39,674
You deceived me.
This is the way according to the map.

573
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:43,428
How do we proceed?
What's the matter with you guys?

574
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,806
See these beams? We take them
down and we build a bridge.

575
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,836
Oh, my God.

576
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,168
This is not the Well of Souls.
Unh!

577
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:00,129
In the next chamber, I swear.

578
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,464
Show me.

579
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:31,452
Directly above us,
the Dome of the Rock,

580
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:35,623
Islam's third holiest shrine.

581
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:41,921
And henceforth from this day forward,
the holiest shrine of the Order.

582
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:55,601
Cyrus, I beg you to reconsider.

583
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,944
Bring the bomb.

584
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,113
Hey, hey. Hold on, hold on.

585
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,491
We'll get to that.
First, we fill these bags.

586
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,119
There's no time.

587
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,915
Would you take a look
around you, Cyrus?

588
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:20,209
There's a king's treasure here.

589
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:23,504
Enough to finance
10 of your holy wars.

590
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:27,383
We set the bomb now.

591
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,469
We can do this the easy way,

592
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,931
or the very easy way.

593
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:42,023
I have a prophecy to fulfill.

594
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,318
And I have a Swiss
bank account to fill.

595
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:49,947
That's the only reason I joined
your crazy scheme in the first place.

596
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,579
Idiots!
Professor, here.

597
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:58,956
Stop them! Don't let them get away!

598
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,378
Unh!
Aah!

599
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,797
No!

600
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,425
Avram, no!

601
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:19,936
Rudy, your dad!
Dad, you're hit.

602
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:24,607
Unh! Unh.
Dalia, come on.

603
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,360
Let's go. Over here.

604
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,081
Dad, you stay here. We'll be back.

605
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,166
I'll be fine.

606
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,085
Let's go. Come on.

607
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:50,258
They couldn't have come
this far. We must've passed them.

608
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,093
Come on, let's double back.

609
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,887
Let's split.
Go!

610
01:13:57,474 --> 01:14:01,561
Get after him!
I'll take care of that bitch!

611
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:48,983
Ah. Help me with these.
Assist him.

612
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,085
Shit!

613
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:50,938
Hey, Dad, meet Dalia.
She's the dead cop!

614
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,816
Wrong, major.

615
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:06,454
Professor, are you okay?
I'm fine.

616
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,504
Take my father out of here.
What about you?

617
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:20,343
I've got to stop the bomb.
Rudy, please be careful.

618
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,057
Come on, professor.
Let's go.

619
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:30,978
Are you ready for this?
Thank you.

620
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:38,944
Psst.

621
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:52,750
The bomb is set.
It's irreversible.

622
01:17:57,714 --> 01:18:02,259
The prophecy will be fulfilled,
and I will vanquish my enemy.

623
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,742
You can't stop the prophecy.

624
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,709
You read the wrong book, pal.

625
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:06,902
Now it's time to say bon voyage.

626
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,279
Shalom!

627
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:58,370
Please, stay calm.

628
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,132
Hey, Dad.
Rudy!

629
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,550
My main man!

630
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:57,721
Hey, this is great.

631
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:00,599
A few more to sign,
then we can go to lunch.

632
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,851
Take your time.

633
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,611
Don't touch that!
Oh!

634
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,448
I'm sorry. What is this?

635
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:20,619
It is a map which purports
to show the location

636
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:25,791
of the fabled seven cities of Cibola
near Cancún on the Yucatán peninsula.

637
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:30,212
Oh.
These, ostensibly, hm,

638
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:34,216
are the legendary cities of gold

639
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,761
containing the Mayan treasure,

640
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:42,975
which the Spanish conquistadors
so desperately had sought.

641
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:47,312
And to answer your
inevitable next question:

642
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:51,191
Yes, it is quite valuable. Ha, ha.

643
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,238
Rudy? Rudy?

644
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:57,906
Rudy!

645
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:00,284
So where to, young Cafmeyer?

646
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:01,618
Cancún, Mexico.
Mm-hm.

647
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:05,748
Will that be business or pleasure?
Pleasure, always.

648
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,959
Rudy!
Oh.

649
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,977
Cut?
