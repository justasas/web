Mmm-mmm. Called the super this morning.

Calling doesn't do any good.
I'll go down and talk to him.

Hey, where's Sami?

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,265
Did you let him go out?

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,366
He doesn't do what I tell him.

12
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,340
You let him bring that in here?

His throat's been cut. It's not very deep.

Didn't go through the carotid artery.

There's dirt in the wound, in his mouth.

00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,793
He's even aspirated some up his nose.

50
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,098
And there's dirt under the nails.

Enrique Iberra.

70
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,868
According to the blood tests,
the kid's probably his.

71
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,965
I'm guessing Iberra's priors were for dope.

72

This MO's got dope written all over it.

73
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,373
Iberra's last conviction was 12 years ago.

74
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,009
He finished his GED while he was inside.

00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,143
His parole reviews are stellar.

76
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,285
He had car grease on his
jacket, calluses on his hand.

77
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,052
He was a mechanic. He was
working for a living.

He and his kid were what, witnesses?
Wrong place, wrong time?

79
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,755
Or it's punitive.

00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,129
Someone was being taught a lesson.

00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,961
Not necessarily.

Iberra had his son's blood on his pants.

84
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,838
His son was buried on top of him.

85
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,177
Which means Iberra was likely killed first.

86
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,071

And Rico came home after work,

96
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,375
he left his toolbox there

97
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,416
and then he left again. Why?

98
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,225
To have a beer.

99
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,931
But Sami was 12 years old. He
didn't take Sami to have a beer.

No. He just went out... That's all, he...

No, we can't afford that.

These are ticket stubs from 3 different games.

113

The last one was a month ago.

114
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,645
Someone from Rico's work got him those.

115
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,157
A rich guy. Rico worked on his car.

116
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,056
I don't remember his name.

120
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,465
How much did they cost?

121
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,142
(STAMMERING)
I... A dollar something. I don't remember.

122

These are worth about $5, right?

123
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,509
I mean, these are about $5 bucks.

124
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,746
Did someone give them to Sami?

125
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,348

gave him the game tickets.

126
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,152
No, I told you.

133
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,550
Rico's work. Grease everywhere in the house.

134
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,954
It's okay, I'll clean it up. It's no big deal.

135
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,157
You should really listen to
what my partner is telling you.

136

You're not alone.

137
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:57,275
Protein bars, Knicks tickets,
this kid had expensive tastes.

138
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,381
Yeah, and the money to indulge them.

139
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,489
Move it over to the right, okay, because
that's where the drum kit goes.

- Yeah.

144
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,904
And after, Tomas needs help with his homework.

145
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,572
What? You know the rules.

152
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,001
Enrique's wife said you saw him last night.

153
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,969
Why would she say that?

154
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,743
Maybe because he said he
was having a beer with you.

155
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,880
No way he told her that.

156
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,211
I was still here, right here,
working ‘til 9:00.

157
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,957
How do you know it was before
9:00 when he went out?

158
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,156
Well, you just said that...

159
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,629
She didn't tell you what
time it was, Mr. Ramirez.

160
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,259
Now you know because you saw him, right?

161
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,393
Maybe somebody told me they saw him.

162
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,800
EAMES: Somebody who?

163
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,405
Somebody from where Enrique was
having the beer, like Louisa said.

164
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,636
Where would that be, you being
Enrique's drinking buddy?

165
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,477
Try La Taverna around the corner.

166
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,508
Hey, I wasn't that close to him.

167
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,616
He'd been in jail, you know?

168
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,886
See that bodega down there on the right?

169
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,357
I think the guy there,
Ramirez, was friends with him.

170
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,449
Maybe he saw him.

171
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,190
But you're sure Mr. Iberra didn't
come in for a beer last night?

172
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,959
Yeah. He hardly ever came in.

173
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,693
I don't know, maybe once, I don't know.

174
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,894

no, wait up, wait up.

178
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,847
Listen, me and my partner, we need your help.

179
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,414
Did you know that a friend of
yours from the neighborhood,

180
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,893
Sami Iberra, you know that he got
killed last night with his...

181
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,123
We don't know him. We
don't know what happened.

182
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,166
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not finished.

183
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,601
Who put the word out not to talk to us?

184
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,534
Who's everyone afraid of?

185
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,435
Come on, Sami grew up here

186
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,670
all his life with his Mom and his Dad.

187
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,806
Huh? You guys grew up with him.

188
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,779
You probably went to the same school, right?

189
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,817
You played video games, you shoot hoops.

190
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,145
You don't think you should stand up for him?

191
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,050
In this neighborhood, the
Neighborhood Watch watches the cops.

192
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,293
LISA: It just breaks my heart.

193
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,435
Sami was one of our small victories.

194
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,468
He worked so hard to better his grades.

195
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,769
This year it all just clicked in for him.

196
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,173
How was he outside of class?

197
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,234
Any problems with the other kids? Fights?

198
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,214
No. He stuck mostly with kids
from his own neighborhood.

199
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,409
They're all good kids.

200
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,712
That's the picture we're getting.

201
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,243
The local precinct said it's a low
crime area, very little drug activity.

202
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,048
Protein bars seem to be the drug of choice.

203
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,185
All of Sami's friends eat those.

204
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,557
If you had to name Sami's best
friend, who would that be?

205
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,364
It was Jamal Dupuis,

206
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,265
but Jamal moved out of state a few
months ago to live with his father.

207
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,769
EAMES: How did Sami take that?

208
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,602
He started acting out, but he
got himself under control.

209
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,438
CD player. Noise reduction headphones.

210
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,304
It's got to be at least
a couple hundred bucks.

211
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,712
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

212
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,977
That's Rap. Rap.

213
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,077
(LATIN MUSIC PLAYING)

214
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,851
Well, this is interesting.

215
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,526
What is that, a mambo?

216
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,156
No, it's Son. It's music from Cuba.

217
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:13,196
Which is odd 'cause his family's Dominican.

218
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,263
These kids are usually ferocious about,

219
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,539
you know, embracing their ethnic background.

220
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,108
It's homemade. Sami's Mix.

221
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,173
And he didn't have a computer
or a CD burner at home.

222
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,214
Sixteen-One Studios.

223
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,888
Yeah, I showed Sami how to download
tracks and use the CD burner.

224
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,588
- You a friend of the family?
- A friend of the community.

225
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,658
The local kids, they like
to stop by after school,

226
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,565
I let them hang out till their
parents come home from work.

227
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,433
But that can't be good for business.

228
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,405
Hey, don't worry. When J. Lo comes
in, I make sure the kids behave.

229
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,301
Let me help you with that.

230
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,203
We'll move it around this way.

231
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,508
All right.

232
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,847
You know, Sami's...

233
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,484
he had a very eclectic selection on his CD.

234
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:07,721
Yeah, rap, hip-hop, you'd expect
that. But Son music?

235
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,653
Is that your influence, Mr. Rios?

236
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,718
He heard me play it. He liked it.

237
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,855
Kids are like, you know, sponges.

238
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,229
He see you eat these?

239
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,930
He had some in his locker at school.

240
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,967
Well, I can't help it if they get
hungry, and I don't feed them junk.

241
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,872
I mean, you eat junk, you become junk.

242
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:28,071
Yeah, respect your body, respect
yourself. That's a good philosophy.

243
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,906
I'm sorry, this thing is just so...

244
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,915
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Baby!

245
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,310
Oh, I like that.

246
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:41,190
It records a word or a phrase so you
can play it like a note, you know.

247
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,124
You let the kids use this stuff?

248
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,355
I teach them how to use the equipment,

249
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,022
after they do their homework.

250
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,690
Jojo's clubhouse.

251
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,995
All due respect, ma'am,

252
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,694
where would you like these boys to be?

253
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,534
Here, doing their schoolwork,
maybe learning a skill,

254
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,137
or out in your neighborhood
boosting car stereos?

255
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,834
No, here, definitely.

256
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,842
Hey, Frankie, Ruthie's Jerk
Palace is coming in at 4:00, huh?

257
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,472
You want to set up the board?

258
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,014
I got a restaurant commercial to do.

259
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,979
You must do a lot of these commercials
to pay for all this gear.

260
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:16,390
Oh, commercials, demos. I even got a
couple of clients get on the Latin charts.

261
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,697
Is Frankie one of your success stories?

262
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,258
Frankie's like an apprentice, you know?

263
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,268
Another couple of years, he'll know
enough to open his own studio.

264
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,601
So he gets his own studio,
and then there's Sami.

265
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,207
What happened with him?

266
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,875
He was a victim of his father's impulses.

267
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,876
The man was an ex-convict.
That was his nature.

268
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,183
He was probably mixed up
with some bad people,

269
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,550
and the poor kid paid the price.

270
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,184
You know, one last thing,

271
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,023
before we let you get on with
your, you know, commercial.

272
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,090
Jamal Dupuis,

273
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,197
did he hang out here with Sami?

274
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:01,068
Yeah, for a while. But I think the
kid moved out of the neighborhood.

275
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,138
That's what we heard.

276
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,044
Well, thanks.

277
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,771
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Baby!

278
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,748
(CHUCKLING)
I really like... I really like that.

279
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,783
Jamal moved down to the barrier islands,

280
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,790
to live with his father in South Carolina.

281
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,850
EAMES: Why? Was he having problems here?

282
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,058
He wanted to work, and they don't
let 13-year-olds work up here.

283
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,360
So, they say you can make good
money crabbing down there.

284
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,129
Have you talked to him lately?

285
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,936
He calls from time to time from pay phones.

286
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,411
His father doesn't have a phone now.

287
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,310
Have you told him what
happened to his friend Sami?

288
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,571
No.

289
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,413
Well, they were best friends.

290
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,353
They hung out together at the
sound studio on Bergen Street.

291
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,782
We have nothing to say against Mr. Rios.

292
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,526
Your daughter is very cute.

293
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,465
You're happy Jamal's out of the house.

294
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,105
Why would you say that?

295
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,137
Well, you don't have any photos of him.

296
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,442
What's the town where Jamal's
staying with his father?

297
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,076
It's not just one town.

298
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:26,189
Well, his father's got family on
a lot of the islands down there,

299
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,222
so Jamal stays with them, too.

300
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,762
My favorite place down there
is Gullah Gullah Island.

301
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,628
I bet Jamal probably goes crabbing there.

302
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,497
Oh, yes. I remember him telling me that.

303
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,333
Telling you that he went crabbing
on Gullah Gullah Island?

304
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:49,077
You know, Mrs. Dupuis, there
is no island with that name.

305
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,641
Well, I'm sure I heard of it.

306
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,916
That's because

307
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,785
there's a children's television
show called Gullah, Gullah Island,

308
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,295
and you probably watched it with
him when he was growing up.

309
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,465
(SOBBING)

310
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,905
Where is he?

311
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,603
What happened to him?

312
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,807
He's with his father, and you have to go now.

313
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,509
Mr. Dupuis, we can protect your family.

314
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,680
Just go.

315
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,861
JOJO: Slowly, now. You don't
need that much, just half.

316
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,798
Easy, easy.

317
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,033
You see, Ramon?

318
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,663
One drop at a time, not all at
once like you did last week.

319
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,798
No, I didn't.

320
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,398
Don't contradict!

321
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,013
A man who sees his own
shortcomings and corrects them

322
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,879
is on his way to meet God.

323
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,844
Frankie, come help teach these boys.

324
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,825
Your mind isn't here.

325
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,388
You wanna be strong, you stay focused.

326
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,126
You watch Bennie. He's focused.

327
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,065
That's how he gets the job done.

328
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,831
I got the job done, Jojo.

329
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,203
Half done. Now I told you, watch Bennie.

330
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,448
You see, Frankie? That's focus.

331
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,121
Jamal's parents were supposed to contact us

332
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,891
to tell us where to send his school records,

333
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,329
but we never heard from them.

334
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,993
Jamal ever talk about working
in South Carolina?

335
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,593
No, I never heard that.

336
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,729
Could we see other files from students

337
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,240
who moved away in the last year or so?

338
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,242
Sure. We keep them over here.

339
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,306
There's a notation in Jamal's
records from the school nurse.

340
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,746
Two weeks before he moved,

341
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,843
he showed up with a black eye
and a broken collar bone.

342
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,015
Here you go.

343
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,890
This one moved to Fresno, California.

344
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,298
The school board confirms he's enrolled there.

345
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,598
Here, Christopher White,
broken arm six months ago.

346
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,267
3 weeks later, his parents
say he moved to Oklahoma

347
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,200
to live with relatives.

348
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,777
There's no confirmation in the file.

349
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,308
We try to stay on top of things.

350
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,380
Marco Reyes.

351
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,250
His parents say they sent him to
Mexico to live with his grandmother.

352
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,256
That was a week after he showed up for class

353
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,314
with eight stitches in his face.

354
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,094
These kids were all getting a
beating as a going-away present.

355
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,864
Well, they have something else in common.

356
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,870
They were all from the same 12-block radius.

357
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,939
The same 12 scared blocks.

358
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,046
Some kids were trolling
for scrap metal last October

359
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,481
along I-95 near exit 43.

360
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,644
Their dog started digging.

361
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,318
John Doe, 12 to 13 years old.

362
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,421
He matches one of the set of
dental records you sent around.

363
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,217
Christopher White.

364
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,656
The throat was cut.

365
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,665
The laceration was deep, all
the way back to the vertebra.

366
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,723
Almost took his head clean off.

367
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,568
The way the body was posed in the grave,

368
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:39,235
stretched out, hands crossed
over the front, feet together.

369
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,171
A proper burial.

370
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,207
A sign of respect?

371
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,749
I'm looking at Christopher
White's birth certificate.

372
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,050
His body was dumped less than a
mile from where he was born.

373
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,855
And these spots on the
shoe, anyone test them?

374
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,033
Other than coloring and tanning agents,

375
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,731
all you got here is shoe leather.

376
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,605
No trace of anything that would cause
it to crack and discolor like that.

377
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:17,171
Yeah. You know, when I was a
kid, I had leather mitts,

378
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,147
all right, and then they would get cracked,

379
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,685
you know, when they were wet and cold.

380
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,243
Well, that's how leather
reacts when it's frozen.

381
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,756
What about flash frozen?

382
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,415
Sure, with dry ice.

383
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,017
But that leaves a residue.

384
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,895
Liquid nitrogen?

385
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,289
Sure.

386
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,329
It evaporates, leaves no residue.

387
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,376
Look, I

388
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,607
was wondering if you could run
this through your machine.

389
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,377
I wiped it off the floor of a kid's bedroom.

390
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,610
Is that grease?

391
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,952
You tell me.

392
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,218
Submicron Teflon chips. Graphite.

393
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,261
Rare polymers. Friction modifiers.

394
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,323
I'm afraid to ask you where
you put this kind of grease.

395
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,662
It's Italian racing bicycle grease.

396
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,633
It's $30 a tube.

397
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,561
I can imagine what the bicycles cost.

398
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,099
Up to $15,000.

399
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,544
If the Iberra kid had a bike
like this in his bedroom,

400
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,541
it had to be stolen. That's what he was into.

401
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,643
Yeah, that's what they're all into.

402
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:34,248
The kid in New Jersey, he dripped
liquid nitrogen on his shoe.

403
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,455
Liquid nitrogen is used
to break bicycle locks.

404
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,393
I pulled some figures from Compstat.

405
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,727
There are $3 million worth of bicycles stolen

406
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,460
in all five boroughs every year.

407
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,729
Most of it involves adult perps,

408
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,170
but there are reports of one gang
of kids operating in Manhattan.

409
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,366
They're quick, they use different MO's

410
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,034
and they've never been caught.

411
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,769
And they're all well-trained.

412
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,439
Like Jojo said, kids are like sponges.

413
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,414
And I assume the ones that
don't make the grade

414
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,041
or make trouble get their throats cut.

415
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,813
We matched up 3 of the missing boys,

416
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,549
including Jamal Dupuis, with John Doe remains.

417
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,615
Their parents have been contacted,
but they're still not talking.

418
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,957
DEAKINS: Let's be careful
how much we lean on them.

419
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,486
According to the direction
of the marks on the vertebrae,

420
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:18,626
these kids had their throats slit from behind

421
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,228
from left to right.

422
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,967
The killer was right-handed.

423
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,737
But Sami Iberra and his father

424
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,645
had their throat cut from right to left.

425
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,206
Their killer was left-handed.

426
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,721
Jojo was breaking in someone new?

427
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,360
Somebody who didn't quite do the job right.

428
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,759
That's a Cielo with a set of record
10 shifters. Bennie got that.

429
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,735
Good work, Bennie. Real good work.

430
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:56,068
You know what? You guys go home, okay?

431
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,801
Frankie and I can take it from here.

432
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,274
They could help unload.

433
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,868
You don't look good. You eat lunch?

434
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,445
I just haven't been sleeping
so good, that's all.

435
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,846
I heard what the cops found.

436
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,045
I know. But you're standing up good.

437
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,385
Your loyalty, that's what's appreciated.

438
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,055
Thanks, Jojo.

439
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,753
"The power within stays safe
and free from assault,

440
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,352
"superior to pleasure and pain,
doing nothing randomly."

441
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,159
- You remember that?
- I do.

442
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,426
I know you do.

443
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,128
And I know you're gonna
continue standing by everyone.

444
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,669
Your fellow warriors.

445
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,365
Any sacrifice that's needed.

446
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,571
That's what I know you can do.

447
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,102
Well, what do you mean?

448
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,537
If it's necessary,

449
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,816
we know you'll do what a man would do.

450
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,590
"Don't act as if you're
going to live 10,000 years.

451
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,955
"Death hangs over you.

452
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:55,762
"While you live, while it's
in your power, be good."

453
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,162
ANTHONY: Frankie's not home
a lot of the time.

454
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,574
Look, is there a reward
for information or what?

455
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,570
- A reward?
- Hmm.

456
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:11,171
Maybe we can scrounge something
up. What do you think?

457
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,217
$20 bucks. We can handle $20 bucks.

458
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,547
$20 bucks?

459
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,022
Well, it's not like he's on
the FBI's top 10 list.

460
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:28,091
Well, I can see Frankie's Mom
has kept her youthful looks.

461
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,869
Don't run, Frankie. It won't
be good for you if you run.

462
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,175
I'm not running.

463
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,479
What you go and do, you little jerk?

464
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,917
Bringing the cops into my house

465
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,318
after all I've done for you.

466
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,048
I hope they fry you.

467
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,281
That's a good attitude, Frank.

468
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,461
And so it begins.

469
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,161
Your Dad's quite a ladies man, huh?

470
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,901
When my Dad came home at night,

471
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,938
I could smell them on him.

472
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,151
I was ashamed.

473
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,386
Right? I mean, like your Dad.

474
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,129
I can see why you look up to Jojo.

475
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,164
I really can.

476
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,496
"Everything has always been the same."

477
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,796
How do you mean?

478
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,371
"You can't lose another life
than the one you're living now,

479
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,307
"or live another one
than the one you're losing.

480
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,976
"The longest life is
the same as the shortest."

481
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,138
What's he talking about?

482
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,046
"The longest life is
the same as the shortest."

483
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,852
I know this.

484
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,161
"Some things are rushing into
existence. Others out of it."

485
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,127
GOREN: Did you read this, Frankie?

486
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:17,140
"Time is a river, a violent
current of events, glimpsed...

487
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,135
"Glimpsed..."

488
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,908
"Glimpsed once, already
carried past us and is gone."

489
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,838
Yeah.

490
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,477
That's Marcus Aurelius.

491
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,277
The dictates of a warrior.

492
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,580
(GROANING)

493
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:41,997
(GAGGING)

494
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,255
Okay.

495
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,166
Call EMS. He's taken something.
He's trying to kill himself.

496
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,763
This is unit 229. We have
an attempted suicide.

497
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,932
GOREN: What did you take, Frankie?

498
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:54,239
I am a warrior. I welcome death.

499
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,247
Yes, and warriors try to live.
They fight and they... And they live.

500
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,449
The son of a bitch!

501
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,577
He told him to do it! He told him to!

502
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,782
He's on a respirator. It's touch and go.

503
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,021
He took some kind of cyanide. He must
have been carrying it around with him.

504
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,392
In case of capture?

505
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,659
What, did this boy step out
of, an old war movie?

506
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,462
An old Roman war movie.

507
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,399
Before he went into convulsions,

508
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,529
he was quoting Marcus Aurelius.

509
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,368
Marcus Aurelius? The Meditations.

510
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,875
He was a Roman emperor... and a
follower of the Roman Stoic philosophy.

511
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,707
But I wasn't aware that Marcus Aurelius

512
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,769
was an advocate of suicide.

513
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,042
Well, he wasn't.

514
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,812
But like any belief system in the wrong hands,

515
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,877
Stoicism can be twisted
to mean whatever you want.

516
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,219
The wrong hands being Jojo Rios.

517
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,316
His idea of self-control.

518
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,421
The way that the bodies
were laid out for the burial,

519
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,525
where they were buried,

520
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,729
he's following the playbook.

521
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:59,001
Even the name of his sound
studio, Sixteen-One.

522
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,437
The year 161 AD,

523
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,081
the year Marcus Aurelius was made emperor.

524
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,545
Mr. Rios sees himself as a general?

525
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,845
Leading 12-year-olds in
a criminal enterprise

526
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,720
with the help of a second century philosophy?

527
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,490
Stoicism inspired the Roman legions

528
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,426
to march across Europe and Africa.

529
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,327
I mean, if you're gonna start a gang,

530
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,763
you could pick a worse model.

531
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,496
Detectives, I'm sorry. The
Marino boy didn't make it.

532
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,662
The doctor will be out to talk to you.

533
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,230
I need to notify the next of kin. The father.

534
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,338
Nurse,

535
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,516
his father, he's not gonna care.

536
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,217
We need a gag order.

537
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,916
I mean, the hospital can put out

538
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,754
that we brought Frank Marino in,

539
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,955
but we don't want them to
tell anyone that he's dead.

540
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,019
We don't?

541
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,765
No. If Frank Marino talked,

542
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,894
we'd have a case against Jojo Rios.

543
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,537
We need him to have talked.

544
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,235
Excuse me, but I really
do need to notify the parents.

545
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,142
Nurse, I'm Ronald Carver,

546
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,908
Assistant District Attorney.

547
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,846
I need to explain something to you.

548
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,684
It's time to round up some legionnaires.

549
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,304
Bennie, come on.

550
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,039
I'm moving. I'm moving.

551
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,375
Not anymore.

552
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,437
Uh-oh.

553
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,515
Jojo takes care of us.

554
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,145
No, see, that money he's
making off the bicycles,

555
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,588
he's not putting that in your college fund.

556
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,725
He's gonna spend it while you sit in Spofford.

557
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,990
Ramon, don't be a sucker!

558
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,697
Your mom's all alone with
your two little brothers.

559
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,136
What are they gonna think if you go to jail?

560
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,073
They'll see I'm a man. To stay true.

561
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:15,338
That's what it means to be a man.

562
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:20,410
GOREN: Christopher White, Marcos Reyes,

563
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:25,082
Jamal Dupuis and Sami Iberra.

564
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,287
What happened to them, Bennie?

565
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,320
And why did Jojo have them killed?

566
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,352
Listen, I do not know anything about that.

567
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,192
What about Christopher White?
He was in your class.

568
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,258
He must have done something
pretty bad to end up like this.

569
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,271
What, was he weak? Disloyal?

570
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,238
Did he steal from the others?

571
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,866
Listen, he was a good person.

572
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:47,805
He was a good person?

573
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,239
Yeah.

574
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,113
That's right.

575
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,311
I forgot.

576
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,488
You don't speak ill of the dead.

577
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,692
You don't speak ill of a fellow warrior.

578
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,498
Chris White was a fellow warrior.

579
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,699
He's buried in New Jersey,

580
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,167
the land of his birth

581
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,085
because that's what Marcus
Aurelius told you to do.

582
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,461
You see, we know all
about Jojo and Mr. Aurelius.

583
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,825
Frankie told us.

584
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,358
Did you know that he was arrested earlier?

585
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,899
If that had happened, he'd know what to do.

586
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,435
He wouldn't just nark on Jojo.

587
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,494
Oh, no.

588
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,500
No, he told us how him and
Jojo laid Chris in his grave.

589
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,775
No. Frankie's a hero, just like Jojo.

590
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,673
He would never turn his back on us.

591
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,845
Jojo's a hero? How do you figure
that? He's a sound engineer.

592
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,752
No, no. I know his story.

593
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,585
Jojo came from Cuba.

594
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,523
His boat sank, and it was night.

595
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,628
Everybody drowned except for Jojo.

596
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,691
He made it because he's strong.

597
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,525
He taught us how to be strong.

598
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,069
- GOREN: To be true?
- Yes.

599
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,032
He showed you by example.

600
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,765
You would never betray him

601
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,833
because he would never betray you.

602
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,176
- Yes.
- BOTH: The way of the warrior.

603
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,724
Well, it's nice to see kids
studying the classics.

604
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,784
And learning all the wrong lessons.

605
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,423
Well, should we pick up a few
more of Mr. Rios' disciples?

606
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,095
Well, there's no point.

607
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,534
I mean, we can't threaten them
with anything more potent

608
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,230
than what they're already afraid of.

609
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,631
Afraid of falling short, as warriors, as men,

610
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,677
in the eyes of their hero.

611
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,077
All that's missing is
war paint and a bonfire.

612
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,843
The wild place inside every boy's heart.

613
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,017
You know, Jojo knows that...

614
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,755
Well, he knows that every
good hero needs a good story.

615
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,127
I need to call the INS.

616
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,226
JOJO: I was going out to see
a client about a booking.

617
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,328
- You're lucky you caught me.
- We're lucky that way.

618
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,964
Well, we won't be long.
It's about Frank Marino.

619
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,509
- What did you call him? Your apprentice?
- Yeah.

620
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,602
Frankie's a good kid. I
hope he's not in trouble.

621
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,702
Afraid so.

622
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,476
We think he's mixed up with
a ring of bicycle thieves.

623
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,811
That's hard to believe.

624
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,852
GOREN: Well, what's worse is that

625
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,213
when we were questioning
him, he did something,

626
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,418
well, inexplicable.

627
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,058
He took cyanide.

628
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,057
My God, that's...

629
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,489
He killed himself?

630
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,630
GOREN: Well, no.

631
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,359
He botched it.

632
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,168
He's still alive.

633
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,866
He's at Methodist Hospital.

634
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,375
We should be able to talk to him by tomorrow.

635
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,005
That's good. I'm glad he's gonna make it.

636
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,579
EAMES: He might not be so glad.

637
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,380
He's facing a couple murder charges

638
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,921
for Sami Iberra and his father, Enrique.

639
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,354
Yeah, he botched that, too.

640
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,292
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he wasn't
planning on Sami's father,

641
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,796
you know, running out of the
park with his throat slit.

642
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,098
Look, I'd be surprised if Frankie
had anything to do with that.

643
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,664
But then again, I don't really
know what he does on his own time.

644
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:39,174
Well, what he does is, I mean,
you know, besides heisting bikes

645
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,271
and killing people...

646
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,040
JOJO: On his own time.

647
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,546
- Do you mind?
- GOREN: Sorry.

648
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,082
JOJO: That's expensive equipment.

649
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,947
Sure, sure. So sorry.

650
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,949
What he does is he fills his mind

651
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:57,354
with some kind of, you
know, martial philosophy

652
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,330
about warriors and loyalty, accepting death.

653
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,898
That's what he talked about
on the way to the hospital.

654
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,935
You don't know anything about that?

655
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:10,496
No.

656
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,736
That's funny because we thought
that it came from you,

657
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,335
you know, along with the protein bars.

658
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,272
I mean, even if I did believe all that stuff,

659
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,076
these are hard-core street kids, you know?

660
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,553
I mean, they wouldn't listen to a guy like me.

661
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,989
Come on, you're being too modest.

662
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,253
These kids look up to you.

663
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,453
Where did you hear that from?

664
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,554
Bennie Renato. He thinks you're a hero.

665
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,461
That's crazy. You know, these are street kids.

666
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,060
They're running a con on you.

667
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,939
Well, no, I mean, Bennie,
he seemed very sincere.

668
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:51,446
Hey, he told us about your
perilous crossing from Cuba.

669
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,382
You know, your boat sank at
night. Everyone drowned.

670
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,086
I mean, except you.

671
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,557
That's right. I told him that. So what?

672
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,286
Why, because it's true, right?

673
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,620
Of course.

674
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,423
It was the Mariel boat lift.

675
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,227
It was when Castro emptied his jails.

676
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,891
You came over with your father.

677
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,294
Your father is a convicted rapist.

678
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,634
That's a lie.

679
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,641
Hey, not according to your INS file.

680
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,406
Your boat, well, it didn't sink.

681
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:31,114
And those people, nobody was lost at sea or...

682
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,182
The INS put your father
in a detention center.

683
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,818
They put you in a foster home

684
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,989
and then in a group home until you were 17.

685
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,793
Okay. Okay.

686
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,899
Sol made up a story.

687
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,905
Well, not just any story.

688
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,769
Well, it was, you know, a hero's story.

689
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,471
I mean, you know, the child
being plucked from the water.

690
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,104
That's Moses with a little
Jonah thrown in there.

691
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,848
And then the orphan who grows
up to be a great leader.

692
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:05,081
That's Marcus Aurelius.

693
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:07,886
You know what?

694
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

695
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,929
No? Marcus Aurelius. That warrior's creed?

696
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,168
That loyalty unto death stuff?

697
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,066
You taught them that.

698
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,130
No.

699
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,136
Look, I was new in the neighborhood.

700
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,736
I had to make nice with the locals,

701
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,509
so I let their kids hang out here. That's all.

702
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,244
Oh, that's good for PR, I guess.

703
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,307
I swear to God.

704
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,753
And if I told them stories, Boy
Scout crap, it was just talk.

705
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,757
All that stuff about loyalty was just talk?

706
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,520
Loyalty's fine as far as it goes,

707
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,721
but if Frankie and Bennie did something
illegal, that's not my responsibility.

708
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,697
And if they're telling you something
different, they're liars.

709
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:55,362
So, you gave them some attention

710
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,202
and a little advice and
sent them on their way.

711
00:39:58,263 --> 00:39:59,435
That's all I did.

712
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:04,207
And if they got into trouble, you know,
themselves, they were on their own.

713
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,748
I don't owe them a thing.

714
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,678
Not even loyalty?

715
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,510
Nothing.

716
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,120
All right, Mr. Rios, I think
we've wasted enough of your time

717
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,627
talking about these punks.

718
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,694
What are you doing?

719
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,203
Did you take that CD out of there?

720
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,569
- Hey man, the thing just popped out.
- Yeah, the hell it did.

721
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,172
You recorded me.

722
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,604
You son of a bitch recorded me.

723
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,705
What's the big deal? It's not like...

724
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,011
Now, you can't take that!

725
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,985
That's my property, now you give it to me.

726
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,086
What did you think you were
gonna do with this, huh?

727
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,887
I was gonna use it

728
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,458
to see if any of the kids had illusions
about how you felt about them.

729
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,004
I told you, those dumb kids

730
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,165
have got nothing to do with me.

731
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,674
I'm surprised at you, Jojo.

732
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,175
About what?

733
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:22,016
Well, I mean, a guy like you on the cutting
edge of sound recording technology,

734
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,684
you know, thinking that we would
resort to using a synthesizer

735
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,361
to bug your sound studio.

736
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,956
Especially when we have neat stuff like this.

737
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:34,526
An omni-directional microphone
and transmitter all in one.

738
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,869
You know, that broadcasts
theater-quality sound

739
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:41,206
through brick and soundproofing

740
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,712
up to 100 yards away.

741
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,486
You know, I can't believe you, Jojo.

742
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,587
You know, I'm so stupid.

743
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,092
What you think you heard,

744
00:41:58,483 --> 00:41:59,689
it was a trick.

745
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,560
Listen, I heard, all right?

746
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,058
So tell me, Jojo,

747
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,598
what do we do now?

748
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,370
To be true. What, do we be like Frankie?

749
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,705
Tell me, what do we do to stay true?

750
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:20,713
Yeah. I just want to tell them everything.

751
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:21,773
Don't you dare!

752
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,115
Jojo Rios, you're under arrest for murder.

753
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,587
No, no, no. Bennie, Bennie,
Bennie! Listen to me.

754
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,885
Listen to me! Listen.

755
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,453
Listen, you're not stupid, Bennie.

756
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,386
You're not stupid.

757
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,925
You're a strong kid. You're a true kid.

758
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,434
That book that you read about being a warrior,

759
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,329
that was good.

760
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:47,874
It's Jojo, man, he sent you
on a battle that wasn't good.

761
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,845
But you, you're true.

762
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,483
And you're strong.

763
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,081
You hear me?

764
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,200
I hope they find a better
role model for their kids.

765
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,163
They could do worse than Sami's father.
