In New York City's war on crime,

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,145
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,880
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,751
These are their stories.

She is not to know about this.

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,529
How much do you usually get?

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,632
Think of a number you're comfortable with.

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,228
Now double it.

9
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,770

Oh, God. She has no boundaries.

We make a good team, Kenneth.

You're fooling yourself. Nan will
make our life a living hell.

16
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,402
I'm sorry, Julie.

17
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,378
I really am.

He loves me, Mother. Is
that so hard to believe?

21
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,121
Your judgment is off.

22
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,216
Right.

23
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,694
I disagree with you, so I must be wrong.

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,658

00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,268

Is this a bad time?

30
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,910
Julie was just leaving.

31
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,246
She only wants what's best for you.

32
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,790
Dad, how can you take her side?

33
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,120
I'm not.

34
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:58,053
The last week, when the talk about
selling the hotel came up...

35
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,222
What?

36
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:00,759
She didn't...

37
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,064
She said she would discuss it with you.

38
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,298
She can't do this!

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,840
You can't let her upset you like this.

40
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,732
Come on, you've got everything going for you.

you're gorgeous.

Just like the ads say.

She drink and drown?

64
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,543
The body fights drowning.

65
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,241
The throat closes to keep the
water out. The victim suffocates.

66
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,917
Which means she should've surfaced.

67
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,550
Which she hasn't.

68
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,585
Lungs are filled with water
and her throat didn't close.

going by that nice smooth
look in all her photos.

73
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,472
Botox works by paralyzing

the nerves around the
facial muscles, doesn't it?

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,207
Does it look like I'd know?

I'm the house dick here.

I'm the one who called you.

83
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,468
The husband doesn't want
any insurance questions later.

84
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,972
For example?

85
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,303
She was suicidal?

86
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,135
She makes other people suicidal.

87
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,010
That include her husband?

He's in the study, about a
half a mile down that hallway.

90
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,146
Nan did not do this to herself.

91
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,748
She never would have given her
enemies the satisfaction.

92
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,815
She must've slipped or...

93
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,520
Or something.

94
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,190
The manager said you got home around 3:00.

95
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,462
Yes. Poker night at the Explorers.

96
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,931
Every week for 20 years.

97
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,504
So your wife was here by herself?

98
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,631
Yes.

99
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,232
What about your daughter?

100
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,540
Julie was with her fiancé, Kenneth Rayfield.

101
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,877
She's at his loft now. She's...

102
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,845
She's far too upset to do any good here.

103

Your wife have enemies?

104
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:19,951
When Nan's father died,
she took over the old dame.

105
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:22,958
It's been a battle.

106
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,590
With whom? Unions? The suppliers?

107
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,292
The competition.

108
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,369
She was determined to keep
the hotel in the family.

109
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,233
This belonged to Admiral Peary?

110
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,069
He took it to the pole.

111
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,671
Nan's father acquired it.

112
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,874
And you use it as a, you know, letter opener?

113
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,247
Your competitors, have they
made a play for the hotel?

114
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,415
There is talk that the Grimwalds
are about to make an offer

115
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,356
but you'll have to try Julie on that.

116
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,950
Can't we try you?

117
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,527
When the family trust was set up,

118
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:03,091
the hotel passed directly
to Nan and then to Julie.

119
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,158
I'm not part of that loop.

120
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,298
One last thing. Did your
wife get Botox injections?

121
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,237
A gentleman does not ask a
lady to reveal her secrets.

122
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,441
I saw Mom just before 8:00.

123
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,051
She was in a good mood.

124
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,685
EAMES: And then you went to your fiancé’s?

125
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,621
I'd just gotten back from the gym.

126
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,295
We ordered Chinese, watched a DVD.

127
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,153
A quiet night.

128
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,331
- It wasn't that quiet.
- Kenneth.

129
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,430
Your father told us that your mother

130
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,166
was gonna keep the hotel in the family.

131
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,707
That's right.

132
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,775
What are your plans?

133
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,236
I grew up in the Townson Hotel.

134
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,871
It's my home. I'm not selling it.

135
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,348
Maybe a competitor thought
they could change your mind.

136
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,482
The Grimwalds, for example.

137
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,917
If the offer was

138
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,350
generous enough?

139
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,520
What did the Algonquin sell
for last year, $30 million?

140
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,963
Forty. And it's hardly in the
same league as the Townson.

141
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,465
I'm an equity analyst at Mason Stone.

142
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,558
Oh.

143
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,628
JULIE: Helen Grimwald's always
had her eye on the Townson.

144
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,374
But she underestimates me,
like everyone else.

145
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,673
KENNETH: So Nan...

146
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,812
It wasn't an accident,
is that what you're inferring?

147
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,708
You mean implying. The listener infers.

148
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:31,984
And detectives speculate, since we
don't know the cause of death yet.

149
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,615
We'll be in touch.

150
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,222
We're so sorry for your loss,

151
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,924
especially now you're getting married.

152
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,329
We haven't set a date yet.

153
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,269
We just met three months ago
at a benefit and we...

154
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,933
Wow, three months. A whirlwind romance.

155
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,370
Well, we... We both just knew.

156
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,675
Well, you're lucky to have each other.

157
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,280
He knew when he got a look
at her mother's hotel.

158
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,054
The ME's got the tox screen results.

159
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,885
This holds 100 units of botulin.

160
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,794
It's good for four treatments.

161
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,891
Nan Turner had over 3,000
units in her system.

162
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,992
Would this fill a whole syringe?

163
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,504
Sure. It's freeze-dried.

164
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,131
Just add saline solution and find a vein.

165
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,603
What about these pinpricks on her forehead?

166
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,169
Oh, those would be from a regular
treatment, probably the day she died.

167
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,374
The lethal dose went into her jugular.

168
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,185
Now, she had sleeping pills, wine.

169
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,346
She was probably injected in her sleep.

170
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,118
Yeah, the botulin caused
a descending paralysis.

171
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,454
First she can't open her eyes,

172
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,255
then she can't speak, can't swallow.

173
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,852
And can't close her throat.

174
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,761
But she can still breathe.

175
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,928
GOREN: So the killer
dragged her to her bathtub,

176
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,334
pushed her under and her lungs
filled with water.

177
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,804
Death by Botox.

178
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,171
Live slow, die old, leave
a good-looking corpse.

179
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,369
Thanks to your friendly local dermatologist.

180
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,241
Oh, I checked with her doctors.

181
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,338
They never gave her Botox.

182
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,744
Well, there's always the hotel beauty salon.

183
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,981
I'm not licensed to dispense Botox.

184
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,083
Yeah, we've found that a lot of people

185
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,890
do things that they're not licensed to do.

186
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,227
Especially if their landlord insists.

187
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,994
My salon never treated her.

188
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,464
Not only does he remove
hairs, but he splits them.

189
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,568
Your cosmeticians,

190
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,905
technically, they're independent
contractors, right?

191
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,973
Yes.

192
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,149
If you had to pick one?

193
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,085
Jason. He's got a following.

194
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,056
House calls, parties.

195
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,961
Julie, I want you to think.

196
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,793
Imagine the worst thing
that Kenneth could do,

197
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,993
and then ask yourself,
would you still love him?

198
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,561
What's done is done.

199
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,039
What matters is, would you still love him?

200
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,743
Would you?

201
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,884
Then do whatever needs to be done.

202
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,348
NINA: He's incredible.

203
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,723
Isn't Jason the perfect
little miracle-worker?

204
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,420
He has quite a following.

205
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,486
Are these to-dos always so crowded?

206
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,295
No. Half of us were here last Wednesday.

207
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,804
(GASPING)
My dear, I would kill to have your skin.

208
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,599
Laser abrasion, am I right?

209
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,698
No.

210
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,404
If you just saw Jason, why would
you need another treatment?

211
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,211
Because Wednesday he showed up empty-handed.

212
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,271
- Oxygen facial?
- No.

213
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,544
So what happened?

214
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,984
He left his whole supply in a cab.

215
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,421
I know. You had a lymphatic drain facial.

216
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,355
Sorry, just soap and water.

217
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,894
Now serving number 10.

218
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,788
I'll be done in a jiff.

219
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,626
Aren't we eager?

220
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,606
I couldn't take the risk you'd
run out like last Wednesday.

221
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,335
(SIGHING)
What a nightmare!

222
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,707
I'm surprised it didn't
make the evening news.

223
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,370
There's still a chance.

224
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,815
Jason here ran out of Botox
the night Nan Turner died.

225
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,182
What is going on here?

226
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,189
A murder investigation.

227
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,825
The Baronet, isn't that a Grimwald hotel?

228
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,190
Yeah, what isn't?

229
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,162
I gave a party in one of their suites.

230
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,363
The Vam Dam, another Grimwald hotel.

231
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,426
Boy, you are just in too cozy

232
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,302
with the Grimwalds for your own good.

233
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,014
He left those vials in a cab.

234
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,777
How often do you need to hear it?

235
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,616
Helen Grimwald was your regular customer.

236
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,782
I mean, you saw her the Monday
before you saw Nan Turner.

237
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,127
GOREN: (STAMMERING) Come on.
It's written right there in ink.

238
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,294
Did she know that Nan was your client?

239
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,493
He's not gonna answer that.

240
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,536
He's gonna want to say something.

241
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,267
He's already on the hook for nine counts
of dispensing a controlled substance.

242
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,208
It's just Botox, for God's sake.

243
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,843
Just Botox?

244
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,945
You mean anyone could do it?

245
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,778
Even me?

246
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,317
This stuff was derived

247
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,117
from something developed
for germ warfare in the '50s.

248
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,886
A jury might not think it's so harmless.

249
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,422
Especially when they find out Nan died

250
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,589
after having 30 vials of it
jammed into her neck.

251
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,098
I, look... I...

252
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:46,033
I lugged those vials around all day in this.

253
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:50,172
First in the fridge at the
Townson's beauty salon.

254
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,574
Then I had some sessions at the
Baronet. I stored them in their spa.

255
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:57,513
After that, the Plaza.
Well, you get the idea.

256
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,943
The idea being that the vials
could've been stolen

257
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,045
at any point.

258
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,220
Yes. Not that I'm pointing fingers,

259
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,820
but Helen Grimwald knew that
Nan was a client of mine.

260
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,265
She was always asking me
about Nan's health.

261
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,560
It was morbid.

262
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,659
She thought as soon as Nan kicked,
she could grab up the hotel?

263
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,171
Yeah, I tried to tell her
Julie Turner would never sell.

264
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,396
Julie lived to renovate.

265
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:28,645
But Helen said that she had a little
bird who told her to be patient.

266
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,845
A little bird.

267
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,475
JASON: Yes.

268
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:37,786
Apparently the same one who saved her a
lot of money when she bought the Baronet.

269
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,851
Okay, thank you.

270
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,722
3 years ago, when the Grimwalds
bought the Baronet,

271
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,855
they got a bridge loan
through Mason Stone.

272
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,166
Kenneth Rayfield's firm.

273
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,397
Yeah, that's Helen Grimwald's little bird.

274
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,597
Once the old lady's out of the way,

275
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,300
he'd sweet-talk the daughter
into selling the hotel.

276
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,674
And he gets a commission from the
Grimwalds and a $40 million dowry.

277
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:05,648
Except that he killed Nan
before marrying the daughter

278
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,185
and locking in the profits.

279
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,352
Nan was in bad health.

280
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,880
He could've let nature take its course.

281
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,190
Something forced his hand.

282
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,624
Kenneth?

283
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,392
Julie adores him.

284
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,399
You trust her judgment?

285
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,604
Three months, they're already engaged?

286
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,496
Julie's had some bad luck in the past.

287
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,737
She's been divorced?

288
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,609
No, she was engaged about three years ago.

289
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,372
Came to her senses just in time.

290
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,714
Was this guy also in the real estate field?

291
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,947
Junker? He played the field,
he didn't have one.

292
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,586
How'd you find out?

293
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:49,252
We found out because Nan
did her due diligence.

294
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,160
You didn't tell Julie?

295
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,930
With Julie, if you push one way,

296
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,660
she tends to go the other way.

297
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,202
We felt it better to let her...

298
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,670
Come to her senses? You know...

299
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,105
There's a check stub missing.
it's been ripped out.

300
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,805
And the checks before and after were written

301
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,575
the day of your wife's murder.

302
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,206
It's check 768.

303
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,081
Do you know anything about it?

304
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,612
The trust account was strictly Nan's domain.

305
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,484
PRESCOTT: It's been over a week.

306
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,723
That check should have cleared by now.

307
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:30,791
The day the check was written, were there
any other transfers into the account?

308
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,866
Mrs. Turner transferred $100,000.

309
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,066
Did I say something amusing?

310
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,508
Not yet. Could you look up a check?

311
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,011
A three-year-old check?

312
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,110
The name of the payee?

313
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,950
Well, we only have the first name.

314
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,714
Junker, with a J.

315
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,688
Just be happy his name isn't Messerschmitt.

316
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,757
There.

317
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,156
Junker Dalton.

318
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,167
$30,000 for traveling expenses.

319
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,968
As in, "Hit the road, Junker."

320
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,030
Nan's MO.

321
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,203
She pays Julie's fiancée to go away.

322
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,769
Ken didn't go.

323
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,013
Why take the consolation prize

324
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,744
when you can stay in the game
and marry $40 million?

325
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,914
So Kenneth killed Nan
and Julie's covering for him.

326
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,024
My father told me all about your suspicions.

327
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,084
You're desperate.

328
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,892
You don't care whose life you destroy.

329
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,899
We care who destroyed your mother's.

330
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,601
When Ken came over that day she
died, it was around lunchtime?

331
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,640
People saw him in the lobby.

332
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,536
Yes, he was here to have lunch with me.

333
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,635
Oh, good, because the people who saw him

334
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,338
weren't sure what day it was.

335
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,008
Oh, is that how it's going to be?
We're going to play tricks?

336
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,642
Well, like you said, we're desperate.

337
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,586
Anyway, so the two of you met in
the loft. That was around 8:00?

338
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,287
- He just came back from the gym,
he took a shower?
- JULIE: Yes.

339
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,417
- Yes?
- No.

340
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,824
- No? What?
- He showered at the gym.

341
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,453
EAMES: Take your time.

342
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,054
And then you ordered in
Chinese from Maple Duck?

343
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,565
Yes. Did we tell you?

344
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,932
We got it off his credit card bill.

345
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,471
You see, we did a little snooping.

346
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,803
The restaurant told us this...

347
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,137
(SNICKERING)
Look at this...

348
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,810
That the order was made just after 10:00.

349
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:27,980
Well, as Ken alluded crudely,
we were preoccupied.

350
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,576
GOREN: Oh, yeah, well...
Oh, that's right.

351
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,555
You took a tumble between 8:00 and 10:00.

352
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,957
The restaurant also told us the
order was picked up in person.

353
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,455
Well, they're confused.

354
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,121
Ken was with me the whole evening.

355
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,358
Then we're confused,

356
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,924
because his gym said he scanned
himself in just after 9:00.

357
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,403
Oh, someone must have stolen
his membership card.

358
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,838
Next you're gonna tell me
someone stole his cell phone

359
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,568
and called you at quarter to ten.

360
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,845
No, I used his cell phone.

361
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,107
I misplaced mine in his loft, so I called it,

362
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,739
so it would ring, so I could find it.

363
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,944
You're turning every little innocent
thing into evidence of nothing.

364
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,749
While you waited for Ken at his loft,

365
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,552
Ken killed your mother and then ran
around establishing his alibi.

366
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,787
'Cause he was afraid that
you wouldn't lie for him.

367
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,228
JULIE: I'm not lying. Ken
wouldn't hurt my mother.

368
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,060
You're into homeopathy.

369
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:23,202
There's Lycopodium, Iris, Satrum.

370
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,499
Leave my things alone.

371
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,406
Well, they're expired, anyway.
You don't use them?

372
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,411
No. Just put them down.

373
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,573
You know, your mother was right.

374
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,412
You have no judgment when it comes to men.

375
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,679
- How would you know what my mother...
- Your last fiancé...

376
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,984
- What was his name?
- Junker. She paid him $30 grand to get lost.

377
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,355
How would you know about... That was a loan.

378
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,792
- She knew...
- A con when she saw one.

379
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,261
Is that why she wrote
Ken a check for $100,000?

380
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,992
Ken ripped up that check.
Doesn't that tell you something?

381
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,467
Well, what's one check when
you can marry the checkbook?

382
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,094
How dare you!

383
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,198
Ken loves me! Is that so hard to believe?

384
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,599
He understands me! He loves me!

385
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,314
We're sorry.

386
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,575
We'll show ourselves out.

387
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,950
She's not covering for him.
He's covering for her.

388
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,524
JASON: I never gave her treatments.

389
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,895
Julie's an attractive young woman.

390
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,593
She doesn't need Botox.

391
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,101
I saw Julie's homeopathic stash.

392
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,037
All the treatments for migraines.

393
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,306
And the heavy curtains in her suite,

394
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,149
to block out the light.

395
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,044
She suffered from migraines.

396
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,815
I wouldn't know.

397
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,888
EAMES: We checked with the hotel pharmacy.

398
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:50,155
It's been four months since she
refilled her migraine prescriptions.

399
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,191
She found something better, didn't she?

400
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,962
She found Botox.

401
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,095
EAMES: We heard for some
people, it works miracles.

402
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:06,540
That day that Nan died, Julie came to you.

403
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,877
She said she had a bad one

404
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,278
and you just wanted to help her.

405
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,887
She said they hurt so bad that they
make people want to kill themselves.

406
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,788
GOREN: She asked to buy your whole supply?

407
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,891
EAMES: She threatened to make trouble for you?

408
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,261
I just wanted to help her.

409
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:31,056
And then later, I realized...

410
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,738
You helped her commit murder.

411
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,740
GOREN: The happy couple.

412
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,406
We brought you new engagement rings.

413
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,882
Julie Turner, you're under arrest for murder.

414
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,612
You're gonna have to come with us, too.

415
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,654
Ken, don't leave me.

416
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,711
It's nice being loved so much.

417
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,552
Ken!

418
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,990
I just told Helen Grimwald Nan had concerns

419
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,831
about Julie's ability to run the hotel.

420
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,802
Nan might've been enticed to sell it

421
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,932
before Julie could run it into the ground?

422
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,134
Yes.

423
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,871
Did Julie know what her mother was thinking?

424
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,108
I don't know.

425
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,207
We talked about other things.

426
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,650
Like about the $100,000 check?

427
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,547
Julie told us about that.

428
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,449
Not one of my finest moments. I acted rashly.

429
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,393
Ripping up the check was a noble gesture.

430
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,899
I mean, giving Julie back
the engagement ring.

431
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,937
But Nan would've made our life a living hell.

432
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,764
Julie didn't tell you?

433
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,971
EAMES: Let's see if we have this straight.

434
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,568
Her mother was planning to sell
the hotel out from under her

435
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,080
and she drove her fiancé away.

436
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,946
Did we miss anything?

437
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,747
I know what you're implying.

438
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,414
But Julie is just not capable
of hurting her mother.

439
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,993
So, again,

440
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,955
what time did Julie show up at your loft?

441
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,334
And this is an answer that you
wanna give a lot of thought to.

442
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,643
I... I called her just after I left the gym.

443
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,076
She was out walking.

444
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,047
I told her to meet me at my place.

445
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,344
She...

446
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,348
She got there just after 10:00.

447
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,420
Sounds like the right answer.
Whose idea was it to lie?

448
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,419
Julie was afraid she'd be accused.

449
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,826
I... Now, I told her that was ridiculous.

450
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,330
But she was so upset. She...

451
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,732
I said, "We should just say
that we were together."

452
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,367
I knew she'd never have hurt Nan.

453
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,236
I bought enough for one headache, okay?

454
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:58,643
I was under a lot of stress with the
wedding preparations and the redecorating.

455
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,014
Redecorating your mother allowed you to do

456
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,111
while she was making provisions
to sell the hotel?

457
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,211
Just a rumor.

458
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,985
- My mother had complete faith in me.
- Your mother...

459
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,623
I…

460
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,133
No. No, it's too easy.

461
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,002
Why? What's too easy?

462
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,938
To get you to go on about your mother.

463
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,411
You should wait for your lawyer.

464
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,538
I don't need a lawyer to tell the truth.

465
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:34,482
No, you need a lawyer
because it's hard for you

466
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,919
to know what the truth is.

467
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,152
It's not your fault.

468
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,953
I mean, how could you,
with a mother like Nan?

469
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,290
Don't patronize me. I've had enough of that.

470
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,522
Hey, I'm trying to let you know

471
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,064
that there's a lot of sympathy
for you in this room.

472
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,764
You had a parent that lied to you.

473
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,399
Undermined you.

474
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,441
Questioned your judgment to the point where

475
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:02,008
you didn't even trust it yourself.

476
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,147
She didn't want you to be happy.

477
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,942
I did not hate my mother.

478
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,449
I did not kill her.

479
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,119
I was with Kenneth.

480
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,679
That's not true.

481
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,524
Ken told us.

482
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,992
Julie, we can see that you're
not a cold-blooded killer.

483
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,123
You were provoked.

484
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,931
I didn't kill her.

485
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,601
And she drove Kenneth away.

486
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,210
Kenneth told us that he
broke off the engagement.

487
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,041
That was just a test.

488
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,581
She wanted to see if he'd take the money.

489
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:42,850
A test? Like the $30,000 she loaned Junker?

490
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,981
No, she was right about him.

491
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,956
That he took the money?

492
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,054
That and he was cheating on me.

493
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,062
According to Nan.

494
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,394
She showed me pictures, okay?

495
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,996
So if she had anything on Kenneth,

496
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,060
she would've shown it to me.

497
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,406
So it was just a test. And he passed.

498
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,475
Then she realized I was right.

499
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,602
She realized he loves me.

500
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,446
This is Mr. Edwards, her family lawyer.

501
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,075
Your father's just outside, Julie.

502
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,813
He doesn't want you to say another word.

503
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,821
Until we get a criminal attorney,

504
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,517
she's reasserting her right to remain silent.

505
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,891
What do you mean, we can't post bail?

506
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,725
Most of the money is in the family trust.

507
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,526
Normally, Julie would have access to it,

508
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,999
but since she's charged with killing Nan...

509
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,060
There's gotta be something
I can use for collateral?

510
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,538
There's not enough that's yours to pledge.

511
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,199
There's gotta be something we can do.

512
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,642
Well, if she were to assign you

513
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,113
power of attorney over the
trust, temporarily...

514
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,244
Well...

515
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,479
(STAMMERING)
I don't want it to appear as though

516
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,215
I'm losing faith in her.

517
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,814
Perhaps you can bring it up with
her, from a legal standpoint.

518
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,257
Well, that's your call, William.

519
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,419
Yes.

520
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,588
Now, as far as a defense attorney,

521
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,289
I want the best you can get.

522
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,900
She can't tell us what it is
or what it isn't,

523
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,869
what she should tell us, what she shouldn't.

524
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,405
She's a pathological liar.

525
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,338
Whatever story works,
that's the one she goes with.

526
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,898
Whatever works for her.

527
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,036
She's not lying to us,
she's lying to herself.

528
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,977
Are you hoping the truth is in these boxes?

529
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,515
We're looking for the evidence
Nan had against Kenneth.

530
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,745
What makes you think she had anything
more than a mother's instinct?

531
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,883
Well, her husband said
she did her due diligence.

532
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,221
Last time, that meant
photos of Julie's fiancé.

533
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,894
The evidence against Julie lays
out in a nice, straight line.

534
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,557
Juries like straight lines.

535
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,001
Whatever Nan had, it's not here.

536
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,938
And there's no evidence
she hired an investigator now,

537
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,909
or three years ago to take photos of Junker.

538
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,309
Well, maybe she kept it in-house.

539
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,009
So, what's your thinking on this murder?

540
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,312
They're trying to find out
who Mrs. Turner hired

541
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,821
to take the snapshots of that...

542
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,016
What's his name? Junker.

543
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,820
And the Captain thinks it was you.

544
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,452
Well, you want a job done right, hire a pro.

545
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,855
What can I tell you? Legwork 101.

(MEN LAUGHING)

547
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,836
So when it was Kenneth's turn,
she came to you?

548
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,268
You would've thought.

549
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,829
I even offered but Mrs. Turner said no.

550
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,069
Why do you think?

551
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,342
Mrs. Turner didn't want another incident.

552
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,314
You mean, with Julie?

553
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,082
She was violent?

554
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,211
COOPER: Yeah.

555
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,591
She attacked her mother?

556
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,954
Well, they had this huge argument

557
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,462
when Mrs. Turner showed her the pictures.

558
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,589
I thought it was over.

559
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,567
But that night, they're on their
way out to go to some dinner,

560
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,036
and Julie hauled off and punched her.

561
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,762
Nearly broke her jaw.

562
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,132
So this time,

563
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:55,804
Mrs. Turner wanted to be more
supportive of her daughter.

564
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,576
She even took her to Florida the weekend
before she died. Just the two of them.

565
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,640
Come back happy as pismo clams.

00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,253
I don't think Julie did it.

568

We'll pass that on to the DA.
Thanks for coming in.

569
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,764
Yeah, one last thing.

570
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,660
This punch-out over the photos,

571
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,330
did Kenneth know about it?

572
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,203
Yeah, he asked me about it once.

573
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,098
He found it amusing.

574
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,244
Well, you know where to find me.

575
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,311
Kenneth told us he didn't think Julie
was capable of hurting her mother.

576
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,513
Gee, you think he was lying?

577
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,250
He knew she could be provoked.

578
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,252
With rumors of Nan selling the hotel,

579
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,256
with Nan paying off another fiancé,

580
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,392
he got her to do his dirty work for him.

581

If she gets caught, his hands are clean.

582
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,798
So much for nice straight lines.

583
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,138
I gladly posted bail today.

Anyone who knows my daughter, knows she could
not possibly have committed this crime.

No comment, please.

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,253
I just wanna say how much I miss
my mom. I loved her very much.

WOMAN: Do you have any other comments?

589
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,262
It may amuse you to know

590
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,629
her lawyer's already putting out
feelers for a plea bargain.

591
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,634
I'm inclined to accept.

592
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,465
Even if someone put her up to it?

593
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,001
That doesn't lessen her culpability.

594
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,439
Who is this someone?

595
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,943
Her fiancé.

596
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,705
He created a circumstance

597
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,279
which he knew in the past had
caused her to attack her mother.

598
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,015
If her fiancé were trying to control
her, wouldn't she lash out at him?

599
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,785
Not if he made her believe
Nan was pulling the strings.

600
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,060
If you take Julie's plea,

601
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,859
if you put the weight of this
murder on her shoulders alone,

602
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,768
we lose our leverage
against any other suspect.

603
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:01,031
I'll hold off responding to their plea offer.

604
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,568
But sooner or later, I will
take the bird in hand.

605
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,344
Kenneth, he knew

606
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,275
that if he could trick Nan

607
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,679
into paying him off,

608
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,013
Julie would snap.

609
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,023
And the way to trick Nan

610
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,858
was to let her find out about
his, you know, bad behavior.

611
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,858
Nan and Julie spent the weekend in Florida.

612
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,128
She wrote the check when she came back.

613
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,302
Kenneth was in the city alone.

614
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,237
Whatever he did to set Nan off,

615
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,407
good chance he did it that weekend.

616
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,078
At this point, I don't think
we should count on Kenneth.

617
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,116
But who else can testify for me?

618
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,412
Well, that's why I approached Mr. Carver.

619
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,350
About a plea bargain? Absolutely not.

620
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,151
Will, consider manslaughter.

621
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,690
If Julie said she had help from...

622
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,850
Well, from Kenneth, for example.

623
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,086
I would never hurt Kenneth, ever.

624
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,857
My daughter doesn't have
to perjure herself to win.

626
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,997
we'll find someone who isn't.

of him and his date, like a surprise.

So, I do.

645
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,921
What did his date look like?

646
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,225
They were kissing. I see
only the back of his head.

647
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,924
He was wearing a baseball hat.

648
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,962
- His head? The date was a man?
- Yes.

649
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,671
Did he buy the photo?

650
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,367
This guy buy it right away. Okay?

651
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:23,173
Kenneth outed himself.

652
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,715
He sent the photo to Nan anonymously.

653
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,341
He knew that it would
get her to pay him off.

654
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,714
Why didn't Nan just tell Julie?

655
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,879
She had proof, in living color.

656
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,451
No. If she did, Julie
would've dumped him herself.

657
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,087
Kenneth's plan wouldn't have worked.

658
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:43,093
He had to make Nan appear unreasonable.

659
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,724
He had to make absolutely sure

660
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,928
that Nan would never show Julie the photo.

00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,182
I told Mr. Behrens I'm not
interested in a plea bargain.

years ago, and Kenneth knew it.

That's...

674
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,602
I was a different person then.

675
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,075
Anyway, Kenneth didn't know.

GOREN: He knew.

677
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,110
He talked to your house detective.

This is Mr. Cooper's statement.

While you and your mother were in Florida,

680
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,384
Kenneth went to a nightclub.

00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:48,763
This is a photo of his
reservation. You see his name here?

While he was there,

684
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,273
he had a photo taken of himself.

00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:03,002
A compromising photo which
he sent to Nan anonymously.

686
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,181
This is the statement from
the hostess at the club.

687
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,384
And this is the statement of the girl

688
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,944
who took the photo.

689
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,753
Please. Kenneth kissing another man?

690
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,386
Believe me, if my mother had that photo,

691
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,656
she would've shown it to me.

692
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,026
Even if it meant hurting you?

693
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,463
I've gotten over worse.

694
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,360
Kenneth didn't want you to get over this.

695
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,364
And there's a reason why your
mother didn't show you the photo.

696
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,908
Because she did love you.

697
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,370
She was afraid it would destroy you.

698
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,545
We found out Kenneth served
on a tourism board last year.

699
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,781
Did you know that?

700
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:46,914
No.

701
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,187
Your father was on the same board.

702
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,285
Did he mention meeting Ken?

703
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,054
No. He was only on it for a few months.

704
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,067
What does this have to do with anything?

705
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:01,866
That benefit where you met Kenneth,
how did you happen to go?

706
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,935
My father bought me a ticket.

707
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,442
He thought I should get
involved in good works.

708
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,080
Your father has your best interest
at heart? He gives you good advice?

709
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,209
Yes, he does.

710
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,253
He's always there for you.

711
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,050
He was standing next to you
on the courthouse steps.

712
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,146
Yes.

713
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:25,854
He probably asked you not
to take the plea bargain.

714
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,028
That a trial would vindicate you?

715
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,995
Yes, he did. He believes in me.

716
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,695
What are you getting at?

717
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,001
We noticed, from the trust accounts,

718
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,702
your mother paid your father
a monthly allowance.

719
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,839
I don't know. That was between them.

720
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,472
Who signs those allowance checks now?

721
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,779
Well, because of this nonsense...

722
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,614
You signed power of attorney
over to your father?

723
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,727
If you go to prison,
what'll happen to the hotel?

724
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,323
- I'm not going to prison.
- If you do,

725
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,697
who will control the hotel? Your father?

726
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,265
Yes.

727
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,969
Because he has power of
attorney, he could sell it.

728
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,841
- He wouldn't.
- But he could

729
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,506
and there would be no one to stop him.

730
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,945
No. No, my father did not do this to me.

731
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,352
Don't get upset and just sit and listen.

732
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,857
Your father knew your temper.

733
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,989
He knew what buttons to push.

734
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,967
He used Ken to provoke you.

735
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,834
I'm not listening to any more of this!

736
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,896
- BEHRENS: Julie.
- Let her go. Go ahead, Julie, run.

737
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,100
Just run.

738
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,506
(CRYING)

739
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,778
You push her one way, she goes the other.

740
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,843
Those are the exact words
your father said to us.

741
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,687
Imagine the insight that he gave Kenneth.

742
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,821
No wonder Ken understood you.

743
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,431
Oh, this can't be true.

744
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,459
My father loves me.

745
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,435
GOREN: Your mother loved you.

746
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,938
She didn't show you the photo,

747
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,907
she couldn't show you the photo,

748
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,966
because the other man kissing Ken

749
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,138
wasn't just any other man.

750
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,048
No. No, my... My father's not gay.

751
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,313
This is a monstrous lie.

752
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,858
Julie, come on, you've known it all along.

753
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,095
Even as a kid,

754
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,563
this image that your parents
presented to you,

755
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,029
of a happy marriage,

756
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,436
and what you saw with your eyes

757
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,700
was out of sync with what you felt.

758
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:56,709
Oh, God. What's happening?
What's happening to me?

759
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,113
Look, in my own life,

760
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,151
I know what it's like to have your
judgment, your sense of security,

761
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,348
undermined by your parents.

762
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,357
Because they were hiding a truth

763
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,992
or denying it to themselves.

764
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,196
You can survive that.

765
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,339
My client's ready to admit her
guilt in her mother's murder,

766
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:35,043
but obviously, her father's involvement
has changed her situation.

767
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,347
As I said, we're willing
to consider mitigation.

768
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,321
But we still have to make
a case against Mr. Turner.

769
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,857
Do you have a plan?

770
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,256
We've discussed one.

771
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,557
We found a clause in your
mother's trust agreement.

772
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,426
You need my help?

773
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,399
Well, only if you're up to it.

774
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,239
Julie!

775
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:06,874
Julie, if I'd known you were waiting
for me, I would've come home sooner.

776
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,679
How are you, honey?

777
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,347
I have news, Daddy. Good news.

778
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,549
Great. Would you like a drink?

779
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,593
No. I'm going back on the wagon.

780
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,754
Well, now that is great news.

781
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,696
How'd it go with the district attorney?

782
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,729
Have they come to their senses yet?

783
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,861
Not yet, but Daddy, the good news.

784
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,200
There's a miracle.

785
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,940
After the meeting, I went to the doctor's.

786
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,133
I'm pregnant.

787
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,471
Does anyone else know this?

788
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,882
I just talked to Kenneth.
Daddy, he was so happy, he cried.

789
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,921
- And then we decided...
- Decided what?

790
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:47,456
In the morning, we're going
to City Hall to get married.

791
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:51,016
Oh, no. Oh, no. You can't rush this.

792
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,251
You've got a trial.

793
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,059
Kenneth doesn't want to wait.

794
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,897
I'm sure he doesn't.

795
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,662
Julie,

796
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,238
did you ever show the family
trust papers to Kenneth?

797
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,535
Maybe once, why?

798
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,435
GOREN: That's it, reel him in.

799
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,274
TURNER: Because there's a clause in the trust

800
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,815
that says that, if in any case

801
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,443
that you can't administer the trust,

802
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,488
say you died, or went to prison,

803
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,986
it would pass to your child,

804
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,423
or your child's guardian.

805
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,654
That will be Kenneth if you marry him.

806
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,958
Well, I'm sure Kenneth would
take good care of things.

807
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,293
No, no, no, no.

808
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,459
Kenneth is not the kind of
man you think he is.

809
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,092
What do you mean? I thought you liked him.

810
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,229
(STAMMERING)
I do. But you can't marry him.

811
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,009
I swore to your mother
I would never tell you this.

812
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,410
She was convinced you wouldn't
be able to handle it.

813
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,206
Handle what?

814
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,218
Your mother received a photograph of Kenneth

815
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,483
in a compromising situation.

816
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,293
He's the father of my child now.

817
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,324
I think I can forgive him an indiscretion.

818
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:02,888
Not this one.

819
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,760
He was with another man.

820
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,330
Got him.

821
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:11,162
Daddy, why didn't you tell me?

822
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,106
You seemed so happy.

823
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,575
You'd let me live a lie?

824
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,908
- I thought that...
- Whoa, whoa, where's she going?

825
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,470
...if you found out about
his preference later,

826
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,140
- Where's she going? ...
- you'd learn to live with it.

827
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,515
Is that what mother did?
Learn to live with it?

828
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,445
TURNER: What are you talking about?

829
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:30,186
No. no. We gotta get in there.
We gotta get in there!

830
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,329
JULIE: You never had anything for me.
Ever. You never loved me.

831
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,957
Mom did, but you didn't.

832
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,160
TURNER: Julie.

833
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,807
You bastard! How could you do this to me?

834
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,637
Our whole life was a lie!

835
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,699
I was just a child.

836
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,002
Mom loved me!

837
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,080
Hey, if anyone deserved it...

838
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,743
She wasn't ready.

839
00:42:56,808 --> 00:43:00,085
- Detective...
- No, no, no, I know that anger.

840
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,520
I should've seen it coming.

841
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,357
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
