1
00:00:00,652 --> 00:00:02,639
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,190
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,446
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:11,053
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,031
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,069
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,465
Hey, kid!
Stop!

8
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:21,675
Hey.

9
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:23,749
I said, stop!

10
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:25,790
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,661
Nothing.
I'm just trying to help.

12
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,139
Did that man hurt you?

13
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:37,114
No visible injuries on the kid.
Blood's not his.

14
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:39,549
Voucher the cloth.
We'll run DNA.

15
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,536
Hi, how you doing?
My name is Elliot. What's yours?

16
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:43,794
Tommy.

17
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,789
Hi, Tommy.
What's your last name?

18
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,205
Hey, what's your mom's name?

19
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:52,033
Mommy.

20
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:55,768
Okay, I'll tell you what, buddy.
We're gonna get you home, okay?

21
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:57,914
I want my daddy!

22
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:02,495
Okay, we're gonna find him.

23
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:07,046
We're gonna find him.

24
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:58,521
Tommy is been like that for an hour.
He will not let go.

25
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:01,679
The whole time at the hospital
he screamed if Elliot tried to put him down.

26
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:03,135
- He checks out okay?
- Medically,

27
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:06,826
but there's no telling what he's been 
through until we find his family.

28
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,837
Fin, anything from missing persons?

29
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,731
No kids Tommy's age
are missing in the tri-state.

30
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,965
Patrol's going door to door,

31
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,643
but there's over 600 apartments
on the block where we found him.

32
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:17,134
We'll have them keep canvassing.

33
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:19,033
A three-year-old can't get too far 
without somebody

34
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,518
in the neighborhood recognizing him.

35
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:22,039
Unless he doesn't live there.

36
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,028
from somewhere else

37
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,722
and dropped him off 
on the upper west side.

38
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:28,132
Or somebody killed the parents
and didn't want to hurt the kid

39
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:31,156
so they dropped him as far away 
from the crime scene as possible.

40
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,476
That kid could be from anywhere.

41
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:35,223
I'll call a buddy from channel 10,

42
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,683
see if we can't get his photo on the air.

43
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:39,231
Well we can have him 
do a live story and really milk it.

44
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,110
Think it'll traumatize the kid?

45
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,225
Not if Elliot keeps holding him.

46
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,753
If you recognize Tommy,
please call the NYPD tip line

47
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:48,673
at the number on your screen.

48
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:50,070
This little boy needs his family.

49
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,733
You couldn't be more right, Detective.
And I hope one of our viewers can help.

50
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:58,447
We will keep you up to date on Tommy,
the boy with no last name.

51
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:01,764
From Manhattan SVU, 
I'm Jackie Judd.

52
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:06,027
Cragen wants us to drop Tommy at ACS
and start running down leads.

53
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,602
I think the kid's gonna freak 
if I leave him.

54
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:09,216
Well, we can't take him with us.

55
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:11,248
Well, have Fin and Lake help you out.

56
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:12,726
I'll stay here and man the phones.

57
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,118
Oh, Elliot, he's so exhausted.
He needs to rest.

58
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:16,886
Not to mention a bath and fresh clothes.

59
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,607
I'll take care of that.

60
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,912
STABLER RESIDENCE 
72-12 CASTLESIDE STREET
GLENOAKS QUEENS, NY
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15

61
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,033
It's been a long time
since we did this, huh?

62
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,942
15 years.

63
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,679
You ready to do it all over again?

64
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:33,890
Still think it's a girl?

65
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:37,150
I haven't been wrong yet.

66
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,625
That's true.

67
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,776
But you really want a boy.

68
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,971
I want it healthy.

69
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:45,438
Just want a healthy baby.

70
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,511
Tell the truth.

71
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,394
Well, the little guy is cute.
I mean, you got to admit that.

72
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:54,567
We can't keep him.

73
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,610
I know.

74
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:59,538
He's such a good boy.

75
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:01,975
But I can't seem to keep him 
in the house.

76
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,173
- There he is.
- Oh, Tommy!

77
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:07,093
There he is.
Come to mama.

78
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:08,753
- Ma'am, please.
- Tommy, Tommy!

79
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:10,434
- It's me, Tommy.
- Come on, ma'am.

80
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,521
- Sweetie, what's wrong?
- Can you get her out of here?

81
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,430
- Don't you know your own mother?
- Let's go.

82
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,566
You have to go now.

83
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:17,474
She sounded legit on the phone.
I didn't know she was from planet zero.

84
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:18,879
Right, anybody more local?

85
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,466
Desk sergeant's setting up another one.

86
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,400
All right, well, uh...

87
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:25,620
He's not gonna be part of it.
We're gonna be in here.

88
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:31,004
Is Tommy here?

89
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,228
Where's my son?

90
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,941
Sir, calm down.
I'm Detective Benson.

91
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,775
Can you tell me your name?

92
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,341
I'm Jake Keegan.
I'm Tommy's father.

93
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:39,086
And why didn't you report him missing?

94
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,305
I thought he was at home.
My cousin said he saw him on the news...

95
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:42,921
Where is Tommy?
Why can't I see him?

96
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:46,103
Sir, can you just give me one minute?
You're welcome to sit down here.

97
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,856
Elliot, check out the possible with me.

98
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:53,593
You got it.

99
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,402
Hey, Tommy.

100
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:57,881
I want you to jump on to that table.
Okay? Go.

101
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:02,332
Hey, look out the window.
You recognize anybody?

102
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:06,251
Daddy.
You found him.

103
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,830
Daddy!

104
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,495
Tommy, hey!

105
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:11,714
How'd you go three blocks
without anybody seeing you?

106
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:12,901
I don't know how he got the door open.

107
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,894
Sir, have you tried to get
in contact with your wife?

108
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,994
Yeah, I called Leah at home,
left a message on her cell.

109
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,823
She didn't answer.

110
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,195
Did something happen?

111
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,535
When we found your son
he had blood on his clothes.

112
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,749
Oh, God.
I gotta go home.

113
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:26,638
Okay, we'll go with you.

114
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:29,632
And your son, he should stay here.
We got a room he can play in.

115
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,215
Okay.

116
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:33,659
Leah must've left the door unlocked.

117
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,221
That explains how Tommy got out.

118
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:36,911
Leah.

119
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:43,273
- That's blood.
- Wait outside... wait outside.

120
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:45,503
I gotta find my wife.

121
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:46,874
Leah.

122
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:48,554
Leah.

123
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,678
Oh, God... no.

124
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:57,430
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,003
There's no pulse.

126
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,808
That's not my wife.

127
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,968
Do you know who she is?

128
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:13,660
It's Jodi, our nanny.
But she was supposed to be off today.

129
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:20,837
She was raped then beaten to death.

130
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:24,795
Based on the liver temp, I'd say 
time of death was around 11:00 this morning.

131
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:25,751
Forensics?

132
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:29,114
I found fresh semen on the comforter
so we've got DNA.

133
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,430
Gotta love a perp
who leaves a calling card.

134
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,790
Some old stains too.
I'll need Jake Keegan's DNA to exclude him.

135
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,764
Well maybe we shouldn't exclude him.

136
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:38,278
You think he did it?

137
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,608
He would be the first dad
trying to diddle the babysitter.

138
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,493
Jake.

139
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:47,919
Need to ask you 
a few questions about Jodi.

140
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,436
Can this wait?
We need to look for Leah.

141
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:50,595
When was the last time
you spoke with your wife?

142
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:53,515
This morning when I went to work she said 
she was going to be home the whole day.

143
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:57,570
Leah's credit card was used to gas up 
on the New Jersey Turnpike at 12:30 pm.

144
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,867
Do you know of any reason
why your wife would be in Jersey?

145
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:04,418
Security camera at the toll booth shows Leah 
driving with a man in the passenger seat.

146
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:06,811
She must've been kidnapped.
Is there any way we can trace the car?

147
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:09,357
We did. 
It's yours.

148
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:12,412
Let's go. / No, you stay here.
Tommy needs you.

149
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,802
We'll call when we have any news.

150
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,972
Come on, I'll take you back
to the station house.

151
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:20,626
There was a second charge on the card
for a motel room in Morristown.

152
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,100
HOLLAND MOTEL
MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15

153
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,441
A guy checked in alone.

154
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,765
He was a young guy,
kind of rough-looking.

155
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:29,831
Oh, here it is, room eight.

156
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,342
Give me the key.

157
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:42,108
- Police.
- Hands up where we can see them.

158
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:43,959
- What the hell?
- Show me your hands, as swipe.

159
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,728
- You're safe, Leah.
- Safe?

160
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:47,670
Who are you?
What do you people think you're doing?

161
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,886
Wait a minute... wait a minute.

162
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,340
- You know this guy?
- Yes, he's my boyfriend.

163
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:05,783
You have to understand.

164
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,093
I love my husband,
but he's a workaholic.

165
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,591
I was lonely.
Matt made me feel very special.

166
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,323
I've got to get home to my son.

167
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:21,543
Hold on.
We need to talk about Jodi.

168
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:25,244
Look, she's a nice kid.
A Mormon from Utah.

169
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:27,020
I don't know anyone 
who'd want to hurt her.

170
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,405
End of story.
Look, please can I go home now?

171
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,305
You know, it would've been nice
if you were this concerned about Tommy

172
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,905
before you ran off to that motel.

173
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,618
Now you had Jodi come in
on her day off

174
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:38,559
so that you can go and screw 
your boyfriend, right?

175
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,567
- That's it... I gotta get out of here...
- Leah, we're looking for Jodi's killer.

176
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,968
Now, you knew her the best
so I need you to sit back down

177
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,152
and answer our questions.

178
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:50,608
I'll answer yours but I'm not talking
to detective dick.

179
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,877
How did you find Jodi?

180
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,488
- We advertised in the papers.
- In Utah?

181
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:05,918
Everyone knows that Mormons
make the best nannies.

182
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:09,953
They're from big families,
they don't drink, they don't smoke...

183
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:11,335
And they speak English.

184
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:15,060
So aside from you and your husband,
who else had the key to your house?

185
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,130
Just Jodi.

186
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,104
Would she open the door 
to a complete stranger?

187
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:19,471
No, absolutely not.

188
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,998
Utah's a far different world
than New York City.

189
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:25,785
She was from a small town
but she wasn't naive.

190
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,891
It must've been someone she knew.

191
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:30,404
Do you have any idea who?

192
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:34,742
I only met two friends.

193
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,911
They were Mormon nannies.

194
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:39,366
Becca and Kimberly.

195
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:42,644
They used to take the kids
to the playground together.

196
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:45,918
BRADBURN PLAYGROUND
435 COLUMBUS AVENUE
FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16

197
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,196
Oh, my heck.
That's so awful.

198
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,052
Do you have any idea 
who killed her?

199
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:52,654
Not yet.

200
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,302
She make any new friends here 
in the city?

201
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:59,009
Um, a few girls at relief society
but she spent most of her free time with us.

202
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:01,750
- What about boys?
- She was engaged.

203
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,125
Her fiance Paul was 
on his mission in Peru.

204
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,635
Drew, be careful.
Don't swing so far out.

205
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,024
That's why we're here.

206
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,514
When our boyfriends get home,
we'll go back to Utah.

207
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:13,061
Must be hard being so far away.

208
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:15,086
Was Jodi lonely?

209
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,068
If you ladies know something 
you have to tell us.

210
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:26,946
Jodi was acting weird 
the last few months.

211
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:29,344
She started dressing different.

212
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:33,371
Short skirts... kind of slutty.

213
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,969
And then she stopped
coming here to meet us.

214
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,723
You know where she went instead?

215
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,171
Nowhere... she was on 
the Keegans' computer.

216
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,157
She said she missed Paul.

217
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,494
She wanted someone to talk to.

218
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:45,861
Ever go beyond talking?

219
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,281
We stopped by the house
one day last week

220
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,703
to see if she wanted
to take Tommy to the zoo.

221
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:53,850
Some man was coming out of the house
and Jodi was kissing him.

222
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,325
This website that she went on,
you know the name of it?

223
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:58,323
Faceunion.com.

224
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:01,573
Morales dumped the Keegan's computer

225
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:04,899
and pulled up 
all of Jodi's faceunion activity.

226
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:08,124
Hot young nanny looking
for grown-up playdates.

227
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:10,553
She got a lot of emails 
from three guys.

228
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:13,387
One of Jodi's playmates
is Taylor Breville,

229
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:15,949
a junior at Faulkner College.

230
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:20,179
Then there's Rafael Gardner,
also known as Casanova.

231
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,949
And the last one 
calls himself Jesse James.

232
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,236
Killer name.
Who is he really?

233
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:30,834
Ah, Gilbert Matthews.
415 6th Avenue in the village.

234
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:32,781
I talked to Jodi online.

235
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:34,698
We hooked up a couple
of times last month,

236
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:36,588
but then I stopped
going over there.

237
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:37,762
Why?

238
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:40,066
We were getting busy
and when I came up for air,

239
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,749
this little boy was watching us.

240
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,068
She put him back to bed
but it creeped me out,

241
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,896
so I split and never went back.

242
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:48,490
Where were you yesterday morning?

243
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:51,231
At a motivational seminar in Yonkers.

244
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:55,011
Paid 250 bucks to hear Donald Trump.

245
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,622
- Looking for Taylor Breville.
- He's not home.

246
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:59,821
- When will he be home?
- Christmas.

247
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:03,197
Taylor's in India, semester abroad.
What's this about?

248
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:06,276
Someone's been using
his faceunion account.

249
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:10,573
Caleb, get your butt over here.

250
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:14,952
Have you been using
Taylor's computer again?

251
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:18,415
Sorry, mom.

252
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:21,771
I took his internet privileges away
after I caught him using my visa card

253
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:24,098
to pay for his Warcraft subscription.

254
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:27,362
He's incorrigible.
Please, lock him up.

255
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,184
Yo,Rafael.

256
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:35,686
Man, you need to really update 
this photo.

257
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:38,486
Talk about bait and switch.

258
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,552
What's the problem?
That's me.

259
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,686
Yeah, 30 years ago.

260
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,821
- What's this about?
- Jodi Simmons.

261
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,511
You been chatting with her
on the internet.

262
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:48,832
You ever meet her face-to-face?

263
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah.

264
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,640
We had a very fulfilling relationship
on the internet,

265
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,792
and then she wanted home.

266
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:58,482
You bang her, Casanova?

267
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:03,153
If you mean were we intimate, yes.

268
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:05,907
- Anything else?
- Yeah, one more thing.

269
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:07,714
Did you kill her?

270
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:12,080
What?
You're saying she's dead?

271
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,345
She was murdered yesterday.

272
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:17,624
When did this intimacy thing happen?

273
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:21,715
We got DNA from the body.
Is it gonna match yours?

274
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:25,989
We had sex and then I left.

275
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,708
I would never hurt her.

276
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,480
We were passionately in love.

277
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,947
- Maybe your passion got out of hand.
- I'll say.

278
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,841
36 emails in eight days?

279
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,533
"My darling, I will make you feel
like a real woman.

280
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,844
Your soul will melt with my hot kiss."

281
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:45,972
That's quite a claim you're making.

282
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,729
What can I say?
I know what woman want.

283
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,705
But Jodi just wanted a hook-up.

284
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,779
I don't believe that.

285
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:56,122
You weren't her only playmate.

286
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,458
These are just a couple of guys
she was boning

287
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,690
when she was in love with you.

288
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,066
Jodi wrote to Gilbert
that his picture made her hot

289
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:06,142
and she wanted to rip off
Taylor's underwear with her teeth.

290
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,414
You're lying.
She loved me.

291
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,568
She's into young hot guys.
Not you, gramps.

292
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:13,984
- I'm not old.
- I know that, Rafael.

293
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:18,257
But young women like Jodi,

294
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,302
they're foolish.

295
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:23,743
She should've seen 
that your love was real.

296
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:26,901
Hey...

297
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:30,090
She was lucky to have you.

298
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:37,297
She led me on, you know?
She said she wanted me.

299
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:40,874
Of course she did.
And you believed her.

300
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:44,251
So you went over
to her house to see her

301
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,425
and then what happened?

302
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,584
She laughed at me.

303
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:54,015
She slammed the door in my face.

304
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:58,128
Pushed my way in.

305
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:03,530
I was so mad.

306
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,345
I lost control.
I don't...

307
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:13,617
Next thing I remember...

308
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:17,624
The little boy came in... 
and he's crying.

309
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:20,740
And I see what I had done and...

310
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,025
I ran.

311
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,869
I could've made her so happy.

312
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:35,213
She wouldn't even give me a chance.

313
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:37,031
All she could see was my age.

314
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:41,011
Perfect timing. Get a little DNA sample
from our buddy in there.

315
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:43,291
- Icing on the cake.
- Be happy to take a swab.

316
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,010
I'm sure it'll match
the semen on the sheets.

317
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,244
But that's not why I'm here.

318
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:47,275
Okay, what's up?

319
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,801
You had EMS voucher
the blood on Tommy.

320
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:52,091
- It was from Jodi.
- Figured.

321
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,424
Bet you didn't figure this.

322
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:55,233
I took DNA from Jake Keegan.

323
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,221
I also took a swab from Tommy Keegan

324
00:15:57,221 --> 00:16:00,389
to prove that the blood on his face
and clothes wasn't his.

325
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:04,421
They don't share any common alleles.

326
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,526
Jake's not Tommy's father.

327
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,519
- He has the right to know.
- It's not our place to tell him.

328
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,099
Jake is raising a child
that isn't biologically his.

329
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,600
He's married to a woman
who's being unfaithful.

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,736
You think that ignorance is bliss?

331
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,914
First of all, Tommy is his son.

332
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,824
And Jake is the only father
he's ever known.

333
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:24,584
Now they love each other.
Why do you want to mess with that?

334
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,070
Because it's not fair to Jake or Tommy.

335
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,729
If Leah Keegan wants
to tell her husband that Tommy's not his,

336
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,867
that's her choice, not ours.

337
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:44,422
What do you mean?
Tommy's not my son?

338
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:53,732
You know, Leah and I had
some bad times together.

339
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:59,159
But I stayed... for Tommy.

340
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,803
And now he's not my kid.

341
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,975
I'm sorry you found out this way.

342
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:08,290
I don't know, is there a good way 
to find out that your son isn't your child?

343
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:17,821
I used to see myself in his face.

344
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,356
You look happy.
When was this?

345
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:28,748
I just rented this place out at North Fork.

346
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:32,669
Great fishing.
Tommy and I would just...

347
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:37,020
spend the whole day together 
out on the dock.

348
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,188
You know, he's look at me with this...

349
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:43,040
This love in his eyes.

350
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,962
That was the best week of my life.

351
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:54,451
When I got back I put
an offer in on the place.

352
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,436
The deal just came through last week.

353
00:17:56,436 --> 00:18:00,587
I was gonna get Tommy
a little rod and reel for Christmas.

354
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:03,873
Look, it doesn't mean
that you love him less.

355
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:10,943
What happens... 
when he gets older?

356
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:14,452
All he wants is his real father.

357
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:17,449
There are plenty of adopted kids that 
don't care about their biological parents.

358
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:20,321
- Even the ones that do...
- I didn't adopt him.

359
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:22,369
I watched my wife give birth to him.

360
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:25,028
I cut the umbilical cord.
He was mine.

361
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,835
He still is.

362
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:35,457
You must have kids.

363
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:37,854
Yeah.

364
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:43,853
What if you found out that one of them 
wasn't yours after all the years of

365
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:48,645
hugging them,
and holding their hands.

366
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,431
You know, wiping their tears.

367
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,931
How would you feel?

368
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:03,016
I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow
but my car is still in the shop.

369
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,704
- So I guess I'll ride my bike.
- Okay.

370
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:12,629
You're not listening to me.

371
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,903
- Sorry?
- My appointment tomorrow.

372
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,890
Yeah, I'll take you.

373
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,710
Okay.

374
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:27,980
Hey, when we were separated,

375
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,994
did you see anyone?

376
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:38,396
Did you?

377
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:42,158
Yeah.

378
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,126
Did you?

379
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:01,845
Yeah.

380
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:05,730
Who?

381
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,215
I went out on a couple of dates.

382
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:10,907
No one you know.

383
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,791
Did you sleep with him?

384
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,990
- Why are you doing this?
- Just answer the question.

385
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,388
What is the point of all this, Elliot?

386
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,302
Are you asking me if this is your child?

387
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,606
Yeah, Liv.

388
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,523
KEEGAN RESIDENCE 
229 WEST 72ND STREET
FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16

389
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:43,284
Okay, so if the officers let you go,
you two gonna start acting like grown-ups?

390
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,247
Okay.

391
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,415
Yeah, all right.

392
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,005
We got it.
Thanks, guys.

393
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,308
What happened?

394
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:56,373
Matt showed up
and wanted to see Tommy.

395
00:20:58,313 --> 00:21:00,407
- He's the father.
- That's what she says.

396
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:02,823
It has to be Matt.
He's the only other man I've been with.

397
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:05,416
I doubt that. This bitch cheated on me.
She cheated on you.

398
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,386
Don't talk about Leah that way!

399
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:09,580
We're in love.
And we have been for years.

400
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,136
She was gonna ask you for a divorce.

401
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,486
- When? After she spent all my money?
- Jake, please.

402
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,871
Where'd you get your clothes, huh?
The gap's not good enough for this whore.

403
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:17,987
She needs Prada and Pucci.
You even have a job?

404
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,534
- I'm an actor.
- You mean you're a waiter.

405
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:21,934
- I can take care of Leah.
- You can't afford her.

406
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:24,029
She spends more money on shoes
than you make in a whole year.

407
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,491
At least I spend time with her.

408
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:28,231
This loser is screwing my wife
and I'm paying for it.

409
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:30,684
- Hey! Hold on.
- Stop it. Stop it.

410
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:32,061
You're not getting my son.

411
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:33,636
- Okay, that's enough.
- Let go.

412
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:35,402
Daddy.

413
00:21:41,374 --> 00:21:43,490
Tommy, it's okay.
Just go back to bed.

414
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,570
- Did you have a bad dream?
- Don't talk to my son.

415
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,828
- Your son?
- Stop it.

416
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:51,550
Not in front of Tommy.

417
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,406
Come on, sweetie.
I'll tuck you in.

418
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:56,607
Arrest this son of a bitch.
He assaulted me.

419
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,336
He tried to take my kid.
Arrest him.

420
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:00,293
We're gonna take you both in.

421
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:08,116
What a mess.

422
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:10,462
- It's gonna get worse.
- Yeah, how so?

423
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:13,206
Since Jake and Leah were married
when Tommy was born,

424
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,619
the doctrine of presumptive paternity 
means that

425
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:18,671
Tommy is Jake's child 
in the eyes of the law.

426
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,597
What about Matt?
He's the biological father.

427
00:22:20,597 --> 00:22:23,498
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Legally, Jake is Tommy's father.

428
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:26,289
Matt doesn't have any rights,
not even for visitation.

429
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:29,325
- If Jake and Leah get divorced?
- It doesn't change anything.

430
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:33,632
Jake's gonna have to pay child support
for Tommy and alimony to Leah.

431
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:37,910
So let's say Matt and Leah live together.
Jake's money will be footing the bill?

432
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,208
Yeah.

433
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,305
The law looks at 
what's best for the child.

434
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:43,513
So even if a woman tricks a man 
into fatherhood

435
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:47,148
by secretly stopping her birth control pills
or putting a hole in the condom,

436
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:49,575
that man is still responsible 
for that child.

437
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:51,452
So Leah lies to Jake,

438
00:22:51,452 --> 00:22:54,865
she doesn't get punished,
but he suffers.

439
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:58,250
- What do you want to do?
- With the cross-complaint?

440
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,524
Well they both threw a few punches
and took a few hits.

441
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:03,248
It's a push.
Cut them loose.

442
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,317
Family court just called.

443
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,321
Matt Kramer filed for custody of Tommy.

444
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:45,232
Poor Jake. / Doesn't Matt deserve
a chance to know his kid?

445
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:47,956
- Tommy's not his kid.
- Biologically he is.

446
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:50,717
And more importantly, Tommy has a right 
to know where he came from.

447
00:23:50,717 --> 00:23:52,500
It's not for us to decide.

448
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,316
Judge wants both of you at family court
for an emergency hearing.

449
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,681
I gotta pick up Kathy,
bring her to the OB for a check-up.

450
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:03,983
- Elliot.
- Yeah.

451
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:06,334
What's Tommy doing here?

452
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:08,671
When I ran into Jake downstairs,
he said he was double-parked.

453
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:12,162
Asked if I could bring Tommy upstairs
for his appointment.

454
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:16,078
I don't have an appointment with him.

455
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,825
Tommy, why'd your dad bring you here?

456
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:21,141
Daddy went away.

457
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,385
Where's your mom?

458
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:29,612
Mommy went away too, like Jodi.

459
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:40,126
Leah, Jake, it's detective 
Benson and Stabler.

460
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:51,543
She's gone.

461
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:54,242
Ah, damn it, Jake.

462
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,779
Tommy did say his father went away too.

463
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,188
- You thinking murder-suicide?
- Yeah.

464
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,580
So where's Jake?

465
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,206
The lake house.

466
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:15,002
It's on the North Forks.
It's about two three-hour drive from here.

467
00:25:15,002 --> 00:25:16,981
Jake dropped Tommy off 
a half hour ago.

468
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,948
I'll call the local sheriff
to watch the house.

469
00:25:18,948 --> 00:25:22,803
I'm heading up there. / Hey... hey... 
what about Kathy's appointment?

470
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,467
I forgot.

471
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:27,606
I'll take her.

472
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:35,325
- You Stabler?
- I call you too late?

473
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,601
What, the ambulance?
No, that was for one of my boys.

474
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:40,094
Stepped in a gopher hole, 
broke his leg.

475
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:42,600
We got your guy right out back here.

476
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,592
He had a gun, 
but my boys tackled him.

477
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:49,021
Can I talk to him?

478
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:51,962
Be my guest.
He's your prisoner.

479
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:10,954
You're right.

480
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:14,062
About what?

481
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:16,265
About Tommy.

482
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:22,503
I was up all last night 
just watching him... sleep.

483
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,105
He's my son.

484
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,242
So then why'd you do it, Jake?

485
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:38,711
Leah told me she wanted a divorce.

486
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:43,986
And Matt filed for custody.

487
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:49,143
I was gonna lose Tommy.

488
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:52,770
I begged her not to take him away.

489
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:55,852
She laughed at me.

490
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,261
I snapped.

491
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:06,397
Man, I knew Tommy would hate me.

492
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,576
I couldn't live with that.

493
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:14,499
So you came here to die.

494
00:27:29,662 --> 00:27:32,353
- What do you got? 
- Is Jake Keegan in custody?

495
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:33,579
Yeah, you get Kathy?

496
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:36,760
- Picked her up right on time.
- Unlike some people.

497
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,094
Yeah, okay, well call me, 
tell me what the doctor says, okay?

498
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:41,997
I will. Love you.

499
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:44,291
I love you too.
Liv, Thanks.

500
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,884
No problem.

501
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,994
Kathy.

502
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:34,812
Kathy?

503
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:36,589
Kathy?

504
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,174
SVU portable to central.

505
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:47,030
Go ahead, SVU portable.

506
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:51,363
53 at 141 and Mccombs,

507
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,977
the victim is a pregnant wife of an MOS.

508
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:56,765
Rush a bus and the fire department.

509
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:58,639
10-4.

510
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:02,305
Advise fire department that the victim
is pinned. Kathy.

511
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,705
Copy that. EMS is en route.

512
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:06,582
Oh, God.

513
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,824
Hurry.
Please hurry.

514
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:43,919
- We need to check you out.
- No, I'm not hurt.

515
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,077
- You could have a spinal injury.
- No, no... really, I'm fine.

516
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,018
You should go to the hospital.

517
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,284
Don't worry about me.
Please help her. / Jackson.

518
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:52,356
You've gotta get inside there.
Please hurry.

519
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:54,434
- You're gonna have to stay back.
- We've got a loaded bag, Cap.

520
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:56,215
- You can't go any closer.
- That's my partner's wife.

521
00:29:56,215 --> 00:29:57,768
The passenger airbag didn't deploy.

522
00:29:57,768 --> 00:29:59,354
It needs to be deactivated
before anybody can go in there.

523
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:01,762
I understand that. She's pregnant 
and the baby could be in distress.

524
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:04,846
I'm not gonna get anybody killed here
if that bag blows up.

525
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,776
- How's the other driver?
- Just a scratch.

526
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:08,961
Car reeks of booze.

527
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:11,440
Wipe the tires and stabilize the vehicle.

528
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,128
Bag's dead.

529
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:23,504
Legs are encased... 
we're gonna have to cut her out.

530
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:25,721
- Why can't you use the jaws of life?
- They will but they...

531
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,386
They gotta stabilize her head and neck
before we can do anything else.

532
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:29,719
Heart rate's up.

533
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,288
It's not enough room to get her BP.
And she's still unconscious.

534
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,410
- What about the baby?
- I can't tell.

535
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,583
Access is pretty tight over there.

536
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,119
I got out, I can get back in.

537
00:30:40,228 --> 00:30:42,052
Watch your head.

538
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,577
Watch it. Let me help you.

539
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:46,019
Watch yourself... watch your head.

540
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:47,572
Good.

541
00:30:47,572 --> 00:30:48,675
You gotta cut the roof.

542
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:50,894
- All right, go... let's do it.
- Okay, listen to me.

543
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:56,705
Place one hand on either side of her head
and hold her neck steady.

544
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,924
- Okay.
- Good.

545
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,661
She's waking up.
Kathy, honey.

546
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,951
- Kathy, try not to move.
- Olivia?

547
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,904
Try not to move, okay?

548
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:08,367
- Try not to move.
- What happened?

549
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,404
We were in an accident,
but everything's okay

550
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:12,246
and we're gonna get you out of here, okay?

551
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:15,446
Hurry.
My water broke.

552
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:26,464
- What are you doing here?
- There's been an accident.

553
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,856
- Who?
- I'll tell you on the way.

554
00:31:27,856 --> 00:31:31,368
Department chopper's waiting on us
at the sheriff's office.

555
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:33,596
What happened?

556
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,691
I need you to fit this around her neck.

557
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:36,844
The chin goes here.

558
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:39,746
I'm gonna put this around your neck, okay?

559
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:43,764
Sorry... sorry, sorry, sorry.

560
00:31:43,764 --> 00:31:47,143
It's a contraction.
Oh, God!

561
00:31:47,143 --> 00:31:50,236
Sweetie, put your head back.
Don't move, okay?

562
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:52,506
- There you go.
- Good work.

563
00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:54,585
Now keep your hands on her.
Keep her steady.

564
00:31:54,585 --> 00:31:56,836
You're doing great, okay?

565
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:58,739
Kathy?

566
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,172
Kathy, honey? Kathy?

567
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:10,399
Uh... Look.

568
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,812
Blood.
She needs fluids.

569
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:14,437
- Get me an IV kit.
- Got it.

570
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:18,226
You gotta get the IV in.
I'll talk you through this.

571
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:20,872
Find the biggest vein 
you can in her arm.

572
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,335
Okay.

573
00:32:27,335 --> 00:32:28,826
I don't feel anything.

574
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:31,943
She's too dehydrated
just look for the blue.

575
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:34,432
Okay.
Okay, I got one.

576
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:40,493
Now take the needle and slide it in parallel 
to her arm towards you.

577
00:32:40,493 --> 00:32:42,895
When you see a flash of blood, 
you got it.

578
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:51,170
- I don't see blood.
- Well push harder.

579
00:32:53,936 --> 00:32:55,494
I see blood. I'm in.

580
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:57,723
Now pull out the needle.

581
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,556
Okay.

582
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:01,562
Tape it.

583
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,550
Okay.

584
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:07,354
Okay, hook up the tubing.

585
00:33:10,244 --> 00:33:11,777
It's connected.

586
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:13,788
Now squeeze the bag.

587
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:16,362
One... two...

588
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:19,314
One...

589
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:21,463
two...

590
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:23,235
One...

591
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:26,281
two...

592
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,696
Okay.
She's back.

593
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:32,181
- Nice work.
- Kathy, you're doing great.

594
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:36,224
All right, ma'am. Ma'am.
We're gonna need to take off the roof.

595
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:38,928
Now there's gonna be a lot of noise,
but you're not in any danger.

596
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:42,461
Here, take this coat.
Put it over her face.

597
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:25,434
Okay, we're through.

598
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:30,739
Kathy, you okay?
Are you okay, Kathy?

599
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,706
Oh, I'm having another contraction.

600
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:36,279
Kathy, you're doing great.
You're doing great.

601
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,609
Her contractions are coming
every three minutes.

602
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,614
There's nothing we can do.

603
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:42,263
Look, you need to give her something
to slow down the labor.

604
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,682
We don't carry those drugs on board.

605
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,856
Olivia.

606
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:48,586
Olivia. Elliot's on the line.

607
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:52,319
Here.

608
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:54,311
Here.

609
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:55,940
El...

610
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,727
Hey, I'm here, babe.
You doing all right?

611
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:01,803
Yeah, Olivia's taking
really good care of me.

612
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:03,336
Listen, I'm on my way.

613
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:06,288
We're taking a chopper.
I'll be with you soon.

614
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,086
I love you.

615
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,553
I can't hear you.

616
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:12,546
I love you.

617
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:15,520
I love you too.

618
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,787
Okay, Cap.

619
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:21,218
All right, we're ready now.
Now just try and stay still, ma'am.

620
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:29,978
This baby is coming now.
I can't help it.

621
00:35:29,978 --> 00:35:32,685
- My legs.
- And we're gonna get you out of here.

622
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:34,425
We're gonna get you out.

623
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,892
Okay, we're ready to go.

624
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:55,141
Oh, they're getting stronger.

625
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:56,821
Now squeeze my hand.

626
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,460
You're gonna squeeze my hand
and you're not gonna let go, okay?

627
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,331
We are gonna do this.

628
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:04,435
We're gonna get you out
in two seconds now.

629
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:06,138
- Okay, Kathy...
- Hang in there.

630
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:09,011
You're doing great. You're doing great.
Hang in there, honey.

631
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:17,414
Almost there, honey.
Almost there.

632
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,481
There you go.

633
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:26,313
Okay, legs are free.

634
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:27,456
I'm gonna need you to exit the vehicle

635
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:29,300
so we can get the long
spine board in here, all right?

636
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,424
No, Olivia, don't leave me.

637
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:34,390
Sweetheart, I'm gonna be right here.
I'm gonna be right next to you.

638
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:39,699
You're gonna be okay.
You got her?

639
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:42,130
Come on, come on.

640
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:44,244
Nice and easy, guys.

641
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,748
Now ma'am, I'm gonna lean you forward
just a little bit, okay?

642
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:49,229
- There we go.
- Nice and slow.

643
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:50,771
Good, good.

644
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:52,569
You got her?

645
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:55,162
All right, she's out.

646
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,723
Strap her in, guys.

647
00:36:57,723 --> 00:37:00,040
Take it easy. Nice and easy.
Be gentle.

648
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,926
Okay, honey.
We're almost there.

649
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:04,337
All right, take it easy.
Are we ready?

650
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:08,648
All right, it's almost over.
Just try to stay still, okay?

651
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,096
All right, on three.

652
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,582
One... two... three.

653
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,944
Easy, guys.
Easy, easy.

654
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,577
All right, bring her down slow.
Bring her down slow.

655
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:22,144
- I'm right here, Kathy. I got it.  
- Let's get her to the bus.

656
00:37:22,144 --> 00:37:23,203
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm right here, honey.

657
00:37:23,203 --> 00:37:25,366
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

658
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:27,218
You're doing great.

659
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,933
She's lost a lot of blood.

660
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:32,549
Patrol is holding traffic at every cross 
street between here and mercy.

661
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:35,028
You'll be to the hospital in ten minutes.

662
00:37:43,184 --> 00:37:44,638
Try to stay still.

663
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,316
This baby is coming now.

664
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:48,345
Just hold on ten minutes.

665
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:50,215
I can't.

666
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:52,653
Go.
Unbuckle her.

667
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,163
We have to keep her airway clear.

668
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:03,982
She's fully dilated 
and the baby's crowning.

669
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:07,455
Get behind her and let her
push against you. / Okay.

670
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:09,918
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

671
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:13,057
- I'm right here.
- Okay, push.

672
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:17,069
You're doing great, Kathy.
You're doing great.

673
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:19,170
Okay, I can see the head.
I can see the head.

674
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:22,535
- You're doing great. You're doing great. 
- Breathe. Come on, breathe.

675
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:24,799
Okay...

676
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:26,538
push.

677
00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:31,111
That's it, baby.
Keep pushing.

678
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:33,540
The shoulders are almost out, honey.

679
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,529
Push.

680
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:39,125
- One more push. One more push.
- Okay. Okay.

681
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:46,994
Good... good girl.
Good girl.

682
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,076
That's it.

683
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,804
Hey, that's it.
Baby's out.

684
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:58,861
It's a boy.
It's a boy.

685
00:39:06,883 --> 00:39:12,416
We did it, we did it.

686
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,925
You did it, you did it.
You did it.

687
00:39:20,354 --> 00:39:23,137
Kathy... Kathy...

688
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:26,580
- What's happening?
- Her BP's crashing.

689
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,778
She needs O2 and more fluids.

690
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:29,983
Call it in.

691
00:39:29,983 --> 00:39:31,729
Keep the baby warm.

692
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:37,378
Proceed. Patient is coding.
Please advise.

693
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:40,414
Proceed with full code protocol.

694
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:42,465
I'm pushing epi now.

695
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,285
Trauma route 3, standing by.

696
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:47,028
Copy that.
Trauma route 3.

697
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:04,179
Elliot.

698
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,534
It's a boy.

699
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:47,293
Hey little man, 
welcome to the world.

700
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:51,331
I'm your daddy.

701
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:57,011
You are his father.

702
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,073
I know.

703
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,613
How's the baby?

704
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:14,312
Great.

705
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,843
Pick a name?

706
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:39,266
Kathy wants to name him after me.

707
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:42,811
Just what the world needs,
another Elliot Stabler.
