1
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,889
Just 8 days more to go.

2
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,854
I'm going crazy thinking about it.

3
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,987
Me, too, sweetheart.

4
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,099
That's enough of that.

5
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,103
You are so funny.

6
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,245
He never wants to see me again?

7
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,509
Your father's upset. You didn't
visit him while he was away.

8
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,050
I had no access.

9
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,517
She took me off the visitors list.

10
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,383
Jack, you know I only do what Milt asks.

11
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,786
Stop. Just stop.

12
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,884
You should be ashamed of yourself.

13
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,858
I'm sorry, Jack. He's...

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,092
Don't worry.

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,869
Milt wants to make sure
you get what's coming to you.

16
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,900
Don't forget your brothers
behind the wall now.

17
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,636
I'll keep it real.

18
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,268
I'm gonna miss you, Milton.

19
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,006
Same here, brother.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,172
Come here.

21
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,986
Maybe your luck will change

22
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,147
now that you don't have to play me.

23
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,931
But who will make dinner for Mr. Milt?

24
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,865
We'll figure something out.

25
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,664
Tonight, I want him all to myself.

26
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,501
Oh, I don't want to set off the
security system when he gets here.

27
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,938
You want me to show you how?

28
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,169
Uh, no. Just turn the stupid thing off.

29
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,369
Okay.

30
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,309
Look at this.

31
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,608
Two years here turned me into a lean machine.

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,683
So what's the first thing you're
gonna do when you get out?

33
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,717
Oh, Milt!

34
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,156
Oh! You're the only one.

35
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,852
My little sweetheart. The only

36
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,420
one!

37
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,667
Baby.

38
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,571
Must be the little blue pills.

39
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,074
It's like it has wings on it.

40
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,438
Wings!

41
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,542
Oh! Must be dinner. I'm famished.

42
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,745
I'll get it. You go take your shower.

43
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,326
Pam?

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,264
Pam!

45
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,038
No!

46
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,501
Those bastards!

47
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,407
You bastards!

48
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,126
These entry wounds,

49
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,760
chest, shoulder, knee.

50
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,737
The shooter had no control

51
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,601
and couldn't resist ripping her earring off.

52
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,505
Like some subway punk.

53
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,009
He sprayed the doorway in an arc,

54
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,371
even hit the upper window.

55
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,686
You know, the shots came from down below,

56
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,318
but not at the bottom of the stairs.

57
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,624
Check the service entrance.

58
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,662
Well, I got 5, 6, 7, 9mm casings.

59
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,431
He rang the doorbell up there

60
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,538
and ran down here to hide?

61
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,037
No. He rang the doorbell down here.

62
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,844
He thought the service
entrance was the main door.

63
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,708
Here.

64
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:38,416
She answers the door. He's surprised.

65
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,289
He shoots wild,

66
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,426
probably one-handed,

67
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,093
cocked to one side.

68
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,599
Like in the gangster flicks.

69
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,566
He's not used to the recoil.

70
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,704
He loses control of the piece.

71
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,742
She'd ordered dinner.

72
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,473
The security cameras must have been off,

73
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,414
so she had to go to the door
to see who was there.

74
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,676
Why were they off?

75
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,310
The security system's very sophisticated.

76
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,979
My wife, less so.

77
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,457
She must have turned it off
when she sent the maid home.

78
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,688
Well, let's talk about who might
have wanted your wife dead.

79
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,991
Any candidates?

80
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,032
Nobody. She was an angel.

81
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:25,126
We had just finished making
beautiful love. They were after me.

82
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,165
All due respect,

83
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:31,035
even in a snowstorm, no one
would mistake her for you.

84
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,078
You think that's funny?
I have enemies everywhere.

85
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,942
Like your ex-business partner.

86
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,915
You were convicted of hiring
a hit man to kill him.

87
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,213
Do I look incompetent? Hmm?

88
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,153
If I wanted him dead, he would have been dead.

89
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,131
Your conviction was a
frame-up, by your enemies.

90
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,927
Exactly.

91
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,360
My competitors.

92
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,164
In the clothing business?

93
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,797
This "Winter Clothes For All Seasons."

94
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,843
This is the original store.

95
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,471
Yeah, up in Harlem. That's my
dad on the left, and that's me.

96
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,782
Who's the man whose knee you're sitting on?

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,212
Our tailor.

98
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,614
Morris Swope.

99
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,091
Long gone.

100
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,261
So you built the chain from one store.

101
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,531
And the bastards came after me
because I refused to be undersold!

102
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,073
Chang. Chang! Nitro.

103
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,881
Worried about being poisoned?

104
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,149
Can't be too safe.

105
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,621
Great wealth meets great paranoia.
Not a healthy combination.

106
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,719
Pierre's, the restaurant
Milt said they ordered from,

107
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,493
had no record of any order.

108
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,599
He told his wife he ordered dinner.

109
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,694
That's why she opened the door.

110
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,899
And knowing what was coming,
made beautiful love to her.

111
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,236
Well, that's what made it
more exciting for him.

112
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,278
Going by his trial testimony,

113
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,273
the man's all about suspicion and revenge.

114
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,440
Revenge for what?

115
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,074
Don't tell me the lovely Mrs. Winters

116
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,176
was cheating on the old coot
while he was still in prison.

117
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,585
Apparently not, if you
believe the cook, the maid,

118
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,055
the driver, and the Pilates instructor.

119
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,616
Milt loved Pam. Pam loved Milt.
Everything was hunky-dory.

120
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,889
Well, there might be one Winters
who's not closing ranks.

121
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,198
Milton Junior.

122
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,965
He was called as a character
witness at his father's trial,

123
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,030
but he never showed up.

124
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,376
My mother taught me if you can't
say anything nice about someone...

125
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,139
So you skipped your dad's trial.

126
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,339
And the reason you didn't visit him in jail?

127
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,281
Pamela had him take my name
off the visitors list.

128
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,910
She had him wrapped around her little finger.

129
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,784
I won't say she had it coming, but...

130
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,016
You know, usually, in a murder investigation,

131
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,026
people try to hide their
joy at the victim's death.

132
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,527
I'll try to remember that.

133
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,221
You're an only child, right?

134
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,355
Yeah.

135
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,300
Well, with his wife out of the
way, you stand to inherit.

136
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,498
Dad made a point of cutting
me out of his will years ago,

137
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,769
so I wouldn't be tempted to kill him.

138
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,670
That's my dad, always looking out for me.

139
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:28,616
Well, at least you've learned not to
take his peculiarities personally.

140
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,712
How can I? Dad's sick.

141
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,252
A brilliant businessman, but sick.

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,120
So he would've protected himself from Pamela.

143
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,217
Well, I'm sure.

144
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,523
With a pre-nup?

145
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,757
Pre-nups, plural.

146
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,857
I heard he was having his
lawyer redraft the originals.

147
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,496
Well, assuming Pamela would
go along with a new pre-nup.

148
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,898
Gee, suppose she said no.

149
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:58,409
I don't care how many subpoenas
you pull out of your ass,

150
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,712
you have no right to stick your
nose in my legal business.

151
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,222
That's the point of getting a
subpoena, to give us that right.

152
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,120
The material you're after is covered
by attorney-client privilege.

153
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:12,220
That privilege was waived when you discussed
redrafting the pre-nup with Mrs. Winters.

154
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,992
Who said anything about redrafting?

155
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,158
Your son.

156
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,359
What?

157
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,230
That rat.

158
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:24,039
He talks to you, and he doesn't
talk to me? I can't believe this.

159
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,873
Look, if you're gonna get upset,

160
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,907
why don't you just wait outside,

161
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,444
and we all talk to your lawyer.

162
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,847
I see what you're doing.

163
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:40,786
You people will do anything, say
anything to pin this on me.

164
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:45,390
The worst scum in the pen have
more honor than any of you.

165
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,064
I loved my wife.

166
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,227
I loved her.

167
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,828
You loved her so much,
you were drafting a new pre-nup.

168
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,999
A pre-nup that increased
her stake in his estate

169
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,873
as reward for her fidelity
during his prison stay.

170
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,909
Not that Pamela cared. Money
was the least of her concerns.

171
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,780
What? It was your idea
to give your money away?

172
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,248
I mean, guys with your
pathology, they usually

173
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,588
build an armor around what they have.

174
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,092
I'm not taking this bait.

175
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,891
I'm not afraid of you.

176
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,462
I'm not afraid of this whole
machinery of justice.

177
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,565
I'm not.

178
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,968
"Money was the least of her concerns."

179
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,741
Very nice. I almost believed you myself.

180
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,441
I meant every word of it, Milton.

181
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,644
Pam turned out to be a lovely girl.

182
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,686
"A lovely girl."

183
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,120
You should know.

184
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,987
What are you saying, Milt?

185
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,130
I know what you did, you son of a bitch.

186
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,897
Milt, let... Let go.

187
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,457
I know what you did.

188
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,033
This pre-nup does speak toward his goodwill.

189
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,140
Who's doing this to me?

190
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,709
He's dead.

191
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:17,048
Oh, my God. Who's doing this to me?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

192
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,220
9mm casings.

193
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,128
Looks like we got a bold
shooter on our hands.

194
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,394
A bold shooter on a bicycle,
according to the limo driver,

195
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,492
who unfortunately didn't see his face.

196
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,628
Bastards!

197
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,933
The bastards are striking at everyone I love,

198
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,564
and you're doing nothing to stop them.

199
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,733
Them?

200
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,744
My enemies, you idiot. I'm the target.

201
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,647
You know, it looks like he's the
one that took all the bullets.

202
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,208
Jack Duvall was only important
because of his relationship to me.

203
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,046
I'm going home. Rashid!

204
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,283
How did he ever get the
impression people don't like him?

205
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,688
Duvall's files were off-limits.

206
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,820
Even his lunch orders fell under
attorney-client privilege.

207
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,695
Yeah. Luckily, the privilege doesn't
extend to his bank records.

208
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,199
All we got out of the secretary

209
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,258
is that Milt was Duvall's only client.

210
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,430
What about Duvall and Mrs. Winters?

211
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,804
Secretary have anything to say about them?

212
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,968
Just that Duvall always
kept his office door open

213
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,943
whenever Ms. Winters came in to see him

214
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,413
and that he never gave her his private number.

215
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,246
Well, Duvall knew how crazy Milt is.

216
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:25,951
Look at this.

217
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:33,154
Over the last few months,
Duvall issued a dozen checks

218
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,531
from his escrow accounts, all for under
$10,000, all to small businesses.

219
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,900
For losses from fire damages, accidents.

220
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,461
He was helping settle insurance claims.

221
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,871
A travel agency in Mott Haven.

222
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,410
A beauty salon in Morrisania.

223
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,543
They're all in the South Bronx.

224
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:54,112
Where a lot of kids learn how to
shoot from watching gangster flicks.

225
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,018
Have you ever seen this guy?

226
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,615
He's a lawyer, Jack Duvall.

227
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,957
No, I don't have much use for lawyers.

228
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,897
Well, this lawyer

229
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,333
wrote a $9,000 check to JC's Beauty Spa.

230
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,766
And that's you, isn't it?

231
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,702
I'm Solomon.

232
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,669
JC is my wife Jaqueetha.

233
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,470
It's her place.

234
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,638
She had a gypsy cab, dollar
van accident a while back.

235
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,873
It could be for that.

236
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,779
Why don't we ask Jaqueetha?

237
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,279
I want you to soak your hand in this.

238
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,055
Is that what it was for?

239
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,284
A gypsy cab accident a while back?

240
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,218
I whiplashed my neck. That's what it was for.

241
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,161
Those guys are crazy drivers.

242
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,122
You're lucky they had insurance.

243
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,234
Is this your son?

244
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,028
Uh-huh. My boy.

245
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,670
And there he is again.

246
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,803
He must be, what, 14 in that picture?

247
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,080
He's grown a lot.

248
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,875
You must be what, 16?

249
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,848
19.

250
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,014
Taye, why don't you go
upstairs, do your studies.

251
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,063
We'll let you get back to business.

252
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,033
I recognized her first.

253
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,478
She testified at the trial of
the boy's real father in '87.

254
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,015
Dempsey Powers. You would've been in Germany.

255
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,881
I remember hearing about him,
the South Bronx Drug King.

256
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,477
He had an interesting MO.

257
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,388
He used to shoot his victims straight
down through the top of their head

258
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,757
to destroy the slug so it couldn't
be traced back to his gun.

259
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,126
When they came to arrest
him, he shot his way out.

260
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,997
Wounded 9 cops. My dad spent
the summer visiting hospitals.

261
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,925
But that isn't why he's in jail, is it?

262
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,767
No, he claimed self-defense.

263
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,933
Told the jury the cops were
in the drug business with him

264
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,442
and were out to kill him.

265
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,878
They bought it. He's in jail for
killing 3 dope dealers.

266
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:09,914
And now the mother of his kid is getting
money from Milt Winters' lawyer.

267
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,780
You know, it's funny.

268
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,418
Two guys who think that
the world is after them

269
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,494
found each other.

270
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,431
Hey look, I was real kind
to that old white man.

271
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,530
Gave him a cigarette once. Maybe
that's why he sent money to Jaqueetha.

272
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,666
Yeah, $9,000 for a loosey?

273
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,572
Hey, it's different
economics inside this wall.

274
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,106
In fact, uh, what am I getting
for this little sit-down?

275
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,651
Two extra phone calls a week for 6
months and an extra hour of TV a day.

276
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,745
- Extra TV.
- Yeah.

277
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,484
Living large, Dempsey.

278
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,057
The point is, I'm still living,

279
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,254
after all the bullets the
crooked NYPD threw at me.

280
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,928
Yeah, well, that was before our time.

281
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,398
We were in the South Bronx.

282
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,564
We just happened to drop your name.

283
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,331
And I got to tell you,

284
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:05,003
there's still all love for DP on the streets.

285
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,472
I'm a legend.

286
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,106
A living legend.

287
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:13,207
In the South Bronx, but in here you're what,

288
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,418
a guardian angel?

289
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,283
Is that why Milt Winters had his lawyer

290
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:24,226
send over $200 grand to businesses
that belong to your family

291
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,125
and friends?

292
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,791
Maybe it was reparations for the slave trade.

293
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,465
First week Milt was here, some
guy tried to shake him down.

294
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,268
That guy ended up with a
screwdriver in his neck.

295
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,807
Milt was never bothered again.

296
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,504
Milt carried himself like a man,
so he was treated like one.

297
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,842
Especially with you watching his back.

298
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,980
He ever talk to you about his wife?

299
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,881
I would never turn on my friends.

300
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,692
I'm not the NYPD.

301
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,091
This punk's a waste of time.

302
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,992
Yeah, but we're just talking.

303
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,928
You know, we noticed that
your son's only been up here

304
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,662
4 times in 16 years.

305
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,563
Greenhaven's too far.

306
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,471
Yeah? Help us out with Milt.

307
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,332
Maybe we can talk to the DA.

308
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,140
Move you someplace closer
where your son can visit.

309
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,374
Come on, Dempsey. What do you think?

310
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,047
You know what, I'm going to watch some TV.

311
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,347
Oh. So you're gonna... You're gonna pass up

312
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:26,015
seeing your son to protect
some rich white man.

313
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,260
Wow! You know,

314
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,823
I think you should sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

315
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,057
I think we're gonna search your cell.

316
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,833
You know what?

317
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,368
You can search all you want.

318
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,599
You can plant all the phony evidence you want.

319
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,636
I ain't afraid of you.

320
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,142
You got that?

321
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,846
I ain't afraid.

322
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,879
We found this inside the mattress.

323
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,954
It's probably marked.

324
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,821
Cards, girlie magazines.

325
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:11,559
Dempsey Powers' entire world, and kids in
the projects think he's a living legend.

326
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,330
This isn't much worse than what they have.

327
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,531
Except he gets 3 squares a day.

328
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,310
He's short 4 cards.

329
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,723
Queen of diamonds.

330
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,156
Jack of clubs.

331
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,030
Deuce of spades.

332
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,696
Ace, hearts.

333
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,976
Queen of diamonds, Milt's wife.

334
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,706
Jack of clubs,

335
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,274
Jack Duvall.

336
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,747
It's a hit list?

337
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,648
Deuce of spades, Milt Junior.

338
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,009
His own son?

339
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,782
He's on a paranoid fugue.

340
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,779
He's cleaning house.

341
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,619
Like any good paranoiac,

342
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,388
he wants to be there when his enemies go down.

343
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,157
I don't know, Dad. You
call me out of the blue.

344
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,498
I've had so much loss these
past two weeks. I need you, Son.

345
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,595
I need you close to me now.

346
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,697
Let me think about it, Dad. I got to go now.

347
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:23,866
How about a ride uptown?

348
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,239
No, it's okay. The water taxi
will get me there quicker.

349
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,504
See you, Dad.

350
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,677
Son!

351
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,039
Clear!

352
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,274
I didn't believe them when they told me.

353
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,940
- You bastard, how could you?
- No!

354
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,214
No, it's them. These cops are
trying to kill me. They're after me.

355
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,345
For once, you're right.

356
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,390
We are after you. Milton
Winters, you're under arrest.

357
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,795
I told you, I'm a bike messenger.

358
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,594
People are trying to jack me all the time.

359
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,998
That's why I was carrying the piece.

360
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,128
What about these? We found
them in your mom's apartment?

361
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,638
Don't know nothing about them.

362
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,238
You don't know what this is?

363
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,038
Huh? How about this one?

364
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,237
This one?

365
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,773
They're playing cards?

366
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:41,580
No, Ahmal, signals from Dempsey Powers.

367
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,318
You see, some...

368
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,392
Some rich white dude paid him $200 large

369
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,894
to have you kill these people.

370
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,488
You all are whack.

371
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,797
And you're an amateur,

372
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,031
'cause pros don't keep evidence
in their mama's apartment.

373
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,971
I didn't do these homicides,

374
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,775
but whoever did, he's no amateur.

375
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,473
He's gangsta.

376
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:11,909
Gangsta?

377
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:16,450
No. This fool was too busy
styling to shoot straight.

378
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,348
He punched out bullets

379
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,722
using a 90 degree flip.

380
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,690
Or maybe the modified John Woo 180 cock.

381
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,360
Whichever,

382
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,526
he had no control.

383
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,734
He put more bullets in the door
than he did in this woman.

384
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,069
She looked dead in the picture.

385
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,403
This isn't a movie.

386
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,673
You did a murder in the course of
a robbery. That's a death penalty.

387
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,872
I didn't rob nobody.

388
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,006
You took an earring off the woman.

389
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,509
Didn't Dempsey tell you not
to mess with the bling-bling?

390
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,552
I'm telling you, I don't even know DP.

391
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,653
Your brother Luther spent time
with him up in Greenhaven.

392
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,757
Is that how you met DP?

393
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,834
Visiting your brother up in Greenhaven?

394
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,598
How am I gonna get all the way up there?

395
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,266
Subway only stop at 241st Street.

396
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,740
All right, you don't have to flip on DP.

397
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,982
Try this.

398
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,884
You have these three cards.

399
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:28,521
We know that there is a
fourth, the ace of hearts.

400
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,522
Who is it?

401
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,189
Who is the fourth hit?

402
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,729
I got no ace.

403
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,561
I'm done.

404
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,470
Give me a lawyer.

405
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,466
Even if this boy flips on Dempsey Powers,

406
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,705
we have no corroboration

407
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,044
other than generic playing
cards from a generic deck.

408
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,947
I suggest we have a
conversation with Mr. Powers.

409
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,516
About what? A plea bargain?

410
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,420
What else would we talk to him about?

411
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,153
We're gonna cut a deal
with a guy who shot 9 cops?

412
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,957
He's already serving life with no parole,

413
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,423
and he's merely the subcontractor here.

414
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,435
Milt Winters is the author of
these murders. These are his targets.

415
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,637
And am I wrong to assume

416
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,798
that unless we identify the fourth target,

417
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,400
Milt Winters will find
somebody to finish the job?

418
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:21,774
On what planet

419
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,176
do you think Powers is going to cooperate
with either the police or the DA?

420
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,148
He hates us. He doesn't trust us.

421
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:30,517
Dempsey thinks that we're capable of anything.

422
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,185
Let's not disappoint him.

423
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:40,227
As you probably know, Milt Winters'
lawyer was shot outside the DA's office.

424
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,794
Not the smartest call.

425
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,800
The place was crawling with officers.

426
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,494
My partner's old man

427
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,731
was in the 4-0. Same precinct
where you shot all those cops.

428
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,535
You mean, the crooked cops.

429
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,609
What's her daddy's name?
Maybe he was on my payroll.

430
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,237
The officers got a good look at
the person who killed the lawyer.

431
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,446
Recognize him?

432
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,711
Oops.

433
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,351
That looks just like your son Taye.

434
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,727
My son had nothing to do with it.

435
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,387
We have the murder weapon.

436
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,762
If you think it was easy
to plant fingerprints in '87,

437
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,801
just think about what we can do now.

438
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,062
You're a devil.

439
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,161
You should see me in a blue dress.

440
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,604
Yeah, well, I ain't afraid of the devil.

441
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,906
You should be afraid of my partner,

442
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,974
afraid for your son.

443
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,055
I give you what you want,

444
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,558
you all leave me and my son in peace?

445
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,222
I'll make sure we do,

446
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,457
you tell the grand jury what you know

447
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,366
and testify at Milt's trial.

448
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,306
Oh, man.

449
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:03,513
Old Milt may have come to me for some favors.

450
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,842
But, you know, being a man of peace,
naturally I turned him down.

451
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,021
I would, um,

452
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,760
be willing to talk about those favors.

453
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,588
The ace of hearts,

454
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,694
who is it?

455
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,936
Milt lost a lot of weight in prison.

456
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,302
Got himself healthy.

457
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,909
He started thinking that his doctor
kept him sick all those years,

458
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,349
to bleed him dry.

459
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:48,248
It's the ace of hearts,
his heart doctor, Dr. Chang.

460
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,521
Dempsey said no such thing.

461
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,187
That's a lie. He and I are brothers.

462
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:57,029
Your brother told us who
your fourth target is.

463
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,566
If you want any leniency from me,

464
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,469
you'll call off any attempt
on your doctor's life.

465
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:04,968
My doctor?

466
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,140
It's a trick. Can't you see?

467
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:19,519
My brother did not betray me,
would not betray me, ever.

468
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,659
You don't trust your own son,

469
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:26,454
but you trust Dempsey Powers.

470
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,864
More now than ever.

471
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:33,535
I've told him for 30 years
to lose weight, to exercise.

472
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,500
So what does he do in prison?

473
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,939
He loses weight. He exercises.

474
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,205
So now he wants to kill me?

475
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,336
You don't sound alarmed by this.

476
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,744
Would alarm help?

477
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,208
Milt is the one who lives in fear.

478
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,112
You mean paranoia?

479
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,818
The fear of death.

480
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,655
His father died of a heart attack at 37.

481
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,421
Milt thinks he lives on borrowed time.

482
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,956
How old was Milt when his father died?

483
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,122
16.

484
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,933
Somehow he kept his father's store going.

485
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,505
Right. Somehow.

486
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,270
Dr. Chang, we'll assign

487
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,472
a couple of detectives to keep an
eye on your office in the city.

488
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:19,573
I don't work in the city anymore.
Don't live here either.

489
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,777
I moved to Staten Island a year ago.

490
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,711
I hardly come into the city at all anymore.

491
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,226
Does Milt know you spend all
your time on Staten Island?

492
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,421
Yes.

493
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,555
He even made a donation to
the hospice I started there.

494
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,771
Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Someone
will take you back to the ferry.

495
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,542
If bicycle boy

496
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:52,716
wouldn't visit his brother because
the subway didn't go to Greenhaven,

497
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,317
how did he figure on getting to Staten
Island to shoot the good doctor?

498
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,152
It was a delivery in one
of these offices over there.

499
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,855
I don't know what office you're talking about.

500
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:08,455
You wanted him to tell you where
he was making his delivery.

501
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,056
That's what he just did, so he's done.

502
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,625
You can't just come over here
and point it out to me, Ahmal?

503
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,534
No, I'm fine right here, man.

504
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,464
Wait, are you afraid of the water?

505
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,875
I ain't afraid of some water. I just
don't... I just stay away from it.

506
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,242
Well, you go over bridges, don't you?

507
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:24,337
I don't take bridges.

508
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,404
What about the ferry?

509
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,143
I just don't go on water, okay?

510
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,776
I stay right over here, on the hard land.

511
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,047
That's the biggest bunch
of nonsense I ever heard.

512
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,419
This is your big day. You're
gonna take a ride on the ferry.

513
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,923
- No, no, leave me be.
- Come on.

514
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,357
- It's right over here. Come on.
- Leave me be. No.

515
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,691
No, no, no. Please, please.

516
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,731
Please, I don't, I swear. I'm gonna
pee myself. Please, just don't.

517
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:45,098
Okay. All right. All right, calm down.

518
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,200
Ahmal, calm down.

519
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,437
Come on. You don't have to
take the ferry. Come on.

520
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,871
Come on. It's going to be all right.

521
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,843
You can stay right here on the hard land.

522
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,793
He was supposed to do the hit on Milt's son.

523
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:16,495
He hesitated.

524
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:19,627
He waited for the son to get
away from the water's edge.

525
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,399
Now, there's no way
that he's gonna take a job

526
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,838
shooting someone on Staten Island.

527
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,466
Fourth victim, the ace of
hearts, it's not the doctor.

528
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,670
Milt's having somebody else killed.

529
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,844
Dempsey wouldn't lie to us about that.

530
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,148
But he would lie to us if he
was having someone killed.

531
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,585
He's playing us.

532
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,854
Yeah, he's playing all of us.

533
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,419
Milt contracted those 3 hits.

534
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,525
The fourth one is Dempsey's choice.

535
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,934
We may be overestimating Mr. Powers' cunning.

536
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,341
The idea he used Milt Winters' killing
spree to hide a killing of his own is...

537
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,812
Overestimate a guy who put
9 cops in the hospital?

538
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,405
You can't be serious.

539
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:08,974
And cover the personnel at Greenhaven,
starting with the warden.

540
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,383
Dempsey might have already made his move.

541
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,583
I checked homicides going back 2 months.

542
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,052
This one,

543
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:20,196
last week, in Queens. Eduardo Escobar.

544
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,254
Shot once straight down
through the top of the head.

545
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,493
Dempsey's MO.

546
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,694
Who the hell is Eduardo Escobar?

547
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,864
A subway mechanic. Married last month.

548
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:32,534
No priors, no known connection
to Dempsey Powers.

549
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,736
If someone killed Escobar
on orders from Powers,

550
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,107
isn't it reckless to advertise the
fact by using Powers' calling card?

551
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,709
Reckless and bold.

552
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:47,053
The act of someone proud of his
connection to Dempsey Powers.

553
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,059
I didn't kill no Eduardo Escobar.

554
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:56,689
You gonna plant the gun you're
looking for, or just powder burns?

555
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,166
Don't believe everything
your father tells you.

556
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,794
I don't have to tell you anything.

557
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,429
My father told me that, too.

558
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,872
You keep following his advice,
and you'll end up just like him.

559
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,000
Ma!

560
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,810
Downstairs is clean.

561
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,611
You won't find anything.

562
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,411
Taye has his father's mouth, but
my husband and I raised him right.

563
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,245
You got a lot of new books.

564
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,786
History of Cuba.

565
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,752
Cuba Today.

566
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:23,450
My final essay on parts of the world
where police don't practice racism.

567
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,085
Definitely his father's mouth.

568
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,029
Come on, Taye, let's let them do their work.

569
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,402
This kid's inherited more
than just his father's mouth.

570
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,307
Dempsey does nothing by accident.

571
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,714
Spanish, Cuba

572
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,411
probably figure into their long-term plans.

573
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:57,421
And killing Eduardo Escobar
somehow gets them there.

574
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,065
No. I never seen this man before.

575
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,926
Eduardo had no enemies.

576
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,700
He was gentle, always helping people.

577
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,572
What about this one? You ever see him?

578
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,978
No. Who are they?

579
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,337
Just men.

580
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:20,512
This is from Calabria, in the south of Italy.

581
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,311
Did you go there for your honeymoon?

582
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,291
No. Puerto Rico. We got married there.

583
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,891
When did you go to Italy?

584
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,496
I went last year.

585
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,398
Well, Calabria's pretty rough country.

586
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,461
People usually don't go there
unless they have family...

587
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,972
You don't have family there, do you?

588
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,064
No.

589
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,167
So you went with somebody?

590
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,440
It was before I met Eduardo.
It's got nothing to do with this.

591
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,752
Calabrese hard head. Have you
ever heard that expression?

592
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:09,294
When I was a kid, I had a
barber who was from Calabria.

593
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,994
He told me that the people
were very stubborn.

594
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,097
He said that when you
take something from them,

595
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,039
they don't give up until they get it back.

596
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,607
Who is he, Ms. Escobar?

597
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,877
Tony.

598
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,715
Tony Sirvino.

599
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,688
He thinks that Eduardo stole me from him.

600
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,493
What does Mr. Sirvino do?

601
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,154
He works for the city.

602
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,366
The Department of Correction?

603
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,366
Yes. He drives their bus.

604
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,570
An escape?

605
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,512
After Dempsey testifies
for the grand jury tomorrow.

606
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,413
Tony Sirvino's scheduled to
drive his bus back to Rikers.

607
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,042
Sirvino grew up in the South Bronx.

608
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:04,917
He went to school with Dempsey, and
Dempsey keeps tabs on his people.

609
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,651
And he had his son kill Mr.
Escobar as a favor to Mr. Sirvino?

610
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,283
This is... Brilliant.

611
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,088
Once Dempsey got the contract from
Milt to make these three hits,

612
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,722
he orchestrated everything.

613
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:19,200
The checks from the lawyer, the playing cards,

614
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,094
everything, to lead us back to him,

615
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,106
so we would bring him before the grand jury.

616
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,836
He knew he'd be transferred
from Greenhaven down to Rikers

617
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,639
and driven back and forth
to the courthouse.

618
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,702
Sirvino helps them escape,

619
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,314
and Dempsey's on his way to Cuba with his son.

620
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,373
Beyond the reach of extradition.

621
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,717
I suddenly have a new found
respect for Mr. Powers.

622
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,779
I ain't afraid of you.

623
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,019
Well, you should be afraid. Using
your daddy's MO wasn't very smart.

624
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,527
- Blood or no blood...
- Taye.

625
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,120
- I'm Winston Malik,
- ...he's gonna take it out of your hide.

626
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,357
- your father's lawyer. Now I'm yours.
- Or your mom's.

627
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,455
But if you...

628
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,727
I ain't giving you no reason to kill my pops.

629
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,393
Taye's invoking his rights.

630
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,664
He doesn't have anything more to say.

631
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,734
Unless his son cooperates,

632
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,608
we have no case against Mr. Powers.

633
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,675
And once Mr. Powers finds out
we got wind to his escape plan,

634
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,750
I doubt he'll testify to the grand
jury tomorrow against Milt Winters,

635
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:13,790
and then that case will be gone, too.

636
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,892
We haven't told Junior what
we know about the escape.

637
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:18,823
We should be able to keep Powers in the dark

638
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,362
until after he goes in
front of the grand jury.

639
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:24,127
But once we derail his escape, he'll
never testify at Milt Winters' trial.

640
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,691
We can use his grand jury testimony.

641
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:30,502
Grand jury testimony is not admissible
at trial. I need Mr. Powers to appear.

642
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,768
I'm betting that Dempsey Powers...

643
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,245
I'm betting he knows
that if he escapes to Cuba,

644
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:39,143
his grand jury testimony
can't be used at trial.

645
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,175
He never intended to betray Milt.

646
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,918
There is an exception, isn't there,

647
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,355
that allows a grand jury
testimony to be used at trial

648
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:52,019
if the witness has been threatened
into recanting his testimony?

649
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,723
But who's going to threaten Dempsey Powers?

650
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,421
His good friend Milt.

651
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,965
Question. "What did Mr. Winters tell you?"

652
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,532
Answer from Mr. Powers.

653
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,997
"He was always complaining about all of them.

654
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,135
"His wife, his son, his lawyer.

655
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,041
"He wanted to get rid of them."

656
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,603
That's what your brother, Dempsey,

657
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,480
told the grand jury just a
little over an hour ago.

658
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:15,676
Down the street from here.

659
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,946
Question.

660
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,985
"Did Mr. Winters solicit your help
in dealing with these individuals?"

661
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,786
Answer from Mr. Powers. "Yes.

662
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,852
"He offered to pay me $50,000
each to get them killed."

663
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,295
Save your breath.

664
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,834
Are you still convinced Mr. Powers
is looking out for your interests?

665
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,930
More than ever. This doesn't mean squat

666
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,635
until he says it at my trial.

667
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,904
And no way on earth he rats me out.

668
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,810
My son, in a heartbeat, but Dempsey, never!

669
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,949
I'm so curious about this unquestioning trust.

670
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,079
Is it based on anything?

671
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,449
Greenhaven.

672
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,950
He looked out for me from day one.

673
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,188
You paid for that protection.

674
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:04,996
I was happy to share with him.
He had so little. I had so much.

675
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,932
The only thing that you had so
much of in prison was fear.

676
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:11,371
And Dempsey could smell it.
And he used it to gain your trust.

677
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:14,933
I'm not wrong about Dempsey. I know people.

678
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,478
And Dempsey knows you.

679
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,013
He told us that he was checking you out.

680
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,412
He was looking for an in on you.

681
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:23,146
And he found it in an article
about a retailing miracle

682
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,188
known as Winters Clothing.

683
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,222
I…

684
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,891
I have it.

685
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,730
It's here.

686
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:45,407
"Faced with his father's
unexpected death, 16 year old Milt

687
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,234
"not only kept the family store afloat,

688
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,869
"but it turned into the flagship

689
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,643
"of the city's most successful
chain of men's clothing stores."

690
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:58,820
There was a photo that was in the article.

691
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:06,055
That's what tipped Dempsey off

692
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,957
that you had help keeping the store afloat.

693
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,759
That's right. Your dad's tailor, Morris Swope.

694
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,737
Yeah, Uncle Morris.

695
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,932
The man who looked out for
you when your father died,

696
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,040
who showed you the ropes the first time

697
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,478
that you were alone against the world.

698
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:35,084
But Dempsey told us that he took one
look at that photo and he knew.

699
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,853
He knew how to come at you.

700
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:41,864
And it wasn't by being
a bully, or a flatterer,

701
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,798
but as Morris Swope,

702
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,200
the reassuring protector.

703
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,578
Dempsey told us that it cracked him up.

704
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:04,347
He pictured you sitting on his
knee, like a wooden dummy.

705
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,389
He got around your natural suspicion

706
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,124
by modeling your one

707
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,859
positive adult relationship.

708
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,035
He took you for a couple hundred grand

709
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:31,508
and sold you out for immunity and a
few extra hours of TV every week.

710
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,581
Sure, he's going to spend the rest
of his days in relative comfort.

711
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,885
But you?

712
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,551
You're looking at the death penalty.

713
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,290
I mean, that just doesn't seem fair.

714
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,958
To be fair,

715
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,393
Mr. Winters, I'll settle
for life without parole

716
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:57,099
in return for your admission of guilt.

717
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:03,142
You think about it on your way back to Rikers.

718
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,592
What's your name?

719
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,591
Sirvino.

720
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,655
You make these too tight, Sirvino,

721
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,258
I'm gonna slap a brutality suit against you.

722
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,610
Milton! They got you.

723
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,579
I'm not sitting near this man.

724
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,845
It's okay, Officer, we're old friends.

725
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,424
Have a nice ride, gentlemen.

726
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,301
The toughest guy in Greenhaven, a rat.

727
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,171
Milton, be cool. Be cool.

728
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:09,268
Cool? You spent the morning ratting me out.

729
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,005
For what? More TV?

730
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,251
That's what friendship's worth?

731
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,876
Milt,

732
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,955
don't worry, man, don't worry.

733
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,984
It ain't gonna happen.

734
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,550
I won't testify against you in court, okay?

735
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,924
You already did.

736
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,432
They playing you, Milton.
Just chill out and trust me.

737
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,127
Just chill.

738
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,460
Sitting on your knee.

739
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,270
Very funny, huh?

740
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,072
What the hell are you talking about?

741
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,838
I don't care what hole
they put you in, Dempsey,

742
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,674
I'm gonna reach out to you.

743
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,248
You're a dead man.

744
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,051
You're a dead man.

745
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,148
What are you doing?

746
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,521
You know what, Milt?
I ain't going back to Haven.

747
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,958
Just be cool. Be cool.

748
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,217
You're breaking out?

749
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,318
Shut up.

750
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,665
Wait. Take... Take me with you.

751
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:07,865
We're a team, right?
Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis.

752
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:08,926
Shut up.

753
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,872
Don't leave me. Dempsey, don't leave me.

754
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,670
Don't leave me behind.

755
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,971
It's a slice, Milton.

756
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,877
Okay, okay, okay. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

757
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,319
Just put it down.

758
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,120
Just put it down. It's empty.

759
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,752
It's over.

760
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,091
What the hell's going on?

761
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:39,635
Tony Curtis speaks.

762
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,931
I told you to keep your mouth shut, fool.

763
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,938
We got Milt's death threat on tape.

764
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,140
Which makes Mr. Powers' grand
jury testimony admissible

765
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:54,581
at Mr. Winters' trial.

766
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,984
And we've got Mr. Powers
for the Escobar killing.

767
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,454
You know, it's a shame.

768
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,354
All this trust and loyalty,

769
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,557
look where it gets you.
