1
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:23,323
<i>Le Vaillant was struck
by the hypocrisy of killing...</i>

2
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:26,910
<i>fellow human beings
in the name of religion...</i>

3
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:31,289
<i>especially since these people
professed belief in the same God.</i>

4
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:36,336
<i>The Fazar, Le Vaillant's written account
of his experiences in the Holy Land,</i>

5
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:39,339
<i>tells us he wandered the streets
of conquered Jerusalem...</i>

6
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:43,343
<i>for days after that bloody battle...</i>

7
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:46,346
<i>until he found the entrance
of a cave...</i>

8
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:49,349
<i>that ran beneath the length
of the Holy City.</i>

9
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:53,353
<i>Inside that cave, he began
to record his epiphany...</i>

10
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:56,356
<i>which became the basis
for a new religious sect...</i>

11
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:59,359
<i>an order that would combine
the fundamental tenets...</i>

12
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:02,362
<i>of the 3 major religious
of his day.</i>

13
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:05,365
<i>His first converts were
fellow Christian knights...</i>

14
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:09,369
<i>who'd also become disenchanted
by the bloodshed.</i>

15
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:12,372
<i>The force of his convictions
even won over...</i>

16
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:16,376
<i>a number of Muslims and Jews,
former enemies...</i>

17
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:20,380
<i>who now became willing converts
to the new faith.</i>

18
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:23,383
<i>Many years after completing
the original Fazar...</i>

19
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:26,386
<i>Le Vaillant had further revelations.</i>

20
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:30,432
<i>He wrote these down, intending them
to be added as the final chapter.</i>

21
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:34,394
<i>Around the same time,
he and his followers...</i>

22
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:38,398
<i>were being accused of heresy
by the Crusader authorities.</i>

23
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,401
<i>On their way to Syria,
he and a group of disciples...</i>

24
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:45,405
<i>were intercepted by some
of the very same Crusaders...</i>

25
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:49,451
<i>he had once commanded.</i>

26
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:24,444
<i>During the battle that followed...</i>

27
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:28,490
<i>Le Vaillant died a martyr's death.</i>

28
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,504
<i>The final chapter he had written
was lost.</i>

29
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:59,521
Do you have the alarm code?
And no guards, right?

30
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:02,482
You will be like the fox
in the hen house.

31
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:05,485
Take as many eggs as you like.

32
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:09,489
Yuri, it's Russian mob.
No mistakes on this one, right?

33
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:12,492
My friend, this is 1,000 percent.

34
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:15,495
By this time tomorrow, you'll be
in New York making the deal.

35
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:19,541
A sale. And I'll be in Tel Aviv
waiting for my commission.

36
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:55,577
Visual is all clear.

37
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:09,591
- Come on.
- Done.

38
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:25,607
Way to go, Yuri. I'm in.

39
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:37,619
Do you see the egg?

40
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,579
It's beautiful.

41
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,581
Yes! Yes!

42
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:45,627
I'm going for it.

43
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:05,605
- I got it.
- Yuri's the man with the plan!

44
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:09,609
- You're the man with the plan.
- I told you.

45
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:13,655
- Shit.
- Rudy.

46
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:20,662
Are you okay?

47
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:25,667
- Was that a gunshot?
- No. I farted.

48
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:06,708
Guide me out of here.

49
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:27,729
Oh, shit. Rudy, I'm sorry.

50
00:09:56,818 --> 00:10:00,822
Toilet.

51
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:19,799
Hey, pal, this is a taxi zone.
You want to get towed away?

52
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:23,803
Sorry. Watch it for me.

53
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,806
- Thanks.
- Right on.

54
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:30,810
Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps you've
seen enough stones and carvings.

55
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:33,813
All right, come with me.
I will now show you a garment.

56
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,817
One of our most controversial
acquisitions.

57
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,820
This was unearthed beneath
a false storage room...

58
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:44,824
situated by Theodosius
as a decoy against thieves.

59
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:47,827
Quite often, success
as an archaeologist...

60
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:49,829
depends on knowing where to dig.

61
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:52,832
Well, I can dig her.

62
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:55,835
Rudy! Would you
take over for me, please?

63
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:59,839
- Can I have your...
- Okay, everybody, follow me.

64
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:02,842
Dad, what's up? My main man!

65
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,844
Why must you always
attract attention?

66
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:07,847
Come on. I love people.
I love life.

67
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:11,851
You love to embarrass me.

68
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:14,854
I'm just having fun, Dad.

69
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,856
Anyway, you called me.
Want to talk?

70
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,858
Yes, but not here. Come on.

71
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,904
So tell me, Rudy, are you still
involved with that same nonsense?

72
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:27,867
Hey, I'm legit now.
Straight, import/ export.

73
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:31,913
And I'm kicking ass.
Now, check this out.

74
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:36,876
Here, take it. For you.

75
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:40,880
Fancy watches,
fast cars, easy money.

76
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:44,926
What does it all really prove
in the grand scheme of things?

77
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:48,888
- Yeah?
- You have the egg?

78
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,892
Yeah, I've got it. Trust me,
it's in pristine condition.

79
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:56,938
- 10:00.
- Yeah, I'll be there.

80
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,899
Later. Tonight. Some business.

81
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:01,901
I do hope, for your sake,
it is legal.

82
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:05,947
- A thousand percent.
- Come on.

83
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:10,952
Damn plane tickets.
They are here somewhere.

84
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:13,913
Where are you going?
Another dig?

85
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:17,917
No. An interview with someone
I've been trying to meet...

86
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,963
for a very long time.

87
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:25,925
- Don't touch that!
- Sorry.

88
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,927
What is it?

89
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:31,973
The lost chapter of the Fazar.

90
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:33,933
Oh.

91
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,936
The Fazar happens to be
the holy scripture...

92
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:39,939
for an obscure Middle Eastern sect.

93
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:42,942
And yes, to answer your
inevitable next question...

94
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,944
it is quite valuable.

95
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,947
But only to practicing members
of the Order.

96
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:51,951
What can I say, Dad?
You have an exciting life.

97
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:53,953
Rudy, we need to discuss
some important issues.

98
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:56,956
Can you come by my apartment
this evening?

99
00:12:56,998 --> 00:12:59,959
I've got some business tonight.

100
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:03,963
In fact, it's time to go, Dad.

101
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:06,966
All right.
Can you at least call me?

102
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:09,969
Of course.

103
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:10,970
Absolutely.

104
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,973
Tonight.
Rudy, it has to be tonight.

105
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:18,019
You've got it, Dad.

106
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:37,038
Be careful.

107
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,043
- What's going on?
- What's up?

108
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:49,008
Mr. Cafmeyer, this way, please.

109
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,054
So, let's see
what Santa brought for me.

110
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:57,016
This egg was designed
by Peter Carl Faberge.

111
00:13:57,058 --> 00:14:01,020
A special gift to Czar Nikolay.

112
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:05,066
Look at that inlay...
2 4-carat gold.

113
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,027
What can I say?
One of a kind.

114
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:11,030
- That's why it's so damn expensive.
- Yeah.

115
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:14,034
- You cannot find this on the Net.
- That's for sure.

116
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:18,038
But stealing it from
a Russian Mafia boss. Come on.

117
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,042
Russian Mafia?

118
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,044
In fact, he's got some friends...

119
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:26,046
very nasty guys.

120
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:29,049
If they found out about this...

121
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,094
you'd end up with your balls
stuffed and sewn inside your mouth.

122
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:37,057
So, the deal about the...

123
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:40,060
Here's the deal, Rudy.
I'm giving you an easy out.

124
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:44,105
I'll take this hot potato off your
hands, and I'll assume the risk.

125
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:48,068
Risk is my business, okay?

126
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:51,071
You're not listening, Rudy.

127
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:55,075
A second, please.

128
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:57,077
- Hello?
- Rudy, where are you?

129
00:14:57,118 --> 00:15:01,081
You promised to call me tonight.

130
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:02,082
I'm in a business meeting.

131
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:05,085
Really? What,
are you buying a disco?

132
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:09,089
- Dad, please.
- I can hear that Snoopy Dogg music.

133
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,091
Where are you going?

134
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:15,136
Well, that is just what
I am trying to explain to you.

135
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:21,142
- What is going on?
- Give it to him.

136
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:28,149
Hey, come here!

137
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,164
My egg.

138
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:49,170
Move!

139
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:07,188
Move it!

140
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,194
Oh, shit.

141
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:22,162
My eyes!

142
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:26,207
Got a problem here?

143
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,172
Hey, can I make a phone call
over here?

144
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:36,217
Not just yet, Rudy. I heard
you had a big night last night.

145
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:40,180
How are you gonna pay for it?
Sell your Ferrari?

146
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:43,183
I had a bad night, okay?

147
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:46,186
Why do I have to look
at your face in the morning?

148
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:50,190
Is your father Oscar Cafmeyer?

149
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:53,193
Yeah. Why?

150
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:55,195
Yesterday, there was a valuable
manuscript in this case.

151
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:59,199
Last night, Security
discovered it missing.

152
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,200
So what?

153
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:03,203
Your father was the last one
to leave the building.

154
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:06,206
This morning, nobody seems
to know where he is.

155
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:08,208
Maybe it's a case
of "like father, like son"?

156
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:11,211
- You're full of shit!
- Rudy, relax.

157
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:14,214
Why should he break the glass
if he had a key?

158
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:17,217
Nobody's making
any accusations here.

159
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:19,219
We just want to ask him
some questions.

160
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,264
Do you know where he is?

161
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:47,247
Rudy, I have been trying
your mobile.

162
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:50,250
All I get is this recording.

163
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,295
Oh, never mind.
I will try again later.

164
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:59,259
Rudy, I am staying
at an old friend's home.

165
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,263
You remember Walt Finley.
He is teaching at Ben-Gurion University.

166
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:07,308
Now, this is his number.
97 2...

167
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:15,275
- Dad, how are you?
- Thank God you are there.

168
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:17,277
- Where are you?
- Israel.

169
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:20,280
- Israel!
- Pay attention, please.

170
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:23,283
Listen, I was just
at the police station.

171
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:26,286
- Do you know what they're saying?
- Not now, Rudy.

172
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:29,289
I'm afraid I might have gotten
myself into some big trouble.

173
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,290
What do you mean?

174
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:33,293
What are you doing?

175
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:35,295
Who's that?

176
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:38,298
Can you book me on the first flight
to Israel, Tel Aviv?

177
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,343
Right away.

178
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:51,352
Take your glasses off, please.

179
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:56,316
Visiting Israel
on business or pleasure?

180
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:58,318
Pleasure. Always.

181
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,363
Excuse me.
What's the delay?

182
00:19:04,365 --> 00:19:07,327
Mr. Cafmeyer, our database shows
that you've had several arrests...

183
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:09,329
for illegally transporting
artifacts.

184
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:13,375
Does it also show
I was never convicted?

185
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:18,380
Please open your carry-on.

186
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:26,346
Do you have any artifacts
which you have not declared?

187
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:28,348
Oh. The Mona Lisa.

188
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,350
You like to joke, huh?

189
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,352
They say laughter
opens up the soul.

190
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:35,355
Well, while we're at it, let it
open the rest of your luggage too.

191
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:39,401
You're joking, right?

192
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:45,365
- You know, this is bullshit.
- No, Mr. Cafmeyer.

193
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:49,411
This is Israel.

194
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:57,377
I apologize for the inconvenience.
Security is extra tight this month.

195
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,381
Muslims are making their pilgrimage
to Jerusalem for Ramadan.

196
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:05,385
- Passport, please.
- Rudy Cafmeyer!

197
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:07,387
- Who is this?
- Walter Finley.

198
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:10,390
Professor of archeology
at Ben-Gurion University.

199
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:13,393
And what is your relationship
to this man?

200
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:16,396
Not that it's
any of your business.

201
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:18,398
I'm a friend of his father's.

202
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,400
I've known that kid
since he was in knickers...

203
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:24,404
which would have put you
in diapers.

204
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:28,408
Now, are there any more
insurmountable obstacles...

205
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,412
we have to overcome here,
young lady?

206
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:36,416
Thank you for your cooperation.

207
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,419
Shalom.

208
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:43,423
- Good to see you, Rudy.
- Good to see you too.

209
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:47,469
- Where's my dad?
- Let's get your bags into my car.

210
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:03,485
- Watch where you go, putz!
- Up yours!

211
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:08,448
Cafmeyer's a cranky old fool.

212
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,451
Calls me 2 days ago
to pick him up at the airport.

213
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:15,497
So I take him back to my house.
We have dinner, talk, catch up.

214
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:18,458
- What was he doing here?
- I'm getting to that.

215
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,462
What is this,
the Spanish Inquisition?

216
00:21:22,504 --> 00:21:26,466
A few years ago, he uncovered some
scrolls near the Syrian border.

217
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:29,469
They were the lost final chapter
of the Fazar...

218
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:31,471
written by Le Vaillant himself.

219
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:33,473
What was he doing?
Translating it?

220
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:37,477
More than that. He was writing
a history of the sect.

221
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,480
An unauthorized history.

222
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:43,483
He's been E-mailing me
his chapters...

223
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:46,486
having me lock them up
in a safe deposit box here.

224
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:50,532
- Why a safe deposit box in Israel?
- Because he trusted me.

225
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:55,495
Here's the key.
You ought to have it anyway.

226
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:57,497
Okay, where can I find these guys?

227
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,543
I'll show you.

228
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:25,525
Their monastery
is in East Jerusalem...

229
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,528
the other side
of the Mount of Olives.

230
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,529
We're wasting time. Let's go.

231
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:33,533
The present-day Order is just
as reclusive as it ever was.

232
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:36,536
Fanatically adverse to publicity.

233
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:38,538
No contact with the outside world.

234
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,542
You'd do better trying to get
an audience with the Pope.

235
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,544
Son of a bitch.
Those are the guys...

236
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:46,546
that came by the house
and picked up your dad.

237
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:48,548
- Hey, you!
- Let's go!

238
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,594
- Jump in. I'll drive.
- You don't know the way!

239
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:55,555
You'll navigate.

240
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:59,601
Be careful.
This is a classic car.

241
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:13,615
Professor, buckle up.

242
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:35,637
Get down!

243
00:24:31,693 --> 00:24:35,697
Watch the truck!

244
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:51,713
My car!

245
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:07,687
Shit.

246
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:11,733
Sorry about the car.

247
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:23,745
- There they are.
- Let's nail these sons of bitches.

248
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:39,719
You okay?

249
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:43,765
- I'm fine.
- Good.

250
00:26:12,794 --> 00:26:16,798
Where's my father,
you son of a bitch?

251
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:27,809
I'm gonna kill you!

252
00:26:30,812 --> 00:26:34,816
- You okay?
- Finley, look out!

253
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:50,790
- Don't move!
- He needs a doctor. Help me!

254
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:54,836
- Hey, it's not me!
- Get up!

255
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:01,801
You are telling us...

256
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:03,803
these men kidnapped your father?

257
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:05,805
They took him somewhere,
and no one's heard from him.

258
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:09,851
Mr. Cafmeyer, I can smell
bullshit a mile away.

259
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:13,813
And you're only 5 feet from me.

260
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,816
I believe you are using the alleged
disappearance of your father...

261
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:19,819
as a cover to smuggle artifacts
out of Israel.

262
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:20,820
Alleged?

263
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,823
My father was here,
and now he's missing!

264
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:27,827
That has nothing to do with
the reason you are now in custody.

265
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:30,830
You were found next to the corpse
of a prominent professor.

266
00:27:30,872 --> 00:27:34,834
Let me guess. Now you
are accusing me of killing him?

267
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:38,880
Until we have more facts,
all options are open.

268
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:42,842
I'm placing you under house arrest.
You'll be taken to a hotel...

269
00:27:42,884 --> 00:27:45,845
where you will remain until
we complete our investigation...

270
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:48,848
into the professor's death.

271
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,850
Know why you're smelling bullshit?

272
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:54,896
Because you're
up to your nose in it.

273
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:05,865
I'll be in the room next door
if you need anything.

274
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:09,911
- What about a taxi?
- Within reason.

275
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:15,875
- And what about my father?
- We are looking into the matter.

276
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:17,877
- Good night.
- Good night, officer.

277
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,923
Lieutenant Barr. Dalia Barr.

278
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:01,963
Thank you.

279
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:05,925
- How are you?
- Okay.

280
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:09,971
Thanks.

281
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:17,038
Go!

282
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:11,092
- Yuri
- Rudy

283
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:14,596
<i>Rudy, let me explain
what happened in Odessa.</i>

284
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:17,724
Explain what? You left me hanging
like a piece of laundry.

285
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:20,060
But, Rudy, my friend,
there was this cop...

286
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:24,105
Admit it, you little slimeball,
or you'll never see your money.

287
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:27,067
- What money?
- The egg. I sold it.

288
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:29,444
Remember our deal? 10%

289
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:32,363
<i>That's 50 Gs for you, my friend.</i>

290
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:36,076
Lucky for you, this place
makes me feel very generous.

291
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:38,536
Thank you.

292
00:31:39,704 --> 00:31:42,707
Rudy, do you have
the cash with you?

293
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:45,502
No. It's under my mattress.

294
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,922
Of course I have it.
But I'm leaving tonight.

295
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,465
Tonight?

296
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:55,095
<i>Can we meet first? Please come
to my office in Tel Aviv.</i>

297
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:00,058
I have a beautiful new....
penthouse suite in the diamond district.

298
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:03,103
You'll be my special guest.

299
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:04,562
We'd like to use the phone.

300
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:06,106
Rudy?

301
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,608
Yuri

302
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,568
<i>I have a much better idea.</i>

303
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:25,625
Yuri

304
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:29,713
Yuri

305
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:35,176
Is that you, Rudy?

306
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,152
You slimeball!
You almost got me killed.

307
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:56,156
Rudy, it wasn't my fault.

308
00:32:56,197 --> 00:32:58,158
- You owe me.
- Owe you?

309
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:00,160
- You owe me.
- What do you mean?

310
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:04,205
- You owe me, I said.
- Anything, Rudy. Anything.

311
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:09,210
Just listen.
Tell me what I can do to help.

312
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:13,173
I need this map translated.
Can you do it?

313
00:33:13,214 --> 00:33:16,176
- Sure?
- Sure. I'm positive.

314
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:19,179
I promise, friend.
What are you talking about?

315
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,182
- And this disk printed.
- Done. Anything for you.

316
00:33:22,223 --> 00:33:25,185
Understand something.
I know where you sleep...

317
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:28,188
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
There were cops over there!

318
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:32,233
Cops. Let's split up.
I'll call you. Go.

319
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:47,248
Stop!

320
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:52,253
Oh, you maniac.

321
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:07,227
Look! There he is! Stop!

322
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:11,272
You! Hey, you! Stop!

323
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,304
Get away! Hey, stop!

324
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:22,302
Hey, you! Stop!

325
00:35:22,343 --> 00:35:26,347
Stop!

326
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:52,374
Come on!

327
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:17,399
Don't move!

328
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:33,415
Freeze!

329
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:59,441
We got him! Nobody move!

330
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:55,497
Excuse me.

331
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:03,505
Cuff him!

332
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:11,471
Do you know how much trouble I'm in
because of you?

333
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:14,474
Let's have a coffee
and talk about it.

334
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:18,478
Well, Mr. Cafmeyer, you have proved
that my original hunch was correct.

335
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,480
You cannot be trusted.

336
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:23,483
I came here to look for my father.

337
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:26,486
I did what I had to do because
nobody else seems to give a shit!

338
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:29,489
On the contrary.
We spoke to Immigration.

339
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:31,491
They have no record of your father
entering the country.

340
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:34,494
- That's impossible.
- What's really going on?

341
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:38,540
Were you, perhaps, planning
to smuggle out a little something?

342
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:45,505
Hey, those are mine!
What's going on here?

343
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:48,508
We checked you out of the hotel.
You may change at the airport.

344
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,510
You're going home.

345
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:53,513
- You cannot do that.
- I can and will.

346
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:56,516
Can I trust you to take him
to the airport without him escaping?

347
00:38:56,558 --> 00:39:00,520
Yes, sir.

348
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:03,523
- What about Finley's murder?
- You're no longer a suspect.

349
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:07,527
- I'm still your only witness!
- We have your testimony, thank you.

350
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:10,530
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Cafmeyer.

351
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:13,533
- You're not helping me!
- Come on!

352
00:39:13,575 --> 00:39:15,535
You're full of shit!
What's going on here?

353
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:19,581
What did you find?

354
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:33,595
Today, as every year at this time...

355
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:37,557
we come to this special place...

356
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,560
to commemorate the departure...

357
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:43,563
of the Knights of Christendom
from these shores.

358
00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:47,609
Brother Cyrus will now lead us
in a passage from the Fazar.

359
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:53,615
Thank you, First Disciple.

360
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:58,578
As was prophesied
in the Book of Tribulations...

361
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,582
we await the return
of the Army of God...

362
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:05,585
who shall rise like a tide
against the sea...

363
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:09,631
of those who do not believe.

364
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,600
Cyrus...

365
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:24,604
by what authority do you quote
from that disreputable source?

366
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:28,608
As second disciple, you of all
our brothers should know better!

367
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,612
I beg your forgiveness.
It was an unpardonable error.

368
00:40:32,654 --> 00:40:36,658
Le Vaillant himself once followed
a false path toward God.

369
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,620
We must choose our words carefully.

370
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:43,623
Wars have started for less.

371
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:47,669
I will ask for forgiveness
at evening vespers.

372
00:41:16,698 --> 00:41:20,702
Your flight doesn't leave for
a few hours. You hungry?

373
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:24,664
Oh, someone here
actually cares about me.

374
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:27,667
We may be overly cautious
about our security...

375
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:29,669
and protective of our artifacts...

376
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:33,673
but we're not barbarians,
Mr. Cafmeyer.

377
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:37,719
It would be a shame if you left
without sampling some fresh hummus.

378
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:47,687
You like?

379
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:50,690
- I'd like it more without this.
- Sorry.

380
00:41:50,732 --> 00:41:53,693
Look, I came here to find my father.

381
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:56,696
He told me he was in trouble.

382
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:58,698
He's the type of guy
who never lies.

383
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,702
Sounds like you really care
about him.

384
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:06,706
The two of you must be very close.

385
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:10,752
He taught me everything...
about paintings, antiques.

386
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:14,714
- You name it.
- Well, you applied that knowledge.

387
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:18,718
Let's say I did.
I never meant to hurt him.

388
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,720
And that's bothering you now?

389
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:24,766
Yes, because now he's missing,
and I'm realizing what I missed.

390
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:30,730
Why am I telling you all this?

391
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:34,776
You're tired.
You're jet-lagged.

392
00:42:35,777 --> 00:42:37,737
You'll feel a lot better
once you're back on the plane.

393
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:39,697
I'll feel better when I find him.

394
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:53,795
<i>This attack was a brutal
and senseless act...</i>

395
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:59,217
<i>perpetrated on a man who devoted
his life to God and to peace.</i>

396
00:43:00,802 --> 00:43:04,806
<i>We, his brothers and sisters,
mourn his passing...</i>

397
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,768
<i>and pray that those responsible
find repentance in their hearts.</i>

398
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,771
- Who died?
- Pierre Gardet...

399
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:14,107
the leader of some religious sect.

400
00:43:14,149 --> 00:43:16,401
You mean the Order?

401
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:44,846
Come on. This way.

402
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:55,857
Come on.
Please keep on moving.

403
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:20,840
Get the prisoner off the plane.
I want him brought back here.

404
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:21,841
Why?

405
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:25,845
We've been informed
he's leaving with an artifact.

406
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:27,847
Customs checked him.
I saw him changing.

407
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:31,893
Just do it, Lieutenant!

408
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:40,860
- What's going on?
- You're staying in Israel.

409
00:44:40,902 --> 00:44:44,906
- What?
- You're smuggling an artifact.

410
00:44:45,907 --> 00:44:48,868
Do you believe that?

411
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,914
Something is not kosher here.
I'm not trying to be funny, okay?

412
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:06,928
When I signal,
run to the back stairs.

413
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,892
There's a service road
on the far side of the tarmac.

414
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,894
- If you make it, I'll be waiting.
- If I make it?

415
00:45:14,936 --> 00:45:18,940
Now push me. Just push me.

416
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:23,903
Over here! He's escaping!

417
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:27,949
Quick!

418
00:45:29,951 --> 00:45:32,912
Back up!

419
00:45:32,954 --> 00:45:36,958
Quick! I need assistance up here!

420
00:45:51,973 --> 00:45:55,977
What are you doing?

421
00:46:21,002 --> 00:46:25,006
The stairs are slowing him down!
We can catch him!

422
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:10,070
Get in the back. Hurry.

423
00:48:10,111 --> 00:48:14,115
Get down. You all right?

424
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,124
We missed him.
He went over the fence.

425
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:43,103
Okay, we're safe now.

426
00:48:43,144 --> 00:48:47,148
Safe from what?
I've got some questions for you.

427
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,110
I used to belong to the Order.

428
00:48:50,151 --> 00:48:53,113
What?

429
00:48:53,154 --> 00:48:56,116
You should have told me this before.

430
00:48:56,157 --> 00:48:57,117
Rudy, I couldn't.

431
00:48:57,158 --> 00:49:00,120
Of course not,
because you're part of it.

432
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:03,123
No, because I didn't know
any of this was related.

433
00:49:03,164 --> 00:49:07,168
- Sure. You dealt with my father.
- Where are you going?

434
00:49:11,172 --> 00:49:14,134
- I just risked my ass for you!
- Why?

435
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:17,137
So you can hand me over
to the Order?

436
00:49:17,178 --> 00:49:20,140
- I left the Order when I was 18.
- Oh, you left the Order?

437
00:49:20,181 --> 00:49:22,142
I wanted to create my own life.

438
00:49:22,183 --> 00:49:26,146
So meeting you at the airport
was no accident, right?

439
00:49:26,187 --> 00:49:30,191
Look, Rudy, let me just explain
a few things to you, okay?

440
00:49:31,192 --> 00:49:35,155
Most of the followers
are peaceful and life-affirming.

441
00:49:35,196 --> 00:49:38,158
There is a small group of fanatics
who believe in a darker path.

442
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:40,160
They call themselves
the Army of God.

443
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:44,164
They've been on standby for years.

444
00:49:44,205 --> 00:49:47,167
And you think these are the guys
who took my father?

445
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:51,212
I don't know, Rudy. They might also
be the ones who killed Gardet.

446
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:04,184
Hey, Rudy, my friend.

447
00:50:04,225 --> 00:50:08,229
- Who's the cop?
- Everything's fine. She's with us.

448
00:50:10,231 --> 00:50:14,235
Look, my friend. Look what I
printed out for you from the disk.

449
00:50:33,254 --> 00:50:37,258
- It's not translated yet, but...
- It looks like a map of Jerusalem.

450
00:50:38,259 --> 00:50:40,220
Middle Ages, European design.

451
00:50:40,261 --> 00:50:44,224
- What's the language?
- Aramit.

452
00:50:44,265 --> 00:50:47,227
It was the language of Palestinian
Christians during the Crusades.

453
00:50:47,268 --> 00:50:50,230
Okay, see these lines
here and here?

454
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:53,233
They are caves and tunnels
beneath the old city.

455
00:50:53,274 --> 00:50:56,236
They've remained hidden
since the Holy Wars.

456
00:50:56,277 --> 00:50:58,238
Professor Finley
told me about those.

457
00:50:58,279 --> 00:51:02,283
But what he didn't tell you
was what they lead to.

458
00:51:03,284 --> 00:51:06,246
Ask yourselves, why would
an archaeology professor...

459
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:09,249
bring the scrolls to New York
but leave the map in Israel...

460
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,253
hidden inside a safe deposit box?

461
00:51:13,294 --> 00:51:17,298
Because the map leads to something
even more valuable.

462
00:51:25,306 --> 00:51:27,267
It's the people who just left.
They forgot something.

463
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:31,312
Let's hide this.

464
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,281
Hands in the air!

465
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:43,283
Get them up!

466
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:46,286
Move!

467
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:50,331
Where is it?

468
00:51:55,336 --> 00:51:59,340
Freeze!

469
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:45,387
Fuck!

470
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:15,495
Give me that.

471
00:55:15,537 --> 00:55:19,541
Come on.

472
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:49,589
Thank you, Avram.

473
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:53,635
After all this time,
you come back to me like this.

474
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:03,603
You know I've had to make
some difficult choices.

475
00:57:03,645 --> 00:57:05,605
You chose to leave.

476
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:08,608
Please, can we talk
about this later?

477
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:12,654
I really need some water
and clean rags right now.

478
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:19,619
Here's some water.

479
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:23,665
Thank you, Avram.

480
00:57:40,682 --> 00:57:42,642
Where am I?

481
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:46,646
A friend's.

482
00:57:46,688 --> 00:57:50,650
How long have I been here?

483
00:57:50,692 --> 00:57:54,654
2 days now.

484
00:57:54,696 --> 00:57:56,656
You really should rest.

485
00:57:56,698 --> 00:57:57,657
I'm okay.

486
00:57:57,699 --> 00:58:01,703
Well enough to leave?

487
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:07,667
Israeli hospitality kills me.

488
00:58:07,709 --> 00:58:11,713
No, it just saved your life.

489
00:58:14,716 --> 00:58:16,676
Here.

490
00:58:16,718 --> 00:58:19,679
- Your father's book.
- Yeah.

491
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:23,683
I've been going through this.

492
00:58:23,725 --> 00:58:27,729
You really should too.

493
00:58:34,736 --> 00:58:37,697
The last chapter
predicts a revolution...

494
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:41,701
one that is peaceful
and spiritual in nature.

495
00:58:41,743 --> 00:58:44,704
This will not be good news
to the radical Army of God...

496
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:48,750
who contend that Le Vaillant
prophesied a catastrophic holy war.

497
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:52,712
I suspect this militant faction
will stop at nothing...

498
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:56,716
to suppress the true contents
of this final chapter.

499
00:58:56,758 --> 00:58:58,718
Though my own safety
may be at issue...

500
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,721
I have requested an interview
with the first disciple...

501
00:59:01,763 --> 00:59:05,725
to make these matters known.

502
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:07,727
Your scholar
seems to be on the verge...

503
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:09,729
of enlightenment.

504
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:13,733
It wouldn't hurt you
to sample some of it yourself.

505
00:59:13,775 --> 00:59:16,736
Dalia, the world
is as filled with temptations...

506
00:59:16,778 --> 00:59:20,782
as it is with false prophets.

507
00:59:22,784 --> 00:59:26,788
Onions. I need onions.

508
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:33,753
- Is everything okay?
- We were just...

509
00:59:33,795 --> 00:59:35,755
We were just discussing
your father's manuscript.

510
00:59:35,797 --> 00:59:38,758
It's a fraud.

511
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,759
A fraud?

512
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:42,762
The scrolls, they were tested.

513
00:59:42,804 --> 00:59:44,764
By whom? Secular scientists?

514
00:59:44,806 --> 00:59:47,767
- If you would just open your mind.
- To what?

515
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:51,813
To this, Avram.

516
00:59:52,814 --> 00:59:54,774
What is this?

517
00:59:54,816 --> 00:59:55,775
What is this?

518
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:58,778
It's mentioned in the Thesuar.

519
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,781
Solomon's gold. A treasure the
ancient Hebrews hid under the city.

520
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:05,827
Which might explain why people with guns
have been chasing us all over Israel.

521
01:00:06,828 --> 01:00:08,788
It explains nothing
but your ignorance.

522
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:12,834
The treasure is a metaphor
for the wisdom of the ancient sages.

523
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:16,796
Avram, I need to
get to the monastery.

524
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:19,799
- I think they're holding my father.
- Impossible.

525
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:21,801
No outsider is permitted.

526
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:24,804
What about an insider?

527
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:28,850
A member from overseas
that is here on pilgrimage.

528
01:01:11,893 --> 01:01:13,853
That's Cyrus...

529
01:01:13,895 --> 01:01:17,899
the new first disciple.

530
01:01:27,909 --> 01:01:29,869
Children of God...

531
01:01:29,911 --> 01:01:32,872
I stand here before you today...

532
01:01:32,914 --> 01:01:34,874
in great sorrow...

533
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:36,876
for what should be a celebration
of hope and joy...

534
01:01:36,918 --> 01:01:40,880
must instead be looked upon
as a call to action.

535
01:01:40,922 --> 01:01:43,883
God's vengeance
for this murderous deed...

536
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:47,929
will be swift and without mercy.

537
01:01:49,931 --> 01:01:53,893
May the eternal spirit
of Pierre Gardet...

538
01:01:53,935 --> 01:01:57,939
guide us on this path
of deliverance.

539
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,901
It's the best time
to see if my father's alive.

540
01:02:01,943 --> 01:02:05,947
Try the catacombs first.

541
01:02:06,948 --> 01:02:10,910
That door leads
to a small stairway.

542
01:02:10,952 --> 01:02:14,956
Follow it all the way down.

543
01:02:15,957 --> 01:02:19,961
Be careful.

544
01:03:11,012 --> 01:03:12,972
Dad, are you all right?

545
01:03:13,014 --> 01:03:13,973
Yes.

546
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:16,976
Let me get you out of here.

547
01:03:17,018 --> 01:03:18,978
I already tried.

548
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,981
No, forget about me.

549
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:23,983
You have to stop him.

550
01:03:24,025 --> 01:03:26,986
Pull off that tarp.

551
01:03:27,028 --> 01:03:28,988
You will see
what this is all about.

552
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:33,034
Rudy, go. Go.

553
01:03:55,056 --> 01:03:57,016
This looks like...

554
01:03:57,058 --> 01:03:59,018
A bomb?

555
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,021
Sorry we're late, Mr. Cafmeyer...

556
01:04:02,063 --> 01:04:05,024
but I could give a shit
about this coronation.

557
01:04:05,066 --> 01:04:07,026
Tonight...

558
01:04:07,068 --> 01:04:09,028
we will all witness a miracle...

559
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:13,032
as God's fury cleanses the souls
of those who stand against us.

560
01:04:13,074 --> 01:04:16,036
Let the new age...

561
01:04:16,077 --> 01:04:18,038
begin!

562
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,041
- Where are you going?
- To find Rudy.

563
01:04:21,082 --> 01:04:25,045
We have to put a stop to this.

564
01:04:25,086 --> 01:04:28,048
All right, I'm coming with you.

565
01:04:28,089 --> 01:04:32,093
This way.

566
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:35,055
Dalia, stop!

567
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:39,059
It's a trap!

568
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,062
Now, be a good girl, Dalia,
and come down here.

569
01:04:42,103 --> 01:04:46,066
And since when did you take your vows
with the Order, Major?

570
01:04:46,107 --> 01:04:49,069
The day Cyrus vowed there was
a treasure under the temple mount.

571
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:53,114
That's the day I found religion.

572
01:04:54,115 --> 01:04:57,077
Hello, Professor.

573
01:04:57,118 --> 01:05:00,080
Dad...

574
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:01,081
meet Dalia.

575
01:05:01,122 --> 01:05:03,083
She's a good cop.

576
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:05,085
Now let's ask the major...

577
01:05:05,126 --> 01:05:09,130
what the big bomb is for.

578
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:14,094
It's Ramadan.

579
01:05:14,135 --> 01:05:18,098
Islamic leaders from around the world
will be on the temple mount at noon.

580
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:20,100
What are you saying?

581
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:23,103
This nutcase is gonna blow it up?

582
01:05:23,144 --> 01:05:25,105
That will start World War III.

583
01:05:25,146 --> 01:05:27,107
Especially when
they find the bodies...

584
01:05:27,148 --> 01:05:30,110
of an Israeli and an American
beneath the rubble.

585
01:05:30,151 --> 01:05:33,113
Oh, no, you're crazy.
This is impossible.

586
01:05:33,154 --> 01:05:37,117
You have completely misinterpreted
the words of the first disciple.

587
01:05:37,158 --> 01:05:39,119
And you...

588
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,164
are a naive moron.

589
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:48,128
You have truly lost the way, Cyrus.

590
01:05:48,169 --> 01:05:49,129
On the contrary...

591
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:52,132
I have found it.

592
01:05:52,173 --> 01:05:55,135
I want to thank you,
young Cafmeyer...

593
01:05:55,176 --> 01:05:59,139
for unwittingly providing
the final piece of the puzzle.

594
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,141
And thank you, Avram...

595
01:06:01,182 --> 01:06:03,143
for your unwavering
loyalty and devotion.

596
01:06:03,184 --> 01:06:07,188
But, First Disciple,
what they're saying here is insane.

597
01:06:08,189 --> 01:06:11,151
If you've read the Book of Tribulations
carefully, you are aware...

598
01:06:11,192 --> 01:06:14,154
that the Holy War is triggered
by a singular event.

599
01:06:14,195 --> 01:06:18,158
Behold the event.

600
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:22,162
And as my unwavering one...

601
01:06:22,203 --> 01:06:24,164
I shall grant you the privilege
of assisting us.

602
01:06:24,205 --> 01:06:26,166
Bind him...

603
01:06:26,207 --> 01:06:27,167
and her too.

604
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:31,212
Now, where is my guide?

605
01:06:43,224 --> 01:06:44,184
Dad!

606
01:06:44,225 --> 01:06:45,185
Stop!

607
01:06:45,226 --> 01:06:47,187
There is no need for that!

608
01:06:47,228 --> 01:06:50,190
Does this mean you'll be
assisting us too, Professor?

609
01:06:50,231 --> 01:06:51,191
What's he talking about?

610
01:06:51,232 --> 01:06:55,236
With the map you brought us, your father
can now guide us under the temple mount.

611
01:06:57,238 --> 01:06:58,198
Please.

612
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:00,200
Millions will die.

613
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:01,201
It is written.

614
01:07:01,242 --> 01:07:04,204
"I will raze Mt. Moriah
and build upon it a new temple."

615
01:07:04,245 --> 01:07:08,249
That prophecy you are quoting
is a fabrication.

616
01:07:10,251 --> 01:07:13,213
Wait. Don't do shit for him.

617
01:07:13,254 --> 01:07:14,214
Apparently...

618
01:07:14,255 --> 01:07:17,217
stubbornness is
an ingrained family trait.

619
01:07:17,258 --> 01:07:21,221
Beats a messiah complex any day.

620
01:07:21,262 --> 01:07:24,224
Stop! I will do it.

621
01:07:24,265 --> 01:07:25,225
I will guide you.

622
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:28,228
God help us all.

623
01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:32,273
He helps those
who help themselves, Professor.

624
01:08:31,332 --> 01:08:34,294
We are near the temple mount.

625
01:08:34,335 --> 01:08:36,296
That is where the traps begin.

626
01:08:36,337 --> 01:08:40,341
Perhaps we should use
someone expendable to lead the way.

627
01:08:42,343 --> 01:08:44,304
Young Mr. Cafmeyer...

628
01:08:44,345 --> 01:08:48,349
we have a job for you.

629
01:08:55,356 --> 01:08:59,360
- Be careful.
- Okay.

630
01:09:01,362 --> 01:09:05,366
Go.

631
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:17,379
Somebody help him! No!
Let me go, damn it!

632
01:09:21,383 --> 01:09:23,343
Be careful, Rudy!

633
01:09:23,385 --> 01:09:27,389
Come on, Avram.

634
01:09:34,396 --> 01:09:36,356
You deceived me.

635
01:09:36,398 --> 01:09:40,360
This is the way,
according to the map.

636
01:09:40,402 --> 01:09:43,363
- Then how do we proceed?
- What's the matter with you guys?

637
01:09:43,405 --> 01:09:47,409
You see these beams?
We take them down and build a bridge.

638
01:10:14,436 --> 01:10:18,440
Oh, my God.

639
01:10:55,477 --> 01:10:57,437
This is not the well of souls.

640
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:00,440
In the next chamber, I swear!

641
01:11:00,482 --> 01:11:04,486
Show me.

642
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:30,470
Directly above us...

643
01:11:30,512 --> 01:11:31,471
the Dome of the Rock...

644
01:11:31,513 --> 01:11:35,517
Islam's 3rd-holiest shrine.

645
01:11:36,518 --> 01:11:39,479
And henceforth,
from this day forward...

646
01:11:39,521 --> 01:11:43,525
the holiest shrine in the Order.

647
01:11:51,533 --> 01:11:55,537
Cyrus, I beg you to reconsider.

648
01:12:03,545 --> 01:12:05,505
Bring the bomb.

649
01:12:05,547 --> 01:12:07,507
Hold on. Hold on.

650
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:09,509
We'll get to that.

651
01:12:09,551 --> 01:12:13,555
- First we fill these bags.
- There's no time.

652
01:12:15,557 --> 01:12:18,518
Take a look around you, Cyrus.

653
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,520
There's a king's treasure here...

654
01:12:20,562 --> 01:12:24,524
enough to finance 10 of your holy wars.

655
01:12:24,566 --> 01:12:27,527
We set the bomb now.

656
01:12:27,569 --> 01:12:31,573
We can do this the easy way...

657
01:12:32,574 --> 01:12:36,578
or the very easy way.

658
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:42,542
I have a prophecy to fulfill.

659
01:12:42,584 --> 01:12:45,545
And I have a Swiss
bank account to fill.

660
01:12:45,587 --> 01:12:49,591
That's the only reason I joined
your crazy scheme in the first place.

661
01:12:54,596 --> 01:12:56,556
- Idiot!
- Professor, here!

662
01:12:56,598 --> 01:13:00,602
Stop them!
Don't let them get away!

663
01:13:16,618 --> 01:13:18,578
Rudy! Your dad!

664
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:22,582
Dad, you're hit.

665
01:13:22,624 --> 01:13:24,584
Come on.

666
01:13:24,626 --> 01:13:28,630
Let's go. Over here.

667
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,601
Dad, you stay here.
We'll be back for you.

668
01:13:41,643 --> 01:13:45,647
- I'll be fine.
- Let's go.

669
01:13:46,648 --> 01:13:48,608
They did not come this far.

670
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:52,612
We must have passed them.
Come on, let's double back.

671
01:13:52,654 --> 01:13:56,658
Let's split. Go.

672
01:13:57,659 --> 01:14:01,663
Get after him.
I'll take care of that bitch.

673
01:14:44,706 --> 01:14:46,666
Help me with these.

674
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:50,712
Assist him.

675
01:15:06,728 --> 01:15:10,732
Shit!

676
01:16:46,828 --> 01:16:49,789
Hey, Dad, meet Dalia.

677
01:16:49,831 --> 01:16:51,791
She's the dead cop!

678
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:55,837
Wrong, Major.

679
01:17:01,843 --> 01:17:04,804
Professor.

680
01:17:04,846 --> 01:17:08,850
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

681
01:17:11,853 --> 01:17:15,815
- Take my father out of here.
- What about you?

682
01:17:15,857 --> 01:17:18,818
I've got to stop the bomb.

683
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,821
Please be careful.

684
01:17:21,863 --> 01:17:24,824
Come on, Professor.

685
01:17:24,866 --> 01:17:27,827
Let's go.

686
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:31,873
- Are you ready for this?
- Thank you.

687
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:50,850
The bomb is set.

688
01:17:50,892 --> 01:17:54,896
It's irreversible.

689
01:17:57,899 --> 01:18:00,860
The prophecy will be fulfilled...

690
01:18:00,902 --> 01:18:04,906
and I will vanquish my enemy.

691
01:19:47,008 --> 01:19:51,012
You can't stop the prophecy.

692
01:19:56,017 --> 01:20:00,021
You read the wrong book, pal.

693
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:04,044
Now...

694
01:21:04,085 --> 01:21:06,046
it's time to say...

695
01:21:06,087 --> 01:21:07,047
bon voyage!

696
01:21:07,088 --> 01:21:11,092
Shalom!

697
01:21:56,137 --> 01:22:00,141
Please stay calm.

698
01:22:52,193 --> 01:22:56,156
My main man!

699
01:22:56,197 --> 01:22:58,158
Hey, this is great.

700
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:01,161
Just a few more to sign,
and then we can go to lunch.

701
01:23:01,202 --> 01:23:05,206
Take your time.

702
01:23:10,211 --> 01:23:13,173
Don't touch that!

703
01:23:13,214 --> 01:23:17,177
I'm sorry.
What is this?

704
01:23:17,218 --> 01:23:19,179
It is a map
which purports to show...

705
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:23,224
the location of the fabled 7 cities
of Cibola, near Cancun...

706
01:23:24,225 --> 01:23:26,186
on the Yucatan Peninsula.

707
01:23:26,227 --> 01:23:27,187
Oh.

708
01:23:27,228 --> 01:23:30,190
These, ostensibly...

709
01:23:30,231 --> 01:23:33,193
are the legendary...

710
01:23:33,234 --> 01:23:35,195
cities of gold...

711
01:23:35,236 --> 01:23:38,198
containing the Mayan treasure...

712
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,200
which the Spanish conquistadors...

713
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:43,203
so desperately had sought.

714
01:23:43,244 --> 01:23:47,207
And, to answer
your inevitable next question...

715
01:23:47,248 --> 01:23:51,252
yes, it is quite valuable.

716
01:23:58,259 --> 01:24:00,220
So, where to, young Cafmeyer?

717
01:24:00,261 --> 01:24:02,222
Cancun, Mexico.

718
01:24:02,263 --> 01:24:04,224
Will that be business or pleasure?

719
01:24:04,265 --> 01:24:08,269
Pleasure, always.

720
01:25:07,328 --> 01:25:11,332
Cut.

721
01:25:13,585 --> 01:25:15,503
