Hoyt was in a departmental

They can't find anything wrong with her car.

148
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,699
So she imagined her car problems?

149
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,539

Her father said that he tested the car.

152
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,457
He drove it around the block a few times.

00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,468
Yeah, it's Goren. Can I have
Mike down in the garage?

154
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,634
MIKE: We drained the gas tank.

155
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,699
That's when we heard it
rattling around in there.

00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,681
When you drive over long distances,

158
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:14,146
like the airport road or an expressway,

159
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,154
it gets sucked down to the gas line intake,

160
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,718
plugs it up, the car stalls.

161
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,761
When you stop, it floats
back up to the surface.

162
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,293
Car starts up again.

163
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,297
But if you just drive it around the block...

164
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,232
Because of the stop and go, the
ball never gets sucked down.

165
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,826
Car never stalls out.

166
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,067
Ralph, that was Jenny's work.

167
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,136

170
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,349
Oh, sweetie.

171
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,917

00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,498

174
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,297
when her car started stalling out.

175
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,996
But she was killed Thursday night.

176
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,437
There was a weather pattern Wednesday.

177
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,940
The afternoon flights were
canceled. She went home early.

178
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,604
Her car was probably sabotaged
in the employee parking lot.

179
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,640
The killer couldn't make
his move until the next day.

180
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,149
So potentially a co-worker.

181
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,845
Her father said she had
to fight for her promotion.

182
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,684
If there was a fight, there was a loser.

183
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,122
Personnel told us you
had seniority in baggage,

184
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,028
but she had more years in the company.

185
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,795
She made a stink, she got the job. Your job.

186
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,358
It wasn't my job.

187
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,468
There was a salary bump with that promotion.

188
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,563
Would've been.

189
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,237
Oh, man, instead you got stuck
in this little hellhole.

190
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,871
I don't mind. I like the guys.

191
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,880
Loyalty counts for something.

192
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,247
Can I bum a smoke from you?

193
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,515
I mean, you can smoke in here, right?

194
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,392
So what do you supervise here,
Mr. Tate, lost luggage?

195
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,326
No, no, don't sweat it.

196
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,330
You were just biding your time.

197
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,161
Indecent Exposure Gentlemen's Club.

198
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,905
We passed that on the way here.

199
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,168
EAMES: I didn't notice.

200
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,937
You guys hang out there?

201
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,910
Yeah, sometimes.

202
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,843
Jenny must've felt right
at home at a titty bar.

203
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,408
Oh, right. That's the point.
She wouldn't. Right, Walter?

204
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,322
You know what?

205
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,320
We're gonna let you get back to work.

206
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,024
And thank you for your help.

207
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,666
I almost forgot.

208
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,096
I once busted a stripper.

209
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,833
Her specialty was this
thing with a glow stick.

210
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,374
They do that there?

211
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,668
Yeah, they do that.

212
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,574
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

213
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,944
I can't believe you touched that thing.

214
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,875
Ms. Sullivan did make
a sexual harassment complaint

215
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,385
but not against Walter Tate.

216
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,479
The person involved got a warning.

217
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,114
Can we see the complaint?

218
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,886
It's against our policy.

219
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,486
Well, what did this person
do to Ms. Sullivan?

220
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,030
I can't get into that,

221
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:17,296
but the general sense was that Ms.
Sullivan was overly sensitive.

222
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,261
Let me guess. It had to do with her locker.

223
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,808
Somebody wrote graffiti on it,
and that's why it was repainted.

224
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,668
Someone slipped something through her vent,

225
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
and that's why she blocked them.

226
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,716
We're battin’ a thousand anyway.

227
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,775
You might as well let us see it.

228
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,680
You understand I'm bending our rules.

229
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,851
I think your rules are used to it.

230
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,794
Playboy pinups in the break
room, dirty cartoons...

231
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,333
That's from our inspection of the workplace.

232
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,959
Her complaint wasn't about that.

233
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,095
Well, I guess she wasn't
all that overly sensitive.

234
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,036
The complaint was against Desmond McCarthy.

235
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,805
The big guy in the locker room.

236
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,006
Yeah, he exposed himself to her.

237
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,709
He put the glow stick on her car seat.

238
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,480
He poured urine through
the vents of her locker.

239
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,113
Jenny cataloged everything he did.

240
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:16,058
Every obscene gesture, every piece of
graffiti, dates, times, witnesses.

241
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,619
Did she have notes or a journal?

242
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,960
He told us she had a
spiral notebook with her.

243
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,364
Oh, I didn't ever saw anything like that.

244
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,374
She ever say anything to you
about her problems at work?

245
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,273
We talked about other things.

246
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,707
Who makes the bed?

247
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,446
SUSAN: Jenny does.

248
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,714
She likes things neat.

249
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,991
Eames.

250
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,997
EAMES: So this is where she hid the notebook.

251
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,310
What's going on?

252
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,305
We've been talking about

253
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:17,252
how good Jenny was doing at her job.
You must be proud of her.

254
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,655
Sure. I was proud.

255
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,892
My dad's a retired cop.

256
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,451
When I've got a beef at work,

257
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,258
I go to him. Is that what Jenny did?

258
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,821
She came to you with her problems?

259
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:31,425
Yeah, sure. Everybody has
a bad day one time or another.

260
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,902
You can't let it get to you.

261
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,529
EAMES: That's what you taught Jenny?

262
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,507
Don't show weakness? Be strong?

263
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,175
When she told you some guy
at work was ragging her,

264
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,340
you told her to just tough it out.

265
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,245
The guy was just a jerk.

266
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,776
Did you know she filed a complaint
against him with the company?

267
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,124
GOREN: You're not surprised.

268
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,760
You know what's on the complaint.

269
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,423
You read her notebook.

270
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,826
- No.
- Yes, you did.

271
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,499
And now you're taking it on yourself

272
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,735
because you're thinking maybe you
should've listened more carefully

273
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,276
to what Jenny said.

274
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,910
And that's why you're not
telling anyone about it.

275
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,874
I didn't know.

276
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,744
She tried to tell me.

277
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,185
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,452
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,632

McCarthy started telling me

this bozo a slap on the wrist.

Maybe not just to harass her.

The address on Fordham Place.

It's the State Human Rights Division.

307

She was filing a complaint with the State.

308
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,046
She was going for the jugular.

- This is crap.
- What did he say exactly?

They found the complaint
she made on bright boy here.

- I'm not taking the fall for this.
- Just relax, would you?

You relax, Martinez!

317
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,066
No, you know what? Don't relax.

What motive? You just said the Human
Rights division never heard from her.

She hadn't made up her mind yet.

323
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,083
She was scared. She'd been burned before.

324
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:42,285
But if these guys got wind she was
even thinking of going to the State...

325
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,952
Appalling as their behavior is,

326
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,927
it doesn't predispose them to murder.

327
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,125
They threatened her with
rape. They fondled her.

328
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,725
Yes, they did. But there is not
a single case on the books

329
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,830
proving a causal relationship between
sexual harassment and murder.

330
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,966
Not a single case until now.

331
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,002
Not with this evidence.

00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,401
These men may have been pigs,

333
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,039
but that doesn't make them
killers. I'm sorry.

in the other supervisor,

It's interesting. He never
said anything to us.

337
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,864
Sure. I knew what was going on.
It was hard to miss.

338
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,456
And she told you about it?

339
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,795
We talked about it.

340
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,858
She wrote it in her notebook.

341
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,002
She kept a very detailed chronicle.

342
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,006
Yeah, well, then you know I wasn't involved.

343
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,532
Right, we got that. What we don't
get is why you didn't tell us.

344
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,972
Because it didn't have
anything to do with her death.

345
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,878
You know, I told corporate what was going on.

346
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,746
It was up to them to come down on those guys.

347
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:40,977
Why didn't you?

00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,782

But you didn't take care of Jenny.

352
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,025
She wrote in her notebook you're
the only guy she trusted.

353
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,758
Or maybe you enjoyed seeing
her get tormented.

354
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,795
Where is this coming from?

00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,130

00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,931
We need to call in anyway.

357
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,676
This case has brought out the...

358
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,907
what's the code word? “Feminist”
in my partner.

359
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,010
Well, it's all right.

360
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,983
You know, she's an attractive woman

361
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,385
in what used to be a man's
job. It can't be easy.

362
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,249
Attractive?

363
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,954
If hostility turns you on.

364
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,456
That's not what I meant.

365
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,230
If you wanna know, that's more my type.

366
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:38,236
Not bad, if you like
high-maintenance ball-busters.

367
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,843
No. You see, I like women.

368
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,704
They don't always get a fair shake.

369
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,980
So you have no problem
with Jenny working in...

370
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,550
How did you put it,
what used to be a man's job?

371
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,352
Of course not.

372
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,993
I told those guys that she deserved a chance.

373
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,366
You know, I hope you're
wrong about those guys.

374
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,835
I have to go.

375
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,207
(MUSIC PLAYING)

376
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:33,054
The new age man. He likes
women, he understands them.

377
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,996
He tried to help Jenny.

378
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,556
And still she's dead.

379
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,533
Another ineffectual nice guy.

380
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,197
I wonder how helpful he really was.

381
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,767
These memos from Keith Ramsey
are about work procedures.

382
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,480
Where are the ones about sexual harassment?

383
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,949
We never got anything from him about that.

384
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:57,647
These memos concern his comments on
work proposals made by Ms. Sullivan.

385
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,020
"Putting more security
in the baggage terminal

386
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,218
"will result in additional costs.

387
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:06,559
"Ms. Sullivan's proposal
requires further study."

388
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,130
Ms. Sullivan, she wanted more
security in her department?

389
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,001
Apparently, yes.

390
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,036
EAMES: She thought incoming
mailbags were spending

391
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,402
too much time in the terminal.

392
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:19,238
She proposed rescheduling
pick-ups by the post office.

393
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:22,006
Ramsey said that she overstated the problem.

394
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,812
Every chance that he gets, he submarines her.

395
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,414
What's the date on her memo
about the mailbags?

396
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,921
August 25.

397
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:38,220
McCarthy poured urine
in her locker on the 27th.

398
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,028
Her security memo?

399
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,594
September 15th.

400
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:47,562
On September 18, she found
the glow stick in her car.

401
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:53,206
They were harassing her
in response to her memos.

402
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,242
Mailbags and security. Touchy subjects.

403
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,413
Identity fraud?

404
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,010
You have my attention.

405
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:07,546
Jenny complained that her workers
were taking unscheduled breaks.

406
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:12,119
These breaks coincided with flights
arriving from Sioux City and Bakersfield.

407
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,857
All the flights carried mailbags.

408
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,594
Sioux City is a distribution center
for major credit card companies.

409
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,397
Bakersfield is headquarters

410
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,836
for two credit reporting companies.

411
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,430
That's what was in those mailbags,

412
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,372
credit cards and credit reports.

413
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,705
Which were being stolen.

414
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,301
Which is what Jenny Sullivan uncovered?

415
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,677
There's no evidence that she
knew what was going on.

416
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,181
She was doing her job.

417
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,443
CARVER: Getting in the way.

418
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,416
They tried to drive her out by harassing her.

419
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,613
When that didn't work, they killed her.

420
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,952
The FBI has to be brought in on this.

421
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,923
Who's the ringleader, Ramsey?

422
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:46,119
The murder seems out of character for him.

423
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,456
The evidence against him won't
support an arrest warrant anyway.

424
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,399
We'll start with the others.

425
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,596
She was wound too tight.

426
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,004
I just ragged on her so
she'd loosen up, you know.

427
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,700
Yeah, loosen up.

428
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,613
Is that why you think the FBI's here?

429
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,552
It's the mailbags, Desmond.

430
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,153
That's why you wanted her to loosen up.

431
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,891
That's why you killed her.

432
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,156
I never went near those bags.

433
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,394
I took those breaks 'cause I
have a medical condition.

434
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,801
Right, the Sioux City mailbag syndrome.

435
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,568
I hear it's contagious.
Your buddies all caught it.

436
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,803
I swear I never opened those bags.

437
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,377
You're the only one of those
guys who touched her.

438
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,416
And killing her was that much easier?

439
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,950
It wasn't me.

440
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,047
I got nothing to say about mailbags.

441
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:47,483
But the killing, I'm not
taking the hit for that.

442
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,451
That was Walt. Walter Tate.

443
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,587
He messed with her car.

444
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,988
I did not steal from mailbags.

445
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,625
That's a federal crime. I'm no idiot.

446
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,963
I got a wife and kids.

447
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,867
Maybe you didn't steal, Walter,

448
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,803
but maybe you know those other guys did.

449
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,204
Desmond and Stuart.

450
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,005
You're not gonna get me to
say anything about anybody.

451
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:11,412
Well, you got a lot more character than
your buddies, Walter, I'll give you that.

452
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:15,007
One of them told us that you were seen
putting something in Jenny's tank.

453
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,485
That's a damn lie!

454
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,417
You talk to Bill Stuart.

455
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,082
You ask him why he washed
out the trunk of his car

456
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,752
the day after the murder.

457
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,127
That's right. People saw him.

458
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,632
I'm not going down for this.

459
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,258
I did not kill her.

460
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,236
If you know who did, Bill, now's the time.

461
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,933
Martinez. It’s Martinez.

462
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,478
Martinez drove out after her that night.

463
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,741
Somebody saw him.

464
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,750
I just put the mailbags in a room

465
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,309
and those other guys,
they took stuff out of them.

466
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,685
No. See, Martinez, you did more than

467
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,020
just push mailbags around the terminal.

468
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,616
There's what you did to Jenny.

469
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,526
That sex stuff? Yeah, that wasn't my idea.

470
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,757
I liked her.

471
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,958
Everybody was giving her such a hard time,

472
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,467
and she still brought us homemade cookies.

473
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,696
Cookies?

474
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,565
Keith said it was a peace offering.

475
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,866
EAMES: Something must've
been wrong with her baking

476
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,410
because somebody saw you
following her that night.

477
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,104
MARTINEZ: They didn't see me.

478
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,739
Desmond. He's the one followed her.

479
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,179
There isn't enough against Ramsey.

480
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,777
But with Martinez's statement,

481
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,187
the Bureau can proceed against
McCarthy, Stuart and Tate

482
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,987
for mail theft and fraud.

483
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:33,122
As far as the murder, well,
that's your jurisdiction.

484
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,588
Thanks for your help.

485
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,358
Well, at least they said thank you.

486
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,232
So now we have 4 murder suspects.

487
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,329
And 4 witnesses and 4 sets of facts.

488
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,396
This is not a promising development.

489
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,101
EAMES: These guys could've orchestrated this.

490
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,473
Not these 4.

491
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,573
Someone fed them those stories.

492
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:52,707
The same mind that put the
ping-pong ball in Jenny's car

493
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,742
is now playing ping-pong with us.

494
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,087
I had a very nice time. It's not that.

495
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,493
I just have a big day tomorrow.

496
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,794
I'll call you later this week.

497
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,696
Keith, I'll call you, okay?

498
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,426
I better get my coat.

499
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,278
SIMON: Keith. Keith.

500
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,757
Tell me some news, Keith.

501
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,691
We need to get back to business.

502
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,628
I told you I can't get
the documents right now.

503
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,063
It's too dangerous.

504
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,691
The cops are questioning my guys.

505
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,327
Your guys, they can hurt you.

506
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,368
My guys only know what I tell them.

507
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,136
You don't have to worry about them.

508
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,369
Okay.

509
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,245
Then I just worry about you.

510
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,718
Our new best friends at the FBI traced

511
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,386
the usage of the card numbers
stolen from the airport.

512
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,726
So far they're showing
over a million dollars

513
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,197
in long distance calls to Eastern Europe.

514
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,433
Our boys must be fencing
the cards to the Russians.

515
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,664
Such lovely business partners.

516
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,002
What're you looking for?

517
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,440
Cookies. Martinez said
that Jenny made them cookies.

518
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,603
(STAMMERING)
But it's not in here.

519
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,644
Maybe she had other things on her mind.

520
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,541
She wrote down everything else.

521
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:38,520
Here. Ramsey told her he discussed her
harassment with a woman's rights lawyer.

522
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:39,954
More bull.

523
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,892
She wrote down the lawyer's
name. Lucia Hastings.

524
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,724
Can you look it up in the
bar association directory?

525
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,390
Probably the only bar Lucia's associated with

526
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,729
is the cocktail lounge at the airport.

527
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,199
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

528
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,365
Well, what do you know. Lucia Hastings.

529
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,007
Associate at Markham & Frasier.

530
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:05,379
Like I said on the phone,
I don't know Keith very well.

531
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,042
Is one of his employees suing him?

532
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,786
Executives are such easy targets.

533
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,820
Executives like Keith?

534
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,550
He mentioned ever since he became a...

535
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,460
I'm so bad with titles.

536
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,656
Vice President.

537
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,892
Yeah, I know. But of what?
Do you still have his card?

538
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,093
Vice President of Operations.

539
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:29,298
I'm curious. How did my name come up?

540
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,008
You made an impression on him.

541
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,807
But then again, you are
his type. You met socially?

542
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,281
At a club. Ahmad's in SoHo.
Couple of months ago.

543
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:44,152
So what's he done? Embezzled company funds?

544
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,848
I'm surprised that you'd say that.

545
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:53,156
(STAMMERING)
'Cause, you know, he's such a nice guy.

546
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,262
Well, sure, he was nice.

547
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,129
EAMES: Nice enough to date?

548
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,394
I let him take me out to dinner.

549
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,165
How did the evening end?

550
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,696
Not the way he hoped.

551
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,978
And when you told him that you weren't
interested, how did he take it?

552
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,239
He just got very quiet.

553
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,673
I gave the waiter my card
to pay for the drinks.

554
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,946
I thought that was the least I could do.

555
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,918
Then I went to the powder room.

556
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,512
When I got back, Keith was gone,

557
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,251
and I haven't heard from him since.

558
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,260
Later on, did you notice anything
missing from your purse?

559
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,454
No.

560
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,121
How about your wallet?

561
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,759
- Credit card that you left on the table?
- No.

562
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,664
It was there when I got back.

563
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,031
How about when you got your
bill at the end of the month?

564
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,233
Well, as a matter of fact,
someone had charged

565
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,177
a bunch of phone calls
to Sarajevo of all places.

566
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,444
Of all places.

567
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,652
EAMES: He stole her credit card number

568
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,654
and passed it on to his Russian buddies.

569
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,485
CARVER: He masquerades as an airline exec.

570
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,956
That's what he does for sport?

571
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,789
Well, it's not a sport.
It's how he sees himself.

572
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,257
The waitresses at Ahmad's said he
comes in a couple of nights a week,

573
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,321
in a business suit, flashing a roll,

574
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,335
chats up one or two ladies
and usually goes home alone.

575
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,372
Home being The Dakota
across the hall from Yoko.

576
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,964
At least that's what he told the bartender.

577
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,565
I wish we could give him a new home.

578
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,668
The phone charges on Lucia Hastings' card

579
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,713
tie him to the mail theft ring.

580
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,406
That still leaves the murder.

581
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,575
Ramsey doesn't like confrontation.

582
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,351
It would take something
deeply threatening to trigger

583
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,945
the kind of rage that killed Jenny Sullivan.

584
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:29,358
I don't know what that trigger could be.

585
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,227
I can't see it yet.

586
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,022
(MUSIC PLAYING)

587
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,694
Thank you.

588
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,533
And one for the lady?

589
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,538
- No, thanks.
- Please.

590
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,833
I've been on the phone all day trying
to avert another airline strike.

591
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,504
And the only thing that'll
make me feel better

592
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,912
is if I can buy a beautiful woman a drink.

593
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,916
Well, thank you.

594
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,479
Thank you for accepting.

595
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,388
I am Keith.

Steffi.

597
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,190
What airline do you work for, Keith?

598
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,524
Trans Union.

599
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,862
I'm Vice President of Operations.

600
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,862
There's gonna be a strike?

601
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,438
Right now, I couldn't care less.

602
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,339
EAMES: Hi, Keith.

603
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,436
How fabulous to run into you.
I just got off the Concorde.

604
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,004
You know, when you finally take
over that airline of yours,

605
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,277
you should really buy a couple of those.

606
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,876
They are so fabulous. And who's this?

607
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,217
- Hi, I'm Alex.
- Steffi.

608
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,484
Steffi. What a cute name.

609
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:38,119
- EAMES: And you remember Bob?
Bob, the shipping magnate?
- Hi, Keith.

610
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,089
Did Alex tell you what she does for a living?

611
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,834
She's a queen.

612
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,392
Queen of Sheba.

613
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,233
(CHUCKLING)
They're pulling your leg.

614
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:52,833
No, no. Shipping magnate. Queen of Sheba.

615
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:56,675
And what was it, Vice President
of Trans Union Airlines?

616
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,182
It's so fabulous.

617
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,277
Why don't the 3 of us go back to our place

618
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,878
and talk about our fabulous jobs?

619
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,049
You know, you two are very
funny, but Steffi and I...

620
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:09,786
We even brought you an invitation.

621
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,327
We insist, Keith.

(HANDCUFFS SNAPPING)

623
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,230
I'm sorry.

Two hour wait to get an attorney
appointed to represent you.

00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:32,311
But I ran into two attorneys
I know who are taking cases.

Mr. Drotos, Ms. Broderick.

628
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,914
Both excellent. They've
looked at the complaint.

629
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,319
Your choice, Mr. Ramsey.

630
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,457
Mr. Drotos, why don't you have a seat?

631
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,790
All right.

632
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,367
No, wait. I don't want him. I want her.

634
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,578
EAMES: Do you two need a minute?

635
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,139
- Yeah, that would...
- No. I don't need a minute.

636
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,845
I didn't have anything
to do with any mail theft.

637
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,945
These charges are ridiculous.

638
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,482
So if you had $3,600 on you,

639
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,653
we shouldn't think anything of it?

640
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,157
A friend repaid a loan.

641
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,028
And this money clip, these cufflinks.

642
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,463
They're from Bulgari.

How much do you make
a year? Fifty, sixty grand?

644
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,036
Those are gifts.

645
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,738
From your many admirers?

646
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,109
This...

647
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,113
It's a Kiton jacket. That's $5,000.

648
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,447
Was this a gift or did it fall out
of a suitcase in the lost and found?

649
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,717

answer any of their questions.

You know, Keith might just be a
supervisor of baggage handlers,

655
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:06,604
but he's really a lot more sophisticated
than you give him credit for.

656
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,333
Let's stay on point.

657
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:13,476
All right, the point is,
is that he is a high-flying

658
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,781
airline executive trapped
in the life of a nobody.

659
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,843
I mean, isn't that right, Keith?

660
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,586

If you just wanted to get lucky,

you should've hit on the

He doesn't want waitresses. Do you?

666
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,271
You want thoroughbreds.

00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:38,634
Why not?

669
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,109
And that's why you stole the credit cards

670
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:45,005
to bankroll this man of the
world you needed to be.

671
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,846
I had nothing to do with that.

672
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,517
Do you remember Lucia Hastings?

673
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,316
You mentioned her to Jenny.

674
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,290
Jenny wrote about everything.

675
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,521
He lifted her credit card number.

676
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,190
I did no such thing.

These are the calls to Eastern Europe
that were charged to her card.

The same phone numbers
also appear on the bills

679
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,105
for credit cards stolen from
the mailbags at the airport.

680
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,540
I did not lift Lucia's credit card number.

Before we arrested him, we
searched your apartment.

Not the one at The Dakota, the other one.

684
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:30,521
And we found these things in
a drawer in your bedroom.

00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,018
It's a Chanel scarf.

Mr. Ramsey, I really think we need
to talk before this continues.

693
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,787
This must be really embarrassing for you.

694
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:09,696
For a classy woman to
see you for what you are.

695
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,397
It's not what you think.

696
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,294
You know what I think?

697
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,171
I think that

698
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:22,171
you really resent women
who frustrate your plans.

699
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,977
Like Lucia, like Jenny.

Isn't that what the notebook said?

702
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,419
That I helped her?

703
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,489
You wanted her out of the way.

00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,817
It was those other guys.

00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,986
I told her not to provoke them.

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,031
But she baked them cookies.
How was that provocative?

707
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:47,035
Where'd you hear about that?
Did she write about it?

708
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,132
No, she didn't.

709
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,706
You told the guys that
they were a peace offering.

710
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,672
Yeah, I told Jenny they
wouldn't appreciate it.

711
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,089
You were worried there for a moment.

712
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,454
(STAMMERING)
No, what do you mean?

713
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,493
That she'd written about the cookies.

714
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,528
She wrote about everything else.

715
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,937
Each instance of sexual harassment

716
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,134
but not one word about the cookies.

717
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:30,071
What is the big deal about a tin of cookies?

718
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,606
She didn't bake them for the guys.

719
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,243
She baked them for you.

720
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,210
No.

721
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,820
That's why she didn't write
about it 'cause it was private.

722
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,880
I mean, she had a thing for you.

723
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,887
I don't know anything about it.

724
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,222
Well, why not?

725
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,929
A man of the world. How could you miss it?

726
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,226
No, no,

727
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,426
you gave her a shoulder to cry on.

728
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,027
Right?

729
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:59,439
And she looked up at you
with those big cow eyes.

730
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,601
That's insulting!

731
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,838
No, no, no, you see, I get it now.

732
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,380
She liked you.

733
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,282
But the funny thing is, with
all her memos and complaints,

734
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,288
she was gonna screw everything up for you.

735
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,846
- No more Steffis.
- Not true.

736
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,824
No more man of the world.

737
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,288
The only thing that would be left would be

738
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,198
Jenny Sullivan.

739
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,433
The booby prize.

740
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,166
That would never happen.

741
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:30,865
Jenny thought it could.

742
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,640
How could she?

743
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,507
(STUTTERING)
How could she think

744
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,604
that I would even be seen
with somebody like her?

745
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,210
Well, why not?

746
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,246
I mean, maybe she didn't look
so hot in a cocktail dress,

747
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,381
but unlike those uptown girls,

748
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,291
she would've gladly jumped into
the sack with you with both feet.

749
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:55,359
Never in a million years would I
let something like that happen.

750
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,455
Mr. Ramsey...

751
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,864
Shut up.

752
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,608
So why were you so resistant?

753
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,305
Is it because you thought she was crummy?

754
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,750
Like your job, like your office?

755
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,220
She just didn't belong.

756
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,415
Like you?

757
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,493
You were afraid that people would think

758
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:32,399
that girl is the best, a crummy, little
nobody like Keith could ever hope for.

759
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,898
No. I am better than that.

760
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,297
Well, Jenny presumed to think otherwise,

761
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:41,310
and so you taught her a lesson.

762
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,810
It was those other guys.

763
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,306
Keith,

764
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,753
she would've never gotten into their car.

765
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,050
She didn't trust them.

766
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,792
She only trusted you.

767
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,366
And that's why we know you did it, Keith.

768
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,735
You looked at her and you saw yourself.

769
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,971
Your true, crummy self.

770
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,842
And that made you angry at her.

771
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:20,108
She got in your way, right?

772
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,082
And you got angry at her.

773
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,778
She loved you, and you were angry at her.

774
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,524
She trusted you. Angry.

775
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,320
So you beat the life out of her.

776
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,724
God! No!

777
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:32,955
You punished her!

778
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,520
That dumpy bitch! Why didn't she just quit?

779
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,122
Why didn't she...

780
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,590
Don't look at me that way!

781
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,171
Don't look at me.

782
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:46,766
(YELLING)

783
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,588
CARVER: That's the problem with most men.

784
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,989
They want what they can't get,
and don't want what they have.

785
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,823
No. The problem with men
is they talk too much.
