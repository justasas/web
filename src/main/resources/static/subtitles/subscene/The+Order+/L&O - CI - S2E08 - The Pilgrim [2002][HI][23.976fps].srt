1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,681
In New York City's war on crime,

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,045
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,780
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,583
These are their stories.

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,455
Sorry I'm late.

6
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,793
I wanted to find that wine you like, and
I had to go all the way to the bowery.

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,396
Al, honey?

8
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,835
What?

9
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:33,939
No way.

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:35,802
No way.

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,174
(PHONE RINGING)
Pick up. Pick up.

12
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,412
(ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPING)

13
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,613
It's me.

14
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,716
I thought things were really great,

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,185
and now I find this typed
letter not even signed?

16
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,625
You have to talk to me, AI.

17
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:55,827
If this has anything to do with my
parents coming, it's really not okay.

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,101
I'm not mad,

19
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,362
I just wanna talk.

20
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,375
Maybe he's just scared of committing.

21
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,969
The way you talk about your dad.

22
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,844
It's not my dad. It's him.

23
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,875
He's got somebody else.

24
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,685
I could just kill him.
If you could find him.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,118
Oh, I'll find him.

26
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,116
Watch this.

27
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,458
Al, this is Leslie again.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,526
You don't call me in the next 12
hours, you're in big trouble.

29
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,931
(SIGHING)
I know what's been going on at school.

30
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,297
Like that ever works.

31
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,268
I gotta go to the gym, see you.

32
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:35,968
Please, honey,

33
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,903
just call me.

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,937
Please.

35
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,755
If you don't have enough money why
don't you put back the vermouth?

36
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:54,020
You can't make a martini
without vermouth, okay?

37
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,059
How much you need?

38
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,226
Oh, no, that's okay.

39
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,231
COUNTERMAN: She needs 80 cents.

40
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,859
Here.

41
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,136
If you give me your address,
I'll send you the money.

42
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,804
Forget it.

43
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,847
NEAL: Thanks for letting us in.

44
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,077
I don't know why she didn't
meet us at the airport.

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,414
NANCY: Leslie?

46
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,348
Yoo hoo? It's Mom, we're here.

47
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,056
What's this?

48
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,365
NEAL: Leslie?

49
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,803
Her purse and her wallet
and her keys are here.

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,230
Please call the police.

51
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,275
Maybe she's visiting somebody in the...
Just call them now. And use your cell.

52
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,072
And don't touch anything.

53
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,419
Missing woman is Leslie Dornan.

54
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,985
Neighbors haven't seen her since yesterday.

55
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,553
She have a boyfriend, girlfriend?

56
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,963
Not according to her folks.
Her father's a cop?

57
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,558
Pittsburgh PD, retired.

58
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,001
Guess he knew which strings to
pull to get Major Case here.

59
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,199
This turns into anything, we'll
put you in on the collar.

60
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,374
Go ahead, impress me.

61
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,477
It's Aramaic.

62
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,415
GOREN: It's the language
that Christ spoke in.

63
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,978
Parts of the Old Testament
were written in it.

64
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,955
But don't ask me what it means.

65
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,825
GOREN: This is Aramaic too.

66
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,266
Mr. and Mrs. Dornan?

67
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,002
Is that your daughter's handwriting?

68
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,709
I don't know. I can't tell.

69
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,347
This wall-hanging here?

70
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,586
My mother brought that back
from Turkey. It's the Lord's Prayer.

71
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:40,352
But I don't think that
Leslie knew that language.

72
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,560
EAMES: The last time you talked
to her, how did she sound?

73
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,153
NEAL: She sounded fine.

74
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:49,462
Leslie wouldn't hurt herself.
She loves life, she's a fighter.

75
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,033
The detective said you didn't think
Leslie was involved with anybody.

76
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,231
NANCY: No, she wasn't.

77
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,002
Well, she definitely had a regular visitor.

78
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,673
This is hair gel.

79
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:10,216
He liked to sit here and watch TV.

80
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,048
He'd rest his head against the wall.

81
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,228
Those are scuff marks.

82
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,703
He liked to put his feet on the table.

83
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,696
Well, he's tall.

84
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,435
Six, 6'4"...

85
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,511
If she had a boyfriend...

86
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,749
Why didn't she tell you?

87
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,612
EAMES: How about you tell us
about her boyfriend?

88
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,178
Al? They broke up last Tuesday.

89
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,520
Leslie came home, his stuff was gone.

90
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,986
She was furious.

91
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,119
She kept leaving messages on his phone,

92
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,992
how she was gonna make trouble for him.

93
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,931
Let's start with Al's full name. Alan what?

94
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,862
It's not Alan. It's Ali Al-Javad.
He's Moroccan.

95
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,870
He's a grad student at Hunter.

96
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,409
Is that why she didn't tell her parents
about him? Because he's Moroccan?

97
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,034
Her dad could be pretty intense.

98
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,039
She must have really liked him.

99
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,014
He made her feel so special.

100
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,150
He bought her expensive gifts, antiques.

101
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,416
I noticed the coffee table.

102
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,854
That was a gift?

103
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,654
Yes. He had me buy that for
her in Amsterdam last summer.

104
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,054
He just gave you a bunch of money

105
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,622
and told you to buy what you want?

106
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,895
No. He gave me the name of the antique store.

107
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,300
They took care of the shipping.

108
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,703
Who picked up the coffee table on this end?

109
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,365
JANEY: We all did.

110
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:40,042
We took my brother's van to
the customs broker in Jersey.

111
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,611
Just the table. Nothing else?

112
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,376
Yes.

113
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,479
If you're trying to freak
me out, it's working.

114
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,786
(sighing)

115
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,852
How did Al and Leslie meet?

116
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,455
You're embarrassed. Did
he pick her up in a bar

117
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,220
or maybe a chat room?

118
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,759
It's not sleazy.

119
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,296
It's the Singular Singles website.

120
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,064
You can see their video,

121
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,163
hear what they have to say.

122
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,336
It's not like a total pick-up.

123
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,845
I love dancing salsa and singing karaoke.

124
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,644
EAMES: This is the boyfriend, Ali Al-Javad.

125
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,117
My dream girl is a full-figured American lady

126
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,653
who loves to laugh.

127
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,414
Give me some mail.

128
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,683
No, he's not Moroccan.

129
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,747
When Moroccans speak English,
they sound French.

130
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,919
I'd put this guy further east.

131
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,621
How about we put him in this seat?

132
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,028
You talk to his college?

133
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,656
Well, he registered two years ago.

134
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,758
Took a full load the first semester and then

135
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,894
one class each semester after that.

136
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,736
Just enough to satisfy the
requirements of his student visa.

137
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,368
And then he found a girlfriend.
Someone vulnerable,

138
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,105
grateful for the attention.

139
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,477
Somebody who'd be afraid
to ask too many questions.

140
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,174
He moved in with her,

141
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:52,842
everything's in her name.

142
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,544
He stays off the radar.

143
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,945
He's a sleeper.

144
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,352
(scoffing)

145
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,754
Maybe, just maybe, this
guy doesn't like school.

146
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,349
Maybe he's just here for a good time.

147
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,757
We still have a missing woman.

148
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,093
A 33-year-old single woman who'd
been drinking, who'd been dumped.

149
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,859
I mean... Someone

150
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,129
is trying very hard to convince
us she committed suicide.

151
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,239
This is the translation off the wall
writing. It's from the Old Testament.

152
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,706
The Song of Songs.

153
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,370
"Night after night on my bed,
I have sought my true love.

154
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,709
"I have sought him but not found him.

155
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,806
"I have called him but he has not answered."

156
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,217
They wanted to write a suicide note,

157
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,055
but they couldn't fake her handwriting,

158
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,584
so they wrote it in Aramaic.

159
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,089
Ali took a flight out of Newark
to Germany Tuesday night.

160
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,100
The day before Leslie disappeared.

161
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,864
One of his buddies must
have taken care of her.

162
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,802
He left the country
the same day he left her?

163
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,365
Well, whatever job he had
to do here, it was over.

164
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:55,345
Look at this itinerary. He had
to connect through Atlanta and Paris.

165
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,645
No. He could have flown direct
from JFK for half the price.

166
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,810
Maybe he was hooking up
with somebody in those cities.

167
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,421
Or maybe it was about leaving out of Newark.

168
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,151
He had something to do in New Jersey
before getting on that plane.

169
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,419
The table.

170
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,291
The table he had Leslie's
friend buy in Amsterdam,

171
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,560
it was shipped to a customs broker in Jersey.

172
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,892
An antique that he could have
bought in SoHo for less money.

173
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,129
It was a dry run.

174
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,263
He was testing the customs inspection.

175
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,635
He brought something else in.

176
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,198
He had to take delivery of it or
maybe hand it off to somebody

177
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,074
before leaving the country.

178
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,175
AUDREY: Tuesday, yes,

179
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,317
Mr. Al-Javad picked up a crate of
household goods from the Netherlands.

180
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,821
Did Customs inspect it?

181
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,117
Inspect?

182
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,453
Oh, the crate?

183
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,484
You're kidding, right?

184
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,591
I guess we are.

185
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,425
How large a crate was it?

186
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,991
Three foot by three foot.
Weight, 80 pounds.

187
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,526
The container the crate was shipped
in, where would that be now?

188
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,337
Ali's crate was loaded in first.
That would put it somewhere in the back.

189
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,811
You know, we get about six million
containers a year coming in,

190
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,546
(DOG BARKING)
and we only check about 2% of them.

191
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,641
The more I know the less I sleep.

192
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,883
This corner here is positive for explosives.

193
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,752
Do you have any idea how much?

194
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,054
Judging by the way Homer's
bouncing around, I'd say a lot.

195
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,594
So much for sleep.

196
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,777
The lab tests from the container
came back positive for Titadine.

197
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,752
It's a high-yield, high-grade
form of dynamite.

198
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,381
Titadine.

199
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,558
There was an advisory
on that stuff last year.

200
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,652
8 tons of it were stolen
from a factory in France.

201
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,155
Most of it's unaccounted for.

202
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,391
Until this morning.

203
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,900
The Feds and the Joint Task Force
are gonna be all over this.

204
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,993
You're not suggesting we bow out.

205
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,372
Hell, no. We've got a
suspected homicide to clear.

206
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,573
Where are we with
Mr. Al-Javad's accomplices?

207
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,804
We found a number of prints
from the rental van.

208
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,709
I like this guy. Jorge Galvez.

209
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,271
His prints were on the inside
of the cargo area of the van.

210
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,375
He's got a juvenile record
in Baltimore. It's gang related.

211
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,852
Then he served three years
here for assaulting a motorist

212
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,253
over a fender bender.

213
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,585
A rageaholic.

214
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,658
Since he was paroled two
years ago, he's been clean.

215
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,859
Not even a parking ticket.

216
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,160
His last year in prison he worked
in the library, he got his GED.

217
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,229
Something put him back
on the straight and narrow.

218
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,034
A religious conversion?

219
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,634
He wouldn't be the first person
to find God behind bars.

220
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,172
Some people find Allah.
Some people find Jesus.

221
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,544
There are a lot of teams in the league.

222
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:49,552
Galvez finished his parole, but maybe
his PO is still in touch with him.

223
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,583
ABE: Jorge hasn't worked here
since a year ago last spring.

224
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,786
What happened to him?

225
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,954
He went to the hospital. His appendix burst.

226
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,429
After that he disappeared.

227
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,797
His last paycheck I mailed to
his apartment, it got returned.

228
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,335
EAMES: You meet any of his friends?

229
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,235
Just the people from the
prison outreach program.

230
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,139
GOREN: What about his religious friends?

231
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:16,309
His parole officer told us that he
converted to Islam when he was in prison.

232
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,379
And I can see that you sell halal chicken,

233
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,513
meaning it's slaughtered
according to Muslim tradition.

234
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,825
I know that your community
has had a rough year

235
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,696
and we are not looking
to make things any worse.

236
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,628
There's a missing girl.

237
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,532
Jorge might be involved. We need to find him.

238
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,708
I took him to our mosque, helped him with
his Arabic so he could read the Koran.

239
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,006
Jorge had this big chip on his shoulder.

240
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,516
He'd talk a lot of trash about
America, how oppressed he was.

241
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:57,180
I told him, you stop breaking the
law, you won't feel so oppressed.

242
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:01,284
When Jorge went to the
emergency for his appendix,

243
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,828
who took care of him? A girlfriend?

244
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,523
A nurse. He was at Mount Sinai
for over a week.

245
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,623
A week? I like your health coverage.

246
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,792
(scoffing)

247
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,936
Our health coverage is my wife's chicken
soup. We don't cover hospitals.

248
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,998
Somebody had to guarantee that hospital bill.

249
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,646
I just signed the hospital papers.
The prison outreach program

250
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,512
that I was working with at the time,
they had a fund for that sort of thing.

251
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,482
Have you seen Jorge since?

252
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,953
No. Once his parole was up,
we didn't keep in touch.

253
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,787
Excuse me.

254
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,388
(INAUDIBLE)

255
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,894
That's a smart question, Randy.

256
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,395
That's your name, right?

257
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,922
Randy asked why the Greek Bible
is called the Septuagint.

258
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,297
Septua means 70

259
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:50,500
and the story is that it took 70 scholars
to translate the Hebrew Bible into Greek.

260
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:56,404
At the great library at Alexandria
in Egypt, right, Mr. Edwards?

261
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,976
Right.

262
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,545
The library and its 700,000
books were destroyed by fire

263
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,281
over 1,300 years ago.

264
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,754
My mother was a librarian.

265
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,790
They just built a new library
on the site of the original.

266
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,593
This time with state of
the art smoke detectors.

267
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,532
You've been?

268
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,701
I've read about it.

269
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:22,365
I'm one of five people who actually
reads the Smithsonian magazine.

270
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,100
Six.

271
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,900
Yeah, one of six.

272
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,844
I should get back to class.

273
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,381
Substitute teacher.

274
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,245
You must like punishment.

275
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,351
I like making a contribution.

276
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,852
I wish you could make one to our case.

277
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,220
He had an uncle in Baltimore. A dry cleaner.

278
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,921
He was talking about hitting him up for work.

279
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,398
I hope that helps.

280
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,495
Jorge's uncle, the dry cleaner,
died three years ago.

281
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,596
So either Jorge lied to Edwards
or Edwards lied to us.

282
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,163
What's this?

283
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,676
It's the Smithsonian article on
the new library in Alexandria.

284
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,347
When Edwards mentioned smoke
detectors, it didn't ring a bell.

285
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,782
You actually read this when it came out?

286
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,780
The magazine's the perfect
size for my treadmill.

287
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,756
There's nothing in here
about smoke detectors.

288
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,823
And since there's no reason Edwards
would mention a detail like that...

289
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,055
He's been to Egypt in the last year.

290
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,487
The State Department would know.

291
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,799
The Egyptian consulate in
Munich issued a tourist visa

292
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,134
to Ethan Edwards a year ago last June.

293
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,435
A week later, they issued
another one to Jorge Galvez.

294
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,476
They both got passports in April last year.

295
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,568
They both left the country in the same week,

296
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,408
and they both got back two months ago.

297
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,210
Sounds like they had a meeting of the minds.

298
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,150
Edwards' co-workers, at the outreach
program, they knew he was a Muslim,

299
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,588
but he didn't become political
until he met Jorge Galvez.

300
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,351
The school board have an address on Edwards?

301
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,983
Just a PO box.

302
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,255
I'll get Carver working on a
subpoena for the postal records.

303
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,160
You two call the task force.

304
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,762
- Bedroom clear!
- Bathroom clear!

305
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,897
MAN: Living room clear!

306
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,937
(SIREN WAILING)

307
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,418
This is not good.

308
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,189
It's rat poison.

309
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,600
Rat poison's an anticoagulant.

310
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:10,074
Suicide bombers in Israel, they
use it to mix with the shrapnel

311
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,607
when making bombs.

312
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,410
The idea is

313
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,173
when their victims are wounded,
they bleed to death.

314
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,849
A suicide bomber.

315
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,378
When the hell did this kid decide

316
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,945
that's what he wanted to be when he grows up?

317
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,515
Doesn't look like he's planning to grow up.

318
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,294
EAMES: This is the crate
they shipped from overseas.

319
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,491
The K-9 unit came up positive for explosives.

320
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,832
Once we get all this weighed, we'll know
how much Titadine we have to worry about.

321
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,962
Edwards lived here alone
until a couple of weeks ago,

322
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,940
another man described as male, Hispanic.

323
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,200
Galvez.

324
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,743
EAMES: We couldn't get a positive ID.

325
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,336
At this point, we're not sure which
one's the actual suicide bomber.

326
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,881
It could be a suicide bomber,

327
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,974
or they might try and use
a remote-controlled device.

328
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,383
Well, I'm going with a suicide bomber.

329
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,478
You see here, here and here.

330
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,825
Something was taped to the wall.

331
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,385
The paint was ripped off
when it was taken down.

332
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,423
And duct tape residue.

333
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,731
The sheet was used as a backdrop.

334
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,434
And...

335
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,538
These three marks.

336
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,114
Probably a tripod.

337
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,607
I think they made a

338
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,617
video tape.

339
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,548
A suicide note.

340
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:38,720
The Bureau feels releasing any information
to the public is counterproductive.

341
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,822
It might even provoke these people
to step up their operation.

342
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,094
They already know we got their scent.

343
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,668
We weighed that crate, they
have 50 pounds of Titadine,

344
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,702
they made a vest, they're good to go.

345
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,369
Agent O'Dell, it's established
practice to let the eyes and ears

346
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,743
of the American public help us
deal with terrorist threats.

347
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,382
For once we have more to offer
them than a color scheme.

348
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,385
We have the actual photos of the terrorists

349
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:07,684
which the District Attorney will
recommend be released to the media.

350
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,761
I'll let my people know that.

351
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,401
We're still tracking down Galvez's
associates and relatives here

352
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,560
and in Baltimore.

353
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,399
We got some background on Edwards,

354
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,336
he might have family up in Westchester.

355
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,534
Which one is the designated martyr?

356
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,841
Galvez took electronics courses in prison.

357
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,910
He probably assembled the bomb.

358
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,417
Which leaves Edwards the job of carrying it.

359
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,817
What are his qualifications?

360
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,348
Theology major at Manhattan
University with a minor in languages.

361
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:44,884
He speaks Spanish, Arabic, working
knowledge of Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic.

362
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,226
Everything you'd need to study
the Bible in the original text.

363
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,289
He volunteers in soup kitchens.

364
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,303
He mentored kids in inner city schools.

365
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,703
How can a man with that background
murder innocent people?

366
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,774
Well, that's probably why he
made a tape. To explain himself.

367
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,744
We can always ask his parents.

368
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,549
JOE: it's because of his religious beliefs,

369
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,779
that's why you singled him out.

370
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,981
Mr. Edwards, will you please
just answer my question?

371
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,285
He called last July. He was in Phoenix.

372
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,587
He'd just gotten back from
traveling around Europe.

373
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:20,062
And Egypt. He got a visa for Egypt last year.

374
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,857
Yes, he visited Egypt.

375
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,195
Why aren't you telling us
anything? Is Ethan hurt?

376
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,294
We spoke to Ethan three days ago.

377
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,898
GOREN: He's working as a
substitute teacher in Queens.

378
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,039
Did you know that's what he was doing?

379
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,842
No. If Ethan wanted us to know he
was here, he would've told us.

380
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,844
Mr. Edwards, I need you to
unlock the door to the garage.

381
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,113
(DOG BARKING)

382
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,486
This woman is missing.

383
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,062
Leslie Dornan.

384
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,497
Maybe Ethan

385
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,133
knows what happened to her.

386
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,394
Is she his girlfriend?

387
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,461
No.

388
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,804
It's complicated.

389
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,001
Ethan would never hurt anyone.
He's a very ethical person.

390
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,640
Well, he's certainly familiar
with the Ten Commandments.

391
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:15,683
He's got the Torah, the Koran, the Bible

392
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,046
with notes written in the margins.

393
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,386
He followed a path of study.

394
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,021
He probably would've been a minister
if it weren't for his father.

395
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,325
Your husband doesn't like religion?

396
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,003
Joe's a chemist. He likes tangible things.

397
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,501
And Ethan embraced the intangible.

398
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,037
Have you ever talked to him
about his conversion to Islam?

399
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,882
He said it made him feel

400
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,855
centered and connected
to something bigger than him.

401
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,691
When was this picture taken?

402
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,995
That's the summer I took Ethan to
do volunteer work in Appalachia.

403
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,432
He was just ten.

404
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,035
Did your husband take that picture?

405
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,368
No. Joe didn't go with us.

406
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,773
It wasn't a good time in your marriage?

407
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,982
Maybe it brought you and Ethan closer.

408
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,616
When Ethan was traveling,

409
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,750
maybe he contacted you
more than your husband.

410
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,124
He sent me e-mails. He called me once,

411
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,286
after the attacks.

412
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,059
I wasn't sure where he was.

413
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,236
Did he talk about the attacks?

414
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,072
He wanted to know if anyone
we knew had been hurt.

415
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,705
He sounded very shaky.
He wanted to come home,

416
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,714
but he said he had things he had to do first.

417
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,821
You're probably the one person
that he's afraid to disappoint.

418
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,488
Oh, he knows that couldn't happen.

419
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,491
You said that Ethan was

420
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,721
looking for a connection to
something bigger than himself.

421
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:08,361
Now, if he found people
that offered that connection,

422
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,730
he might be persuaded to do things

423
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,402
that he found morally repugnant.

424
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,972
What things?

425
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,706
A suicide bombing.

426
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,369
Oh, my God, no.

427
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,641
Oh, Ethan.

428
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,876
You can help us bring him in.

429
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,381
As we reported earlier, Vera Edwards,

430
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,950
the mother of fugitive terrorist
suspect Ethan Edwards,

431
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,893
Suffered a massive heart attack

432
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:44,025
after being informed that her son might
be a member of a terrorist cell.

433
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,729
A spokesperson for St. Peters hospital

434
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:50,865
says that Mrs. Edwards remains
in very critical condition.

435
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,170
In fact...

436
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:56,102
We're monitoring the hospital, the
parents' house, phones, e-mails.

437
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,375
In the hopes he'll reach out
to his dying mother?

438
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,010
CARVER: Detective Goren feels that
she's a role model for Edwards.

439
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,145
They've got something.

440
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:05,917
You raised me

441
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:10,520
to believe you can't take
without giving back.

442
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,398
So really, this is a path
I was always meant to walk.

443
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,230
Tell everyone that there's a message coming,

444
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,299
and America better read it carefully

445
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,639
because it's being written
in a language it understands.

(BEEPS)

447
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,413
It was e-mailed to his parents.

448
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,007
It's clean, nothing embedded, no
way to trace where it came from.

449
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,448
This is a streaming video, right?

450
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,887
Like the videos on Singular Singles?

451
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,654
The software to process
and send a streaming video,

452
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,694
are they all the same?

453
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,701
No. There are different kinds.

454
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,975
And each one would have
a signature on the video?

455
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,210
Sure. Why?

456
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,308
Hello, I'm Khalid.

457
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,210
I'm a stock analyst with an MBA
from Wharton School of Business.

458
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,721
I enjoy sports...

459
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,689
This is the only video
I found on Singular Singles

460
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:17,956
that uses the same software
as the Edwards video.

461
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,692
I like romantic dinners and long
walks in the city at night.

462
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:26,134
Let's give him his long walk.

463
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,035
Get his phone number and
address from the website.

464
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,866
I got pizza.

466
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,953

00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,524
Get him down, get him down!

468
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,395
He was gonna kill Edwards.

469
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,259
GOREN: Keep Edwards from talking.

470
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,767
Talk about what? We got the bomb.

471
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,006
One of the bombs.

472
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:14,281
This vest weighs about 40 pounds

473
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,315
and minus the shrapnel.

474
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,022
We've only got about 20,
25 pounds of explosives here.

475
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,961
There's another vest out there.

EAMES: Our search of Khalid's
place didn't turn up any leads

477
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,135
to Jorge or to what their target might be.

478
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:36,366
These items were in Ethan's knapsack.

479
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,907
We're not sure what this is.

"1/55@31 ."

481
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,705
It doesn't correspond to any address.

482
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:46,341
The Bureau is assuming Galvez and Edwards
were planning a coordinated attack.

483
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,009
The first man detonates in a crowd.

484
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,178
The second man waits for
rescue personnel to arrive

485
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,552
or targets the crowd
fleeing the first explosion.

486
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,386
All we need is when and where.

487
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,689
Well, they'd pick a confined space
to maximize the concussive power

488
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,660
of the shock waves bouncing off the walls.

489
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,994
If we assume Galvez sticks to the plan.

490
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,226
DEAKINS: Do we have a choice?

491
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,666
The task force turned up
an e-ticket in Khalid's name

492
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,102
for a flight out of JFK
to Madrid tomorrow night.

493
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,198
If this follows the MO, it means his
part of the job would be over by then.

494
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,869
Which puts the target date for the
operation within days from now.

495
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,411
Step into him fast.

496
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,481
You're an American citizen,
Ethan. Born and raised.

497
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,021
Free to worship in
a religion of your choice.

498
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:31,258
How can you sit there and let
Jorge kill innocent Americans?

499
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,228
Well, maybe what they say is true,

500
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,626
you're a traitor.

501
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,035
The worst kind of scum.

502
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,005
No, I'm not a traitor.

503
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,439
One nation under God.

504
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,713
My allegiance is to God, to Allah.

505
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,908
Killing in the name of God is good?

506
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,082
It's better to kill in the name of oil?

507
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,118
I don't get it, Ethan.

508
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,056
Your family told us you were upset by 9/11.

509
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,487
It was a mistake.

510
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,126
It was too much.

511
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,691
But then America sent gun ships and
killed hundreds of innocent people,

512
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,393
women, children.

513
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,533
9/11 was a terrible lesson
that no one learned.

514
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,331
So we need what? A refresher course?

515
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,569
Look, I'm sure that he has it all worked out.

516
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,978
Anyway, this is all,
you know, big-picture stuff.

517
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,719
My partner and I, we're here
for the little picture.

00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,686
For Leslie Dornan.

519
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,053
Her parents just wanna bury her.

520
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,059
You know, it just occurred to me that
you haven't asked about your mom.

521
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,099
You don't wanna know how she is?

522
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,066
How is she?

523
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,195
EAMES: We're working on the
barter system here, Ethan.

524
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,900
You give us something, we give you something.

525
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,577
You're afraid.

526
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,514
No, you're afraid that
you're gonna fail this test.

527
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,521
That those other guys were right.

528
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,955
Who?

529
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,686
What are you talking about?

530
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,321
Well, the reason why
Khalid tried to kill you.

531
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,127
To protect the operation. I accept that.

532
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,958
He knew it.

533
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:22,870
And the other guys at the
training camp, they knew it, too.

534
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:30,841
Ethan, when it comes right down to
it, this is really not your fight.

535
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,646
I mean, you don't have centuries of injustice

536
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,047
and colonial oppression
to harden your resolve.

537
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,252
I'm a Muslim.

538
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,750
It's my fight, too.

539
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,792
You know,

540
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,958
I read the Koran a long time ago.

541
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,295
When I was in the army,
I was stationed in Germany.

542
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,240
And there was this girl who lived
near the base, she was Turkish.

543
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,835
She was Muslim. I wanted to impress her.

544
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,972
And you know, it's really
not what you'd expect.

545
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,343
For example,

546
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:14,517
they recognize the right for women to
vote, to own and inherit property.

547
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,993
To divorce their husbands.

548
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,764
And this was written what?
Like 1,300 years ago.

549
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,299
It's the true word of God.

550
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:26,768
Well, you would know. You've
been looking for the true word.

551
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,466
You've been searching for God.

552
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:39,082
But there's one thing
that I couldn't find in here.

553
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,682
And that's the part where

554
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,617
Allah, you know, tells
everybody to just go ahead

555
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,418
and indiscriminately kill innocent people.

556
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,426
I mean, that part, that's not in here.
I mean, where is that?

557
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,792
Must be in some secret chapter.

558
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,924
But it isn't because I didn't
miss it, did I, Ethan?

559
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:01,998
I mean, it's exactly what
my Muslim friends told me

560
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,336
is that it's not in the Koran.

561
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,539
That there's no sanction for
what you were planning to do

562
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,181
and what Jorge still plans to do.

563
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,115
No, we weren't...

564
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,987
You weren't what?

565
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,558
Let me show you something.

566
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,307
This x-ray is of a suicide
bomb victim in Israel.

567
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,607
This victim has no external
injuries, no shrapnel wounds.

568
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,008
Just this white mass.

569
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,588
Emergency room doctors
call this the white butterfly.

570
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,787
It's what the heart and lungs
and other internal organs

571
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,028
look like after they've been turned into soup

572
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,664
by the concussion from the bomb.

573
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:14,069
Ethan, what I want to know is
you went searching for God,

574
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,173
how did you end up looking for targets?

575
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,319
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

576
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,815
That's probably news about your mother.

577
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,621
Oh, by the way,

578
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,260
this x-ray is of a five-year-old girl.

579
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,673
I was sent by God.

580
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,137
So are we.

581
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,676
(door shuts)

582
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,977
We have to consider another option.

583
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,543
Sodium Amytal.

584
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,644
Truth serum?

585
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,748
I've seen it used on Soviet
defectors, and it didn't work.

586
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,987
If we inject him, we'll lose his
trust, and it'll waste time.

587
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,361
Ethan is a difficult subject, and we
have nothing to leverage him with.

588
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,263
We have his sense of morality.

589
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,633
His sense of morality is what
got us here in the first place.

590
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,633
The FBI has access to it, doesn't it?

591
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:20,035
I'm not getting squat without
authorization from Justice.

592
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,270
The new FBI.

593
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,922
Well, isn't that what the President said?

594
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,524
You're either with us or against us?

595
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:41,289
He sees the world in high
contrast. It's black and white.

596
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,967
Our way or the highway.

597
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,669
ETHAN: He has no idea what we sound
like to the rest of the world.

598
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,002
Washington's still making up its mind.

599
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:52,634
Progress?

600
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,237
So, you gonna lead us out of our ignorance?

601
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,780
I just want America

602
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,779
and the West to stop trying
to control the destiny

603
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,319
of my Muslim brothers and sisters.

604
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:04,915
Surgery?

605
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,123
So, you think by blowing yourself up

606
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,219
is a step in the right direction?

607
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,892
Martyrdom has a lot of symbolic value.

608
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,568
Buddhist monks set themselves on fire

609
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,934
to protest their religious persecution.

610
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:26,269
A man did it at the Pentagon in the
'60s to protest the Vietnam war.

611
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,637
And they were understood loud and clear

612
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,839
because they didn't muddy it
up by killing other people.

613
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,815
You ever think about that
instead of a suicide bomb?

614
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:43,282
Well, I'm sure things made a
lot more sense six months ago.

615
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,960
You know, they were much clearer...

616
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,290
I'm just tired.

617
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,293
GOREN: No, no, no, no, no.

618
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,466
You had doubts

619
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,332
long before you ran into us.

620
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:01,176
About how all this killing squares
up with the will of a merciful God.

621
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,973
Of course I had doubts.

622
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,937
I'm not a psychopath.

623
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,084
Well, you had more than doubts.

624
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,088
You knew you were lost.

625
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,759
GOREN: "Night after night on my bed,

626
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,724
"I sought my true love.

627
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,597
"I sought him but not found him.

628
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,306
"I call him but he does not answer."

629
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,744
In the trade we call this a tell, Ethan.

630
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:44,347
You didn't write the verse
on Leslie's wall by mistake.

631
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,948
You wrote it 'cause you were
calling out to God,

632
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,153
and he's not answering.

633
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,563
And you haven't felt this lost

634
00:35:55,854 --> 00:36:00,064
since that summer you went to
Appalachia when your parents separated.

635
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,164
And that is your personal struggle,

636
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,800
your jihad,

637
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:11,408
to find connection to something
bigger than yourself.

638
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,783
And nothing's bigger than God.

639
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:21,386
And the moment you realized
you lost connection with him

640
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,517
was when you were watching
Jorge kill Leslie.

641
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,796
It wasn't supposed to happen.

642
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,530
He was just gonna talk to her.

643
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:51,910
So if Leslie had to die
to protect your mission

644
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,383
then maybe there was something
wrong with your mission.

645
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,159
Something unjust.

646
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,126
And that's what was going through your head.

647
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,131
I wouldn't kill innocent civilians.

648
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,971
EAMES: Well, Leslie's dead.

649
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:17,412
And more innocent people will
die if Jorge sets off his bomb.

650
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,283
There's only one way back to God.

651
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,422
There's only one way to make
your parents understand

652
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,552
that you're not about this or this.

653
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,330
If I tell you where she is, what do I get?

654
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,977
We'll tell you how your mother's doing.

655
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,845
I'll write down the address.

656
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,981
If you tell us where Jorge is,

657
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,685
how we can stop him,

658
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,059
we might let you know where your mother is.

659
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,033
Whatever happens is God's will.

660
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:34,379
EAMES: I hope this doesn't turn
out to be the consolation prize.

661
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,790

under Leslie's fingernails.

662
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,063
- Yeah.
- Blond hairs,

664
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,897
Jorge's gone blond.

665
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,869
I have shoe prints here.

666
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,739
Boots.

667
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,437

What do you think, military issue?

670
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,081
Regular army, mid '90s. Brand new.

671
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,248
Probably came from a surplus store.

672
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,081
He's got a crew cut.

673
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,159
He may be wearing military...

674
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,561
Clothing.

675
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,630
Ethan said they wouldn't kill civilians.

676
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,201
Civilians.

Tomorrow's Veteran's Day.

That's a two mile long target.

680
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:37,853
1/55, first of the 55th.
That's the mechanized infantry battalion.

681
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,585
And 31

00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:44,388
could be 31st street, their
muster point for the parade.

Why that battalion?

First of the 55th were deployed to the Gulf.

These are Desert Storm veterans.

information on the whereabouts

Edwards and Jorge Galvez.

that Galvez was spotted
in his native Baltimore.

690
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,518
Other sources tell us authorities now believe

691
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,390
the suspects may have fled the country.

00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,834
I was 171st Armor.

698
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,667
You were with the 55th mechanized division.

699
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,010
GOREN: You got your ID?

700
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,637
You know, they're checking IDs.

701
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,149
You wanna smoke?

702
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,055
You know, I quit seven years ago,
but being back in the uniform

703
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,087
really plays a trip on my head.

704
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,036
You got a light?

705
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,816
EAMES: Police! Clear! Out of the way!

706
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,656
(GOREN SCREAMING)

707
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,296
(gun firing)

708
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,849
MAN: Get those people back.
Mark the perimeter.

709
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,295
God's will.

710
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,155
Let's hope so.
