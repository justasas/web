1
00:00:00,695 --> 00:00:02,540
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,222
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:07,416
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:11,095
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,875
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,588
These are their stories.

7
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,775
Jeremy hey, 
where the hell are you?

8
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:29,938
Breck is gonna bust your balls 
if you are late.  / Where's your boss?

9
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:31,549
- Breakfast meeting went over thirty...
- Save it.

10
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:33,038
Jeremy set up this doggy pony show

11
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:35,331
I'm not canceling because 
he is sleeping off the bender.

12
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:38,165
I'm sure he is... / Just find him 
and get in his ass here now.

13
00:00:41,144 --> 00:00:42,544
Jeremy.

14
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:47,041
Jeremy, where are you?
Breck's losing it.

15
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:52,260
What the hell man, get up. 
What's wrong with you?

16
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:05,079
- Looks like he died laughing. 
- Or screaming.

17
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,971
- Neighbors hear anything?
- We are still canvasing. What do you got?

18
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,347
Fluids on his body.

19
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:11,971
Bruising and anal tearing
consistent with penetration.

20
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,569
- Getting raped didn't kill him.
- No. He was asphyxiated.

21
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:18,253
Check out the petechia around his eyes.

22
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:20,260
His knuckles are pretty banged up.

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,217
Could have fought back.
Time of death?

24
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:24,189
Lividity puts it around 1:00 am.

25
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:25,696
Why is his mouth frozen like that?

26
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:28,829
Something must have been wedged 
between his teeth before rigor set in.

27
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,825
Which means someone
hung around for a couple hours

28
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,181
until the body got stiff
and then yanked that thing out.

29
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,119
That's not all he did.
The body was moved.

30
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:38,600
All right.
Who called this in?

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,576
His assistant.
Sam Edelstein.

32
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:44,662
Huh.
He see anything?

33
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:45,890
I didn't ask.

34
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,237
But he was quick to volunteer
he didn't touch the body.

35
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,864
Got something, detectives.

36
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,055
Check out the ID tag.

37
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:58,320
Jeremy Haines.
Where'd you find the bag?

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,460
Stuffed in the garbage chute
down the hall.

39
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,642
My, my, look what we have here.

40
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:07,673
Red leather ball gag.
Satin restraints.

41
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,633
And chaps. / At least now we know
why he was smiling.

42
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:13,081
Jeremy had himself a little treasure chest.

43
00:02:14,528 --> 00:02:16,095
And a play date.

44

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2008/04/22

58
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,561
So let's get this straight.
You found your dead boss

59
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:11,162
cozy underneath the sheets
in his jammies.

60
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:12,319
That's right.

61
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:17,222
- And you never saw this before.
- No.

62
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,932
Detective, run this for prints.
I'm sure the killer touched it

63
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,010
when he pried it 
out of Jeremy's mouth.

64
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,651
Wait. Wait.
I did it.

65
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,135
I... I freaked when I saw him
with that thing in his mouth. So I...

66
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:31,009
- pulled it out.
- Okay. You put him in his PJs too?

67
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,765
And was he wearing
the chaps when you found him?

68
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:33,940
Yeah.

69
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,892
I didn't want it to get into the papers
that he was into kink.

70
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:39,594
So I dumped that stuff 
in the garbage.

71
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,477
Afraid that it would come out 
he was gay?

72
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:44,328
No, he never hid it... I mean,
Jeremy was out to everybody.

73
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:47,483
Okay, so tell me, Sam,
how did you get into Jeremy's apartment?

74
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,933
- I used my key.
- Your key?

75
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,589
I house-sit when he travels.

76
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:52,894
What else do you 
do for him, Sam?

77
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:55,159
Whatever he needed.
I was his personal assistant.

78
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,758
You gave him assistance
in other areas as well?

79
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,702
- We weren't lovers.
- Come on.

80
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,640
He like to get choked?
Maybe you squeezed too hard?

81
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,776
- It was an accident?
- No.

82
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:08,028
You go to work, you wait for
your boss to raise the alarm.

83
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,396
Then you go back to your
love nest, and you find him?

84
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,357
You're wrong.
I was at work till 2:00 am.

85
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:13,665
With 15 other assistants.
Call them and check.

86
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:15,337
We'll be checking
your alibi and your DNA.

87
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:17,584
Go ahead.
I didn't kill him.

88
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:19,333
He have a boyfriend into S&M?

89
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,865
He was single. He...

90
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:23,586
He worked so much, he didn't
have time to meet guys.

91
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,280
Maybe it was one of his kids.

92
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:27,700
He has children.

93
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,500
He volunteered at a shelter
for homeless gay teens.

94
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,532
Last week, one of them beat him up 
so bad, he had to miss work.

95
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:40,905
No way.
The kids loved Jeremy.

96
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,186
Apparently, one of them didn't.

97
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:44,309
I know my boys...
they're good kids

98
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:46,193
whose parents kicked them to the curb 
because they're gay.

99
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:47,920
And I'm sure 
if we run the rap sheets,

100
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,570
they'd all come up squeaky clean.

101
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,596
Look, I'm dealing with drugs,
petty theft, sex for survival.

102
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:56,106
They all got records.
But they're not criminals.

103
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:58,342
One of your angels had
a beef with Jeremy Haines.

104
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:00,345
- Who?
- He's not a murderer.

105
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,368
- He's just a confused kid.
- Name?

106
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,857
- Freddie Ramirez.
- Get him.

107
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:10,958
He's not here.
He works at a gym in Hell's Kitchen.

108
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:16,027
- Excuse me, your manager around?
- You're looking at her.

109
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:21,123
I'm Candayce.
You wanna join my club, handsome?

110
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:22,697
Is Freddie Ramirez working today?

111
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,725
Oh, lord... what'd that
little devil do now?

112
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,462
The little devil been in trouble before?

113
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:30,603
I can't prove it,
but I suspect he's got sticky fingers.

114
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:31,990
What makes you think that?

115
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,797
Things go missing from people's lockers
whenever he's working.

116
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:38,829
I'd fire him,
but the members love him.

117
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:41,981
- He come in yet?
- Yeah, late, as usual.

118
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:44,959
And you know? I think he must have
got into it with someone.

119
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,873
That baby face of his
had a big old nasty bruise.

120
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:50,118
- He got a temper too?
- I'll say.

121
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:52,712
- Where's Freddie now?
- Try the locker room.

122
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:07,225
Hey, that your locker, Freddie?

123
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:21,182
Where were you last night?

124
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,537
- Hanging with friends.
- Doing what?

125
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:25,376
- Stuff.
- Where?

126
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:27,483
- Around.
- Hey, hey...

127
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:32,202
I want you to start answering my questions
in complete sentences.

128
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,452
All right.

129
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:37,977
- A bunch of us went to a movie.
- Good.

130
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:41,384
I'm gonna need the names of your friends.
What happened to your face?

131
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:43,795
Got in a fight.

132
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,967
- With Jeremy Haines?
- Yeah.

133
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:51,337
- Bitch thought he was tough.
- So you killed him?

134
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,616
What are you... talking about?

135
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:57,682
- Last night, Jeremy was murdered.
- And you think I did it?

136
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,427
You just admitted
to beating the crap out of him.

137
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:02,872
No, you got it all wrong.
He boxed to stay in shape.

138
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,447
I told him he ain't fought
until he uses bare knuckles.

139
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,934
- So you two went a few rounds.
- Last week.

140
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,560
Dude didn't know what hit him.

141
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,105
You go back last night for a rematch?

142
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:14,155
- I aint's seen him for a few days.
- And?

143
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,245
What's up? / Got a hit on some blood
found in Haines's apartment.

144
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:20,742
Belongs to a Frederico Ramirez.

145
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:24,121
Booked of assault charges 
six months ago. Know him?

146
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:25,759
You're looking at him.

147
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,333
- He a match on the fluids too?
- The semen sample was mixed.

148
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,815
Probably DNA from Haines and the perp.

149
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:35,987
I'll give you a call
when we get the results in.

150
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,872
Heads up, Freddie.
I got some bad news for you.

151
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,446
I wasn't with Jeremy last night.

152
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:45,384
Yeah? Then why's your blood
all over his apartment?

153
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:48,266
We were hanging out Saturday
night watching the Knicks.

154
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:52,326
He's got this sick plasma hi-def 
flat screen. I got a raging nose bleed.

155
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:55,262
Sure, you did.
What time did you get home last night?

156
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:59,909
Before 12:00. House has a midnight curfew.
You can check the sign-in log.

157
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,335
You and Jeremy must be pretty tight
If you're hanging out at his house, hmm?

158
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,659
Something going on between you two?

159
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:09,040
I tried.

160
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,188
But he shut me down.

161
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,297
Told me I was too young.

162
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:17,156
Besides, he said he was
serious about someone.

163
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,922
Well, what else did he say about the guy?

164
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:20,950
That he traveled all the time.

165
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:22,946
They've been together a few years.

166
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:26,711
Well, that's strange, because 
nobody else he ever mentioned it.

167
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:33,352
Jeremy said he was really
famous and still in the closet.

168
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:35,762
He said the guy was psycho 
about his privacy.

169
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:39,109
So Jeremy and closet boy
were playing Brokeback Mountain.

170
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,626
Things get a little rough,
and Jeremy winds up dead.

171
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:43,874
Look, either way, closet boy's screwed.

172
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:47,009
He can't be found at his dead gay 
lover's apartment, so he splits.

173
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,126
Hey, Liv, Elliot.

174
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:51,992
We ran down Freddie's pals.
They all backed up his alibi.

175
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:56,322
And the security camera puts him 
entering the shelter around 11:45 pm.

176
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:59,094
- He didn't leave after that.
- Okay. So Freddie's clear.

177
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:00,927
And so's Sam the assistant.

178
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,878
It's confirmed he was working
in full view of a dozen other people

179
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,118
when Jeremy was killed.

180
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:07,029
So it looks like our best bet
is the mystery man.

181
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,008
Now all we have to do is find him.

182
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:12,963
Would you miss 
your boyfriend's funereal?

183
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:15,727
Yeah, if I was famous 
and in the closet?

184
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:18,811
How am I gonna show up
crying at a gay man's grave?

185
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:22,210
You make sure no one else
is there to see you.

186
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:26,402
Pole cam, cops best friend.
Take a look.

187
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,738
Mystery man jumped a fence
at the cemetery at 3:00 am.

188
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:31,163
It's gotta be our guy.

189
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,825
Buddy, lift up your
head so we can see you.

190
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,374
Looks like he's praying.

191
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,084
Wait, s...stop that.

192
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:40,185
Holy crap.
Rewind that.

193
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,103
What is it?

194
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,560
Right there... stop.
Blow it up.

195
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,586
He looks familiar.

196
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:51,201
No wonder he's in the closet.

197
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:52,608
Do you know him?

198
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,994
It's Lincoln Haver.
Best quarterback in pro football.

199
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,120
Lincoln Haver is gay?
Dang!

200
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,192
I thought he's dating Natasha Gorsky,
that hot supermodel.

201
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:07,089
Jeremy must have hated
seeing his boyfriend

202
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:08,635
splashed all over the tabloids with her.

203
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:10,268
You can't blame Lincoln
for having a beard.

204
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:11,701
It's gets out, and his career's over.

205
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,244
A bunch of players have come out.

206
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:16,686
There's Dave Kopay,
Roy Simmons, Esera Tuaolo.

207
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:19,933
- Hey, he a relative of yours, Fin?
- It's Tutuola.

208
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,993
And those guys came out
after they retired.

209
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:24,383
Never been an openly gay
football player on the field.

210
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,236
And Linc doesn't want
to be the trailblazer. / Or lose the dough.

211
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:30,072
He just signed a three-year contract
worth 40 mil,

212
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:33,136
and he's a spokesperson for power drink.
That's gotta be worth a pile.

213
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:35,639
Well, they can't fire him for being gay.
He could sue.

214
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,638
No, he can't. All those contracts
have morals clauses.

215
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,415
Sponsor can give him the ax
if he goes down their reputation.

216
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:44,398
You mean when like folks start
calling power drink pansy drink.

217
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:47,329
So some football player's gay... 
what is the big deal?

218
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:49,868
Look, it is. You got millions of kids 
with these guys'posters

219
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:52,548
haning off their walls...
They idolize them.

220
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:54,343
As long as he's sleeping with women.

221
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,433
Lincoln Haver is my kid's hero.

222
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:59,351
Well, let's go pay him a visit.

223
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:02,414
Maybe Linc will sign
an autograph for Dickie.

224
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,445
Blue 22.

225
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,549
Blue 22.

226
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,760
Hey, beautiful. I got a cramp.
Wanna rub it out for me?

227
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,379
- Lincoln Haver.
- Yeah.

228
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,838
Like to talk to you.

229
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:21,286
What's up?

230
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:23,220
Like to discuss Jeremy Haines 
with you.

231
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,728
Jeremy.
He's my business manager.

232
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,139
We know he managed
more than your business.

233
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:30,360
- I gotta go.
- Hey, hey.

234
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:35,552
Our candid camera
caught you at his gravesite.

235
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:40,665
I can't talk to you here.

236
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,778
We understand that
you're in a tough position.

237
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,868
Look, I was at a team
photo shoot in Miami.

238
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:46,277
I came back as quick as I could.

239
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:48,236
In the middle of the night
so no one would see you.

240
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:50,897
- Is that a crime?
- No, but murder is.

241
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,876
We found the perp's DNA
all over Jeremy's body.

242
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:56,252
We're getting a court order
to compel yours.

243
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,577
You think I killed him?

244
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,823
I would never hurt Jeremy.
We were friends.

245
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:06,084
You were lovers.

246
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,609
- We were gonna go public.
- When?

247
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:21,026
It's not like we can
just announce our engagement.

248
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:23,330
Because you knew you'd be
booted out of football.

249
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:26,668
I've  been playing since I was six.

250
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,094
The game's my life.

251
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:31,025
But if I had to choose,
I'd choose Jeremy.

252
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:33,988
So where were you 
the night he was murdered?

253
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,853
With him.

254
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,210
We had dinner with my agent and Natasha.

255
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,597
You had a date with your
boyfriend and your girlfriend?

256
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:45,823
- That's ballsy.
- My agent hooked me up with her.

257
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,862
How'd Jeremy feel 
about his... charade?

258
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,048
He was tired of playing games.

259
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,979
But I just wanted one more season...

260
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:04,072
Maybe give my shot
at a championship ring.

261
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,544
What happened after dinner?

262
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:07,679
Natasha and I went out for a few drinks.

263
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,130
She took me to some hot new club.

264
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,471
Which one?

265
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,982
I don't remember.
I drank too much.

266
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:18,894
But I know I went home with Natasha.

267
00:13:18,894 --> 00:13:22,510
Wish he hadn't.
That night sucked.

268
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,464
- He didn't spend the night?
- He never does.

269
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:29,609
Linc's a hit and run kinda guy.
Always some lame excuse.

270
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,916
Team curfew, early flight.

271
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,587
"I have to save my strength."
What about me?

272
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,311
Must be tough dating a ball player.

273
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:39,823
My publicist pushed him on me.

274
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:42,250
I didn't know I'd be dating
his agent, his teammates,

275
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,213
and his business manager.

276
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:47,823
If he'd rather screw around with boys,
that's fine with me.

277
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:49,971
So you knew about him and Jeremy.

278
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,062
Knew what?

279
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,493
Oh, no, they were not
screwing each other.

280
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:03,115
That explains everything.

281
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,443
Nothing wrong with these girls,
just girls.

282
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,940
Sinead, it's Nat.
You are not going to believe this.

283
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,852
- Don't do that.
- He used me, okay?

284
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:20,577
Wait till the whole world finds out this big,

285
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,051
butch football player's
really just a big fag.

286
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:25,001
Just calm down... I understand
that you're upset,

287
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:28,031
- but think about what you're doing.
- I am thinking about myself, okay?

288
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,140
What about my career?

289
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,476
How could I have been so stupid?
I mean, what if... what if he gave me AIDS?

290
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:35,336
Look, first of all,
you can get HIV from anybody.

291
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:37,407
- Did you use a condom?
- Get out.

292
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,338
My phone.

293
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,596
Sinead, he's a homo.

294
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:48,401
Linc is an ass bandit.
Can you believe it?

295
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,764
Oh, you might wanna have
a chat with Gary Leslie, Linc's agent.

296
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:56,622
I think my ex-boyfriend's
gonna need a new job.

297
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:00,652
Natasha called ten minutes ago.

298
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:03,945
She was on a rampage,
but I shut her up. / How?

299
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,972
I promised her the cover
of the next swimsuit issue,

300
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,514
got her friend Sinead on the View.

301
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,617
Are you sure this isn't a mistake?

302
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,350
Lincoln told us he was gay.

303
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:17,519
I can't believe it.
The guys' a chick magnet.

304
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,827
We go out together,
guaranteed I get laid.

305
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,055
He's played it straight his whole life.

306
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,164
Well, how the hell did Natasha find out?

307
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,127
It was a misunderstanding.
I made a mistake.

308
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:31,301
Well, that's a pretty
major mistake, detective.

309
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:33,560
But damage control
is my specialty, so, uh,

310
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,415
I'll do my best to keep this on the DL.

311
00:15:35,415 --> 00:15:37,738
Do you think he'd kill
to cover up his sexuality?

312
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:40,909
No, Lincoln's tough on the field,
but off, he's like a teddy bear.

313
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,567
He doesn't have it in him
to kill anyone.

314
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:44,578
No way.

315
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,164
Lincoln Haver's semen
was on Jeremy Haines

316
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:49,169
and the carpet near his bed.

317
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:51,165
The sample on the rug could be old.

318
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:52,750
But the fluids on the victim were fresh.

319
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,758
So Linc must have gone to Jeremy's 
apartment after his fight with Natasha.

320
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:58,262
They have sex, they fight.
Jeremy winds up dead.

321
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:00,451
Now, is there any way that
it could have been an accident?

322
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,759
Could he have choked
on the ball gag during sex?

323
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,623
That's what we're supposed to think.

324
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,836
But I'm sure the gag
was inserted postmortem.

325
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,857
- How do you know that?
- His hyoid bone was broken.

326
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:12,442
- He was strangled?
- With something cylindrical.

327
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,915
I found a subcutaneous abrasion
in the victim's throat.

328
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:17,264
It's a diamond pattern.

329
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:19,510
The bar used to choke him
had a textured grip

330
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,358
which left its imprint 
under his skin.

331
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:24,042
- Looking for a dumbbell bar.
- Pattern's a perfect match.

332
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,140
There was a weight bench
at Jeremy's apartment.

333
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,650
I checked with CSU.
His set is short one bar.

334
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,895
So Lincoln must have taken it with him.

335
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,609
We got enough for a search warrant
for the apartment.

336
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:42,582
- Need to see Lincoln Haver.
- Mr. Haver is not at home.

337
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:43,946
Do you have the keys
to his apartment?

338
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:46,248
- Well, yes...
- Great. Then you can let us in.

339
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:49,550
I... I'll need permission
from the management company.

340
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,254
Court order trumps your boss's okay.
Let's go.

341
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,666
Try running to daddy, faggot.

342
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,358
Let's go.
Let's go.

343
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:03,175
Lincoln?

344
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,538
I need a bus at 352 Franklin, now.

345
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,218
They're gone.

346
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,270
His secret's out.

347
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,715
The doctor said 
they fractured your skull.

348
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,404
I'm lucky.

349
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:29,752
I've had a lot worse
happen on the field.

350
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:31,530
You remember what happened?

351
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,877
I was walking home.

352
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:38,231
Heard a car.

353
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,719
Guy yelled, "get the faggot."

354
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,388
Something hit my head.

355
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:47,240
I tried fighting back.

356
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:51,697
- There were too many of them.
- Did you see their faces,

357
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,333
- anything that might help us ID them?
- No.

358
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,790
I was facedown on the ground.

359
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,909
- Lincoln?
- Thanks.

360
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,031
Lincoln?

361
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,568
- He's out.
- That was Fin.

362
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:07,032
Haver's apartment came up
empty for the murder weapon.

363
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:10,044
How screwed up is this?
Our perp is now the victim.

364
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:12,216
All right, well, let's hand off
the gay bashing to The bias crimes,

365
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,743
and we'll focus on the homicide, huh?

366
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:17,917
Oh, hey.
Good job, detectives.

367
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,040
For what?
For almost getting Linc killed.

368
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,113
I'm filing suit against you individually
and the NYPD for negligence.

369
00:18:24,113 --> 00:18:25,812
- What?
- You outed Linc.

370
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:27,349
And then he gets
attacked a few hours later?

371
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:29,656
What, you think that's 
a, uh, coincidence?

372
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:30,864
Natasha must have talked.

373
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:34,131
No way is she giving up the chance
to be every teenage boy's wet dream.

374
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:36,619
She called her friend Sinead
right in front of us.

375
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,887
They both swore that they 
didn't leak to sportsman Larry.

376
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:43,740
- The shock jock?
- Yeah, he told five million listeners

377
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,873
that Linc is, quote,
"a big flaming faggot."

378
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,764
- Oh, so you think that we told him.
- Yeah.

379
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,008
He's crashing.

380
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,602
I need O2 and an ambu bag.

381
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,213
Everybody out.
Now.

382
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,543
Hey, man, welcome back.
I'm sportsman Larry.

383
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:09,631
The topic tonight... sissies in sports.

384
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:13,061
It's bad enough queers are unsatisfied
being hair dressers these days.

385
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:15,295
Now they wanna
get their hands on our balls?

386
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,726
This is offensive...
And I'm not talking Linemen.

387
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:21,671
Come on. Football is America's game.
It's sacred like the good book.

388
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:25,100
There's no place for gays 
in either one, you dig?

389
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,841
Haver wants to come back, cool.

390
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:29,177
Put him in a skirt
and let him shake his pom-poms.

391
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:32,179
What are we running here?
The potential for locker room scandals,

392
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,386
sexual harassment lawsuits? 
Come on.

393
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,979
The Tabloids would have a field day.
I'm a sportsman Larry.

394
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:39,548
Gimme a call.
I wanna know what you're thinking.

395
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,250
- What the hell did you two do?
- Uh, not what you think.

396
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,982
Tell that to the gay rights groups
picketing one PP.

397
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:49,926
- We never talked to sportsman Larry.
- Well, somebody did.

398
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:52,521
The Brass is demanding 
a full investigation.

399
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:55,118
- You're joking.
- I wish.

400
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:57,680
That was the hospital.
Linc Haver's in a coma.

401
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,426
Press is gonna go to town.

402
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,394
IAB is waiting.
You're up first, Olivia.

403
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,593
We dumped your phones, Detective.

404
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:10,316
Do you recognize this number?

405
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:11,783
Yes.

406
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,988
In the past five days,
you've called it 12 times.

407
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:16,095
- Whose number is it?
- Kurt Moss.

408
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:18,164
What does Mr. Moss do for a living?

409
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:21,125
He works for the Ledger,
But you knew that already, didn't you?

410
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,668
What time did you call
Mr. Moss last night?

411
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:26,734
10:14pm.

412
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,631
And what did you do earlier in the day?

413
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:30,884
My partner and I interviewed Lincoln Haver

414
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:33,538
and several other witnesses
in our homicide investigation.

415
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:36,091
And what did Mr. Haver reveal
to you during his interview?

416
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:38,219
That he and Jeremy Haines were lovers.

417
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:40,210
Did you call Mr. Moss that night

418
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,552
and tell him Lincoln Haver is 
a homosexual? / Absolutely not.

419
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:45,986
Then can you explain why
you called a newspaper editor that later?

420
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:49,164
I can assure you that it had nothing to do
with Lincoln Haver.

421
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:53,166
I find that hard to believe, detective.

422
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,211
I think you tipped off your friend Moss
and gave him the story.

423
00:20:57,211 --> 00:21:00,912
You're wrong. I would never jeopardize 
a case by leaking it to the media.

424
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:04,250
Your calling Moss and his gossip
columnist printing the story

425
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,491
is just a happy coincidence.

426
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:08,427
So the gossip guy is a fan 
of sportsman Larry,

427
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:10,356
he hears the news,
and he writes a story.

428
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:13,839
Paper went to press
before Larry's broadcast.

429
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:18,299
Now explain why you called
Mr. Moss last night.

430
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,585
We've been dating.

431
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:33,128
Who knows about it?

432
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:38,189
No one.

433
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:41,583
So you're creating this fictional booty call
to save your own ass.

434
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,389
He's my boyfriend.

435
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,199
And you're his source.

436
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,760
What happened?

437
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:53,819
- Tucker took my gun and shield.
- What the hell for?

438
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,207
Ask him.

439
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,598
Suspended?

440
00:21:57,598 --> 00:22:00,982
With pay, pending investigation
until further notice.

441
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:02,969
You're a son of a bitch.

442
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:07,281
Your partner has been sleeping
with an editor at the Ledger for months.

443
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:09,052
Get outta here.

444
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:12,125
Well, you obviously don't know 
detective Benson as well as you think.

445
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,170
I know she'd never torpedo a case.

446
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,113
Forgive me if I questioned your judgment,

447
00:22:16,113 --> 00:22:18,720
but you didn't even know
she was screwing the paper boy.

448
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:25,693
- Where you going?
- You know where I'm going.

449
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:40,651
Kurt Moss.

450
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,060
You must be Elliot.

451
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:47,578
Olivia has a picture of you two
in her living room.

452
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:49,275
Well, she's been suspended.

453
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:53,260
Internal affairs thinks she leaked 
the Lincoln Haver story to you.

454
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,493
Oh...

455
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:58,956
Who did?

456
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:03,108
Oh, come on.
I'd go to jail to defend my source.

457
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:06,210
I'm not gonna ask one of my columnists
to give up one of his?

458
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,850
You're just gonna hang
Olivia out to dry.

459
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,158
You two have worked
together for a long time.

460
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,825
There must be a reason why
she didn't tell you about me.

461
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:19,391
Hey, pal, her personal life
is her business.

462
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:20,925
I'm here trying to save her job.

463
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:23,203
Now, if you care for her,
you'll help me.

464
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:28,204
What do you want? / Tell IAB 
Olivia wasn't the source of the leak.

465
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:29,912
What are you doing here?

466
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:36,645
I'm trying to convince your
boyfriend to give you a hand.

467
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:39,320
I don't need help from either of you.

468
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,467
I think you do.

469
00:23:41,814 --> 00:23:44,055
I can sign an affidavit
saying you're not the source.

470
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,985
It's not gonna work. It's not enough.
They want a warm body.

471
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:48,142
And he can give them one. Look,

472
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:51,700
I'm sure you know about the skeletons
in the NYPD's closet.

473
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,107
All you gotta do is remind IAB
they should stay on your good side.

474
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,592
I'll talk to them.

475
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:02,750
Nice meeting you.

476
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:06,143
Why didn't you tell me
you were in trouble?

477
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:08,303
- I can handle it.
- That's the problem.

478
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:11,687
You're so used to taking care of yourself
that you can't let anybody else in.

479
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:14,007
Kurt, this isn't about us.

480
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:20,978
If you say so. / If I say so?
What's that supposed to mean?

481
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:27,903
Why is it... 
you won't move in with me?

482
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,159
I gotta go.

483
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,351
And I'll... I'll call them in IAB.

484
00:24:48,098 --> 00:24:49,776
- Thank you.
- Yeah...

485
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:51,633
Hey...

486
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:02,613
It worked.

487
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:05,097
Suspension's been lifted.

488
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:06,861
Your man came through.

489
00:25:12,368 --> 00:25:14,697
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about him.

490
00:25:17,438 --> 00:25:19,200
I'm just glad you have someone.

491
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:22,687
I mean, you could said something, 
you know...

492
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:24,905
I just wasn't ready.

493
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:30,098
Lincoln Haver is out of his coma.

494
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:32,222
One PP wants him locked up.

495
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:37,566
Oh, so yesterday, he was the victim of 
a hate crime, and we were getting grilled.

496
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:40,203
And today, the media has moved on.

497
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:42,687
The Brass doesn't want
a murderer getting special treatment

498
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:45,264
because he's gay or a football player.

499
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,013
We hear you're gonna be okay.

500
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,075
Yeah...

501
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:58,363
All those years... 
lying about who I am.

502
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:01,802
Afraid of the future.

503
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:07,607
That if anyone found out
I was gay, it would... wreck my life.

504
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:11,396
I outed you.

505
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:14,560
I'm sorry.

506
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:22,656
It was bound to happen.

507
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,646
You have any leads on his killer?

508
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:32,575
Lincoln, we're here to arrest you.

509
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,035
You have the right to remain silent.

510
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:38,829
You give up that right,
anything you say can

511
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:41,323
will be used against you 
in a court of law.

512
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:45,346
I told you.

513
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:47,410
I was at Natasha's the night 
that Jeremy died.

514
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,238
Till she kicked you out of bed
because you couldn't get it up.

515
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:52,825
So you went to Jeremy's for a little TLC.

516
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:54,374
Well, you had sex with him?

517
00:26:57,791 --> 00:27:00,225
It's your DNA on his body.

518
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,612
I remember going to his apartment.

519
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:09,527
Then it's all a blur.

520
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,020
You were drunk.

521
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:13,030
You started arguing.

522
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:16,674
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

523
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,664
Now come on.
You remember now, don't you?

524
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:24,391
- I woke him up.
- You started fooling around.

525
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:28,509
Until Jeremy smelled
Natasha's perfume on me.

526
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:30,178
And that pissed him off.

527
00:27:31,654 --> 00:27:34,905
- We fought.
- You lost control.

528
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:37,466
Jeremy died.

529
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:42,273
Oh, God.

530
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,052
What did I do?

531
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:47,143
Well, you tried to cover it up,

532
00:27:47,936 --> 00:27:50,037
Make it look like an accident.

533
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,787
I didn't want to hurt him.

534
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,556
I loved him.

535
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:13,662
Docket ending 1266,
people versus Lincoln Haver.

536
00:28:13,662 --> 00:28:16,165
One count murder in the second degree.

537
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:19,209
- Ms. Balthus, how does your client plead?
- Not guilty.

538
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:21,248
- Bail, counselor?
- $2 million.

539
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:23,492
That's outrageous, even for Ms. Novak.

540
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:26,084
The defendant is one of
the highest-paid players in football.

541
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,616
He's rich but obviously not a flight risk.

542
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:32,129
For God's sake,
he just woke up from a coma.

543
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,807
You have my sympathy, Mr. Haver,
and I'll have your passport.

544
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:36,924
Bail is set at $1 million.

545
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,668
- Next case.
- Docket ending 3419...

546
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:43,348
We have DNA, access to the apartment,
motive, and Lincoln's confession.

547
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,101
Your client doesn't even have an alibi.

548
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:47,798
My client doesn't know
what happened that night. He's confused.

549
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:50,586
What, he confused committing murder
with a little slap and tickle?

550
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:53,512
Go ahead, Casey, make fun of a guy
with a serious brain injury.

551
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:56,557
That jury'll eat that up. / No jury's ever 
gonna hear your half-assed theory.

552
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:58,144
Oh, I think they will.

553
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:01,459
"Football made him do it." That's almost 
as good as the twinkie defense.

554
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:03,086
No, it's even better.

555
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,083
Mr. Haver has suffered
eight concussions since college.

556
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,536
And probably several more that
weren't properly diagnosed.

557
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:12,357
And most athletes who get concussions
don't go out and commit murder.

558
00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:15,863
Repeated head trauma
has irreparably damaged his brain.

559
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:18,000
He was not responsible
for his actions.

560
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,573
- Oh, gimme a break.
- I'll give you the facts.

561
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:22,850
Lincoln has dementia that prevents him

562
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,873
from forming the necessary
intent to be guilty of murder.

563
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:28,298
You can prove your client
has this condition?

564
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,319
Definitively, only on autopsy.

565
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,539
- Well, that's convenient.
- Here's convenience.

566
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:35,112
Your detectives overlooked
Lincoln's obvious impairments...

567
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:38,588
His headaches, his memory loss,
even a coma.

568
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:40,599
Your Honor, the defense
is grasping at straws.

569
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:44,168
There's no evidence Lincoln
Haver is cognitively impaired in any way.

570
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:46,181
And there's no proof he isn't.

571
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:48,189
Have your psychiatrist
examine the defendant.

572
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:51,198
Maybe he can shed some light
on Mr. Haver's brain.

573
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,396
Do you ever have headaches?

574
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,164
Yes.

575
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,413
How often?

576
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,947
- Sometimes every day.
- Can you describe them?

577
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:10,107
It's like my head's in a vise

578
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:12,411
and someone's stabbing me 
in the eye.

579
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:17,459
I'm gonna ask you to perform
a few simple tasks.

580
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:19,835
Memorize these three words...

581
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:23,892
House, pencil, green.

582
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:26,314
House, pencil, green.
Got it.

583
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:30,230
- Where were you born?
- Englewood, New Jersey.

584
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,890
Who has the first president
of the United States?

585
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,325
George Washington.

586
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:38,026
- How many states are in the US?
- 50.

587
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:43,744
- When were you born?
- May 27, 1976.

588
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:47,057
What are the three words
that I asked you to remember earlier?

589
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:49,197
Pencil, boat...

590
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,021
Damn it.

591
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:57,288
This is crazy.

592
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:00,669
Why can't I remember?

593
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:04,321
Lincoln's immediate
and long-term memory are intact.

594
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,865
But his short-term memory
is impaired.

595
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,323
Okay, could the beating
have caused this?

596
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,730
No, I'd say it was the result
of repeated head injuries.

597
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,000
So he's brain damaged.

598
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,667
this is Lincoln's MRI.

599
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,336
These spots are lesions
from multiple concussions

600
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:18,853
That can cause seizures.
I ran an EEG,

601
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:21,048
and Lincoln has evidence
of a seizure disorder.

602
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,385
- Can seizures cause blackouts?
- Absolutely.

603
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:26,667
So Balthus can claim that's why 
Lincoln doesn't remember killing Jeremy.

604
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,906
Maybe not. When did he sustain his last
concussion before the murder?

605
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:33,016
Last year, he was clothesline
on the three-yard line against Denver.

606
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,946
Then he couldn't have had a seizure-
related blackout the night of the murder.

607
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:38,578
Those usually occur within
48 hours of the injury.

608
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:40,659
Well, it's too bad for Balthus
we're in the pre-season.

609
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:42,334
Her brain damage defence doesn't hold up

610
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,871
Hang on Casey, It's not that simple

611
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,110
Repeated head trauma 
can cause memory loss.

612
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,864
Depression, 
and Alzheimer's like dementia.

613
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:53,425
It's not uncommon in boxers, hockey 
and football players

614
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:57,584
So you're saying that there is a chance that 
Linkoln isn't reponsible for his action

615
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:58,645
Yes.

616
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:06,231
So tell me, Mr. Haver.

617
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:10,498
What happens after you've been
knocked out on the field?

618
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:13,341
I have real bad headaches.

619
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:18,561
I get dizzy, light hurt my eyes,
I forget stuff.

620
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,758
Give me an example.

621
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:23,142
Last year, I got my mom
sideline seats for the Chicago game.

622
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,598
I kept looking for her.
But she never showed up.

623
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,517
Why wouldn't your mother
come to see you play?

624
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:28,944
She said I told her not to.

625
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:31,838
Said I called screaming 
that she was a JINX.

626
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:35,420
I love my mom.

627
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,667
I have no idea why I did that.

628
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:40,506
Nothing further.

629
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:45,740
You confessed to the murder
of Jeremy Haines.

630
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,583
So you must remember
something about that night.

631
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,157
The detectives confused me.

632
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:53,448
I remember fighting with Jeremy.
I don't remember killing him.

633
00:32:53,448 --> 00:32:55,057
Were you ever violent with Jeremy?

634
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,363
We argued sometimes,
but I never hit him.

635
00:32:57,363 --> 00:32:59,536
What was your last fight about?

636
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,385
Me coming out of the closet.

637
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:08,704
Football is my life.

638
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:12,948
You'd lose your career
if you came out, right?

639
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:14,917
But that's what Jeremy wanted.

640
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:18,918
He pushed and he pushed,
and you were afraid

641
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:21,759
- that your secret life would be exposed.
- I didn't care.

642
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:28,609
- We were in love.
- But you love football more.

643
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:32,380
- You just said it's your life.
- No. Jeremy came first.

644
00:33:36,426 --> 00:33:38,150
That's why I married him.

645
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:43,431
- You're married.
- In Canada.

646
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,670
A private ceremony.

647
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,497
I can show you our license.

648
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:52,856
I got blindsided today.

649
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:54,611
How did you miss 
their big fat gay wedding?

650
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:55,523
What does being married prove?

651
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:56,898
Straight guys kill their wives 
all the time.

652
00:33:56,898 --> 00:33:59,097
But Lincoln's not your typical wife beater.

653
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:01,543
He's sympathetic.
He was gay bashed. He almost died.

654
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:03,905
And he's still a murderer.
His DNA was all over the body.

655
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:06,360
And Balthus is using 
her bogus brain damage defense

656
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,228
to distract the jury...
and it's working.

657
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:10,909
The women on the panel wanna
hug him and make it all better.

658
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:13,302
Well, you can't blame them.
He does look good in a suit and tie.

659
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:16,086
Yeah, and with that marriage license,
he can play the grieving widower.

660
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:17,497
How the hell am I supposed 
to rebut that?

661
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:18,595
Good question.

662
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:20,622
I just got a notification.

663
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:23,521
Balthus is calling Elliot 
as defense witness.

664
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:33,195
Did Lincoln Haver seem disoriented
when you interviewed him? / No.

665
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:37,584
He wasn't confused or unclear about
the questions you asked him?

666
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:39,229
- No.
- Really?

667
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:42,162
You interrogated him
hours after he came out of a coma.

668
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:45,105
We asked Mr. Haver some questions.

669
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:48,436
Question?
They sounded more like suggestions.

670
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:51,209
Didn't you, in fact, supply my client

671
00:34:51,209 --> 00:34:54,748
with most of the details
found in his confession?

672
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,265
We discussed what he did that night.

673
00:34:56,265 --> 00:34:58,571
And he told you he didn't
remember what happened.

674
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:00,493
At first.
Then he got his memory back.

675
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:04,080
And you kept bullying a sick man,
making suggestions,

676
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,416
coercing a false statement.

677
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:09,046
I quietly and calmly
asked him questions.

678
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:11,975
Mr. Haver had just come out of a coma.

679
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:14,513
He was in a weakened
and suggestible state.

680
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,298
He would have confessed
to killing Kennedy.

681
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,192
I can assure you 
he didn't confess to that.

682
00:35:19,192 --> 00:35:20,950
He had brain damage.

683
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,028
Your psychiatrist said so.

684
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:24,661
Your Honor, I'm not
a trained psychiatrist, so...

685
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:27,654
The brain injury made him confess.
It didn't make him violent.

686
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:30,631
I've seen Lincoln Haver play football
since he was in college.

687
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:32,088
He's always been violent
and aggressive.

688
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:36,190
And the minute Lincoln Haver's 
name came up in your investigation,

689
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:40,795
you made him your prime suspect
because he's a violent football player?

690
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:44,962
He's a victim of your stereotype.
He is not a killer.

691
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:47,596
Your Honor, the people
request a recess.

692
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:50,344
- What for, Ms. Novak?
- To bring in a video monitor.

693
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:52,021
Popcorn and a movie, Ms. Novak?

694
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:55,216
The people will be introducing
footage of Lincoln Haver.

695
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,298
Objection.
Prejudicial.

696
00:35:57,298 --> 00:35:59,725
The defense opened the door

697
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:02,001
alleged bias against football players.

698
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,517
You did, Ms. Balthus.

699
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:05,965
And Ms. Novak is entitled
to walk through it.

700
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:08,757
Now, we've all watched
Lincoln Haver play football.

701
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:10,282
But you haven't seen this.

702
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:13,154
Now, I subpoenaed practice footage.

703
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:16,983
Keep your eye on number 12.
That's Lincoln Haver.

704
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:21,731
Now, this is just a friendly team practice.
There's no game day pressure.

705
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:23,052
Now look what happens

706
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:26,211
when a teammate accidentally
jostles Lincoln's throwing arm.

707
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:28,472
That's my arm, 
you little pissant rookie.

708
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:30,802
What are you trying to do, rip it off?

709
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:33,497
You ever try that again,
I'm gonna kill you.

710
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:40,532
That, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

711
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:42,987
that's the real Lincoln Haver.

712
00:36:52,028 --> 00:36:54,336
Has the jury reached a verdict?

713
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:56,579
We have, Your Honor.

714
00:36:57,294 --> 00:36:59,921
Will the defendant please rise?

715
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:07,283
On the sole count of the indictment,
Murder in the second degree,

716
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:09,121
how do you find the defendant?

717
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:12,355
Guilty.

718
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:22,380
- Do you want another one?
- I can't.

719
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,552
I just broke up with Kurt,
and you said you'd be there for me.

720
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:28,918
I am.
Eli's driving Kathy crazy.

721
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:30,686
I'm kidding.
Go home.

722
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:34,059
Hey, Olivia.
Your case is on TV.

723
00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:38,688
Turn it up, please.

724
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,597
Lincoln Haver's conviction
is a tragedy for his team.

725
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:46,262
But I hope Dwayne Fitzgerald here
will be a great replacement.

726
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:49,263
He's a hell of a quarterback
with a great future.

727
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:52,543
Hopefully, Dwayne won't do
anything to jeopardize that.

728
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:55,203
Just promise me that 
I won't catch you making out

729
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,249
with your boyfriend
in a restaurant bathroom.

730
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:02,524
Gary said he didn't know 
Lincoln was gay until after the murder.

731
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:05,286
Then how could he have
caught him in the bathroom?

732
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,453
How'd you find out Lincoln is gay?

733
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,719
I already told you.
Natasha called me after you outed him.

734
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:14,863
Did you suspect anything
the night the four of you had dinner?

735
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:17,784
I don't know what you're talking about.

736
00:38:17,784 --> 00:38:19,770
We found the murder weapon
in your apartment.

737
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:24,461
You saw Lincoln kissing Jeremy
in the restaurant bathroom.

738
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:25,493
I mean, that must have freaked you out.

739
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:27,060
It would have freaked me out.

740
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:32,955
All those years of hard work
making Lincoln the star, and there he is...

741
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:35,482
With his tongue
down another guy's throat.

742
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,681
- Were you jealous, Gary?
- Made me wanna puke.

743
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:42,597
Going at it in the bathroom
like a couple of horny teenagers.

744
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:45,316
- Did Lincoln see you?
- No, Jeremy did.

745
00:38:45,316 --> 00:38:48,215
So I went to his place
to talk some sense into him.

746
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:50,116
Tells me Lincoln just left.

747
00:38:50,982 --> 00:38:52,531
So what'd you do?

748
00:38:53,477 --> 00:38:55,890
I begged him to give Lincoln up.

749
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,151
And you know what he tells me?

750
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:59,811
He tells me that they're getting married.

751
00:38:59,811 --> 00:39:01,539
He tells me
they're having a huge party.

752
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,558
And they're just gonna come out
to everybody this summer.


753
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,316
Then he tells me to go out
and find a new cash cow,

754
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:07,626
because Lincoln's retiring.

755
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:09,957
And you lost it,
so you grabbed this dumbbell...

756
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:12,498
Hell, yeah, I lost it.
I lost it. I was so angry.

757
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:14,166
The stupid little fairy's ruining everything.

758
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,281
- So you choked him.
- I didn't... I just wanted him to shut up,

759
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:19,466
I didn't mean... I didn't mean... 
I didn't... I didn't mea...

760
00:39:25,105 --> 00:39:26,860
I didn't mean to kill him.

761
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:34,200
So you found the sex toys.
You dressed him up.

762
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,417
Used the gag to make us think
that it was rough sex gone bad.

763
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,313
And you leaked it to the media.

764
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:47,151
I worked my ass of for years

765
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,065
Getting him promotional deals,
commercials, salary increases,

766
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:54,315
and this freaking boyfriend
wanted to take it all away.

767
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,841
- Love sucks.
- Yeah, doesn't love...

768
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:59,858
Screw! Love!

769
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,741
He's a football player.

770
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:07,167
He's a piece of meat that
I sell to the highest bidder.

771
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:11,577
How many good years
you think he's got left... Five?

772
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:15,880
What, ten?
If there's a miracle.

773
00:40:17,552 --> 00:40:19,180
I just...

774
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,407
Why couldn't he have just
waited a couple years?

775
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,459
Why did you confess to killing Jeremy?

776
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:42,485
I was there.
I remember fighting.

777
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:44,091
I thought I must have done it.

778
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:47,096
Thanks for getting me released.

779
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:49,389
Any chance you'll be playing again?

780
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:52,593
Team docs won't let me play.

781
00:40:52,944 --> 00:40:55,370
They say I have permanent brain damage.

782
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:58,380
I'm sorry, Linc.

783
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,422
I had it all.

784
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:03,642
Career, someone I loved...

785
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,790
Football gave me everything.

786
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,696
And then took it all away.
