by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

TISH: It’s Twyla's most accessible work.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,688
I took a chance and got us tickets.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,858
I hope you like dance. I'm game for anything.

8
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:21,962
I get so wrapped up in my work,

00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,798
I forget there's a whole
other world out there.

Dr. Stern here. Mmm-hmm.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,045
Tell him the results are positive

00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,489

I'll see you Friday.

00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,132
Buzz, we're going to Florida next weekend.

22
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,972
I don't want to go with Ted,
I want to go with Daddy.

23
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,946
Oh, we will, honey. Real soon.

24
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,508
I'll take us all to Florida.

25
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,109
Give your Daddy a kiss. Get in the car.

26
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,389
Buzz, you know about making promises.

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,190

- Out of order.

Officer William Davis, Suffolk County PD.

45

He's a long way from home.

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,669
Well, he tried to let his
assailant know he was a cop.

47
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,970
Would've been better off
reaching for his piece.

48
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,176
He's wearing a vest. He expected trouble.

49
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,872
He found it.

50
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,980
So the killer...

51
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:05,249
He threaded the bars of the
gate and found major arteries.

52
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,258
He was sure-handed.

53
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,290
Unless these wounds are just for show.

54
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,524
Davis might've been trailing someone.

55
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,529
A pen.

56
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,166
No memo pad.

57
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,337
TIMMINS: Buzz was a dedicated officer.

58
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,972
If he was on someone's tail,
he'd just keep doggin' the guy.

59
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,983
His case log has a butcher shop break-in,

60
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,144
vandalism at a laundromat.

61
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,513
Which of these was he dogging in the city?

62
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,251
- It'd be in his memo book.
- GOREN: Which was swiped.

63
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,895
According to this time sheet, he
punched out at 4:00 yesterday.

64
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,022
You know how it is. You punch
out, you keep working.

65
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,132
Cigarettes.

66
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,461
From the reservation?

67
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,071
A smuggling investigation?

68
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,167
I'm not saying he was Serpico.

69
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,976
If Buzz was killed in the line of duty,

70
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,086
it doubles his family's death benefit.

71
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,681
Okay.

72
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,853
He's going through a divorce.
He's got child support, legal fees.

73
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,155
So he's been moonlighting. Any other sidelines

74
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,389
besides selling off-tax cigarettes?

75
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,663
That's the only one I heard of.

76
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,925
Maybe the one you didn't hear about

77
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,368
is the one that caught up with him.

EAMES: How come all divorced
cops have the same decorator?

00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,317
The PDR.

81
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,054
Unless this guy's a hypochondriac,

82
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,647
he's not reading these for pleasure.

83
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,286
This was his bedtime reading.
Escort ads and 800 numbers.

84
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,956
That painting.

85
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,062
There was something bigger hanging here.

86
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,911
How many 8-year-old girls
you know who like sports cars?

87
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,479
Besides me?

88
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,686
It’s freshly cut.

89
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,400
Nothing.

90
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,769
Unless that's what he was
picking up in the city.

91
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,637
Something to stash in there.

92
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,080
We were saying goodbye,

93
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,073
and then he promised to take us to Florida.

94
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,887
He said this time he meant it.

95
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,216
And I almost believed him.

96
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,252
He give any hint how he was
going to pay for this trip?

97
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,263
No, but I figured it was his raise.

98
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,491
What raise?

99
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,031
He was up for a promotion, to detective.

100
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,402
They probably told you that at the station.

101
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,532
No, nobody mentioned it. Did he
say why he was being promoted?

102
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:15,046
He was close to cracking a
very big case. Medicare fraud.

103
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,443
That explains the medical books.

104
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:23,120
You're a secretary, Janice,
at an insurance company?

105
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,713
- A medical insurance company?
- Yes.

106
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,228
I bet your adjusters use these
in the office all the time.

107
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,993
If Buzz was investigating Medicare fraud,

108
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,792
he'd need access to insurance records.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,541
Buzz being a quick-thinking cop,

110
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,074
he would've looked for a shortcut.

111
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,973
Especially if it was for critical information.

112
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,842
He would've looked for a computer password,

113
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,514
like this one here.

114
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,448
Maybe your password?

115
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,685
He said if I loaned him my password

116
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,061
it would be like giving him
the last piece to the puzzle.

117
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,462
He'd get promoted.

118
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,361
And Melissa could be proud of her Daddy.

119
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,577
The officer will take you home.

120
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,615
Her company can tell us
what files he accessed.

121
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,556
Maybe instead of investigating
fraud, Buzz was committing it.

122
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,064
Buzz, he was boning up

123
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,658
on infectious diseases.

124
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,703
Infectious diseases

125
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,769
and escort ads.

126
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,082
Have you told anyone about me yet?

127
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,359
There isn't much to tell yet.

128
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:12,791
Other than outside a spa, I've never
seen so many jets in one shower.

129
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,824
I like a clean body.

130
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,100
You're so beautiful.

131
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,234
There really isn't a jealous
boyfriend somewhere?

132
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,808
No, not for the last 3 years.

133
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,878
I've gotten used to being alone.

134
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,851
From now on, you'll be anything but alone.

135
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,715
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

136
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,291
Hi, Bobby. I'm Angel.

137
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,758
Come on in. Can I take your coat?

138
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,998
Oh, hi. He didn't mention he had a friend.

139
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,301
Actually, I'm his partner.

140
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,242
Whatever. You're cute.

141
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,809
Can you get me something from the mini?

142
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,209
Oh.

143
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,919
Right, "partner."

144
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,215
Do you remember on the phone,
when I didn't discuss specifics?

145
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,153
- I just came here for a little conversation.
- Save it.

146
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,959
We just want to ask you about one
of your conversation buddies.

147
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,157
I don't know him.

148
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,896
You should. His phone records have
him calling you every other week.

149
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,702
GOREN: Hey, you know, it's Friday night.

150
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:33,903
I'm sure there's lots of guys out there
that are dying for, uh, conversation.

151
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,909
But if you'd rather sit here
with us all night...

152
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,542
Okay. I know him.

153
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,678
Buzz, the cop, right?

154
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,050
The first time we hooked up, he tinned me.

155
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,383
Then he asked for a PBA discount.

156
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,586
$50 bucks.

157
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,194
I tell you, you give a guy a badge and...

158
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,034
Did he ask about any of your other clients?

159
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,398
All cops are nosy.

160
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,470
What did he want to know about your clients?

161
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,070
Just who they were, where they worked.

162
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,642
Did he ask you if any of them had
a sexually transmitted disease

163
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,049
or any other infections?

164
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,679
Yeah, sure. But I think he
was just being careful.

165
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,926
Your regulars, any of them
stop seeing you lately?

166
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,429
Well, Reverend Tony

167
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,300
and Mr. Cabezas, a couple others.

168
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,860
We'll need telephone numbers,
whatever you have on them.

169
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,405
Buzz could have been looking at
her Johns' medical histories

170
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,778
and then using that information
to shake them down.

171
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,839
And one of the Johns shook back.

172
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,820
He said he was a police officer.

173
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,415
He shows me a badge, and
then he asks me for money,

174
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,121
otherwise he was gonna arrest me
in front of my wife and kids.

175
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,186
He blackmailed you. How much?

176
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,961
$1,600. That was all my savings.

177
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,029
And what did he have on you?

178
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,842
Evidence that you'd been treated

179
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,673
for a sexually transmitted disease?

180
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,145
No, no. I've never been treated for that.

181
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,978
Listen, I know that what I
did with Angel was wrong,

182
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,381
but it was safe.

183
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,119
Buzz took him for $1,600.

184
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,623
Pretty much the same
ballpark as the other Johns.

185
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,252
But it doesn't seem like he was blackmailing
them with their medical records.

186
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,922
Okay. As dirty as Davis was, he's
still a member of the family.

187
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,958
Let's keep this from the
press, for his kid's sake.

188
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,069
It would've taken 50 Johns to
fill up the hole in Buzz's wall.

189
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,873
Buzz had to be going for bigger fish.

190
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,379
Well, it looks like he was trying.

191
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,938
The insurance company
tracked the files he accessed.

192
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,782
The patient records of 3 doctors.

193
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,752
2 on the Upper East Side,

194
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,155
1 in Soho.

195
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,689
Why would someone access my patient records?

196
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:06,526
We believe the hacker was targeting
male patients with STDs.

197
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,265
We refer those out.

198
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,564
We're loathe to use antibiotics,
as are our patients.

199
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,165
Dr. Kantor, you're not the
subject of this investigation.

200
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,541
Of course not.

201
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,605
You don't believe us.

202
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,437
Is that because you've been
investigated before,

203
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,950
because you practice unconventional medicine?

204
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,178
Yes.

205
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:32,189
The AMA, the insurance
companies, managed care.

206
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,357
Has anybody bothered you lately?

207
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,885
The IRS called about 4 weeks ago.

208
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,589
They asked about your patients?

209
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,260
The investigator had a tip that some of
them took inflated medical deductions.

210
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,962
It was pure harassment.

211
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,469
Who were the patients?

212
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,666
One has lupus,

213
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,642
the other a tropical disease she's
been fighting for the past few weeks.

214
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,444
All women?

215
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,107
Yes. And none of them had an STD.

216
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,288
STERN: The last time I spoke
to the IRS was 8 years ago

217
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,824
over a tax shelter my former
accountant got me into.

218
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,793
Well, this would have been somebody
pretending to be an IRS investigator.

219
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,497
The same somebody who hacked into
your patients' insurance records.

220
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,862
Why would someone do that?

221
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,131
We think he was looking for embarrassing
information to blackmail your patients.

222
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,604
Maybe a married patient with an STD.

223
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,537
I don't handle STDs. Not
my specialty. I'm more...

224
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,907
GOREN: Internal medicine. Yale.

225
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,709
And, uh, here you're being honored
for your work in South Africa,

226
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,885
combating infectious diseases.

227
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,226
We went into the townships,
we did what we could.

228
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,557
The diseases we saw were fascinating.

229
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,722
The way they mutate, they'll outlive us all.

230
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:50,393
You didn't bring this little fellow
all the way from Africa, did you?

231
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,869
Look, look, he brought a tiger
cub to the kids at St. Teresa's.

232
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,167
STERN: There are no tigers in Africa.

233
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,302
Not even in the Cape Town Zoo?

234
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,074
We'd like to go through your
patients' files with you.

235
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,380
See if anybody in there might fit
the bill as a blackmail victim.

236
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,913
STERN: I highly doubt it's worth your time.

237
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,823
Most of my patients have digestive
problems. Acid reflux, stuff like that.

238
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,150
I have to tell you, it doesn't sound like

239
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,786
the sort of thing blackmailers look for.

240
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:23,664
Dr. Stern, I gotta tell you,
blackmailing is right up our alley.

241
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,766
I mean, we are pretty good at
sniffing out potential victims.

242
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,307
(CHUCKLING)

243
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,707
My partner might be a little
hard on the furniture,

244
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,439
but he's right about sniffing
out blackmail victims.

245
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,775
STERN: There's just a little
matter of patient privilege.

246
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,546
You should discuss this with my attorney.

247
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,348
Let me give you his number.

248
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,524
You're already fobbing
us off on your attorney?

249
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,994
I don't like lawsuits from my patients.

250
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,992
Your hand shakes.

251
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:56,989
Uh-uh.

252
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,761
It's either nerves, or an intention tremor.

253
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,632
An intention tremor. It started in college.

254
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,777
I guess that eliminated surgery for you.

255
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:13,173
No loss. Even in college, I let my
lab partners do the dissecting.

256
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,018
Stern couldn't have killed Buzz.

257
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:27,086
Uh, he has a tremor. He lacks the
dexterity to have committed the crime.

258
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,198
This turn-gate was vandalized.

259
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,436
It was vandalized so that Buzz was forced

260
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,308
to use the one closest to the staircase.

261
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,717
Dr. Stern had a stainless steel
door on his cabinet rigged

262
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,779
so he could look at the
changing area from his desk.

263
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,417
He likes to watch.

264
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,727
If he arranged to have Buzz killed,

265
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,132
he would have wanted front row seats.

266
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,330
From the staircase.

267
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,341
So he sabotaged the other exit.

268
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,570
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

269
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,270
The woman with the tropical disease

270
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,144
slipped into a coma this morning.

271
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,015
Until you look close, you can't
tell it's varnished macaroni.

272
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,182
Isn't it fun?

273
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,987
Yes. As advertised.

274
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,186
Roger.

275
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,626
What are you doing at an opening?

276
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,791
Tish Van Der Wahl, meet Dr. Scott Borman.

277
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,960
He's got some of the biggest
patients in New York.

278
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,162
Really?

279
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,668
You must be the one who brought Roger here.

280
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,435
His idea of a big night is to stay
home and watch the Surgery Channel.

281
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,807
Well, we're going to change all that.

282
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,970
I bet you will.

283
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,212
Tish, let me get you a refill.

284
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,982
So, Scott, what's your specialty?

285
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,878
Hands-on care.

286
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,321
Roger's been keeping you under wraps.

287
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,553
Now I see why.

288
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,736
EAMES: Was Dr. Roger Stern

289
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,568
one of the specialists you saw?

290
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,608
Uh, I saw him, yes,

291
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,909
but it was a while ago, for something
unrelated. Why do you ask?

292
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,846
Well, someone hacked into his
records, and yours, Megan.

293
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:30,752
And another woman, who's also being
treated for an unknown viral infection.

294
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,380
Emily Wagner?

295
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,349
EAMES: You know her?

296
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,328
I got a call, and they mentioned
her name but I don't...

297
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,457
A call from somebody with the IRS.

298
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,994
Yes. He said he was investigating

299
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,765
some of Dr. Stern's business expenses.

300
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,843
He tried deducting the dinners
that you had together.

301
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,337
You dated him.

302
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,815
How did it end?

303
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,085
We just... we went our own ways.

304
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,453
He was married to his practice.

305
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,287
Was there any other reason for the breakup?

306
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,760
No. Would you excuse me? I'm awfully tired.

307
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,993
Sure, sure.

308
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,366
I just thought, being a germaphobic,

309
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,065
Dr. Stern broke up with you
when you got sick.

310
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,067
No, I got sick after.

311
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,371
Oh. Well, we'll show ourselves out.

312
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,650
Typhoid Roger. You dump him, you get sick.

313
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,779
Blackmail him, you get killed.

314
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,683
The CDC determined one woman was infected

315
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,127
with Rift Valley fever,
the other with Nipah virus.

316
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,765
They're obscure, potentially
lethal zoonotic viruses,

317
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,700
meaning they're found in animals.

318
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,005
Anything I could catch from my local vet?

319
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,132
Not unless he's been in
the Southern Hemisphere

320
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,971
playing fetch with flying bats.

321
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,535
Then these woman were more likely
deliberately, uh, infected?

322
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,445
Assuming you could get hold of the viruses.

323
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,011
DEAKINS: Well, thanks, Doc.

324
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,054
Let's keep in lock-step with the CDC
and the Health Department, huh?

325
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,778
We're already best friends.

326
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,955
Even if you connect Stern to these women,

327
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,594
the guy's an acid reflux specialist.

328
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,859
How does he get his hands on these bugs?

329
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,263
The tiger cub. I need to
track down the tiger cub.

330
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,527
GOREN: Thanks.

331
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,067
The tiger cub that Stern
brought to the hospital

332
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,803
was from the Hudson Zoo,

333
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,676
where his donations have made him
a special friend of the zoo.

334
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:42,251
And where he's taken seminars
on veterinary sciences.

335
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,885
BORMAN: Two civilians contaminated?

336
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,255
That's pretty wild.

337
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,390
Do you keep specimens of these viruses?

338
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,425
Uh, the lab keeps cultures

339
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,992
for diagnostic purposes.

340
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,434
If you need to change, Dr.
Borman, we can wait outside.

341
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,341
Oh, that's okay.

342
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:09,039
We're all mammals in here. Right, ladies?

343
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,842
Whatever you say, Doctor.

344
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,450
You do know, of course, that zoonotic

345
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,355
doesn't mean that the
viruses came from the zoo.

346
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,397
It doesn't? My partner was telling me that.

347
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,558
But it doesn't make sense to me,
because there's the word "zoo."

348
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,001
Guys. We never listen.

349
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,502
You conducted seminars

350
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,706
for special friends of the zoo.

351
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,372
Well, the directors think I'm a
good ambassador for the zoo.

352
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,144
Because you have so much in
common with your animals?

353
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,753
Like Tarzan, right?

354
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,327
There's a doctor, a Dr. Roger Stern.

355
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,492
- He attended some of your seminars.
- Sure.

356
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,624
Oh, these guys are like groupies.

357
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,499
They, uh, take one lecture,
and go on a field trip.

358
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,232
They think they're saving the planet.

359
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,864
Would you hand me those?

360
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,202
(SCOFFS)

361
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,102
Did Dr. Stern ever ask you
about Nipah or RVF virus?

362
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,479
No, no, no.

363
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,510
But one of your seminars
was about zoonotic viruses.

364
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,283
Well, it was on arenaviruses.

365
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,449
A completely different viridae.

366
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,928
We classify viruses with what
we call the Baltimore system.

367
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,362
You've lost me.

368
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,897
It doesn't matter.

369
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,068
Uh, well,

370
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,000
it's almost showtime.

371
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,637
We have a male hyena
that we're going to neuter.

372
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,507
You are welcome to stay and watch me operate.

373
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,979
It's quite a specimen.

374
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,574
That's okay. I've seen my share of specimens.

375
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,422
It is fascinating how they
complement each other.

376
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,020
Tarzan and Dr. Stern?

377
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,622
Stern likes to watch,
Borman likes to be watched.

378
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,198
Megan's reasons for breaking up with Stern...

379
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,669
There's something she's not telling us.

380
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:27,150
The Health Department told
me it's an animal virus.

381
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,411
I can't imagine how I got it.

382
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,285
Well, before you fell ill,
you were dating Dr. Stern.

383
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,294
You might have gone someplace
where you got exposed.

384
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,355
I don't see how. We went
to the theater, to the opera.

385
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,695
He showed you a good time.

386
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,599
Yeah, I did most of the showing.

387
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,228
He said he hadn't been to the Met

388
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,796
since his mother dragged him
to La Boheme when he was ten.

389
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,436
EAMES: I hope he appreciated your efforts.

390
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:56,446
He said before he met me,
his life was bereft.

391
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,310
EAMES: That must have been nice to hear.

392
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,410
And you showed him new things.

393
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,679
So if...

394
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,452
If he asked you to do things
that you hadn't done before,

395
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:12,359
you might try it, just to make him happy.

396
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,430
Well, yes, within reason, I guess.

397
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,770
Did he ever ask you anything involved
with his friend, Dr. Scott Borman?

398
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,014
I was so dumb not to have seen it.

399
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,607
How did it happen?

400
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,884
I was at Roger's. We'd been drinking.

401
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,923
The doorbell rang. It was Scott.

402
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,188
He said he was in the neighborhood.

403
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,325
It didn't occur to me they'd planned it.

404
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,058
So you drank a little more,

405
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,999
one of them made a suggestion...

406
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,162
Yeah, I thought they were joking.

407
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:58,265
But Roger said it would draw us closer.

408
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:05,475
Roger kind of drifted away,
and Scott took his place

409
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,513
in bed with me.

410
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,485
And right away, it felt wrong.

411
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:14,046
And so I looked to Roger. He was
sitting next to the bed, staring.

412
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,592
I got scared.

413
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,089
With the way that he was looking at you?

414
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,691
Yeah, I felt humiliated. I wanted him to stop.

415
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,100
I started crying,

416
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,365
and he got this

417
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:30,998
little smile.

418
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,834
He saw me crying, and he smiled.

419
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,679
EAMES: After this, you stopped seeing him?

420
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,581
He kept calling, apologizing.
I told him there was no going back.

421
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,385
GOREN: But you did see him again?

422
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:48,447
Well, I agreed to have dinner, in public.

423
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,061
When I got there, he gave me
a "no hard feelings" gift.

424
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,721
A pair of earrings.

425
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,564
And he insisted putting them on you.

426
00:25:58,957 --> 00:25:59,958
Yes.

427
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,363
But with that hand tremor of his...

428
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,932
He pricked me. My earlobe started bleeding.

429
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,612
Tish, please. You're having a bad reaction.

430
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,081
A bad reaction?

431
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,414
There's nothing wrong with
me, Roger. It’s you.

432
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,580
Take a look in the mirror. I
can't believe I almost... Don't!

433
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,750
Just stay away from me.

434
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:39,540
Stuck-up little prude. It’s too
bad we have to let this one go.

435
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,477
I'm not kidding, Roger. We
can't afford another mistake.

436
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,009
Get past it, Scott.

437
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,060
They infect these women for revenge?

438
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,691
Maybe.

439
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:06,667
Most killers get satisfaction
from witnessing their handiwork.

440
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,571
Not these two. When they inject these women,

441
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,001
it's fire and forget.

442
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,673
A voyeur and an exhibitionist.
It’s a wonder they found each other.

443
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,771
Isn't the world a swell place?

444
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,682
The lab tests on Megan's
earrings was inconclusive.

445
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:26,450
But the jewelry store said they sold
Dr. Stern 4 pairs of earrings.

446
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,389
One was returned by Emily Wagner.

447
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,755
The woman in a coma.

448
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,991
She returned it 2 days before she
first reported symptoms to her doctor.

449
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,921
Let me find a judge.

450
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,892
When you leave, I want everything
back where you found it.

451
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,699
Housekeeping duties aren't
stipulated in the warrant.

452
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,238
What's this autoclave for?
To steam vegetables?

453
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,907
Huh? Get him out of here.

454
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,068
Let's get everybody out of here.

455
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,841
Uh, we need a HAZMAT team.

456
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:32,620
Bolivian Hemorrhagic Fever, Lassa,
anthrax, alpha pathogens.

457
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,617
The baddest boys on the block.

458
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:38,025
Everything was safe and sealed,

459
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,721
or I wouldn't keep them in my home.

460
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,423
Where'd you get these specimens?

461
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,763
The Bolivian and the Lassa
I acquired from doctors

462
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,732
who encountered them in the field.

463
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,139
And the anthrax? Because
there are a lot of people here

464
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,267
interested in knowing how you
got your hands on a bio-weapon.

465
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,842
It's from South Africa. A fellow
collector in their defense department.

466
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,939
I can give you his name.

467
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,143
I should have gotten rid of it, I know.

468
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,652
I will pay a fine. I won't do it again.

469
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,315
If it were only that easy.

470
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,486
Our lab told us

471
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,993
some of the vials have been
opened recently and resealed.

472
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:17,693
Those open vials included
the Nipah virus and RVF.

473
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,861
Two women that you dated were
infected with these same viruses.

474
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,899
I have 267 specimens.

475
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,540
Whatever virus anyone gets in this
city I probably have in my collection.

476
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,141
Ah.

477
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,276
Or you infected these women

478
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,514
because they wouldn't be part of
your other little collection.

479
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,579
The one you share with Dr. Borman?

480
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:44,119
Oh? This sounds rich.

481
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,921
Megan Colby told us when she
opted out of your health plan,

482
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,900
you infected her with a pair of earrings.

483
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,367
Like this pair we found in your home.

484
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,335
Which lucky lady are these for?

485
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,169
No one. Poor Megan.

486
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,940
You know, the viruses can impair memory.

487
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,808
Even cause paranoia.

488
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:09,208
She had a very clear memory of the look
in your eyes when you were watching her.

489
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,348
STERN: And I see my lawyer's here.

490
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,685
Our threesome's over.

491
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,923
Lab says the virus strains
in the women are too degraded

492
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,263
to match with the ones in his collection.

493
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,064
As far as finding other victims,

494
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,163
now we have 267 pathogens
Stern might have used.

495
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,901
This just doesn't stop.

496
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,739
If Buzz Davis hadn't tried to
put the squeeze on Dr. Stern,

497
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,610
he might have actually busted this
case and earned his promotion.

498
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,913
Stern kept his specimens sorted
according to the Baltimore system.

499
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,852
But this one vial,

500
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,317
it's out of order.

501
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,525
It's a rabies virus.

502
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:56,422
Of all the pathogens, he was
only using the zoonotics.

503
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,762
Animal virus.

504
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:01,498
At least we can narrow our search
to women with those infections.

505
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,338
He said I was the missing piece in his life.

506
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,869
I really thought he enjoyed
going to art galleries, plays,

507
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:12,882
all the sissy things he said his
mother tried to interest him in.

508
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,915
Sissy things? He used those words?

509
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,014
That's what his father called them.

510
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,420
Did he say anything else about his father?

511
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,793
Just that he was in shipping.
Worked himself to death.

512
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,262
Roger didn't want that happening to him.

513
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:33,329
Those finer things, did they
include his friend, Scott Borman?

514
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,636
Actually, Scott's the one who introduced us.

515
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,708
I used to volunteer at the zoo as a docent.

516
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,247
Did Scott do anything besides introduce you?

517
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,741
Okay, look, I really
don't want to revisit that.

518
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,685
It's a thing, it happened, that's it.

519
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,649
After that, did you go back
to work at the zoo?

520
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,027
And risk running into Scott? No. I resigned.

521
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,057
You had to go back to get your things.

522
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,689
ANAIS: They sent them to me.

523
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,632
What exactly?

524
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,637
Stupid things. A sweater, makeup,

525
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,001
my case for my contact lenses.

526
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,278
You wear contacts?

527
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,710
ANAIS: I used to.

528
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,144
Before the infection.

529
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,978
My lawyer will be here soon.

530
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,023
But if you wanna tell me what these
assault charges are all about...

531
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:31,026
It has to do with infecting one of the
volunteers at the zoo with a virus.

532
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,688
BORMAN: Excuse me?

533
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,355
Anais Hutchinson. She dated Roger Stern.

534
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,333
We've been wracking our brains
trying to figure out

535
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,396
how a zoonotic virus, the Hendra virus,

536
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,006
went from his little wine cooler

537
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:52,208
into a contact lens case that
was left by her at the zoo.

538
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,351
EAMES: That's how she was infected.

539
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,783
The rewetting solution in
the case was contaminated.

540
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,221
You didn't tell us

541
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,594
just how close you and Dr. Stern were.

542
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,431
The ladies are talking, Scott.
You wanna know what they said?

543
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,028
Tell me everything. Don't leave out a word.

544
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:19,471
I'll tell you. What they're
talking about is how

545
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,745
after you and Roger tag-teamed them...

546
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,544
They couldn't find soap strong
enough to get rid of the stench.

547
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:32,183
Well, they weren't singing the blues
when I was plowing the field.

548
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,449
Roger dumped them.

549
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:40,291
As much as it turned him on to watch
them with me, he'd get jealous.

550
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,067
EAMES: No, they bailed
out of your little freak show.

551
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,533
And then the next thing they knew...

552
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,037
They were hooked to an IV being
pumped full of antivirals.

553
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,638
Please.

554
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:53,070
Miss Hutchinson worked at a zoo.

555
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,202
Wild beasts rolling around in their own feces.

556
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,643
You said that he got jealous.

557
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,411
Well, maybe he thought

558
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,617
that he was being taken advantage of, by you.

559
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,957
- Well, I don't see that.
- EAMES: Well, he's a Park Avenue doctor.

560
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,894
- EAMES: You're a vet.
- GOREN: Yeah. I mean,

561
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:18,867
he's doing all the work, bagging all these
beautiful, cultured young socialites.

562
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,493
What do you bring to the table?

563
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,498
What do I bring? Well, I'll tell you.

564
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,468
Roger can't satisfy these women.

565
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,278
That's where I come in. I seal the deal,

566
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,447
and Roger likes to watch.

567
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:36,282
See these women going out of
their mind with pleasure.

568
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,652
If I'm guilty of anything,

569
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,715
it's spoiling these girls for other men.

570
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:55,471
His Speedos must be pinching off
the blood supply to his brain.

571
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,632
In the midst of all his strutting,

572
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:01,075
he did present an alternative theory
to Miss Hutchinson's infection.

573
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,408
One that creates a reasonable doubt.

574
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,051
If both doctors hold to their stories...

575
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,950
You know, we know Scott's story,

576
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,319
but we don't know Roger's.

577
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:17,019
Now, he said that seeing
women being pleasured

578
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,052
was what Roger found exciting.

579
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,898
But Megan saw something else in the
way that Roger was looking at her.

580
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,563
- He was getting off on her humiliation.
- Yes.

581
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,469
Scott and Roger were using these
women to meet their needs.

582
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,808
But I doubt they really know
what each ether's needs are.

583
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,514
It's time that we show them.

584
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,559
Why don't you just copy the form you
filled out when you first arrested me?

585
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,428
It's ridiculous. My lawyer told me
I'm supposed to get bail today.

586
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,660
GOREN: Okay, your father's name.

587
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,959

That's right, shipping.

What are you looking at?

594
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,716
Nothing. I'm just thinking about
these preposterous charges.

595
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,553
Well, we feel pretty good about them.

596
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,026
And our witnesses.

597
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,457
Like Megan Colby?

598
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,999
Her character leaves a lot to be desired.

599
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,535
He was right. You are jealous.

600
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,764
No, Dr. Borman told us that
you're jealous of his prowess.

601
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,899
That's nonsense.

602
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,567
He said that you couldn't satisfy them,

603
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:44,478
so you brought him in to pick up the slack.

604
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,277
He told us that it turned you on

605
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,978
to see what a good time
they were having with him.

606
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:53,521
And that excitement, well,
gave way to jealousy.

607
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,057
No, he's a brute.

608
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,993

Scott told us that your girlfriends
had the time of their life with him.

611
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,368
What are you talking about?
They were debased, humiliated.

612
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,930
I turned them into the corncob in the pigsty,

613
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,101
with that rutting hog on top of them.

614
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,839
They'd look at me, wanting
me to call him off!

615

They wanted you to save them?

Your mother, I need her name.

- Vivian.
- Vivian. That's nice. Sophisticated.

621

One of your girlfriends told us that Vivian

622
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,471
- used to take you to the opera. Is that true?
- Yes.

623
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,100
She wanted to enrich your young
life. You must've liked that.

624

dragged you to the opera.

Well, Roger here, now, he got stuck

627
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,013
doing all the sissy things with his mother.

628
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,151
Isn't that what his father called it?

00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,155
That's right. Sissy things.

630
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:04,421
You know something just occurred to me.
Those women, Megan, the others.

631

Let's leave her out of this.

No, Vivian didn't want you
to end up like your Dad.

A brute of a longshoreman,
working himself to death.

Why don't you just tell the truth, Roger?

638
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,914
That everything you did wrong,

639
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,616
Mom said it was because of
your Dad's side of the family.

640
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,519
Your mother, she put on airs.

641

She made you do sissy things.

GOREN: But you were too young
to do anything about it.

644
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,796
But then you became an adult,

645
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,202
and you found a way

646
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,902
to square things up.

those women, to degrade them,

that was your mother being humiliated.

inflicted on them by using you.

00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,585
You know what he does all day?

694
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,192
You know where he puts his hands?

695
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,097
He's a filthy animal, a pig.

696
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:35,336
He's a killer. He killed Buzz Davis.

697
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,997
Yes, yes, that's right,
A killer. A wild beast.

698
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,367
And you watched.

699
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,215
I'm not like him

700
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,012
I'm nothing like him.

701
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:59,659
Both Dr. Stern and Dr. Borman are willing
to plead to multiple counts of assault.

702
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,998
Stern offered to roll on Borman
for the murder of Officer Davis.

703
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,133
How much time just on the assaults?

704
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,367
Separate counts to be served consecutively,
minimum 15 years each count.

705
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:15,742
So they'd be very old men before
they got out, if they ever get out.

706
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,906
And if no one's prosecuted
for Buzz Davis' murder,

707
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,109
the circumstance of his death
wouldn't be on the record.

708
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,379
CARVER: That's true, but...

709
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,752
For all anybody'd know,
he died in the line of duty.

710
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,491
It matters?

711
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,818
Yeah. It matters to his daughter.

712
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,903
What is it?

713
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,915
The South African source for Stern's anthrax.

714
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,387
He told the FBI he gave Stern
5 grams of the stuff.

715
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,588
But our lab only found
3 in Stern's collection.

716
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,327
(SIGHING)
