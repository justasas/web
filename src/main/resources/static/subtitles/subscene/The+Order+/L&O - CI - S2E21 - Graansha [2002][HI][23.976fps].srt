By my count, she's been run
over at least 3 times.

to get out of the way.

Or she didn't try.

72
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,413
Maybe she recognized the car.

He got here before she did though,

did all the eating and drinking.

Yeah, all of that. She
didn't even take off her coat.

was getting the brush-off.

He did a couple minutes after that.

96
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,350
I guess he thought he could
still change her mind.

97
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,157
Is that what he looked like he
was doing outside with her,

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,694
Well, he came back 20 minutes
later and he looked upset.

100
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,324
Then he asked for directions
to the E train and took off.

101
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,666
If he came here by subway, why would
he need directions back to the subway?

102
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,973
Unless he took a cab, or
drove and had car trouble.

103
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,875
No. He would have had to have a tow.

104
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,281
No, maybe his car trouble
was that his car disappeared.

105

Maybe he filed a report.

know, she's a probation officer.

really not interested in my car.

reports his car stolen, then ditches it.

That's not much of a plan.

He's not much of a liar, either.

violated anyone in over 3 months.

Bryce was happy to let us believe
that he was still a little kid.

Let's see if he has an adorable record.

156
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:41,418
He's got a sealed juvie record.
He might be one of her probationers.

157
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,654
Maybe Bryce met Lawson through his kid.

158
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,856
Or maybe not. The kid isn't
one of her current cases.

00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,857
I mean, first he reports the car
stolen then gets it washed.

179
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,663
Then goes back to the car theft scenario,

180
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,298
ditches the car and pulls the wrong wires.

181
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,766
How tall do you think Malcolm Bryce is?

182
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,472
6'5", give or take.

183
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,846
The last person to sit in this car

184
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,850
was 5'10" at the most.

185
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,990
5'10". What an adorable height.

186
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,158
Ann asked me to reassign Paul
Bryce to lighten her caseload.

187
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,890
How'd Paul end up on probation?

188
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,933
Uh, when he was 15, he stole
a car with another kid.

189
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,899
There was a firearm found in the vehicle.

190
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,302
It was Paul's first offense.
He got 18 months’ probation.

191
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,998
Here, this is hers.

192
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,871
Did he get along with Miss Lawson?

193
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,605
She never said otherwise.
There's nothing in the file.

194
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,807
The file. Do you... do you
mind if I have a look?

195
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,110
It's locked.

196
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,344
She didn't like people poking in her things.

197
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,886
Ann was very private.

198
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:52,822
These kids, they often form attachments
to their PO's, isn't that right?

199
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,881
No. We intervene before
things get out of hand.

200
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:58,020
In any event, we don't
arbitrarily reassign kids.

201
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,395
Did Miss Lawson ever talk
to you about Paul's mother?

202
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:03,824
No.

203
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,535
Her phone logs show only one
phone call from Mrs. Bryce,

204
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,336
the day before Miss Lawson
had Paul transferred.

205
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,575
JANET: It was about something Paul told me.

206
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,809
He said Ann was taking him to an
exhibit at the Whitney on a Saturday.

207
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,646
It was wishful thinking on his part?

208
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,984
Yes. I called Ann.
Apparently she had no idea.

209
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,754
He had a crush on her.

210
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,122
Is that why she transferred him?

211
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,261
She said that he would do better
with a male probation officer.

212
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,820
How did Paul take it?

213
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,093
I think he suspected that I
had something to do with it,

214
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,364
because a few days later
he moved in with his father.

215
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:44,374
Your ex-husband, he told us that he had
an interest in juvenile delinquency.

216
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,376
Is that because of what happened to Paul?

217
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,413
Well, that's how Malcolm
deals with personal problems.

218
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,573
He studies them.

219
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:54,210
There would have had to been some
kind of sociological force at work?

220
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,344
Yes.

221
00:12:55,541 --> 00:13:00,047
By the way, do you know where your son
was the night Ann Lawson was killed?

222
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,452
He was at Malcolm's.

223
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,824
First the good news. We found your car.

224
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,695
Oh, good. Was there anything in it?

225
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,235
We'll get to that.

226
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,334
And now the bad news.

227
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,464
About your casual date with Ann Lawson,

228
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,001
we were told it would have been
inappropriate for her to date you.

229
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,813
Well, she did. I met her at this bar...

230
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,680
It wasn't a date. It's about work, your work.

231
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,978
What? What are you talking about?

232
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:33,217
Your study of criminal
behavior among juveniles.

233
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,983
Ann was helping you.

234
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,890
She...

235
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,490
Maybe she gave you sealed records.

236
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,435
You didn't want to get her
in trouble so you lied to us.

237
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,802
That was before you found out she was killed.

238
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,603
With all your sneaking around,

239
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,645
it's no wonder we got the wrong impression
about you and Ann. Anybody would.

240
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:06,223
Especially someone with a juicy adolescent
crush on their probation officer.

241
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,362
Oh, I get it. Paul ran her over.

242
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,287
With his... with his skateboard?

243
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,062
No, with your car.

244
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,367
You see this damage?

245
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,335
Ann's blood and hair
were found in the radiator.

246
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,603
And then there's the rear
view mirror and the seat,

247
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,912
which was adjusted for someone
roughly around 5'10...

248
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,848
Paul didn't do this.

249
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,888
I had the car, I drove it to the bar.

250
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,421
But he knew you were meeting with her.

251
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,488
And seeing how smitten he was over her,

252
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,326
once he saw the two of you together,

253
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,230
he just had to vent. He had to.

254
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,259
He had the extra set of keys,
he took your car and Wham.

255
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,933
Paul is not a criminal.

256
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,539
His rap sheet says otherwise.

257
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,076
He made one mistake.

258
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,604
There's a big difference between one
bad judgment and a criminal mindset.

259
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,707
Paul does not have the predisposition
for antisocial behavior.

260
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,913
That's learned over years and
years through generations.

261
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,691
I went out and I got my own copy.

262
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,422
It's The Jukes Family of New York State.

263
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,261
"The true story of a genetically-linked
clan of paupers, harlots,

264
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,029
"misfits and petty criminals."

265
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,667
It's inspired a whole
generation of behaviorists,

266
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,332
and maybe it inspired you.

267
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,737
Look, Professor,

268
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,609
now, maybe it's just hit home
now that your son was...

269
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,346
Paul didn't do it.

270
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,981
I did.

271
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,182
I was in love with Ann and I
begged her not to break it off.

272
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,659
But she wouldn't listen.

273
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,322
She walked away. She just walked away.

274
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,322
And I killed her.

275
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,304
He just took the rap for his kid.

276
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,334
What a good Dad.

277
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:08,072
What it did was it gave us an open
invitation to search his place.

278
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,774
Make sure the warrant covers the kid's room.

279
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,450
Other than a pair of moldy shoes in
the kid's closet, it's slim pickings.

280
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,655
This is a family tree that Bryce
has been putting together.

281
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,253
It's pretty rough, and it's
got his own shorthand.

282
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,000
But there's one name here,

283
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,231
L. Devlin.

284
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,969
Now, there was a Devlin on the
list of Ann's open cases.

285
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,112
Yeah. "Devlin, Lane."

286
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,074
This docket number, it's a criminal case,

287
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,750
but not a delinquency file.

288
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,982
Well, this might be why.

289
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,320
If L. Devlin is the same person,
he or she was born in 1975.

290
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,454
One of her old probationers?

291
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,861
Back for an encore?

292
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,726
Aunt Trina will be claiming
her this afternoon.

293
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,102
Dad wants the viewing tomorrow night.

294
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,471
The last time I saw her, we fought.

295
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,977
I shouldn't have. She didn't deserve it.

296
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,239
Oh, now.

297
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,570
You didn't know.

298
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,519
Dad, he wants to know
on account she was run over.

299
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,746
Open casket?

300
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:28,350
Daddy, we need to see her to say goodbye.

301
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,627
Listen to me, cousin.

302
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,694
Ann was a sister.

303
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,769
She'll have pride of place,
so everyone can see her.

304
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,473
Now, you'll have to use your skills
on the left side of her face

305
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,772
but you will make her pretty.

306
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,614
Now, you can do that, can't you, cousin?

307
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,482
MAN: Lane Devlin was
picked up for shoplifting.

308
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,815
Her and her 12-year-old.

309
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,753
They tag-teamed the store?

310
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,847
It was cute.

311
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,860
Kid's up front, spilling her
Slurpee, making a diversion,

312
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,522
while Mom's stuffing
battery packs into her purse.

313
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,163
The kid's got a hell of a role model.

314
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,097
Her mom's got priors for bad checks.

315
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,464
What we can't figure,

316
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:15,233
is why her file was with a juvenile
probation officer in Manhattan.

317
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,275
You mean Ann Lawson. She's Lane Devlin's aunt.

318
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,340
Lane called her when she
and the kid got popped.

319
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,575
And she came and bailed them out?

320
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,139
Apparently, it wasn't the first time.

321
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,616
The little girl, where did she end up?

322
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,984
Back with her mom. Lawson told us
she was going to seek custody.

323
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,250
Her and the mom had a real squabble about it.

324
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,815
Lane Devlin's other relatives, uh,

325
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,818
you wouldn't happen to have
run across any of them?

326
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,195
We've had dealings with two of her brothers
for possession of stolen property,

327
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,531
and she's got a cousin doing
time for a short-dollar scheme.

328
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,600
I gotta get back in.

329
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,871
This clan of misfits and petty
criminals Professor Bryce was studying

330
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,239
was Ann Lawson's.

331
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,371
Yeah, a study that he was
afraid to tell us about.

332
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,416
Maybe one of these criminals isn't so petty.

333
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,885
I didn't talk all that much to her,

334
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,482
her being down in the city, busy with her job.

335
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,288
She was in law enforcement.

336
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,421
That must have made for some
tense moments at family dinners.

337
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,226
She got along with everybody.
She was all for the family.

338
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,962
EAMES: A family she never
mentioned to her co-workers.

339
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,766
Why would she?

340
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,431
What do you people want from me?

341
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,633
I'd like a glass of water.

342
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,742
Is that okay?

343
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,972
No, no, that's okay. I can get it myself.

344
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,982
I need to run some names by you,

345
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,040
starting with your brother Evan.

346
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,679
Hi.

347
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,214
You're Fiona, right?

348
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,387
I'm Bobby.

349
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,462
I'm sorry about your Aunt Annie.

350
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,272
What are you reading?

351
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,767
A schoolbook.

352
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,211
Atlantic County School District.
That's South New Jersey.

353
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,912
You went to school there?

354
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,982
Just for a semester.

355
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,517
Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

356
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,620
You went to school there, too?

357
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,360
Last year.

358
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:31,035
Is that why your Aunt wanted
you to move in with her,

359
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,804
because you move around so much?

360
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,645
Would you have liked that,
to live with your Aunt?

361
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,014
I wouldn't have liked
living away from the family.

362
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,581
Well, wasn't your Aunt family?

363
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,488
She didn't live with the family.

364
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,291
She went to live outside, with them.

365
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,290
You mean outsiders,

366
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,798
like me?

367
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,001
Being an outsider is not such a hot thing.

368
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,683
They're suckers. Outsiders are suckers.

369
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,546
I can't imagine Ann being
killed over a custody battle.

370
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,925
Even with her criminal record, Lane
had nothing to worry about from Ann.

371
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,756
Unless you factor in the
family's criminal record.

372
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,165
You see them all checking us out?

373
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,995
I'll bet you that every one of them,

374
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,403
either by blood or marriage,
is related to the Devlins.

375
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,270
These RV's, campers, trailers.

376
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,036
This is their winter camping ground.

377
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,445
Come spring, they'll hit the road.

378
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,415
They're Travellers.

379
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:58,892
Travellers. I can't say that
I know that much about them.

380
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,329
That's how they like it. They're insular.

381
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,123
They have their own language, Shelta.

382
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,828
They're like a tribe. They're
scattered across the country

383
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,396
in family groups maintaining
a nomadic lifestyle.

384
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,874
With the rep of being scam artists.

385
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,809
Roof and driveway repair
fraud, that sort of thing.

386
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,974
They also do seasonal work, anything
to support life on the road.

387
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,679
And one of them used Professor
Bryce's car to kill her

388
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,852
over the custody of this little girl?

389
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,654
Well, one thing the Travellers
are not known for is violence.

390
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:34,691
Well, depends on how far
Ann would go to get custody.

391
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,166
I mean, she was telling Bryce everything.

392
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,227
Not just names and birth dates,

393
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,405
but financial arrangements,
their frauds, their travels,

394
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,239
the kids' neglected education.

395
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,211
That's a powerful piece of
evidence in a custody fight.

396
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:54,376
That might be what she intended to
use it for when it was finished.

397
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,852
But it could also link the Devlins

398
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,817
to hundreds of crimes across the
country from here to Missouri.

399
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,194
If someone wanted to stop
Miss Lawson from talking,

400
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,359
can you tell who would have the
authority to order such a thing?

401
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,467
Well, this symbol here...

402
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:18,066
here, it indicates a tribute
being paid to a K. Devlin

403
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,406
by other members of the family.

404
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,004
It means he could be the alpha dog.

405
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,015
Ann's older brother Kyle.

406
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,618
Bryce likes to get up close to his subjects.

407
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:33,418
He lived with this South American tribe.

408
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:39,386
He would have insisted on meeting Ann's tribe.

409
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,267
For a pair of cops investigating a
murder all the way down in the city,

410
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:50,569
you're spending a lot of time bothering
the very people who loved my sister.

411
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,109
She was a part of our family too, Mr. Devlin,

412
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,111
her being a probation officer.

413
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,243
If you have any ideas,

414
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,943
like about this boyfriend
of hers, Malcolm Bryce...

415
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,315
I don't know much about him.

416
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,583
He drove up here with Ann. Didn't he?

417
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:11,025
He charged some gas about 3 weeks…
ago, last Saturday, right?

418
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,495
At a station about a mile from here.

419
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,094
Yeah. Ann brought him
around for a cup of coffee.

420
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,692
Seemed a decent sort.

421
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,794
What did Ann tell you about him?

422
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,772
Just a guy she fancied. High school teacher.

423
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,607
Why do you suspect him?

424
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,211
Well, let's just say we're
not not suspecting him.

425
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,850
- This your truck?
- That's my son's.

426
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,011
Yeah, it looks like there's
a little mix-up here.

427
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,420
These packages say,
"50-year-warranty shingles."

428
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,151
- Yeah.
- They look a little thin to me.

429
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,090
- He's using a new amalgam.
- More like 20 years.

430
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,889
That's a spun glass core and the like.

431
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,726
And the like? This roofing tar?

432
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,356
Is that new too?

433
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,994
Because, I don't know,
it feels like crankcase oil.

434
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,095
I'll mention that to my son.

435
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,808
Hey, you know, it's kind of odd

436
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:06,272
that you called Bryce a high school teacher.

437
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,379
That's what he said he was.

438
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,252
Really? Because he's a college
professor. Teaches anthropology.

439
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,151
They study social groups. Tribes, clans.

440
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,126
Even extended families. How tall are you?

441
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,588
What's that to you?

442
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,723
Don't make us look it up
on your driver's license.

443
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,561
5'11...

444
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,102
You're all legs.

445
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,933
That's why you sit so low in the seat.

446
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,371
You don't mind, do you,
getting out of my truck?

447
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,816
You know, it might interest you to know

448
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,285
that Malcolm Bryce wrote
a book a few years ago

449
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:46,084
about a tribe of fierce warriors.

450
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,782
He's writing a new book about a new tribe.

451
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,058
It's no matter to me.

452
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,598
He started drawing a family tree,

453
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,926
and it looks like a clan of modern day nomads.

454
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:05,005
You know, itinerant tradesmen,
roofers and the like.

455
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,404
This isn't your tribe,
is it, here, you think?

456
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,018
You know, because, look, it says KD.

457
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,056
That could be you,

458
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,991
and then PD, ED. That must be your sons.

459
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,487
And then there's these little
squiggles next to the names.

460
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:32,468
You know, I think that's Bryce's
shorthand for criminal records.

461
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:37,606
Professor Bryce was putting you and
your kin under the microscope.

462
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,669
You know, like bugs on a pin?

463
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:47,281
Yeah, well, he should study his own tribe,

464
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,586
with that kid,

465
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,889
that car thief that was
panting after my sister.

466
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,614
Where'd you hear about that?

467
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,717
From Ann. He was trouble.

468
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,389
And we're finished talking.

469
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:03,859
Right?

470
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,532
If I understand you, you no longer
consider Paul a murder suspect?

471
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:12,701
Yes.

472
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,007
We believe Paul was home the
night Ann Lawson was killed.

473
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,944
But he needs to tell us about any
contact he had with her family.

474
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:26,354
This call to Rockland County from your
mother's phone on a Saturday 3 weeks ago.

475
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,991
How'd you get this number?

476
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,491
I found it at my Dad's place,
on some driving directions.

477
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,096
He was going somewhere with Miss Lawson?

478
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,598
Yes.

479
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,972
Some guy answered. He said
he was a friend of Ann's.

480
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,172
Kyle something.

481
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,479
He said that her and my Dad had just left.

482
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,314
What else did you talk about?

483
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,915
He asked me if I was one of Ann's kids.

484
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:04,819
He just... he kept talking. He was funny. I...

485
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,693
Told him all about how you feel about Ann.

486
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,093
And about your Dad.

487
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,761
Yeah.

488
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,796
I think he was a little drunk.

489
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,703
Why do you think that?

490
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,971
They were having some party.
I heard music in the back,

491
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,239
lots of people laughing and singing.

492
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,072
Kyle told us it was just a cup of coffee.

493
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,279
Might be something about that party
he doesn't want us to know about.

494
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,252
Here's the first one.

495
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:37,484
It prides me to know that we'll
be one blood from now on.

496
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,891
It's good for everyone, cousin.

497
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,463
(SPEAKING IN SHELTA)

498
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,703
TED: Sheriff Mulroney's right.

499
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,405
There must have been over
100 people at the Devlin's.

500
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,913
Lots of Indiana plates.

501
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,610
The Sheriff said he had his
deputies keeping an eye on things.

502
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,516
Yeah, well, you always got to
keep an eye on the Devlins.

503
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,852
Kyle hired you to take pictures.
It must have been a special occasion.

504
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,654
Uh-huh. Yeah, he said it was
for a confirmation party.

505
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,558
It was a very nice affair.

506
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:12,921
Right.

507
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,591
It was for his granddaughter, Fiona,

508
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:20,228
and a friend's grandson, a kid
from Indiana, Eric Brennan.

509
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:23,397
It looks over the top for a confirmation.

510
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,339
The flowers are all wrong.

511
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,934
Roses, rhododendrons, foxgloves.

512
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,638
The flowers of Ireland.

513
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:34,646
In the girl's hair. Ivy, faithfulness.

514
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,243
The blue dress, the lavender bouquet.

515
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,923
All that's traditional for an Irish bride.

516
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,450
This was an engagement
party for these two kids.

517
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,293
An arranged marriage. That's what
Ann wanted Malcolm to see.

518
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,633
An arranged marriage, between children?

519
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,905
This is just a betrothal.

520
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,544
The actual marriage will take place
when they reach a legal age.

521
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,775
Until then, the boy, Eric Brennan,
will live with the Devlins.

522
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,910
The whole idea's so primitive. An
arranged marriage in this day and age.

523
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,922
Yes, especially in light of the
stunning success people have

524
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,891
choosing their own mates in this day and age.

525
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,622
It doesn't matter what we think.
It's what Ann Lawson thought.

526
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:24,529
She had a history of intervening
on behalf of the little girl.

527
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,233
It might be what finally pushed her
into spilling her guts to Bryce.

528
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,277
I don't know anything about the
Devlins. Ann never told me anything.

529
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,381
She told you.

530
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,416
She showed you.

531
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,581
And then she took you
right into the heart of it.

532
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:51,386
The last free-living tribe of
nomads in America. What a subject.

533
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,193
What a book. Might even get you
back on the bestseller list.

534
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,357
Look! Just stop!

535
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:00,927
All Ann wanted to do was to save a little
girl from the life of petty crime.

536
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,268
Come on, what'd you do?
You just kept on pressing her.

537
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,706
Look, I swear I had no
idea they'd go that far.

538
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,744
I wanted to understand my son.

539
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,437
Ann started telling me about her family.

540
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,845
I encouraged her, maybe I pushed her too far.

541
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,281
Did you push her to take you
to this engagement party?

542
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,149
Well, I told her there'd be no book
without firsthand observation.

543
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,882
Did anyone threaten her?

544
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,515
Well, she was worried about Kyle's temper.

545
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,086
You know, she found out, you know, that he
knew and, you know, her niece told her.

546
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,902
You got no cause taking my daughter away.

547
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,874
I make sure she goes to school, I
make sure no one is harming her.

548
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,173
I am a good mother.

549
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,545
This is what they're worried about.

550
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,678
That's a good-looking
son-in-law you'll have there.

551
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,755
I know what you think.

552
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,420
Nothing indecent goes on.
This is just a promise.

553
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,299
Anybody even ask Fiona if
is this is what she wanted?

554
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,026
Fiona's a child.

555
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,004
It's up to her elders to decide
what's best for her for her future.

556
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,008
Well, maybe she had some little dream

557
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,506
about what her future might be.

558
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,613
Something that she talked
to your Aunt Annie about.

559
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,576
This is our tradition.

560
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,812
It's served us well. There's
no reason to change it.

561
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,686
How'd it do for you?

562
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:31,319
The husband your Dad chose
for you, where is he?

563
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,424
He's in prison, isn't he?

564
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,827
Five-to-ten for burglary?

565
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,366
This kid from Indiana,
how'd your Dad pick him?

566
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,702
He just pull his name out of a hat?

567
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,444
He does what's best.

568
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:51,345
Hey, Kyle found out who Professor Bryce was.

569
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,144
He found out that Ann was talking to him.

570
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,785
Dad would not harm his own sister.

571
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,453
She was family.

572
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,992
Even in death I heard him
making the arrangements.

573
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,257
He wanted her to be beautiful.

574
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,865
He wanted her to have pride of place.

575
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,767
He wanted her to be beautiful.

576
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,371
What did he say exactly?

577
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,967
The left side of her face.

578
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,307
He told them to use their
skills to make her pretty.

579
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,841
There was a police report filed last summer

580
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,683
with the Indiana State Troopers

581
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,019
by Eric's grandfather, Colin Brennan.

582
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,357
Mr. Brennan reported the theft of 7
RV's owned by the Brennan family.

583
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,828
When the police recovered the
vehicles 3 months later,

584
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,162
they traced them back to Kyle Devlin.

585
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,757
Mr. Devlin stole them?

586
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:47,201
The state cops never had a chance to find out.

587
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:51,230
Brennan dropped his complaint. He
said it was all a misunderstanding.

588
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,708
To be settled amongst themselves?

589
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,869
No, it's not that simple.

590
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,378
The outside world is fair game,

591
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,936
but not the family.

592
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,316
Devlin wouldn't want anyone
in the family to know

593
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,249
that he stole from a fellow Traveller.

594
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:05,447
Ah, I see. Restitution would
have to be done quietly.

595
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:09,253
$200,000 doesn't change hands
without the family noticing.

596
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,793
He'd have to disguise it.

597
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:14,296
Yeah. It's tradition
for the family of the bride

598
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,832
to pay a dowry to the family of the groom.

599
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,396
Devlin arranged this marriage

600
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,564
and used his granddaughter
to cover up his crime.

601
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,871
If they were confronted
with what Devlin did...

602
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,572
Why would they believe us? We're outsiders.

603
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,944
But they'd believe Ann.

604
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,549
You said there's no evidence she knew.

605
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,417
Well, maybe Professor Bryce
misplaced some of his notes.

606
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,756
First of all, I want to say
thank you to Colin Brennan

607
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,857
for entrusting young Eric to our care.

608
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,465
ALL: Here, here.

609
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,163
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

610
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,731
Now just one more word, if I may,

611
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:02,939
about our sister, Annie Devlin.

612
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,538
She didn't always agree with our way,

613
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,907
but her love was always true.

614
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,180
You're back in our arms, Annie,

615
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,650
never to leave again.

616
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,755
Here, here.

617
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,724
And one final wish here.

618
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:24,466
That the man who killed her be met
with justice, merciful and swift.

619
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,766
This is a private function.

620
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,732
Yes. We're sorry about that.

621
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,502
But we have some news that we
need to share with your family.

622
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,012
We took your advice

623
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,639
and took a closer look at Malcolm Bryce.

624
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,917
We arrested him for the murder of your sister.

625
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,751
Well, that is good news. And I appreciate
your coming down here to tell us.

626
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,087
There are just a few loose ends to tie up.

627
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,559
We never got a formal ID by the family.

628
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,722
There's a picture for you to look
at and then a form for you to sign.

629
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,198
This might not be a good idea
for your daughter to see.

630
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,828
You saw her after the mortician
did his work, isn't that right?

631
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,168
You had no idea it was this bad.

632
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,998
No, I didn't. But that's her.

633
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,275
GOREN: It's pretty shocking

634
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,143
if you see it for the first time.

635
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,680
Especially what happened to the...

636
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,116
to the left side of her face.

637
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:18,880
Thanks.

638
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:24,484
Last thing. We need some help
deciphering some notations

639
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:29,957
that we found on these
papers in Bryce's office.

640
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,733
You remember he was writing
a book about your family?

641
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:37,136
Well, it looks like your sister was helping.

642
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,672
It might even be the reason why he killed her.

643
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,844
Anybody can snoop through county records,

644
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,505
make up stories.

645
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,982
The Devlins don't go talking
family business with outsiders.

646
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,643
I should hope not.

647
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,920
Well, maybe he made it up. Let's see.

648
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:58,756
It concerns someone named Aidan. Is he here?

649
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,655
I'm Aidan Devlin.

650
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,765
And next to your name, there's a notation.

651
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,962
It says, "sine prole."

652
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,131
Now, that's Latin.

653
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,939
It means you have no children. Is that right?

654
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,637
It is.

655
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:19,011
Next to it is a symbol.
I think it means an injury.

656
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,681
You have no children
because of an injury.

657
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,076
Annie was a good girl and all,

658
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,456
but she shouldn't have been
gossiping to strangers.

659
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,824
It isn't right.

660
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:37,230
Well, at least, we know now
that Bryce wasn't making it up.

661
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,368
What about this? It's next to your name.

662
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,936
It says, "debere." That's more Latin.

663
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,339
It means a debt.

664
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,479
Next to it, there are
initials, “CB.” who's that?

665
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,245
That would be me. I'm Colin Brennan.

666
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,478
Oh.

667
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,587
And this debt?

668
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:04,119
It's a dowry. It's nothing to worry about.

669
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:09,798
Actually, anthropologists, they
have a special symbol for dowry.

670
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,931
Bryce would have used it.
So no, this is definitely a debt.

671
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:18,571
Underneath it there's another
notation. It's the number 7.

672
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,070
And it's got this little
circle thing next to it.

673
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,342
Bryce used this symbol in his other book.

674
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,009
It meant that...

675
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,882
A pig was stolen from a member of the tribe.

676
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:36,757
Which just means that the debt
is about 7 stolen pigs.

677
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,160
You're not a pig farmer are you, Mr. Brennan?

678
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,960
No, I ain't.

679
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,228
I sell recreational vehicles.

680
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,268
So, maybe the debt is about 7 stolen RV's?

681
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:54,836
Is that why he owes you money,
because he stole 7 RV's from you?

682
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,072
I told you, it's a dowry.

683
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,040
Yes, you did. What about it, Mr. Brennan?

684
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,243
Your cousin here steal from you?

685
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,582
He did.

686
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,016
Well, how much does he owe you?

687
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,224
$220,000.

688
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:14,792
I'm guessing it's as much as the
dowry for your grandson's wedding?

689
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,833
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

690
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,028
Colin, listen...

691
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:24,164
I only agreed to help you save
your honor before your family.

692
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,732
But your family can't
keep their mouths shut.

693
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:31,246
Come on, Eric. The marriage is over.

694
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:37,047
The Devlins won't be welcome
in our parts anymore.

695
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,650
And you still owe us the money.

696
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,116
I should have known.

697
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,523
I should have known it!

698
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,825
You can't trust those Brennans!

699
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,197
This is all a misunderstanding.

700
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,934
I'm sorry, Lane. I never
wanted this to happen.

701
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,441
But Ann wanted it.

702
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,538
To stop the marriage.

703
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,278
Haven't you caused enough hurt?

704
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,816
No, haven't you?

705
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:12,478
When you discovered
that Ann was telling Bryce

706
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,285
the history of the Devlin family,

707
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:19,886
or maybe I should say the
terrible misdeeds of Kyle Devlin.

708
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,495
That she was going to throw
a wrench into your deception,

709
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:28,337
stop you from marrying off your
granddaughter to hide your thievery.

710
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,403
Don't listen to this cop.

711
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,400
No, you're right. He's right.

712
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,539
Don't listen to me.

713
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,274
Listen to Ann,

714
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,180
who only ever tried to help her beloveds.

715
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,251
Tried to keep them out of
trouble, keep them in school,

716
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,693
help them to have a good future.

717
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,027
Ann, who got in his way.

718
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,605
Ann, who you disposed of as casually as you
disposed of your granddaughter's future.

719
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,106
This is nonsense.

720
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:10,340
You said that you never saw
the injuries to Ann's face.

721
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,707
But before the family could claim the body,

722
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,378
you described those
injuries to the mortician,

723
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:21,117
telling him to use his skill
to make her pretty.

724
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,257
That is not true.

725
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,919
Yes, it is. It's true.

726
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,563
I heard it.

727
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,225
I was told about her injuries.

728
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,533
No, you saw her when you ran her down.

729
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:40,137
It wasn't me. I didn't do it!

730
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:43,338
You weren't there that night,
Kyle, the night Ann died.

731
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,109
I came by with your supper. You weren't there.

732
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,172
You stop these hysterics.

733
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,079
I didn't kill Annie.

734
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,849
But she is the one who turned her back on us!

735
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,948
The car that killed Annie wouldn't
happen to be a Buick, would it?

736
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,853
Yes, it was.

737
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:02,429
Kyle, you old car thief, that set of
master keys you borrowed from me.

738
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,023
Am I ever getting them back?

739
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,335
Is that it? That's it? That's the loyalty?

740
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,340
Huh? You side with them?

741
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,078
You side with the bitch that brought
people in here to spy on us!

742
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,007
To kill the life, our life!

743
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,372
It was you or her.

744
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,078
Your ways or hers.

745
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,457
It was self-defense. My beloveds...

746
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,288
Shut your yap, Kyle!

747
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,522
Take him. Get him away from here.

748
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:37,896
Our pleasure. Kyle Devlin,
you're under arrest for murder.

749
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:41,169
Come on now, you're not going to stand
there and let them do this to me?

750
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,262
Paddy! Joseph! Save me!

751
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,367
(KYLE SPEAKING IN SHELTA)

752
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:51,045
Maeve, for God's sakes, I'm your brother!

753
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,610
Lane, be a girl! Help your father!

754
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,044
Bronson, save me. Maeve! Hey!

755
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,646
You know, I just realized something.

756
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:01,951
What's that?

757
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,390
All that Ann gave up?

758
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,524
It must have been hard for her.
