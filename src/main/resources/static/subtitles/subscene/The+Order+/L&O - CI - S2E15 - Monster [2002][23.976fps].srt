1
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,032
"You got into fights, you
spent four years in solitary.

2
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,295
"What do you have to say
for yourself, Mr. Dietrich?"

3
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,998
So I said, "Well, what can I say, Warden?

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,040
"l just like to have a good time."

5
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:36,007
Yes, another milestone.
Eight hours as a free man.

6
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,273
Mark.

7
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,578
I'm Chantal. Can you sign something for me?

8
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,821
I saved it all these years.

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,290
You looked so hot.

10
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,849
Naomi, give me a pen.

11
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,957
So, is this really the bar where you
and Mandy hooked up that night?

12
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:58,629
Baby, it was 15 years ago. It was
called something else back then.

13
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,002
Hey, Penny, take a picture of me and Mark.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,405
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Here, look.

15
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,974
"I'm Mandy. Don't choke me so hard, Mark."

16
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,303
Mark?

17
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,946
I brought you coffee.

18
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,147
Miss?

19
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,113
Oh!

20
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,096
One thing I learned in prison, Mom,

21
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,903
is not to kill the girls I have sex with.

22
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,701
I want you to feel good,
Mark, good and powerful.

23
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,502
Is this how you want me? Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,874
I've been watching you

25
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,916
running around the reservoir,

26
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,578
watching your butt in those
little silver running shorts.

27
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,920
...running around the reservoir,

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,482
watching your butt in those
little silver running shorts.

29
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,050
Is all you're gonna do is watch?

30
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,620
Shut up. Shut up.

31
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,991
I'm gonna fill your mouth with
sand, so you start choking.

32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,792
Get all tight.

33
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,204
I'm going out now.

34
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,513
What's the matter, Mom? I know
you've been watching me. What is it?

35
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,846
You're a malignant narcissist.

36
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,155
What did you say?

37
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,122
Never mind.

38
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,991
Have a nice night.

39
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,525
And try not to hurt anyone.

40
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,804
I don't remember, all right.
It was 15 years ago.

41
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,137
Come on. I just want to see
where you killed Mandy.

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,438
I'm gonna kill you if you don't knock it off!

43
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,944
Where's your coke?

44
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,713
Just show me. Okay, like, you hooked
up with her at the bar that night.

45
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,411
She was wearing a little
black dress, like this.

46
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,185
I'm sick of this crap!

47
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,779
Mark, wait up. Wait up.

48
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,381
Hey, Mark!

49
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,754
Mark, wait up!

50
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,813
Mom, where'd you hide the coffee?

51
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,956
Mom.

52
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,388
Mom.

53
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,197
No. No, no, no, no!

54
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,210
No, no, no, no!

55
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,168
No.

56
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,753
A co-worker found her. No forcible entry.

57
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,891
She lived alone till Dietrich moved in a
month ago. "My son, the Yuppie Killer."

58
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,491
He's why we're here. Anybody seen him?

59
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,592
Not since yesterday.

60
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,433
The neighbors heard them
arguing on and off though.

61
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,940
Life with a psychopath. I'll talk
to the co-worker when she's ready.

62
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,204
Well,

63
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,550
the killer caught her behind the ear. She...

64
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,249
She crawled to here.

65
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,585
The...

66
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,293
The back of her nightgown is, is...

67
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,329
Is bunched up, but the
front has been pulled down

68
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,501
to cover her.

69
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,437
Someone was worried about her modesty?

70
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,340
The girl Dietrich killed in the park
didn't rate that kind of consideration.

71
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,809
That lady's ready.

72
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:16,411
I talked to Laura last night, just to
make sure that she wanted a ride to work.

73
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,616
We're fact-checkers for a
publisher in Long Island City.

74
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,125
Was she expecting company last night?

75
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,890
No, Laura didn't socialize much.

76
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,090
Especially since her son came home.

77
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,429
How was that going, between her and Mark?

78
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,800
Well, she was hoping for the
best, you know, but they argued.

79
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,931
And then she just stopped
talking about him altogether.

80
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,359
Mrs. Dietrich's cell phone is missing.

81
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,138
Has anyone been reading this paper?

82
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,642
No, it was out in the hallway.

83
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,939
I brought it in.

84
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,551
I'm gonna need this bagged, exactly as is.

85
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,656
We...

86
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,226
Let's go for a ride.

87
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,804
I… I’m…

88
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,915
I'm gonna need a Polaroid of this, please.

89
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,185
You all set?

90
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,399
Mark, how you doing?

91
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,241
I'm sorry I had to deliver
the bad news over the phone.

92
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,706
Yeah, you figured out my mom
lent me her phone, huh?

93
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,577
Uh-huh. We wake you up?

94
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,713
My girlfriend and I were just waking up, so...

95
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,152
Where are we going?

96
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,718
You know, Mark, Detective Eames
thought that you were good for this.

97
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,884
I thought you went on the lam.

98
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,465
Except you left your Xanax
behind and your mom's money.

99
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,564
It was on her dresser.

100
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,305
Are you ready?

101
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,385
You found her like this?

102
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,217
Yes.

103
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,452
See.

104
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,120
Why?

105
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,195
I just...

106
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,965
I mean, can we cover her up? She
wouldn't want to be seen like this.

107
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,168
She was a very modest woman.

108
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,109
We need to go downtown,

109
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,738
so you can sign some papers.

110
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,152
I meant to ask you. Did
your mother have any enemies?

111
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,890
She got some phone calls, a few years back,

112
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,225
from the brother of the girl.

113
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,425
Mandy Johanssen, the girl
you strangled in the park.

114
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,728
By mistake.

115
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,829
I wrote a letter to that family,
telling them how sorry I was.

116
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,340
But you can never be
too sorry for some people.

117
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,901
Last night, where were you again?

118
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,108
With my girlfriend, Chantal Fielding.

119
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,812
Does she know about you?

120
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,115
She knows it was a long time ago.

121
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,452
Gena will help you fill out the forms.

122
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,020
Oh, uh...

123
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,351
All those?

124
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,295
It's what you have to do when a
member of your family gets murdered.

125
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,662
You tracked mud in with your shoes.

126
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,064
Yeah, sorry.

127
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,208
It's horse manure.

128
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,583
Mark was really upset
when he heard about his mom.

129
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,242
I felt so sorry for him.

130
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,308
I felt sorry for his mom.

131
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,854
Did you ever meet her?

132
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,720
No. I only met Mark a couple of weeks ago.

133
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,953
I'm sorry, I dropped something.

134
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,821
So, what did you and Mark do last night?

135
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,133
We went out to dinner,

136
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,602
and then came back here.
Fell asleep watching TV.

137
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,299
Gee, you two sound just like my parents.

138
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,137
That's probably why Mark appreciates it,

139
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,643
'cause it's so, you know, ordinary.

140
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,307
Especially with a guy like Mark.

141
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,048
You know, he's a magnet for extreme attention.

142
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,584
Absolutely. You should've seen the
skank he was with when I met him.

143
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,521
Yeah, I know the type.

144
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,853
Murder groupies.

145
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,953
Mark said she started writing him in prison.

146
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:29,160
These women, they like to visit murder scenes.

147
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,933
It gets them hot.

148
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,403
You never

149
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,008
were tempted to, you know,

150
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,441
ask Mark?

151
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,503
No.

152
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,016
Because, you know, it's not that far
away. It's just on the bridle path

153
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,678
where they walk the horses. In fact,

154
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,718
it's where they found the girl Mandy.

155
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,455
She had a smell of horse manure.

156
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,793
Like this, you know?

157
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,798
Like the mud on your boots.
Like the mud on Mark's shoes.

158
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,963
How was it, Chantal?

159
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,065
Did you ask Mark to call you Mandy while
he wrapped a scarf around your neck?

160
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,404
That is so sick.

161
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:17,437
You know, Mark, he told us that there's
3 varieties of murder groupies,

162
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,911
victims, psychos, shrinks.

163
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,985
He said with you, he's got 3 mints in one.

164
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,421
Oh, that loser!

165
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,563
All right. You wanna know what he did?

166
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,095
We went into the park,

167
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:39,002
and then he freaked out.
I had to walk home by myself.

168
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,628
And what got him upset?

169
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,004
I don't know. He was whining all night
about his mother being mad at him.

170
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,633
What time did he show up here?

171
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,201
I don't know, about 6:30 in the morning.

172
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,307
He curled up like a little
baby and went to sleep.

173
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,911
Look, if I killed my mother,

174
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,714
- I'd be in South America by now.
- I just wanted you to know

175
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,052
- You said yourself, I didn't run away.
- that your attempt to deceive
us didn't go unnoticed.

176
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,388
- You forgot one thing, the morning paper.
- Look, my mom has it delivered.

177
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,757
The first officer to arrive on
the scene found it outside.

178
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,320
Where you put it, when you brought it
in, when you came back from the park.

179
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,388
No.

180
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,094
You read the sports section,
you killed your mom.

181
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,627
- No!
- You slipped the sports section back
into the newspaper.

182
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,733
Put it back outside, only, you put
it back in the wrong section.

183
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,573
- At this point, Mark's invoking his rights.
- No, no, no.

184
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,408
- Look, I wanna tell them what happened.
- No, no, no, Mark.

185
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,539
I just wanna get it over with.

186
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,617
I got home, I was drunk,
and I blacked out, okay.

187
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:36,019
I came to. I went looking
for my mom and I found her.

188
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,518
And she was already dead.

189
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,491
- I got scared.
- And you're saying that

190
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,658
there's this huge chunk of time
that you have no memory of.

191
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:46,101
I'm saying that I passed out
in the living room. I...

192
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,370
I did not kill my mother.

193
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,070
Your mother told her friends you fought.

194
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,840
Yeah, well, when I first got out, yeah.

195
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,247
All that lecturing and moralizing.

196
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,875
- But not lately.
- So that was the problem.

197
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,318
- No, we were barely speaking.
- That's the problem, right there.

198
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,653
- She'd given up on you.
- Yeah, right, so what do I care?

199
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,294
She called me

200
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,365
a malignant narcissist.

201
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,103
That was the last thing she said to me.

202
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:27,278
She was the only one I had left out
here. Why would I want to kill her?

203
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,173
I mean, why would I want to do that to myself?

204
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,915
When someone is killed

205
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,286
by receiving a blow to the head,

206
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,723
it sends up a fine spray of blood

207
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,988
that's unrecognizable to the...

208
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,554
to the human eye.

209
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:49,191
Once the lab gets done with their
microscopic inspection of your clothes,

210
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,031
we'll have you cooked six ways to Sunday.

211
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,705
She was my mother.

212
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,368
There was no way I killed her.

213
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,637
Why did you stop?

214
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,043
Look, when you tell a suspect

215
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,780
that there's incriminating
evidence on the way, they...

216
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,753
They get quiet. They...

217
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,322
They start to try to remember
what they missed.

218
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,952
You know, they don't keep
claiming their innocence.

219
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,788
Or he really doesn't remember killing her.

220
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,230
Mark's mother,

221
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,231
she called him a malignant narcissist.

222
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,798
That's a clinical term that
psychiatrists use amongst themselves.

223
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,912
She has no background in psychology.

224
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,740
She stopped talking to him.

225
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,913
She withdrew.

226
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,146
There's something going on with her.

227
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,748
Mark Dietrich should've gotten
life for choking that girl.

228
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,690
He caught a break, but not this time.

229
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,455
Just get the evidence and bury him.

230
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,834
The only change that I can think of is,

231
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,532
we stopped riding home together 3 weeks ago.

232
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,097
I thought she was taking a class.

233
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,143
She was always home by 9:30.

234
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,809
She made notes. "Remorseless,
charming, predatory."

235
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,475
Anybody we know?

236
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,279
"Shallow emotional affect,

237
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,550
"rehabilitation is rare."

238
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,781
You know, I...

239
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,962
Look, what, was she fact-checking
a psychiatric text?

240
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,095
No. We only check statistical data.

241
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,660
Rolls of nickels.

242
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,601
Do you have any vending machines
that only take nickels?

243
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,697
No. What costs a nickel these days?

244
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,469
Microfilm machines.

245
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,873
They use them in the library
to copy newspapers.

246
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:51,317
These are the books that she checked
out of the psychology section.

247
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,883
"Nurture-Born Killers,

248
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,484
"Patterns of the Sexual Predator."

249
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,463
Maybe she liked seeing Mark's name in print.

250
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,323
No, that's the thing. Mark's
name wouldn't be in here.

251
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,461
These books are about
chronic sexual offenders.

252
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,903
Mark's strangling of Mandy Johanssen,

253
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,669
it was called a one-time incident,

254
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,303
completely out of character for Mark.

255
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,182
What'd you find?

256
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,014
A clerk said Mrs. Dietrich
checked out newspapers

257
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,544
from the summer of '86 to the fall of '87.

258
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,181
Besides Mandy's murder in September,

259
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,782
there was another Central Park story

260
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:32,295
that ran that whole year.
The Reservoir Runner.

261
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:37,697
2 months earlier in July, she was dragged
into the woods and raped by 4 kids.

262
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,165
Maybe Mrs. Dietrich thought Mark
had something in common with them.

263
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,705
Something that made her withdraw from him.

264
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,334
Something that

265
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,645
compelled her to do research 3 weeks ago.

266
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,943
Something she saw or heard.

267
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,385
Well, 3 weeks ago,

268
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,816
that's before he started seeing Chantal.

269
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,657
She said he was with his prison pen pal.

270
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,200
The word she used was skank.

271
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,833
What happened with Mark?

272
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,133
You corresponded with him for what?

273
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,605
7 years.

274
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,136
Did he open up to you?

275
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,942
About Mandy?

276
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,741
It was an accident.

277
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:27,013
Mark needs to feel powerful,
but he doesn't need to kill.

278
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,345
If only his mother had given him
that kind of understanding.

279
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,753
I read about what happened to her.

280
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,485
She wasn't good for him.

281
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,187
You met her?

282
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,922
I didn't need to. I saw her apartment.

283
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,528
Lots of beige’s, neutral tones. It's stifling.

284
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,265
When were you in her apartment?

285
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,333
Like 3 weeks ago.

286
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,139
Well, that is interesting,
'cause that's when Mark

287
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,213
said that his mother turned cold on him.

288
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,610
But he couldn't figure out why.

289
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,447
I can.

290
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,254
I left my camera in his room.
She must've seen the video.

291
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,091
A video of you “healing” Mark's wounds?

292
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,594
I helped him give a voice
to his sexual fantasies.

293
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,461
Like what? About

294
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,733
choking

295
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,567
with a scarf, like Mandy?

296
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,949
He had a whole scenario
about silver running shorts

297
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,144
and filling my mouth with sand.

298
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,188
Once you get to know him,
Mark's a very creative soul.

299
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,049
Thanks, Naomi.

300
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,223
We'll be in touch.

301
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,569
The Reservoir Runner was described
as wearing silver running shorts,

302
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,167
but there was nothing in any
of the articles about sand.

303
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,143
Laura Dietrich heard her son's fantasies

304
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,046
about a runner in the park.

305
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:11,077
She goes to the library and she
confirms some of the details.

306
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,583
And she's a fact-checker.

307
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,923
Her next move would have been to the source.

308
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,723
The detectives who broke the case.

309
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,432
Mark Dietrich's mother? No kidding.

310
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,029
Never made the connection.

311
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,541
She said she was checking facts
for an article on the case.

312
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,440
Which facts in particular?

313
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,207
What the victim was wearing, was she choked?

314
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,145
Did she ask about sand?

315
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,141
She asked if the attacker put
sand in the victim's mouth.

316
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,517
But that wasn't made public, right?

317
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,181
Well, not at the time, no.

318
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,781
This have to do with the murder?

319
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,953
Laura Dietrich might've suspected
her son committed the rape.

320
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,495
It may be why he killed her.

321
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,157
That would be tragic because
he did not do that rape.

322
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,996
My partner and I got those guys.

323
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,037
There was semen found on the victim,

324
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,572
semen that didn't match any of them.

325
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,037
Did Mrs. Dietrich ask about that?

326
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,738
No, but if she did, I would've
told her it was a gang rape

327
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,644
and that we only got 4 of the guys.

328
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,512
Now, maybe Mark Dietrich, the Yuppie Killer,

329
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,573
was running with the homeboys that night,

330
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,880
but I doubt it.

331
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,812
Well, how do you explain that he knew

332
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,951
unpublicized details of the rape?

333
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,922
He was incarcerated in the same facility

334
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,724
with those 4 punks, wasn't he?

335
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,389
Cons tell each other everything.

336
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,127
But like you said, Detective Marston,

337
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,062
you know, I can't imagine a yuppie killer

338
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,662
shooting the breeze with 4 homeboys.

339
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,969
Look, we got taped confessions.

340
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:41,211
A lot of people worked a lot of hours
to get those animals off the street.

341
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,873
Us guys don't remember
what it was like back then,

342
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:48,578
but I've had a lot of women tell me they
were afraid to walk out in broad daylight.

343
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,053
Anything I can do, give me a call.

344
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:01,157
I remember. Marston and his partner
Roscoe were heroes around our house,

345
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,463
the way they got 4 kids
to confess in one night.

346
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,367
Yeah. I'd like to see how they did that.

347
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,441
I'm just saying, Nishan,

348
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,267
your friends are gonna tell the tale.

349
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,838
You finished with that can of
soda? You want another one?

350
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,474
Uh, no.

351
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:25,347
I ain't mean to leave it there.
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

352
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,917
- Come on, you were there.
- Man, I told you,

353
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,790
we didn't go anywhere near the reservoir.

354
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,056
We didn't rape no woman.

355
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,097
You're not helping yourself out, kid.

356
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:37,327
Your friend Nishan already said
he pulled down her silver shorts.

357
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,663
No, that ain't right.

358
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,863
And he said you held down her left leg.

359
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,428
I didn't. I didn't touch her never.

360
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,168
Monty, if you keep denying while all
your friends are cutting deals,

361
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,801
it's gonna go real bad for you.

362
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,868
Don't you wanna help us?

363
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,436
Yeah, I do.

364
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:54,109
All you gotta say is that
you touched her left leg.

365
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,408
Just touched it.

366
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,318
You don't have to admit
to anything else, just that.

367
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,118
And then you can go home tonight.

368
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,625
Um, do you have the tape of this confession?

369
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,822
They wanted him to say
he touched her left leg.

370
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,662
This is the confession
that played for the jury.

371
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,697
And then Nishan took down
her shorts and got on her.

372
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,898
What'd you do?

373
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:20,000
I touched her leg. Her right
leg. It's all I did.

374
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,677
Left leg, right leg. The point
is, the kid admitted he was there.

375
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,116
There were inconsistencies
in all 4 confessions.

376
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:32,246
And not one of them admitted
actually raping her.

377
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,188
Look, if they didn't do it,
if they weren't even there,

378
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,055
why in the world would they confess?

379
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,061
Because they were afraid to disappoint.

380
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,357
Disappoint who?

381
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,591
Marston and Roscoe. Look.

382
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:52,674
I'm just saying, Nishan, your
friends are gonna tell the tale.

383
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,579
You finished with that can of soda?
You want another one?

384
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,138
Uh, no.

385
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,715
I ain't mean to leave it there. I'm sorry.

386
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,119
So, Marston is drawing
attention to the soda can,

387
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,350
so that when anyone watches it,

388
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,256
they know that Nishan
had something to drink.

389
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,558
So nobody can say he was denied food and
drink. He's being a smart detective.

390
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,622
These kids were interrogated
for 30 hours with no lawyers

391
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:18,396
and almost no contact with their parents.

392
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:23,606
Marston's being polite. He's being very nice.

393
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:26,771
But look...

394
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,509
Look at the kid's reaction.

395
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,446
You got someplace I can throw
it away. I'll clean it up.

396
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,573
I'll clean it up.

397
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,744
The kid thinks that Marston
is reproaching him

398
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,152
for leaving the can on the table.

399
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,282
He is desperately trying
to please the one guy

400
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,827
he thinks can get him out of trouble.

401
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,793
I mean, the jury never saw this.

402
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,561
Never saw the way that Roscoe
and Marston played these kids.

403
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,427
All they saw was the finished product.

404
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,271
These confessions, they're nothing but vapor.

405
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,773
Mark Dietrich is the real thing.

406
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,071
He did this rape.

407
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,386
All 4 recanted their confessions.

408
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,514
Once their lawyers got ahold of them.

409
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,721
Two dozen witnesses saw them in the park,
running in a pack, snatching purses.

410
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,421
Dietrich knew the details.

411
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,931
I agree with Detective Marston's explanation.

412
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,263
Dietrich shared a prison
yard with the 4 rapists.

413
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,802
So, years later, he's having sex,

414
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,929
he just happens to dredge
up what they told him?

415
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,301
Now, that is incredible.

416
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,932
Tales of forcible sex excite him.

417
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,068
There's an easy way out of this.

418
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,876
The department still has Dietrich's
DNA from the Mandy Johanssen case.

419
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,577
We run it against the unknown
DNA from the reservoir rape.

420
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,250
I can just feature what
that little psycho told you.

421
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,756
She especially liked the part
about the silver running shorts.

422
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:51,124
I'm a sack artist. Improvisation
is the key to my creativity.

423
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:55,097
Almost as much as the bit about
stuffing her mouth full of sand.

424
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,894
If I understand you, you've never
actually seen this alleged video.

425
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,902
No. But his mother did.

426
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:04,406
She even looked up the true
story that inspired it.

427
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,976
These are the newspaper articles
that she checked out of the library

428
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,483
and books.

429
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,619
That's how she found out about the,

430
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,920
you know, the stuff
about malignant narcissism.

431
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,222
She even called the detective
who investigated the case.

432
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,921
She thought you were good for it.

433
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,464
If she thought that, she would've told me.

434
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,167
- You ever seen this woman?
- No.

435
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,260
You sure?

436
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,474
Your DNA matched the semen
on her running shorts.

437
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,711
Yeah. Okay, yeah, I remember her now.

438
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,808
I met her in the park. So?

439
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,418
We were warming up before
jogging. We started talking,

440
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:53,020
went back to her apartment.

441
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,250
Where?

442
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,819
All I remember is, it wasn't
close enough. And there was a bed.

443
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,122
We had sex. I must've
dripped on her shorts.

444
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,027
And then she went back to the park to jog,

445
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,865
and I went home to sleep.

446
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:12,300
What, you had consensual sex with a
runner that you met at the reservoir,

447
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:17,040
the same night the Reservoir
Runner was raped?

448
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:20,508
And it never, you know, crossed your mind

449
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,446
to say anything?

450
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,419
Well, how would he know
that's who he had sex with?

451
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,887
Her name and photo were never released.

452
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,287
I still wouldn't have known.

453
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,292
You never exchanged names?

454
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:30,850
It was the '80s.

455
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,725
Women were a lot more fun.

456
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:43,531
I don't understand. Is there
some doubt about who raped me?

457
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:49,343
This man's DNA matched the
semen on your running shorts.

458
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,508
This guy doesn't look like somebody
who'd bash me in the head with a rock

459
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,382
and put sand in my mouth.

460
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:02,620
Miss Stephens, if you can't
remember anything about the attack,

461
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,687
who told you about the sand?

462
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,425
Detective Marston.

463
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,802
So he's kept in touch with you.

464
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,460
He's called every few months.

465
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,433
Has he called you recently?

466
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,006
A couple of weeks ago.

467
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,076
He said he's worried about me.

468
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,648
I didn't know policemen like that existed.

469
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,392
DNA match, huh? Where do
you want me to start?

470
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,295
The samples were improperly stored.
Some genius blew his nose in the petri dish.

471
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,629
You gotta hear Dietrich's explanation.

472
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,760
He hooked up with Jane
Stephens before her run,

473
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,997
went back to her apartment to have sex.

474
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,571
Yeah, I can go with that.

475
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,602
Just for drill, you should check with her.

476
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,667
But she doesn't remember
what happened that day.

477
00:28:55,734 --> 00:29:00,479
He knows that. Because you've monitored
her condition over the years.

478
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,152
You didn't see her that first night.

479
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,654
She lost three-quarters of her blood.

480
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,518
She doesn't need to remember what
they did to her. That's my job.

481
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,056
Detective Marston, we understand
there was extraordinary pressure

482
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,258
to break this case. Those
kids fit a profile...

483
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:20,428
Forget it. There were no
mistakes, no rush to judgment.

484
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,806
We matched the DNA.

485
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,673
Dietrich has no evidence to back up his story.

486
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,910
The DA says it's open and shut.

487
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,212
You know,

488
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:39,712
AI Roscoe and I went over to Jane Stephens'
apartment the day after she was raped,

489
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,657
just to look for a number
of her next-of-kin.

490
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,853
We found a condom wrapper
on the floor next to her bed.

491
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,227
Now, maybe, that's what Dietrich
used to have sex with her.

492
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,395
Ask AI Roscoe, I'm sure he'll remember.

493
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:57,136
He could've just said he was wrong
about the kids, a good-faith mistake.

494
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,469
What's he afraid of?

495
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,600
Yes.

496
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,373
Okay. Thank you.

497
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,073
I found AI Roscoe.

498
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:09,913
He's at the Saint Albans Parish cemetery
up near Ghent. He died 2 weeks ago.

499
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,288
His handgun discharged
while he was cleaning it.

500
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:18,092
Wait a minute, I don't understand, Detective.

501
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,959
Why are you volunteering
this information?

502
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,989
Because you're going to find out about
it anyway. It's exculpatory evidence.

503
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,230
Well, was there anything else
besides the wrapper?

504
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,463
- You remember the brand?
- No.

505
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:34,609
All your boy needs to know, is I
saw a wrapper. The simpler, the better.

506
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,746
Are we clear?

507
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,509
My father didn't like talking about that case.

508
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,919
That's why he moved us up here,
away from all the attention.

509
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,891
We looked at the police report
of your father's death.

510
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,993
It had all the...

511
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,098
the earmarks of an accidental shooting.

512
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,829
He would've done that for you.

513
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,397
For the insurance.

514
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,301
I just hope I'm doing the right thing.

515
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,016
I got this in the mail, the day after he died.

516
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,418
He was police chief here until last year.

517
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,692
I want my kids to remember him as a hero.

518
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,438
"it's something I've been
running from for 15 years.

519
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,743
"Last weekend, Ted Marston called.
It's all going to catch up.

520
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,580
"Before Ted and me began our
interrogation of those young men,

521
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,820
"we agreed that regardless of their innocence,

522
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,015
"we were going to get
confessions out of them.

523
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:56,753
"That's what we did. Even though
the more we questioned them,

524
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,591
"the more it was obvious
they were innocent.

525
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:04,760
"I'm ashamed of what I did.
I can't live with it anymore."

526
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,870
Some good-faith mistake.

527
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,330
They premeditated framing those kids.

528
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,807
Marston was looking at
prison time if word got out.

529
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:17,039
Or if Laura Dietrich got the case reopened.

530
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,554
This letter is of no value as evidence.

531
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,123
Mr. Roscoe isn't here to authenticate
it. It can't be used at trial.

532
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:36,929
Marston knows that the only person who
can tie him to the frame up is dead.

533
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,826
There's no evidence to tie him
to Laura Dietrich's murder.

534
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,668
And thanks to his condom wrapper story,
we can't even make an ironclad case

535
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,299
against Mark Dietrich for the reservoir rape.

536
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,243
Marston's sitting pretty snug in the saddle.

537
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,804
We need to put a burr under the saddle.

538
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:57,679
You are considering vacating the
convictions on the rape, aren't you?

539
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,623
I was a kid.

540
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,522
I was trying to keep from going to jail.

541
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:10,564
Detective Marston said the other guys
were gonna put the weight on me, so

542
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,668
I just said I touched her arm.

543
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,630
Detective Marston suggested you say that?

544
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:16,798
Yeah.

545
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,205
He said he would try to help
me, so long as I play along.

546
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,875
Mr. Carver, you asked us here
to discuss a new development.

547
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,817
We matched the semen on the
victim's shorts to a suspect we...

548
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,220
we've come to believe acted alone.

549
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,428
Are you preparing to vacate the convictions?

550
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,297
Vacate, what does that mean?

551
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,630
Your record will be clean.

552
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,694
It means, Nishan, that you spent all
those years in prison for nothing.

553
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,263
Ten years because you trusted
Detective Marston.

554
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,970
Well, that changed you in ways
that you never wanted. I...

555
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,941
I don't know what could
compensate you for that.

556
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,574
Oh, I do. I know exactly.

557
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,119
A $100 million. Those punks
are suing for $100 million.

558
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,022
I hear the city and the department
are prepared to settle,

559
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,062
but that proposed settlement
doesn't include you.

560
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:16,759
You see what's going on here?
I'm being set up.

561
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:19,802
We need a strategy.

562
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:23,101
The Detective's Endowment cannot
get involved if you were derelict

563
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,573
or if you acted out of bounds
of your official duties.

564
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,109
What's that supposed to mean?

565
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,668
You're the Detective's
Endowment, I'm a detective.

566
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,941
You'd better just talk to the DA.

567
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,513
I'm gonna go broke defending myself.

568
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,143
You gotta have a talk with the Endowment.

569
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,550
I'm sorry.

570
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,713
Look,

571
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:43,115
we had suspects. The city was in a panic.

572
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,792
Women couldn't sleep without worrying that
some guy was gonna rape them in their beds.

573
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,129
This isn't fair. These guys were heroes.

574
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,691
We need to stand by our own.

575
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,204
It's not just the DA's office.
It's public perception.

576
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,470
What if we had him help us break Dietrich.

577
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,144
Would that change the perception?

578
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,381
We both saw how he handled
those kids. He's good.

579
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,350
And nobody knows the reservoir
case better than him.

580
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,680
I think she has a point.

581
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,482
What're you talking about here?

582
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,149
We need to get Dietrich on the reservoir rape,

583
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,852
if we wanna get him for his mother's murder.

584
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,954
You want my help?

585
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,124
Yeah.

586
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,059
You'd be staying ahead
of the curve, you know,

587
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,698
doing what you always do, getting
at the truth like any good cop.

588
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,409
All right. All right.

589
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:38,437
Anything to make sure that the
right guy goes down for the count.

590
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,277
Where you wanna do it?

591
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,918
We were back there, when we started talking.

592
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:50,221
No, no, the witnesses said
they saw her warming up around here.

593
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,625
I'm just telling you
what I remember, all right.

594
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,028
Mr. Dietrich, as I explained
to your attorney,

595
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,396
we need to eliminate you
as a suspect in the rape

596
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,299
in order to defend ourselves
against this lawsuit.

597
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,269
How you doing, Detective?

598
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,169
Mark, this is Detective Marston.

599
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,044
He knows this case inside out.

600
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,171
Maybe you've heard of him.

601
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,443
He's the one who got the
confessions out of those kids.

602
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,280
Thanks for helping us out today.

603
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,048
You know, Mark is not so clear on how

604
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,686
him and Jane Stephens
got back to her apartment.

605
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,850
Uh-huh.

606
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,622
This path hooks back up to the traverse.

607
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:31,197
Her place is on West 81st, so
they would've cut through here.

608
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,800
You okay?

609
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,032
Come on, I'll put my arm
around you. You won't slip.

610
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,667
No, no, no, I...

611
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,368
What's wrong, Mark?

612
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,607
I'm not going down there.

613
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,642
Not with... Not with these on.

614
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,548
Oh, no, sure, sure, sure.

615
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,382
Here you go.

616
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,982
They cleaned it up since the
last time you've been here.

617
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,253
Cut out a lot of the underbrush,

618
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,059
put up a light.

619
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,454
The rocks...

620
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,459
Rocks are still here.

621
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,591
And the ground,

622
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,869
still sandy.

623
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,932
Right over there, is where they found her,

624
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:17,038
half-dead, barely a pulse.

625
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:22,416
Look, I don't know anything about that.
I don't wanna stay here.

626
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,447
Mark, you don't wanna help us anymore?

627
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,990
I mean, what are we supposed to make of that?

628
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,492
I told you, all right, I talked to the woman,

629
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,529
we went back to her place
and we had sex, okay?

630
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,691
I mean, didn't you see
the condom wrapper there?

631
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,436
Right? Isn't that what he told you?

632
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,135
I might've confused it with
another rape victim, Mark.

633
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,643
I mean, I work a lot of cases.

634
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,648
But this girl's apartment, the bed
was made, everything was tidy.

635
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,975
The doorman saw her go out.

636
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,914
If he would've seen her come back with you,
don't you think he would've said something?

637
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:04,721
Why don't you say something? I mean, what
did you let them bring me here for?

638
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,286
- Mark, I think you should...
- What? You're fired, okay?

639
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,492
He sees the writing on the
wall, same as everyone.

640
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,058
You know what you need to do here, Mark?

641
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:18,305
You need to cut yourself
the best deal you can.

642
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,206
I'm not going back in.

643
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:24,008
No, there's a way of telling the
story, Mark, that can work for you.

644
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,877
You hooked up with a girl on the path,

645
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,110
you brought her down here
for a little intimacy,

646
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,777
consensual intimacy.

647
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:32,151
I, I, I see where this is going.

648
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,190
This is a good story, Mark.

649
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,691
Things started developing between you two,

650
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,126
and all of a sudden, she hurt you.

651
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,264
Squeezed you a little too
hard, got too tough,

652
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:43,658
and you lost it.

653
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,702
The sex was consensual. A straight
assault with mitigation,

654
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,203
isn't that right, Counselor?

655
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,466
Under those circumstances, yes.

656
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:54,175
And all you gotta say, Mark, is she hurt you.

657
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,613
She hurt you, and you got scared.
Isn't that the way it happened?

658
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,241
You say it, and everything falls into place.

659
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:04,378
She hurt you, and you got scared.

660
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,116
She hurt me. I got... I got scared.

661
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,092
Look, I didn't wanna hurt her.

662
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:21,134
I just... I got scared. I got scared.

663
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,005
That's very good. You're almost home free.

664
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,939
All that's left to talk
about is, is your mother.

665
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,310
My mother?

666
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:38,614
Well, you helped Detective
Marston clear up his old case.

667
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,990
Now he wants to help you with this
other thing. I mean, we all do.

668
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,418
I didn't... I didn't kill my mother.

669
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,656
What you said is, you don't remember.

670
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,661
What's it gonna look like to a jury?

671
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:56,437
Please tell him that he has
practically no chance with a jury.

672
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,973
You have to stay out of court, my friend.

673
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,510
You have to talk to us.

674
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,105
I would... I wouldn't kill her.

675
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,513
It's obvious you care about your mother.

676
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:11,748
Even in death, you cared
about her, you had respect.

677
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:17,424
You remember? You remember what you
told me that morning that you saw her

678
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,427
in her nightgown?

679
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,958
About her modesty?

680
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:26,433
Oh, he was so concerned
about her being covered.

681
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,764
I mean, doesn't that say something?

682
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,899
Tells me, you're a good son, Mark.

683
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,444
The way you pulled her nightgown down.

684
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,379
After she was dead, to cover her.

685
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:43,283
A good son would do that, a respectful son.

686
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:46,981
Yeah.

687
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,950
How did you find out about that stuff?

688
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,900
Isn't that what you're talking about?
It was pulled down over her panties.

689
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,467
You tell me.

690
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,833
It was bunched up like this?

691
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,902
Maybe in the heat of the moment, you...

692
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,969
You just forgot to do it.

693
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,407
Maybe you thought about pulling
it back down, you know,

694
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,919
so you could implicate someone.

695
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,022
Someone like Mark.

696
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,125
And what, you were in too much of a hurry,

697
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,103
you just forgot to yank it back down?

698
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:39,108
You think that I killed... What,
you think I'd kill her? You're nuts!

699
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:43,873
As we speak, we're executing search warrants
on your home, your office, your car.

700
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,471
Oh, no, no, this is bull.

701
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,574
Yeah, no, we staged the picture 4 weeks ago.

702
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,111
We pushed the nightgown
back up just to trick you.

703
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,756
What're you coming after me for? You
got this loser here, he's good for it.

704
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:01,627
Yeah, for the fact he didn't do it. You did.

705
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,363
You're under arrest for murder.

706
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,529
You son of a bitch, you killed her.
You killed my mother!

707
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,129
Get out of here.

708
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,730
You'll never make it stick.

709
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:14,333
A cop killing a witness,

710
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,836
isn't that the death penalty?

711
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,471
It certainly is.

712
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,347
What you're gonna wanna do here, Ted,

713
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,582
is cut the best deal you can.

714
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,151
There is a window of
opportunity, Mr. Marston.

715
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:34,060
But given what you've put this city through,
I'm not disposed to leave it open longer.

716
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,463
You have from here back up to
that path to make up your mind.

717
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:48,569
Okay.

718
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,179
I'll take the deal.

719
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,280
I'll take it.

720
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:54,907
I'll get back to you.

721
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:08,824
This must've been a very
lonely place 15 years ago.
