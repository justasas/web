00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,110
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,949
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,818
These are their stories.

00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,626
KIM: So what did you do this week for fun?

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,129
Did you know that the word "fun"
can be found in over 14 languages,

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,995
and its meaning changes every time?

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,694
I was thinking about good old American fun.

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,632
What's fun for me isn't always fun for my dad.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,140
You mean like what we did Saturday?

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:35,709
Robbie, I'm sure at the school you'll be able
to do more of the things you like to do.

12
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,373
Here's your father.

13
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,715
Kim? The stuff we talked about today,

14
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,687
I'd like to be the one to tell him, okay?

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,924
Sorry I'm late.

16
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,152
How did it go?

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,288
We had a good talk.

18
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,456
Will you be there tomorrow?

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,466
Probably not. Good luck.

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,667

Oh, hi.

24
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,877
Listen, I just got out of a press conference.

25
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,347
Got a message Jim Hardy canceled tonight.

26
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,180
So here I am with nobody to eat dinner with.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,151
What about your wife? Doesn't she eat?

28
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,381
I thought you social workers were
morally ambivalent about marriage.

29
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,890
KIM: Not this social worker.

30
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,557
If you just want to talk about budget
cuts in my department, that'd be fine.

31
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,687
Fair enough.

32
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,958
I'll pick you up from work.
Watch the news tonight.

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,795
They promised me 15 seconds.

34
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,972
There are two kids aged four and six

35
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,132

You'll get them back when
you can take care of them.

It's one of the Mayor's pet projects.

potholes and bigger piles of garbage?

47

when I stopped beating my wife.

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,933
Look, it's up to the maintenance
crews and the sanitation workers.

Any idea what Webster was doing here?

75
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,449
Mrs. Webster said she talked to him on his
cell phone just before he got killed.

76
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,756
He told her he was just
finishing dinner with Jim Hardy

from the Sanitation Workers Union.

78
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,326
What does Mr. Hardy say?

79
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,890
Well, he told us he canceled his
dinner with Mr. Webster that afternoon

80
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,904
and spent the evening at home with Mrs. Hardy.

81
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,409
Looks like Webster had a passenger,

82
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,141
sat close to him, wore a
purple cashmere sweater.

83

Tight-fitting size 2 with a plunging neckline.

84

Hmm. That I can't tell from this.

85
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,152
I can tell from the bull
he was feeding his wife.

86
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,220
The window was rolled down.

87
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,463
He was reaching over when he was shot.

88
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,058
Maybe reaching for this.

89
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,703
He had someone get him a paper?

90
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,808
Maybe we can find partial
prints on the quarters.

91
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,554
No quarters.

from the boxes on 12th Street.

a paper from those boxes?

Yeah. A woman in a... In a black car.

109
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,691
She had a fuzzy sweater.

to take you to our office.

113
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,400
She bought him a newspaper and disappeared.

114
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,999
We'll say she's a potential witness
and leave it at that. What else?

115
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,135
Webster had enemies. City
workers, union leaders.

116
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,180
We're checking everybody's
whereabouts last night.

117
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,682
Anybody asks, we're treating
this as ordinary street crime.

118
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,650
This is Webster's cell phone
records for yesterday.

119
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,280
He called the Administration for
Child Services mid-afternoon.

120
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,689
The witness might work in
the city's social services.

121
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,494
Yes, hello. Beg your pardon?

122
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,259

line. Is Ms. Stevens in?

123
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,565
When?

124
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,606
No, that's all right. Thank you very much.

125
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,642
Found her.

126
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,610
We ID'd her off her prints.
City has them on file.

128
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,642
Mmm-hmm. But the ME thinks
she was knocked out first.

129
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,023
Do you have her clothes?

130
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,929

131
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,136
What year was Webster's car?

- Any purse?
- RICHLAND: No.

She was found uptown?

00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,975
Wrapped in a blanket.

In a shopping cart, under
the FDR at 136th Street.

139

Rumor has it you have a suspect in custody.

140
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,551
Yeah.

141
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,755

and drove off with her body.

Okay. You know what? Okay.
What difference does it make?

I only eat candy.

You want to tell us what you did last night?

154
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,261
Well, me and Jeanie were upset

155

it for... They said it's for evidence.

00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,788
Somebody who knew Stevens
had a history with Kulik

174
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,117
and tried to frame him.

175
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,823
I'll go break the bad news
to the boys upstairs.

176
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,416
GOREN: Now, there is good news.

177
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:47,454
Since her body was moved, it shows that the
Deputy Mayor wasn't the primary target.

178
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,539
EAMES: Any other parents threaten her?

179
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,475
No. She had an excellent track
record of reuniting families.

180
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,943
She has notations in here.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,174
"Subject looks forward
to intellectual challenges.

182
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,878
"Emotional maturity beyond his years.
Sheltered home life.

183
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,853
"Unsuited for college environment."

184
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,156
It reads like evaluations
for college admissions.

185
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:18,119
If she was doing anything like
that, it was on her own time.

186
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,757
Any names to go with the notes?

187
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,700
No, just serial numbers.

188
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,133
"Subject interacts well
with college-age adults.

189
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,404
"Subject has practical concerns. He worries...

190
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:38,744
"He worries that he's too short
to use bathroom facilities."

191
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,512
These subjects are little kids.

192
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,055
Little kids being considered
for college admissions.

193
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,690
Geniuses.

194
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,561
There can't be that many places in town

195
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,155
that give mortarboards to baby Einsteins.

196
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,876
Robbie, I need to speak with
your father for a moment.

197
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,073
I've just had some shocking
news about Ms. Stevens

198
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,053
which has forced us to adjust our
normal admissions procedures.

199
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,056
Based on Robbie's tests and everything,

200
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:24,027
we would like to offer him a place
at the school. Congratulations.

201
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,892
- You've been accepted.
- I have?

202
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,265
You made it, Robbie. You did it.

203
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,733
DR. LEONARD: Since our students
are much younger

204
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,507
than the college kids they'll
be attending classes with,

205
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,176
the university requires that we make
sure that they're emotionally equipped

206
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,186
to handle the social and academic pressures.

207
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,553
Why hire a city social worker
to do the evaluations?

208
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,091
DR. LEONARD: Well, Kim volunteered.

209
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,093
She was an alumnus of Metcalf University,

210
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,789
with degrees in social work and psychology.

211
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,922
How many children are up for admission?

212
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,457
8, for 6 openings for the summer semester.

213
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,738
Had Ms. Stevens turned in
her evaluation on them?

214
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:11,742
No. She was going to on Thursday
when we made our final selection.

215
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,711
Last Thursday, the day after she was killed.

216
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,611
EAMES: How did you choose the winners
without Ms. Stevens' evaluations?

217
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:24,212
DR. LEONARD: We relied solely on the
other criteria, IQ scores, SAT's.

218
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,852
Please, you're going to disturb the children.

219
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,951
Are they working on that
problem on the board?

220
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,553
Yes. This is a special math tutorial.

221
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,697
GOREN: Really? These little kids
are gonna solve that?

222
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,667
These are profoundly gifted children.

223
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,568
You'll have to forgive my
partner, Dr. Leonard.

224
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,107
He's feeling very humble right now.

225
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,503
The competition to get into
your program must be fierce.

226
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,173
- I hope you're not suggesting that...
- We are.

227
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,281
Of the 6 kids that you admitted,

228
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,751
how many of them are on the bubble

229
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,311
as far as Ms. Stevens'
evaluations are concerned?

230
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,552
Well, as I told you, we never
got her final evaluations.

231
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,761
But there was one student
I thought might've been,

232
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,158
as you say, on the bubble.

233
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,235
We thought Dr. Leonard's program would
help Charlie re-focus his goals.

234
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,743
But it became apparent after a few days...

235
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,905
That Charlie's goals didn't need re-focusing.

236
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,849
Charlie doesn't have to be a math genius,
you know. He can be a musical prodigy.

237
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,046
Not to mention, you think the math chicks
look anything like Jennifer Connelly?

238
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,113
No way, hombre. Besides, the
hot babes go for musicians.

239
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,991
You see the problem.

240
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,551
Music is my life, Mom.

241
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:41,190
Did Ms. Stevens give you any
hint that there might be a

242
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,664
problem with your son?

243
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,998
No. But we knew going in, it wouldn't be easy.

244
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,937
I told Kim I just wanted off
that baby-genius track.

245
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,998
Track. You make it sound like it's a race.

246
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,141
Oh, it's totally cut-throat at our level.

247
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,237
We all know we'll all be competing for
the prizes and the research money.

248
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,674
Do you know any of the other students
that applied to Dr. Leonard's program?

249
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,117
Oh, sure. Except for the new guy,

250
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,452
we've all been together in math camps
since we came out of the test tube.

251
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,755
Charlie knows very well he
wasn't conceived in a test tube.

252
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,889
So who was this new kid?

253
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,329
Robbie something. I don't know.

254
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,201
Leonard treats him like
he's another John Nash.

255
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,830
She just leaves him alone and lets him doodle.

256
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,705
His father told me he's been
home-schooled since kindergarten.

257
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,506
Do you know the other parents well?

258
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,707
Pretty well. We spend a
lot of time commiserating.

259
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:36,015
You have no idea what a challenge
it is parenting a gifted child.

260
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,721
This math equation.

261
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,792
I saw it at the Institute on the board.

262
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,654
Oh, yeah. It's the Riemann Hypothesis.

263
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,197
One of the Millennium Projects.

264
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,096
You solve it, you make a million bucks.

265
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:51,661
Leonard's pet project.

266
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,830
She wants one of her
baby geniuses to solve it.

267
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,268
Can I keep this?

268
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,668
Sure. What do I need it for?

269
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,542
(STRUMMING SINGLE NOTE)

270
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,038
DAVID: Oh, he went to school
for about five minutes

271
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,846
until I saw what was happening to him.

272
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,977
Which was what?

273
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,385
He was bored, he was so far ahead,

274
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,721
and I thought, hell, I can do a
better job than those klunkheads.

275
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,192
Klunkheads.

276
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,462
You think they were klunkheads, Robbie?

277
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,431
Well, they were just trying their best.

278
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,367
But they didn't have enough
training to teach someone like me.

279
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,066
Who helped you home-school him? Your wife?

280
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,004
My wife died in an accident five years ago.

281
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,339
I came up with the curriculum.
It was just Robbie and me.

282
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,743
EAMES: And you what, work nights?

283
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,012
No. I spend my nights with Robbie.
I'm on disability from work.

284
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,076
Tae kwon do? You used to compete?

285
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,280
A long time ago.

286
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,688
But unless I was willing to do it on a
national level, it wasn't worth it.

287
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,920
Auto racing, did you do that nationally?

288
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,325
Regional, quarter mile.

289
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,388
Robbie remembers being in his
mother's arms watching me race.

290
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,402
Let me guess, you were in a band.

291
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,738
Oh, that's all in the past.

292
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,433
Robbie, you want to show me your room?

293
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,407
- Now I devote myself full-time to
my son's education.
- Is that okay?

294
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,949
Wednesday night, you remember where you were?

295
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,076
Here. Robbie was asleep.

296
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,049
- Do you own a car?
- No.

297
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,581
Gun?

298
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,487
Come on.

299
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,659
No, I don't own a gun.

300
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,697
Derek Jeter's rookie card, signed.

301
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,133
You must be a Yankee fan.

302
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,398
Yeah, baseball's a thinking man's game.

303
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,498
Do you know who managed
the Yankees in the '80s?

304
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,940
Who didn't manage the Yankees in the '80s?

305
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,636
Billy Martin came back three times,

306
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,046
Gene Michael came back twice, Bob Lemon,
Yogi Berra, Clyde King, Lou Piniella,

307
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,744
Dallas Green, Bucky Dent and Stump Merrill.

308
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:48,911
Wow.

309
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,980
Your dad take you to the games?

310
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,890
No. He says watching sports doesn't
add any value to my education.

311
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,552
But I follow the stats on my computer.

312
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,054
But you play.

313
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,091
What position?

314
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,831
Oh, no. I don't have time.

315
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,639
How were your interviews with Kim Stevens?

316
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,736
Oh, she was a nice person.

317
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,474
Did she tell you that you might
not get into the program?

318
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,210
No.

319
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,618
The Riemann Hypothesis.

320
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,791
You know what? This does not look fun.

321
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,062
My dad says that sometimes
the way to solve a problem

322
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,100
is to let your right brain work on it.
So that's what I'm doing.

323
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,639
I really like your drawings.

324
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,270
Hey, if you don't need them,
you think I can have them?

325
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,606
Sure. Okay.

326
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,174
Catcher, that's what you play.

327
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,080
How did you know?

328
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,454
It's the thinking man's position.

329
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,096
You really need a million bucks that bad?

330
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,863
It's Robbie's calculations.

331
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,265
They contain symbols that
aren't in the other kids' work,

332
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:56,006
and they're not in any work
done on the Riemann Hypothesis.

333
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,176
They don't belong there.

334
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,944
Well, he's 10 years old. He made a mistake.

335
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,917
No. There's no mistake.

336
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,954
This symbol. Infinity.

337
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,789
This one.

338
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,389
It's Omega. The end. This one.

339
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,725
Theta. Death.

340
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:26,076
Now Robbie wrote these in his
calculations over and over again.

341
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,810
Infinity. The end. Death.

342
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,444
He's suicidal.

343
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:38,382
Kim Stevens found out. She was
going to keep him out of the program.

344
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,024
If Kim Stevens decided Robbie
Was psychologically unfit, his
father might've found out.

345
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,761
Maybe he thought he could change her mind.

346
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,326
Webster got into the
picture. The dad panicked.

347
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,204
And killed two people just to get his
child into an educational program?

348
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,539
Dads kill over hockey. Why not over education?

349
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,804
Yes. Especially this dad.

350
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:05,611
The rock star, martial arts
expert, drag racing champion.

351
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,819
All attention-seeking careers,
all of which he's failed at.

352
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,186
But if his son succeeds,
the spotlight's back on him.

353
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,591
Have you confirmed that Ms. Stevens
diagnosed Robbie Bishop as unfit?

354
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,157
The school won't release her files
without the father's permission.

355
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,062
Fat chance of that.

356
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,801
Unless we could have him removed
as guardian of his son's records.

357
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,702
We'd have to convince a judge

358
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,767
there's probable cause to consider
Mr. Bishop a murder suspect.

359
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,785
The lab found a mixture of higher paraffins
imprinted on the back of her sweater.

360
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,986
The substance is a preservative, Cosmoline,

361
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,823
used on new cars shipped from overseas.

362
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,124
It's shaped like a flashing
around a car window.

363
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,926
Bishop pushed her up against his car.

364
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,627
Bishop doesn't have a car. We checked.

365
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,364
Do we have Bishop's employment history?

366
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,609
He worked in the Stevedores Union.

367
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,580
Worked for Autotrain Freight Forwarders.

368
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,981
Still works there a couple of days a month.

369
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,178
Taking cars off boats, putting them on trains.

370
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,487
Wouldn't be too tough to borrow
one of those cars for the night.

371
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,422
You match the imprint on the sweater

372
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,017
to a model of car in that shipyard,

373
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,825
that should be enough probable
cause to satisfy a judge.

374
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,793
Enough for a search warrant, too?

375
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,162
I want everything cataloged
and returned, you understand?

376
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,263
You got some balls coming
between me and my son.

377
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,399
I'm the only one here who's got
his best interest at heart.

378
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,206
You're not concerned that
your son might be suicidal?

379
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,770
If Robbie was unhappy, he'd tell me.

380
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,077
You couldn't tell from all
these personality tests?

381
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,551
Those just measure social adjustment.

382
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,248
I have to make sure he's
not getting overloaded.

383
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,383
I've always read that kids with
high IQ's, they thrive on pressure.

384
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,087
They need it to help them develop.

385
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,855
There's nothing I hate more than
discussing my child with a know-it-all.

386
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,292
Hmm. Are you dyslexic?

387
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,061
'Cause you wrote down a phone
number, then crossed it out

388
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,267
and then re-wrote it in the right order.

389
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,310
I was tired, that's all.

390
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,404
Where's your partner? Where'd she go?

391
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:21,307
My mom used to tell me stories
at night before I went to sleep.

392
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,353
Now your dad reads to you.

393
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,446
Yes, until I fall asleep.

394
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,247
He never leaves me alone.

395
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,852
What about last Wednesday? Did he read to you?

396
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,657
I just went to sleep. I was pooped.

397
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:39,861
Robbie, the detectives have work to do.
Let's get out of their way.

398
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,311
Look what he showed me.

399
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,443
His aunt and uncle.

400
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:56,452
They live in western Mass. He says
he visits every chance he gets.

401
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,419
There he looks happy.

402
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,890
If he was there. You see Robbie's face?

403
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,054
The lighting and the shadows
don't match the others.

404
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,830
He digitally put himself in this photo.

405
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,271
Looks like Stevens did a pretty
thorough work-up on Robbie.

406
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,873
At least he had fun with her,
she took him to the Bronx Zoo,

407
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,112
to Little League in
Prospect Park one Saturday.

408
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,518
Yeah. To observe him with kids his own age.

409
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,955
She says here he's remarkably well-adjusted.

410
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,857
How could she miss this kid was miserable?

411
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,556
Says here she gave him an MMPI.
Do you have it over there?

412
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,998
Well, if you tell me what it is in plain
English, I might be able to find it.

413
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:49,233
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.
It tests social adjustment.

414
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,805
I remember this. We had to take
it the last year of high school.

415
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,410
So did we.

416
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,839
How did you do?

417
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,644
I had to go to my counselor's office

418
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,707
and have a talk with the school shrink.

419
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,609
How about you?

420
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,919
Me? I was so well adjusted,
they elected me prom queen.

421
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,892
Well, Robbie's scores are off the chart,

422
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:16,595
indicating a high level of
adaptability and socialization.

423
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,132
Not the kid we saw.

424
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,468
His dad must have coached him.

425
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,170
He had all the personality
tests, the literature.

426
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,711
Wasn't taking any chances.

427
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,509
Well, it worked. She was
recommending him for admission.

428
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,117
Then why would David Bishop
get the idea that she wasn't?

429
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,689
I have no idea how Mr. Bishop
could've gotten that impression.

430
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:53,533
I was never anything but absolutely positive
about Robbie's joining our program.

431
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,865
I wanted him.

432
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,463
You told Mr. Bishop that?

433
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,269
That would've been impolitic.

434
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,469
I had to wait for Kim's evaluation.

435
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,780
I mean, what do those
evaluations tell you, anyway?

436
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,646
These kids are bound to be maladjusted.

437
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,949
They've never fit in anywhere.
But here, they're with their own kind.

438
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,922
You've created a safe haven for them.

439
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,992
I'd like to think so.

440
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:20,658
And if Robbie acts out, I mean, it's
nothing you're gonna take too seriously.

441
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,223
That's right. It was just a normal
reaction to his special circumstances.

442
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,962
So he acted out, then.

443
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,436
That's not what I said.

444
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,871
You said his acting out was normal.

445
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,370
What did he do

446
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,711
that you didn't take seriously?

447
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,948
When he came for his first interview
in my office, he fainted.

448
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,582
His father said he had the flu.

449
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,281
EAMES: What did you think it was?

450
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,052
Stress, obviously.

451
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,627
This was the most important
interview of his young life.

452
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,289
Why wasn't this incident in Ms. Stevens' file?

453
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,991
Because I didn't tell her.

454
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,558
It was immaterial to his suitability.

455
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,827
Uh, you have classes seven days a week?

456
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,204
The children only attend six days.

457
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,634
Saturdays for some, Sundays for others,

458
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,644
depending upon their religious persuasion.

459
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,974
Saturdays for Robbie?

460
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,708
Yes.

461
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,011
Did he know he'd have to
go to school on Saturdays?

462
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,918
Absolutely.

463
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,148
We make it clear when the children apply

464
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,350
the level of commitment
that we expect from them.

465
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,222
Would you like to go
to a Little League game?

466
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,123
I talked to Dr. Leonard. She
doesn't think you're giving 100%.

467
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,461
But I'm doing the best I can.

468
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,468
Nothing is more important than your
education. You know that, right?

469
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,525
I know.

470
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,866
I might not always be there to remind you.

471
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,167
Where are you going?

472
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,903
Nowhere. All I'm saying is I
want you to concentrate harder.

473
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,040
You have your lunch?

474
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,808
All right. See you at 4:00.

475
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:54,123
I remember this kid from the tryout.
He knew a lot about baseball.

476
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,624
Did he show up by himself?

477
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,457
No. His mother was there, in the stands.

478
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,361
I remember. He pointed her out to me.

479
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,594
Yeah, that's her.

480
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,504
These kids, they know that their games
and practices are on Saturdays, right?

481
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,097
Yeah. We tell them at the tryout.

482
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,137
Thanks.

483
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,978
He knew if he got accepted
into Leonard's program,

484
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,570
he wouldn't be able to make the games.

485
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,311
But he signed up anyway, five days
before Leonard made her picks.

486
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,616
Robbie must've been convinced
he wouldn't be admitted.

487
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:28,590
Or else he was making sure he
wouldn't be by lying to his father.

488
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,924
Telling him that Kim Stevens was
giving him a negative evaluation.

489
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,793
Hoping like any normal 10-year-old

490
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,594
his dad would then just
forget about the school.

491
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,501
Not realizing that his dad is not
like any normal 40-year-old.

492
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:46,605
If he really didn't wanna be in this
program, why not just tell his father?

493
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,145
Oh, and risk disappointing the
only parent that he has left?

494
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,080
It's much safer for him to lay
the blame on Kim Stevens.

495
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,083
Her notes suggest they
had a good relationship.

496
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,982
Couldn't he have confided in her?

497
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,214
Well, maybe he tried to
tell her in his own way.

498
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,382
The Greek symbols in his math equations.

499
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,426
Anything more overt might have put
him in direct conflict with his dad.

500
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:06,156
When no one picked up on how
depressed this poor kid was,

501
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,993
lying was his only way out.

502
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,031
Now you need the truth from
him, what he told his father,

503
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,868
what he knows about his father's
whereabouts the night of the killings,

504
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,273
assuming you can talk to the
boy without his father.

505
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,743
The only place Robbie's away from
his dad is at the university.

506
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,110
We'd need Leonard's permission
to talk to him there.

507
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,710
I imagine I could persuade her.

508
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,114
You want to subject a minor
child to a police interrogation

509
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,157
without his father being
present or even notified?

510
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,160
It wouldn't be an interrogation.
He's a witness, not a suspect.

511
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,889
I could be sued for allowing it!

512
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:41,454
You could be charged if you don't.

513
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,456
That is ridiculous.

514
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:46,935
If I thought that there was abuse,
I would do something about it.

515
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,939
Even if it meant losing Robbie
Bishop as one of your students?

516
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,133
- Of course.
- Yeah.

517
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,504
A profoundly gifted child

518
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,942
who graduated high school at age seven?

519
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,573
Who scored a perfect 800 on his math SAT's?

520
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:03,378
Whose IQ was recorded at 246
on the Stanford-Binet scale?

521
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,520
Who represents your only
chance of one of your students

522
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,059
solving a Millennium Prize problem?

523
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:14,061
You would risk losing him
over a little fainting spell?

524
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,032
I should mention that while I
investigate this abuse charge,

525
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,399
I can shut down your institute.

526
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:23,768
Which, I'm sure, will generate a great
deal of interest from the press.

527
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,545
Hey, Dad, I'm ready for school.

528
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:37,281
Good, great. Let me just finish my
coffee. Your lunch is right there.

529
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,259
ROBBIE: Colorado?

530
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,388
We're going to Colorado?

531
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,125
There's a special school.

532
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,004
They heard about you. I don't know.

533
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,168
There was something else in the mail.

534
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,312
From the Little League.

535
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,281
It's okay, Robbie. You're allowed
a mistake every now and then.

536
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,005
Hey, Robbie.

537
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:37,238
Dr. Leonard told me this is where
you like to spend your lunch hour.

538
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,083
What are you doing up here?

539
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,114
Nothing.

540
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:45,381
I... I just wanna talk to you.

541
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,323
I don't wanna talk about my dad.

542
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,820
We don't have to.

543
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,393
We could talk about this.

544
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:57,056
I was wondering what you
thought of Boston this year.

545
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,362
Boston?

546
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,531
What, you don't like Boston?
They're leading the league.

547
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,598
This week. They choke
every time they get a lead.

548
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,774
They didn't choke the last
time they played the Yankees.

549
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,405
Four-zip. Thanks to Jeter, he lost that game.

550
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:12,607
Jeter was safe at second.

551
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,209
With the bases loaded, they could've tied
the game and gone into extra innings.

552
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,914
No way! Look, I... Look, I
saw that play on the news.

553
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,081
He was out by a mile.

554
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,751
I saw it happen. He was safe.

555
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:29,997
Why, you... You watched the game?
Your dad was out that night?

556
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,696
No, he was home.

557
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,569
Well, you said

558
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:43,476
that your dad doesn't let you watch baseball.

559
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,242
Sometimes he does.

560
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,941
No added value.

561
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,848
That's... That's what you said.

562
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,322
Come on, Robbie, tell me the
truth. Was your dad home?

563
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,018
No.

564
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:58,786
Oh.

565
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,124
That was Wednesday night.

566
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,438
I think the night before you found
out you were admitted here?

567
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,077
You didn't think you were
gonna get in, did you?

568
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:34,997
You thought that you were gonna
be playing baseball on Saturdays,

569
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,930
instead of being stuck in here.

570
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:44,305
Look, I know that you
tried to let people know

571
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,471
how you felt about coming here.

572
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,278
They wouldn't see it.

573
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,023
You told your dad a fib?

574
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,918
About Ms. Stevens

575
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,227
keeping you out of the program?

576
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,133
You hate it in here.

577
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,038
You know how I know?

578
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,524
You told me.

579
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,452
Yeah.

580
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,101
You've been thinking about these things a lot.

581
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,347
Maybe you thought about hurting yourself.

582
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,228
What is it about this place
that makes you so unhappy?

583
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,702
Is it the other kids?

584
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,633
The teachers?

585
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,911
Is it the work?

586
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,122
The work is too hard?

587
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,297
Can I see your book?

588
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,734
Please?

589
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,363
Has Dr. Leonard seen this?

590
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,623
No.

00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,666
(SNIFFLING)

592
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,400
- Has your dad?
- No.

593
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,206
Nobody knows?

594
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,014
I just have to try harder.

595

(ROBBIE WEEPING SOFTLY)

00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,706
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

597
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,850
You again. What is it now?

598
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,916
Now we're here for you.

599
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,528
I have to pick up my son
from school in an hour.

600
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,120
GOREN: We already have that covered.

601
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,100
You going somewhere? Colorado, maybe?

602
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,603
I don't have to answer that.

603
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,835
Guess what? Wherever it is you're
going, our squad room's on the way.

604
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,001
I hope you're not gonna keep
me away from Robbie too long.

605
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,206
He's still adjusting to being
away from home every day.

606
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,709
Robbie will be fine.

607
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,272
He's a remarkable kid.

608
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,776
I know that.

609
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,582
Who first noticed he was
unique, you or your wife?

610
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,685
My wife told me she thought he was bright.

611
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,989
But it was your idea to test him?

612
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,462
Yes.

613
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,998
After she passed away?

614
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,402
I owed it to her to help him
live up to his potential.

615
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,766
He tested well.

616
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,669
He maxed out the scale.

617
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,763
The Stanford-Binet IQ scale.

618
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,970
Right. And the Wechsler Scale.
He did that one when he was six.

619
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,809
And then he got that perfect
score on his math SAT's.

620
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,509
That must've been pretty gratifying for you.

621
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,520
Because you were something of a
math whiz yourself in high school.

622
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,524
Where did you hear that?

623
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,426
GOREN: Just from your old report cards.
They were among the papers that we took.

624
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,555
I did okay in high school.

625
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,232
You expect more from yourself than just okay.

626
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,432
I mean, if it weren't for the dyslexia,

627
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,405
you would've been an "A" student.

628
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,443
Twenty-five years ago, they didn't
know much about learning disabilities.

629
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,008
But you have the drive to succeed,

630
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:53,982
and you found other ways to be recognized.

631
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:57,119
Like being a race car driver or a rock star.

632
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,646
Or the father of a genius.

633
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,553
And that's where you put your best efforts.

634
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,891
Why not? I mean, that's what
being a father is all about,

635
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,725
making sure your kid gets the best.

636
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,424
GOREN: Paid off.

637
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,827
David, we talked to Dr. Leonard today.

638
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,865
And she thinks that he's done it.

639
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,600
Done what?

640
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,507
The Riemann Hypothesis.

641
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,907
He's made a breakthrough and solved it.

642
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,842
What? Oh, my God, that's...

643
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:32,480
That's fantastic! I never dreamed
that he'd be able to do it.

644
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,421
All our work, it was worth it!

645
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,724
Here. Have a look at his workbook.

646
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,465
What is this? This doesn't make sense.

647
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,805
EAMES: You sure?

648
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:58,075
Yeah, I'm sure. I know enough
about math to know this is...

649
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,082
GOREN: What, gibberish?

650
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,021
The work of a bright eighth grader

651
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,586
wrestling with concepts
beyond his comprehension?

652
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,688
My son didn't do this.

653
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,354
GOREN: Yes, he did.

654
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,495
This is what he does

655
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:21,065
when you're not around. When
you're not there to help him.

656
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,665
No, no, not my kid.

657
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:27,005
You're not there to finish
the Wechsler IQ test for him

658
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:30,706
and work out the answers for the SAT's...

659
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,179
Robbie did those by himself.

660
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,683
The only one he did by himself
is the Stanford-Binet

661
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,913
and that's only after he memorized
the manual you gave to him

662
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,717
before taking the test.

663
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,753
David, Robbie told us

664
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,491
about the memory exercises,
about the vocabulary builders,

665
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,726
about the constant coaching.

666
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,234
That's just how we work together.

667
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,933
He's just a little boy.

668
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,433
Yeah. A smart little boy
with a terrific memory

669
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,877
and an overwhelming fear
of disappointing his father.

670
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,055
But he's not a genius.

671
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,886
But you're wrong.

672
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,933
He's afraid to tell you.

673
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,906
That's why he lied to you
about Kim Stevens' intentions.

674
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:37,003
These are her notes on Robbie. She
was giving him a positive evaluation.

675
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,126
Oh, God.

676
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,994
Robbie.

677
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,231
I need to see my son.

678
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:06,872
I need to see my son. I need
to tell him... Robbie! Robbie!

679
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,808
I want to talk to him. Robbie.

680
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,515
He needs me.

681
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:17,551
He's fine. His aunt and uncle are on
their way down from Massachusetts.

682
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,087
You want to help your son?

683
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,215
I want to talk to him. Robbie...

684
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,960
You have to own up to the
murders. Tell the truth.

685
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,626
Why?

686
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,100
You confess, there's no trial.

687
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:40,070
There's no need for us to bring
in Robbie to testify that...

688
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,133
That you weren't home that night.

689
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,377
There's no need for him to know
that the lie that he told you

690
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,388
is the reason why you killed Kim Stevens.

691
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,598
You can spare him that knowledge.

692
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:13,735
Okay.

693
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,138
Okay.

694
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,923
Murder two, two counts, concurrent
sentences. 20-to-life.

695
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,092
The worst thing for him?

696
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,792
He'll miss Robbie's college graduation.
