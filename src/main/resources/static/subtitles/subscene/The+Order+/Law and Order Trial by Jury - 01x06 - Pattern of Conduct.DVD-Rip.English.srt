<i>all defendants are innocent

00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:16,647
<i>either by confession,

4
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,843
<i>This is one of those trials.</i>

5
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,778
<i>I went to dinner with my boyfriend.</i>

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,824
Then we went to his apartment.

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,950
He dropped me here around 7:00.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,018
I saw Lauren's door was open.

9
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,529
[Sniffs]
She's not an early riser, so...

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,567
I looked in.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,300
Her eyes were open,

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,067
but I saw blood, and I knew...

13
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,110
right away.

14
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,413
When's the last time
you spoke to your sister?

15
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,246
Yesterday.
Around noon I called her cell.

16
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,310
She said she was seeing Ken
for dinner.

17
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,256
That's Ken Jackson,
the all-star forward.

18
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,486
Apparently Lauren had been dating him.

19
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,654
They weren't really dating.

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,631
He's married.

21
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,068
They were involved?

22
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,263
Yeah.

23
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,499
But she knew it couldn't go anywhere.

24
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,815
It's not a suicide. I wouldn't
bring you down here for that.

25
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,580
<i>[Gaffney] Lady Derringer? I
hear they make earrings to match.</i>

26
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,283
So convince me. Women rarely
shoot themselves in the head.

27
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,793
Some women are too vain.
That's not evidence.

28
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,422
A model who bunks in a Soho loft with
her kid sister, hangs with celebrities.

29
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,023
Let's talk about the wound.

30
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,269
<i>No powder burns
or stippling.</i>

31
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,532
And there was no visible blowback
on the weapon.

32
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,699
I'd say she was shot
from over five feet away.

33
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,608
What's this on her hand?

34
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,612
<i>"Spin"?</i>

Caters to A-list celebrities.

37
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,284
That brings it back
to Ken Jackson.

38
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,922
How many miles to the gallon
you think that thing gets?

39
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,758

you wait for the hybrid.

<i>[Door Closes]
Well, here we go.</i>

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,764
Mr. Jackson. Sorry, guys,
no time for " signings.' '

42
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,771
Ain't about autographs.
We're from the D.A.' s office.

43
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,603
Lauren Ford?
You know her?

44
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,166

claim they know me, man.

45
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,179
R-R-Right.

46
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,772
Well, you know, I don't want to
jam you up with a tabloid thing.

47
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,908
It ain't a great place to talk.

48
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,545
Look, I don't know her. Okay? Okay.

49
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,988
Why don't you come down to the station
with us, answer a few questions.

50
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,685
We'll straighten everything out.
[Sighs]

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,694
Look, I saw her a couple of times,
you know what I'm saying?

52
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,696
And the last time
would have been-

53
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,698
Couple days ago.
Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,327
So tell me what she said. The last time you
- you had sex, right?

55
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,531
Look, man, you know my wife will kill
me if she knew I was talking like this.

56
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,404
Well, we're not
gonna tell your wife.

57
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,603
All right, so how do we fix this?

58
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,612
Look, how much she want?

59
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,380
Money's not gonna help
Lauren Ford. She's dead.

[Exhales]

61
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,096
So I better get a lawyer?

62
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,463
Or we could keep talking.
Make this go away.

63
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,661
Yeah, right.

64
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,421
Every major paper,
plus ESPN, Fox, CNN-

65
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,548
Blood's in the water,
and the sharks are out.

66
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,650
Well, we're not
spreading any rumors.

67
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,753
Jackson is interviewing
heavy-hitter defense attorneys.

68
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,298
That's the leakage. Couldn't
even wait to be indicted.

69
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,300
The M.E. Report says,

70
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,269
"In view of lack of stippling
at the site of the entry wound,

71
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,862
"the bruises
and minor vaginal abrasion,

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,932
possible rape and homicide
should be considered.' '

73
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,376
Damn. Could he be
any less committal?

74
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,470
<i>[Kibre] That's an M.E.
I'll never put on the stand.</i>

75
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,845
The latent prints on the gun are hers,

76
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,850
but they're in her own blood.

77
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,046
How could she shoot herself,
get blood on her hand,

78
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,056
<i>and then pick up
the gun?</i>

79
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,059
Bits and pieces that'll never
get a grand jury to indict a celebrity.

80
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,994
They'll want something
that could be a tabloid headline.

81
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,224
The M.E. Found semen in the victim.

82
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,392
A D.N.A. Match could put
Jackson at the scene.

83
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,527
But we have no probable cause
to get a sample from Jackson.

84
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:08,267
Well, that's all in the news. We
gotta do something. Shake the trees.

Hey, there is no situation.

89
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,854
I'm completely innocent.
Not completely.

90
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,553

00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,403
It's not perfect.
So tell us what will.

94
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,701
For starters, perceptions.

96
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:50,280
But Tiffany, when you glare at Ken
with those hard, lovely eyes,

97
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,841
you're telling the world
he's done something bad.

98
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,581
You don't know him.

99
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,885
I do.

100
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,693
That ruby ring-

101
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,855
<i>Six karats?</i>

102
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,764
- Seven.
- A recent gift?

103
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,234
<i>From now on,</i>

104
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,295
before you look at Ken,
look at that ring.

105
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,275
<i>It's magnificent,
and Ken gave it to you.</i>

106
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,436
<i>Feel good about that.</i>

107
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,817
<i>Yeah.</i>

108
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,514
Now the world knows Ken's a good guy,

109
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,580
a loving husband.

110
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,320
You're saying, " I know he's innocent.' '

111
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,897
This grand jury-

112
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,899
Can I go in there and just
clear all this mess up?

113
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,835
<i>Not if I'm your lawyer.
[Tiffany] Forget "if.' '</i>

114
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,635
You are his lawyer.
So what does he do?

115
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,711
He speaks to no one
who isn't now in this room.

116
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,374
He goes about his life with caution.

117
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,679
They'll be after Ken's D.N.A.

118
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,686
Don't spit, chew gum...

119
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,918
or leave behind a locker room towel
where they can get it.

120
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,859
And keep your secretions
to yourself.

121
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,692
His secreting days are over.

122
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:20,162
<i>[Kibre] Mr. Mebane, you were at one
time a teammate of Kenneth Jackson's?</i>

123
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,173
Yeah, before I was traded.

124
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:27,110
<i>Did you know Lauren Ford?
No, I never knew her.</i>

125
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,546
I just know about the reporter.

126
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,351
Did Mr. Jackson date a reporter?

127
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,116
I think it was more than " date.' ' Last year
there was talk some reporter might sue him.

128
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,958
Sue him for what? It was on the down
low, but I heard they liked to play rough.

129
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,963
You know, I guess it got out of hand.

130
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:49,058
<i>- Do you know this reporter's name?
- No, just that she worked out of Philly.</i>

131
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,695
Okay, thank you, Mr. Mebane.

132
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,864
Are there any questions?
Yes, sir.

133
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,705
Mr. Mebane says that he got traded.

134
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,213
Didn't Ken Jackson
force you off the team?

135
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,373
No one forced me off the team.

136
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,180
<i>Come on. A nyone who reads the sports
page knows that these guys hate each other.</i>

137
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,888
- Yes?
- When do we get to meet Ken Jackson in person?

138
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,257
<i>[Laughter]</i>

139
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,888
I don't care what some ballplayer said
in a grand jury.

140
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,899
I meant what I said on the phone.
I won't discuss Ken Jackson.

141
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,901
You wasted a trip to Philly.

142
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,960
Well, we don't plan on eating
cheese steaks and going home, so-

143
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,063
So subpoena me. Fine.
That's not what we'd prefer.

144
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,906
This is the upside
- The information you give us is of no value and we go away.

145
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,539
Was she raped?

146
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,016
She had sex shortly before
she was killed.

147
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,020
Now, Ken Jackson claims
that it was consensual.

148
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,420
He threatens, she submits-

149
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,720
To him that's consensual.

150
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,585
Obedient.
Is that how it went?

151
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,996
Two months into my job,
our head of sports news said...

152
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,398
that Ken Jackson would do
a one-on-one interview.

153
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,403
He asked specifically for me.

154
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,701
Saw you on the news.
Liked what he saw.

155
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,707
And I was flattered.

156
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,541
After the interview he asked me
for a drink in his hotel room.

157
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:11,276
Ken opened some champagne
and started to lay out some coke.

158
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,447
I knew where it was going,
and I wasn't up for it.

159
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:20,456
I started to leave.
Suddenly he had a gun.

160
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,157
There was no menace in his voice.

161
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:30,090
He just aimed at me and said,
"Get undressed.' '

162
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,138
When he was done he asked
if he could call me-

163
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,772
like we'd had fun.

164
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,948
I'd like you to talk to our D.A.' s.

165
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,917
It's his word against mine,
and he's a star.

166
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,181
There must be others.
Find them.

00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,194
and mostly to my beloved wife-

170
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,931
I was unfaithful.

171
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,937
It would be a lie to deny that,

172
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,304
and I'm truly sorry
that I've let you down.

173
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,277
With all of my heart,
I regret all the pain that I've caused.

174
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:17,544
- [Clamoring]
- This lady, Lauren Ford-

175
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,052
<i>Her death is a tragedy,</i>

176
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,282
but I had nothing to do with it.

177
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,953
<i>[Reporters Shouting Questions] Because of the ongoing
investigation, Mr. Jackson won't take questions directly.</i>

178
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,826
Isn't he right now the target
of a grand jury probe?

179
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:36,061
We can't know that because
grand juries operate in secrecy.

180
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,798
But if there is a probe,
Mr. Jackson will be happy to testify.

181
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,170
<i>You'd let him?
I would encourage it.</i>

182
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,905
Sadly, the district attorneys believe
that celebrity cases bring votes.

183
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,743
That's the only reason why
this woman's tragic death...

184
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,908
is being exploited in the first place.

185
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,918
Are there any other questions?

186
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,580
I loved him saying Jackson
will testify. It's smart.

187
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,920
We can't reveal grand jury witnesses,

188
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,721
so people won't know
he never showed up.

189
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,785
So we've run out
of grudge-bearing players.

190
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,990
<i>What about the reporter?
Shaky.</i>

191
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,432
She's threatening to come down
with a case of selective amnesia.

192
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,437
His D.N.A. Would sure help.

193
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,440
Well, we're not any closer
to probable cause.

194
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,944
Well, maybe we can get his D.N.A.
Without probable cause.

195

214
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,852
My kid's a fan.
I'll give you 20 bucks for the hat.

Twenty bucks?

Take the boy to Atlantic City.

217
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,627
Better idea.

218
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,764
Leave him.
Go on your own.

219
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,897
My spies saw a lab report.
They got Ken's D.N.A.

220
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,064
They'll try for a match with
the semen found in the victim.

221
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,438
So what? Ken went
public that he cheated.

222
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,811
<i>Yes, but still
- a match links Ken to the events of that night.</i>

223
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,815
Maybe there was someone else
around that woman.

224
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,545
We should offer a big reward for information
- Half a million dollars.

225
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,554
- Tiffany- - They should be looking
to find out what really happened.

226
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,718
When they did that in the Simpson case,
it only served to heighten suspicion that-

227
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,421
<i>Don't compare me with him.</i>

228
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,725
Look, I'm innocent.
Now, you must believe that.

229
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,564
Of course, but it's a fool's move
in any game to overreact.

230
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,701
- This may simply go away.
- How would that happen?

231
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:33,108
<i>The prosecutors have a problem
unique to a celebrity case.</i>

232
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,445
Grand juries like sitting there
hearing dish about famous people.

233
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,882
<i>It's their 15 minutes of fame.</i>

234
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,386
Once they vote, it's over.

235
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,252
You're saying they might not vote at all?

236
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,417
First MichaelJackson investigation,
they sat for months,

237
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,427
and then voted no indictment.

238
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,023
We stay calm. All right?
And see where this goes.

239
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,903
<i>[Kibre] So in comparing samples
of Mr. Jackson's D.N. A...</i>

240
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,944
<i>to semen samples found
on Lauren Ford-</i>

241
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,414
Frequency calculation indicated
that one in every 1.5 million...

242
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,246
<i>would be expected to have
the same profile as the donor.</i>

243
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,253
And this tells us what,
Dr. Spellman?

244
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:19,758
Kenneth Jackson had intercourse
with Miss Ford shortly before her death.

245
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,056
Thank you. Any questions?

246
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,360
Did he find Ken Jackson's D.N.A.
On the gun?

247
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,766
<i>The gun was not offered for D.N.A.
Evidence. So why is this a big deal?</i>

248
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,861
Ken admitted he had sex with her.

249
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,897
Tiffany says in here
the woman was stalking him.

250
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:41,072
Okay, you've heard forensic evidence
that states that the victim...

251
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,307
was shot from at least five feet away.

252
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,783
You've seen photographs of bruises
and vaginal abrasions.

253
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,719
I really think it's time for you
to consider taking a vote...

254
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,154
on whether or not
to indict Kenneth Jackson.

255
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,387
That woman in Philadelphia told her
roommate that she was raped with a gun.

256
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,986
<i>Can we use this as evidence?
No.</i>

257
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,896
Hearsay is not allowed.

258
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,230
But
- [Clears Throat] I would like to remind you...

259
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,897
that this grand jury
will reach an expiration date,

260
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,736
and at that time it's entirely likely...

261
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,242
that a whole other group of people
will get to decide...

262
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,939
whether or not to indict Kenneth Jackson.

263
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,015
Congratulations.
How'd you move 'em off the dime?

264
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,455
<i>Well, it's hardly cause
for celebration.</i>

265
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,755
We were two votes short
of a no bill.

266
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,853
<i>Close calls are as good as any.
With our felony murder charge,</i>

267
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,593
Ken Jackson might use
the Phil Spector defense.

268
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,761
<i>What, because they were seeing each
other, guns are acceptable foreplay?</i>

269
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,134
The media can also spin that
as an accidental death.

270
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,606
We can't address all the possible media
spin. Get a warrant and haul him in.

271
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,442
A perp walk plays right to charges
of overzealous prosecution.

272
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,311
Then no arrest warrant.
Let him surrender.

273
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,976
And no cuffs on our hometown hero
when he's arraigned.

274
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,986

Mr. DaSilva?

Where could this man

Ken Jackson
is here today voluntarily-

284
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,519
out of respect for Lauren
Ford's family and the law.

285
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,859
The State's case is so weak, they
dare not issue an arrest warrant.

286
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,422
Mr. Jackson voluntarily surrendered?

287
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,094
<i>We extended that as a courtesy.
Then, Your Honor,</i>

288
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,228
shouldn't they extend
the further courtesy of reasonable bail?

289
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,239
So it would seem.

290
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,502
Bail is set at $500,000 cash.

<i>I looked into Ken Jackson's
college records.</i>

302
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,407
He was suspended from playing
his senior year.

303
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,571
<i>Meaning?
Means he had to sit out games.</i>

304
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:32,139
How many? Four
- and the record says it was for curfew violations.

305
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,243
Okay, I'm not that big of a sports fan.

306
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,288
What exactly does that mean?

307
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:41,383
No college takes a star player out of games
for coming in late. He did something else.

308
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,260
There's a single name on the witness list-
Hope Elizabeth Newhall.

309
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,731
She's currently a graduate student
at Hudson University.

310

<i>I'm close to my postgrad degree.</i>

311

I don't wanna screw things up
by getting involved.

312
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,042
Well, your college records say that
Ken Jackson was briefly suspended,

313
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,674
and you were a witness.

314
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,947
What's the big deal?
That's all it says?

315
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,113
I was a witness?

316
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,215
They cut Kenny some slack?

317
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,056
That's what they do
for star athletes, right?

318
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:21,023
But then again, you're cutting him
some slack right now, aren't you?

319
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,302
<i>Look, if you wanna give Kenny...</i>

320
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,066
another chance to skate,
that's fine,

321
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,734
but I'll bet you any amount of money
whatever happened,

322
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,039

<i>So you weren't actually dating Ken?</i>

325
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:44,048
<i>No. He and Tiffany

<i>[Kibre]

He started coming on to me.

330
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,600
We ended up in a room
on our own.

331
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,475
We kissed a little bit,
but I was nervous.

332

<i>I told him I wanted to get something
to drink just to get out of there.</i>

00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,278
<i>He said, "Look at this.' '</i>

334
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,821
He was holding a knife-
sort of playing with it.

335
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,391
He could see I was really scared,

336
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,621
and I could tell he liked that.

337
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,523
He asked me, very calmly,

338
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,301
to perform oral sex on him.

339
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,071
I'd never done that before.

340
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,203
I was frightened, and he-

341
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,680
<i>He-
He got rough?</i>

342
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,586
He said he'd make me mind him
like a dog.

343
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,918
And afterwards he was like-

344
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,016
He offered me a ride home.

345
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,755
He actually thought I would see him again.

346
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,562
Okay. We checked,
and there's no police report.

347
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,569
You never told them?

348
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,435
I called the campus police.

349
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,873
They took me to the dean's house.

350
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,877
The coach was already there.

351
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:17,279
<i>He and Dean Erhardt
grilled me for hours.</i>

352
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,614
When I told them that I'd had a
vodka and orange juice at the party,

353
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,247
they said underage drinking
was a crime.

354
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,883
Meaning what had happened
was your fault.

355
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,421
They said I'd be expelled
if I told anyone.

356
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,794
<i>These witnesses, Diane Harris
and Hope Newhall,</i>

357
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,803
must be allowed to testify.

358
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,898
<i>Their statements support the defendant's
pattern of conduct, pursuant to Molineaux.</i>

359
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,967
Judge, please see this for what it is-

360
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,639
Two women grabbing their 15 minutes
of fame on perjured testimony.

361
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:53,082
I've read your memos. One
woman describes rape with a gun.

362
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,585
The other one
talks about some knife.

363
00:20:55,654 --> 00:21:00,318
Therefore I will only allow the testimony
of Miss Harris, the reporter. Next?

364
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,953
I filed a request to access psychiatric
records on all alleged rape victims.

365
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,089
Yes, I've obtained those records
and I read them in camera.

366
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:11,329
I find that some of them are relevant,
especially those of Lauren Ford.

367
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,462
The psychiatric records
of a dead victim?

368
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,472
Why are those relevant?

369
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,941
Because Lauren Ford received counseling
for previous suicide attempts.

370
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,112
<i>Four years ago, my sister locked herself
in the garage and started the car.</i>

371
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,348
She'd just broken up with this guy.

372
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,859
And your parents took her to an E. R? They
treated her and then she got some counseling?

373
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,728
They told my parents
she had a marginal bipolar disorder.

374
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,358
After that she took a bunch of Seconal
while she was living out of state?

375
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,561
Over a guy.

376
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,627
I never met him.

377
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,568
Look, she did not shoot herself.

378
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,578
I've thought about it a lot
and I'm certain...

379
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,807
she didn't do that.

380
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,415
<i>There are no possible grounds
for a motion in limine...</i>

381
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,426
to keep the suicide out?

382
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,258
What do I argue, that she
had a depressive disorder?

383
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,926
I've never filed a nol-pros
in my career, but-

384
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,265
Forget it.
You're not filing one now.

385
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,771
We don't indict a star athlete
without a good reason.

386
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,103
I just got a call
from the police in Philly.

387
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,439
They're bringing Diane Harris in
for an interview.

388
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,776
Our last remaining hope ducked calls,
ducked a subpoena...

389
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,783
and now has to be delivered
in a police cruiser.

390
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,842
At least you got her.
Make it count.

391
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,853
I didn't want to say anything
in front of the boss, but, uh-

392
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:43,623
About a year agoJackson gave
Diane Harris a million dollars...

393
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,925
to shut up about the rape.

394
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,066
Hey, I was abused, humiliated-
I was owed.

395
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:56,233
A million bucks? I'm on
camera. My living is my image.

396
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:00,438
That station pays zip, and I
needed clothes, a car, a condo.

397
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,913
Really? Well, invite Lauren's
family over to see your closet.

398
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:07,611
Tell them, " I won't put away Lauren's
killer, but check out my Manolos.' '

399
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,917
This nightmare is costing me my job.
I'm ruined.

400
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,617
Do you understand that?
I don't give a damn.

401
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,286
Can I go?

402
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,730
You're served.
Show up in court or sit in jail.

403
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,594
Fine. I won't remember a thing.

404
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,103
<i>[Gaffney] There is a way to
help yourselfhere. Yeah, right.</i>

405
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,106
I mean rebuild your image.

406
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,268
Amber Fry
- The "other woman" for whom Scott Peterson killed his wife?

407
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,781
On the stand she became the courageous
witness who helped to put him away.

408
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,373
Ken's lawyers will destroy me.

409
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,817
<i>[Kibre] Not if I have you
tell your version first.</i>

410
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,981
It starts with the prosecution.
We won the spin.

411
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,183
Like I'd get some favor from you?

412
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,557
Personal feelings aside,

413
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,791
it's in my best interest
to make you look good.

414
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,891
Either that or I treat you as a
hostile witness and tear you a new one.

415
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,459
Your choice, Diane.

416
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,010
<i>This would be my first time on a jury,</i>

417
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,513
and I would willingly give up the time.

418
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,312
This is a big case.
You mean it seems important?

419
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:17,253
<i>[Woman] Violence against a woman? E.R.
Nurse, volunteers at a rape crisis center.</i>

420
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,291
<i>Outspoken, advocate.
[Gaffney] Miss Claros,</i>

421
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:23,191
<i>have you yourself ever been
a victim of a violent crime?</i>

422
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:27,061
Fortunately not,
but I've seen plenty of victims.

423
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,066
Gone.

424
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,799
Your Honor, we respectfully
challenge juror number 157.

425
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:38,373
Juror number 157 is excused.

426
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,708
<i>[Gaffney] Ms. Prokolsky, do you
believe a man can rape his wife?</i>

427
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,714
<i>Or his girlfriend?</i>

428
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,182
Sure, if he wanted it and she didn't.

429
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,185
I mean, I'm sure it happens.

430
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,222
<i>She's indecisive.
[Gaffney] How do you know?</i>

431
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,656
Well, then, I mean, there's,
like, accusations- Snoop Dogg-

432
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,320
<i>and, like, I mean,</i>

433
00:24:57,395 --> 00:25:00,023
I think she could have lied,
I guess.

434
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,066
She's a ditz.

435
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,192
She's good for us.
We want her.

436
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,228
<i>[Kibre] Mr. Leone, I see
you're employed by a bank.</i>

437
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,900
<i>Do you believe celebrities are easy prey
- C.P.A. He'll want absolutes.</i>

438
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,002
<i>For false accusations? Hold the
prosecution to an impossible standard.</i>

439
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,845
<i>Happens all the time. People make false
accusations against anyone with money.</i>

440
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,850
Lawyers have ruined this country.

441
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,216
<i>[Laughter]</i>

442
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,422
I wasn't referring to you,
of course.

443
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,391
[Chuckles]
No problem.

444
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,088
Your Honor, the People
are satisfied.

445
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,188
Your Honor, my client
is satisfied with this panel.

446
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,200
Thank you.

447
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,726
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you are now seated in
the case of The People v. Kenneth Jackson.</i>

448
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,738
<i>[Gavel Raps]</i>

449
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,510
Can you match that demographic?

450
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,512
Three days I'll have them cloned.

451
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,048
<i>The prosecution is gonna show you a gun-</i>

452
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,452
A.25-caliber Lady Derringer...

453
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,888
with a single partial print-

454
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,553
Lauren Ford's print,
in her own blood.

455
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,623
Lauren Ford fired the gun,

456
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,894
<i>and took her own life.
Boring.</i>

457
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,664
<i>Real evidence has been made banal by
TV crime dramas. This is not a murder.</i>

458
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,638
<i>It is a suicide. [Woman] Look
at this peak on "suicide.' '</i>

459
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,732
Mmm. Hot word.

460
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,075
Uh, Rex, we're getting a bump on "
suicide.' ' Why don't you go there?

461
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,081
<i>Make 'em feel it.</i>

462
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:28,347
So, let us now view Lauren's
desperate yearning...

463
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,514
for a man she could not have.

464
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,856
<i>The feel of a hard-bodied athlete,
the caress ofhis strong hands.</i>

465
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,259
<i>Oh, they're loving it.
That's pay dirt, Rex.</i>

466
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,467
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, when Ken
told Lauren that they were through-

467
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,868
that he was breaking it off-

468
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,533
Ken didn't know that Lauren Ford
had a history of depression,

469
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,669
that there were prior suicide attempts.

470
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:58,648
<i>When Ken told Lauren that he was devoting
himself to his wife and his family,</i>

471
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,483
he never, ever thought Lauren Ford
would take her own life.

472
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,688
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you are confronted with tragedy,</i>

473
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,693
not a murder.

474
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,695
Thank you.

475
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,903
<i>Understand, these Ken Jackson high school
records are mostly handwritten notes.</i>

476
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,067
There's no computer database. I hope
you're not prepping me for bad news.

477
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,304
Not at all.
We have something.

478
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,313
There was a mediation
before a guidance counselor.

479
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,576
<i>What kind of mediation?
We don't know,</i>

480
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,586
but we found handwritten drafts
for a counselor summons.

481
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,088
One is for Deborah Jackson,
Ken's mother.

482
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,716
Another for Erlene Henderson.

483
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,158
<i>These two people were definitely
involved in the mediation.</i>

484
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,162
Was Erlene Henderson a student?

485
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,722
<i>There was no one in the student body
or the faculty with that name.</i>

486
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,567
Maybe if Ken's mother was summoned,
Erlene Henderson is someone else's mother.

487
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,998
Find out who she is.

488
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,213
<i>[Kibre]
Are you currently employed, Ms. Harris?</i>

489

490
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,052

491
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,021
For what reason were you fired?

492
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,617
I've been the subject of a scandal
that involved Ken Jackson.

493

00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,042
<i>[Judge]
You may.</i>

498
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,807
<i>Why did TiffanyJackson...</i>

499
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,542
pay you one million dollars?

500
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,641
Objection. Calls for speculation.

501
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,483
If you know.

502
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,121
Because her husband, superstar
Ken Jackson, raped me.

503
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,992
<i>[Kibre]
It was hush money, and you took it?</i>

504
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:56,727
<i>Yes. I said nothing
about being raped at gunpoint.</i>

505
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,326
Why talk now?

506
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,774
Because Lauren Ford was raped,
like I was, and murdered.

507
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,174
Objection. Move for mistrial.

508
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,271
Denied, but the jury will disregard
that last statement.

509
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,816
No more questions, Your Honor.

510
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,149
How is your career, Miss Harris?

511
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,485
You heard me.
I was fired.

512
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,888
I'm not talking about local TV.

513
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,757
This case has made you sort of
a national celebrity, hasn't it?

514
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,194
<i>Unfortunately.
"Unfortunately"?</i>

515
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,560
How unfortunate is all this?

516
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:34,696
You weren't paid for these
recent interviews and articles?

517
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,934
Some. A few.

518
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,942
Hmm.

519
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,876
How much for this one?

520
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,545
I don't remember.

521
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,179
50,000, wasn't it?

522
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:54,214
<i>If I bring in the publisher,
what's he gonna say?</i>

523
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,352
Yes. Fifty.

524
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,159
Ken Jackson is like
a cottage industry for you.

525
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,291
<i>You make one false accusation
and you're set for life-</i>

526
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,804
profiting from a woman's tragic death,
and Ken Jackson's misfortune.

527
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:10,204
<i>Objection. Badgering
the witness. Sustained.</i>

528
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,938
One simple question, Mr. DaSilva.

529
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,139
I don't need another question.

530
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,648
<i>She's already given us
the answer.</i>

531
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,152
<i>[Gaffney]
Impact on thejury's hard to say.</i>

532
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,381
Look at Father Shanley's trial
in Boston.

533
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:28,118
The only witness took a payoff,
but the jury still convicted.

534
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,491
They figured if someone got paid,
something must have happened.

535
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,725
We might get lucky.
We got Tiffany's birth certificate.

536
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,996
She was born Tiffany Ingram, and her
mother's name is Erlene Henderson.

537
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:41,561
All right. Check out her school
records. Maybe they haven't been cleaned.

538
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,903
I did that.
An incident report.

539
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,411
Victim Tiffany Ingram
alleges that 12th grader Ken Jackson...

540
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,675
attempted a sexual assault on her-
at gunpoint.

541
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,384
I'll draft a motion.

542
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,513
Evidence of a similar crime
on Mr. Jackson's wife?

543
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,582
We've also found Byron Holmes, the
school security guard, who was a witness.

544
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,117
The incident was never proven, and
Mrs. Jackson retracted the allegation.

545
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,723
Which is why we call it a prior
bad act and not a prior conviction.

546
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,735
We should have been given notice of this
during discovery. We would have prepared.

547
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,397
You're seriously arguing
unfair surprise?

548
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,633
If you don't like that, Judge,
how about marital privilege?

549
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,541
<i>- They weren't married when this occurred.
- [DaSilva] They're married now.</i>

550
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:24,207
<i>At this point, no way am I forcing Mrs.
Jackson to testify against her husband.</i>

551
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,943
Yeah. Tiff and I will talk about it.

552
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,649
All right.

553
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,124
What?

554
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,627
DaSilva says the prosecutors are bringing
that security guard from our high school.

555
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,631
Damn.

556
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,465
Tiff, the man is going to testify.
Now, what is he gonna say?

557
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,663
I was mad at you. L-

558
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,504
<i>I don't remember what I said.</i>

559
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,238
So I guess we're gonna have to wait
and see what he remembers.

560
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:00,615
- Ken, do you think that they know things we don't know?
- Like what?

561
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,121
Like there was some witness.

562
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,588
<i>Like somebody saw something.</i>

563
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,956
Even if it weren't true,
there are people out there...

564
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,360
who would lie just because we
are who we are. Hey, listen.

565
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,957
Ever since I've been accused,
you and I have both known they were wrong.

566
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,127
Yeah.

567
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:21,365
Baby, all we gotta do is be strong,
and stick to the plan.

568
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,608
But I'm so scared for you.

569
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:31,380
I'm gonna bring us through this.

570
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,440
Okay?

571
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,649
<i>[Kibre] Officer Holmes, do you
remember the defendant? Who doesn't?</i>

572
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:47,357
<i>- And his then girlfriend, Tiffany?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

573
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,400
<i>Did Tiffany Ingram...</i>

574
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,231
report that she had been assaulted
by the defendant?

575
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,498
Objection. Hearsay.

576
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,540
Approach.

577
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,237
<i>I'm assuming that you
have found an exception.</i>

578
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,078
It's admissible as an excited utterance.

579
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,141
"Excited utterance.' ' Please.

580
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:12,019
If she can lay the proper foundation,
I'll allow it.

581
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,024
But be careful, Ms. Kibre.

582
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,198
Please describe Tiffany's demeanor
when she reported the incident.

583
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,065
<i>She was very upset.
What did she say?</i>

584
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,401
<i>Objection.
Overruled.</i>

585
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,840
She said that Kenny
had sexually assaulted her.

586
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,377
Did she say a weapon was involved?

587
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,379
<i>She said he threatened her
with a gun.</i>

588
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,550
Thank you.

589
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,586
Did Tiffany have any visible injuries?

590
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,554
Her hair was mussed.
She was crying.

591
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,250
<i>Did you take her to the hospital?
No.</i>

592
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,350
- Did you find a weapon?
- No.

593
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,554
<i>In fact, two days later,
didn't she come to you and recant?</i>

594
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,530
<i>Yes. She said that she
made the story up.</i>

595
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,932
She said that they were fooling around
and he pulled out a gun.

596
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:02,530
<i>She was scared.
It was a misunderstanding.</i>

597
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,370
Thank you.

598
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,070
<i>Your Honor, redirect?
Proceed.</i>

599
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:11,741
Officer Holmes, when Tiffany came
and recanted the story of the rape,

600
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,546
did you notice anything
different about her?

601
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,488
Uh, how was she dressed?

602
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,986
Her clothes looked nice. New.

603
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,462
<i>Anyjewelry?
She showed me a ring.</i>

604
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,989
Said she and Kenny had made up
and they was engaged.

605
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,901
Uh, well-

606
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,961
<i>Was it...</i>

607
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,633
the same ring
that Ms. Jackson is wearing now?

608
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,347
Nah, he gave her that
for cheating with the dead woman.

609
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,315
<i>[Laughter]
Everyone knows that.</i>

610
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:50,343
<i>- [DaSilva] Objection.
- [Judge] Thejury will disregard.</i>

611
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,590
No more questions.

612
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,755
I was called a liar.

613
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,764
Humiliated.

614
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,766
I want to respond.

615
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,768
Look, they want to hear me,
not her.

616
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,100
I'm the celebrity.
I've been accused.

617
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,537
Every time they ask a question
you look at me for the answer.

618
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,098
Watch what you're saying.
It's true, baby.

619
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,111
- Without a ball in your hand, you can't think.
- Damn it, now, that's enough.

620
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,444
Now, I'm sick of being
bitch-slapped by you.

621
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,046
I don't want you being questioned by them.
You understand?

622
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,025
I'm sorry, honey.

623
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:33,029
Let's just settle down
and listen to our lawyer.

624
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,463
All that matters is we win.

625
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,366
<i>I understand Ken's feelings,</i>

626
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,769
but I think it should be you.

627
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,865
You can be like Hillary Clinton-

628
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,309
The wronged woman telling us
to forgive what she's forgiven.

629
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:52,315
<i>Asking that we believe in Ken
as she believes in him.</i>

630
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,682
In my opinion, you're the voice
that everyone's waiting to hear.

631
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,562
So you knew about Lauren Ford?

632
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,761
I was aware of Lauren.
People tell me things.

633
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,771
People enjoy telling me
hurtful things.

634
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,364
Did you ever meet Lauren?

635
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,534
No, but I once talked to her.

636
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,774
- The night she died, she called.
- Objection.

637
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,045
<i>- Hearsay.
- Goes to state of mind.</i>

638
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,250
<i>Proceed.
What did she say?</i>

639
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,348
Ken had just left her.
I could tell she was crying.

640
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,757
<i>But why call you?</i>

641
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,625
<i>She said she couldn't
live without him.</i>

642
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,097
<i>I actually felt sorry for her.
She was so-</i>

643
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,602
She was so miserable.

644
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,805
<i>She begged me to leave him.</i>

645
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,205
She...

646
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,870
said she hated me, that she would
kill herself and ruin our lives.

647
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,079
Thank you.

648
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,483
So after hearing a woman
threaten to commit suicide,

649
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,323
you called 911.
No.

650
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,463
No? What did you do?

651
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,132
This wasn't the first woman
who was obsessed with my husband.

652
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,174
Well, did you ever
tell the police this, uh,

653
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,235
story?

654
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,941
Those police who were looking to
get famous off arresting my husband?

655
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,746
You say this isn't
the first woman who was...

656
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,052
obsessed with your husband.

657
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,991
Did any others call?

658
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,187
Others have called.

659
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,027
Sent little love notes,
left voice mails.

660
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,001
But none had ever looked me in the eye
and said I'm taking him away from you.

661
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,507
Looked you in the eye?

662
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,107
I meant called me on the phone.

663
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,893
<i>Freudian slip? Phone records
show a call from Lauren.</i>

664
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,235
Ken comes home,
tells Tiffany Lauren's become a problem,

665
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,571
then Lauren calls and threatens.

666
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,406
Says she'll go public,
reveal Ken's gunplay.

667
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,605
They'd lose millions
from their endorsements.

668
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,876
Or it was jealousy.
She loves him.

669
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,180
[Scoffs] Please. It happens.

670
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,619
In any case,
none of this matters.

671
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:48,318
It does to me.
Who you calling?

672
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,262
Please.
Thank you.

673
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,659
Hope I didn't drag you
from too far away.

674
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,762
Not at all. I live over on 110.

675
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,239
Chablis?
Thank you.

676
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,276
Park view?

677
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,437
No, an old family brownstone.

678
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,039
My father was a surgeon
over at Westside Presbyterian.

679
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,017
Too bad we can't toast to victory.

680
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,078
No, that wouldn't work.

681
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,084
Mr. DaSilva,

682
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,221
I'm one of those people who needs
to be certain about things.

683
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,527
An honest prosecutor needs certainty,

684
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,693
just as an honest defense attorney
needs doubt.

685
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,738
There was a moment in court-

686
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,798
A moment that supports
Ken Jackson's innocence.

687
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,901
So you know what I mean.

688
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,572
It's nothing I can act on.
Nor can l-

689
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:48,479
Except to say that
if there were an admission-

690
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,646
Is this the offer of a plea?

691
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,092
If the truth could emerge,

692
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,958
I would lobby for a plea.

693
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,263
There's a personal quotient involved-
a marriage-

694
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,673
something I'm not part of, something
they may not be willing to share.

695
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,677
Well-

696
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,077
<i>Clearly-
The offer of a plea...</i>

697
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,777
would have to come
before I could even suggest it.

698
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:25,287
A plea?
After all we did to indict this guy?

699
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,290
Forget it.

700
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,327
You sold that jury a pattern of conduct,
and I think you'll get a conviction.

701
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,158
I can't stop thinking
that it was Tiffany.

702
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,131
Off what? A slip of the
tongue? Female intuition?

703
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,498
You haven't talked to anybody?

704
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,800
I just want a judgment
based on the truth.

705
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,568
Stop dreaming.
You're not in the certainty business.

706
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,236
The winning argument is the proof.

707
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,779
What actually happened,
who did what to whom,

708
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,111
are things that we never know.

709
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,049
I hate that.

710
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,213
Learn to live with it,
'cause it's all we got.

711
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,469
<i>[Judge]
Jurors, please be seated.</i>

712
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,309
<i>It's still not too late. Forget
it. Have you reached a verdict?</i>

713
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,312
<i>[Woman] We have, Your
Honor. Kibre is reasonable.</i>

714
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,213
<i>We ask the verdict be withheld,
and try to work something out.</i>

715
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,411
Tiff is not gonna plead.
I got her into this mess.

716
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:35,086
Will the jury foreperson and
the defendant please rise.

717
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,226
<i>In the matter
ofThe People v. Kenneth Jackson,</i>

718
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,755
<i>charging murder in the
first degree, is he guilty,</i>

719
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,859
<i>or not guilty?</i>

720
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,598
We the jury find the defendant,
Kenneth Jackson, guilty as charged.

721
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,270
<i>- [Spectators Murmuring]
- No!</i>

722
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,939
[Whispering]
No. I can't let them do this.

723
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,381
It's all right, baby. It's okay.
Ken-

724
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,587
No. No. It's all right. I
love you. I've got your back.

725
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:15,029
There's no way I'd ever
let them punish you, ever.

726
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,013
