1
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,249
Five cats, Kate. You want them all?

2
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,192
I promised Mrs. Batchelder.

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,762
You're an angel.

4
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,629
The firemen told me it
was her electric blanket.

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,568
That's terrible.

6
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,834
If you hear from her family could you give
them my number? I need to talk to them.

7
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,999
Okay.

8
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,406
Now, you take care it doesn't happen to you,

9
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,502
dying alone like that, all pathetic.

10
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,343
She was such a sweet lady,
Mom, you would've liked her.

11
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,051
Where's the rosemary and the lavender?

12
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,151
Her son complained they were too pungent.

13
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,928
They told me this would be semi-private.

14
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,158
Oh, it's not that bad.

15
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,795
Anyway, sweetheart, you cannot
keep 5 cats in your apartment.

16
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,604
What man will want to come home to that?

17
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,275
I have to get to work.

18
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,742
I love you.

19
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,006
It's fine, sweetheart.

20
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,552
You get used to it.

21
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,748
A private room is very expensive.

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,916
That's no problem. I can cover it.

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,020
That's not what you told us
when your mother checked in.

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,087
Things change. I want her moved today.

25
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,501
It's sterling silver.

26
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,899
I'm really not supposed
to be doing this, but...

27
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,136
This is it?

28
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,112
I told you over the phone
not to get your hopes up.

29
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,610
But she promised me.

30
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,312
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,050
I wish things had worked out
differently for you.

32
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,149
Good luck.

33
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:58,291
You'll have a check in 3
days. Just give me a chance.

34
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,458
All right, 3 days. Now, good night.

35
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,038
This is Kate Finnoff.

36
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:20,483
I'm so sorry to bother you at
home, but about Mrs. Batchelder,

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,542
I know I had more coming to me,

38
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,954
and if I have to go to a lawyer, I will.

39
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,289
Please call me tonight.
You have my home number.

40
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,899
Cat, get back inside.

41
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,264
Kate?

42
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,807
Kate, your cats are making a break for it.

43
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,434
Kate?

44
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,704
Psst.

45
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,771
Kate?

46
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,976
Oh, my God! Kate!

47
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,501
It looks stripped.

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,803
Definitely something the building
inspector should've picked up on.

49
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,776
We figure he's got at least a
dozen landlords paying him off.

50
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,073
Nice sideline.

51
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,872
What we need to know from you

52
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,348
is did she fall because
the handrail gave way,

53
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,079
or did she slip and
then grab the handrail?

54
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,678
We'd love to hit the inspector
with a negligent homicide.

55
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,485
We'll see what we can do.

56
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,457
Well, can we make the task force's day?

57
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,793
Well, it depends on what
she tells us, right?

58
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,663
The notch on the handrail
is where she lost the tooth.

59
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,293
The fingernails on her left hand are broken,

60
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,032
probably from grabbing the railing.

61
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,504
So she was coming down the
left-hand side when she tripped.

62
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,334
Which is odd, seeing as she's right-handed.

63
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,416
The gums on her left side

64
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,149
recede more than the ones on the right.

65
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,890
People brush more vigorously on the
opposite side of their dominant hand.

66
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,223
So she would be coming down the
right side of the stairwell.

67
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,089
Unless somebody pushed her off the landing.

68
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,769
Oh, great. A cat person.

69
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,077
She just became a cat person.

70
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:05,573
This homeopathic remedy for cat allergies,

71
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,051
it's microscopic cat dander
that you put onto your tongue.

72
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,916
I had a girlfriend, Lola. She had cats.

73
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,720
You ate fur balls for her?

74
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,986
Maybe she did it for her boyfriend.

75
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,195
Birth control pills.

76
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,934
Hello? They told me you wanted to talk to me.

77
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,065
I'm Mrs. Wing, the super.

78
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,934
The young woman, Kate Finnoff.

79
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,707
Yes. Everyone in the building loved her.

80
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,544
That include a boyfriend?

81
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,811
Oh, I don't think she had one.

82
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,115
Where did the cats come from?

83
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,951
Helen Batchelder. She lived upstairs.

84
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,391
She died in a fire last month.

85
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,760
She had no family. Kate helped
her with her errands.

86
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,658
Well, Mrs. Batchelder had a nice
way of showing her gratitude.

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,167
It's engraved, "Helen".
It's a cigarette holder.

88
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:00,897
Sterling silver. It's a
Dunhill. From the '30s.

89
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,966
Something wrong, Mrs. Wing?

90
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,705
I thought I saw that at Helen's,

91
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,475
on her coffee table, the night she died.

92
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,578
Was there a table lighter with it?

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,278
They usually came that way.

94
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,514
I think so.

95
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,456
Was Kate in her apartment that night?

96
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,923
Getting the cats.

97
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,019
But I can't imagine she would just take it.

98
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,495
It's not like her.

99
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,696
Seems there were other things she was
doing that were out of character.

100
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:33,835
Credit card bills. Her past
balances were under a thousand.

101
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,839
Then last month, she maxed out.

102
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,977
$2,000 in linens, flowers every day,

103
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,440
$1,600 at Lorelei's. High-end nightgowns.

104
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,080
Mrs. Wing,

105
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,583
does Kate have a friend
or a relative in the hospital?

106
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,755
I've been here 3 months.

107
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,757
She always tried to make it like home.

108
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,294
Poor, sweet Katie.

109
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,234
The other ladies, have they
been here longer than you?

110
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,207
- Them?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,611
Rookies.

112
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,213
I was just looking at your plants.

113
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,251
They'd be better off in the sun.

114
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,120
You know, since you have seniority here,

115
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,625
why didn't you take the bed
nearest the window?

116
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,888
I did.

117
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,525
But they moved me to a
private room last month.

118
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,864
Katie made a special
arrangement with the hospice.

119
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,396
But then they put you back in here.

120
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,569
I mean, did something happen
with the arrangement?

121
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,105
Katie said there was a mix-up.

122
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,714
Sounds like this girl's heart
was bigger than her pocketbook.

123
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,720
All right, thank you.

124
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,347
Well, her pocketbook wasn't
doing so bad last Christmas.

125
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,291
Her bank said that she cashed
a $10,000 bearer bond.

126
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,623
A bearer bond?

127
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:08,027
12%, probably issued in the late '70s.

128
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,158
Maybe a relative?

129
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,860
Her mother would have said something.

130
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,803
Or the old lady with the
cats. Kate helped her.

131
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,840
She could have given it to her
as a Christmas gift.

132
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,398
Bonds are a little like potato chips.

133
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,570
People don't usually buy just one.

134
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,011
This old lady could've been
sitting on a stack of them.

135
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,276
If Kate knew that,

136
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,615
she might've thought she'd inherit
some cash to go with the cats.

137
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,383
God knows she needed the money.

138
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,891
This old lady, she died in a fire?

139
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,820
An electrical fire.

140
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,632
It's a statutory waiting period

141
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,699
to make sure all her
outstanding debts are settled.

142
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,598
- Now, if she'd had a will...
- But 6 weeks, man.

143
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,235
I mean, this junk, I could care less,

144
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,378
but the money, see, I could use the money now.

145
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,780
Look, Craig,

146
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,083
I'm really not supposed
to be doing this, but...

147
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,850
But what?

148
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,797
The old gal peed herself during the night.

149
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,201
Shorted out the electric blanket.

150
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,901
Did you find protective undergarments
or a plastic mattress cover?

151
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,035
No. Some people forget, or they're careless.

152
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:34,479
Well, look, these photos...
I see grab bars in her shower.

153
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,382
She's got 4 locks on her front door,

154
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,389
a flashlight on her nightstand.

155
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,320
This woman wasn't careless.

156
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,286
All I know is that her bed
was drenched with urine.

157
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,920
Sure smells like it. Did you check the urine?

158
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,688
Check it for what?

159
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,627
Testosterone?

160
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,694
Testosterone levels are higher in women
who take the pill. Women like Kate.

161
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,502
God, I hope she's wrong.

162
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,844
Using urine to cover up
an arson. That's depraved.

163
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,681
Yeah, but maybe worth the trouble.

164
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,078
Mrs. Batchelder's bank sent over her records.

165
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,985
She only had $33,000 in the bank,

166
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,650
but in 1978,

167
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,724
she used her husband's life insurance pay-out

168
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,494
to buy $150,000 worth of bearer bonds.

169
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,068
12% interest over 25 years, compounded,

170
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,800
that's over two and a half million dollars.

171
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,575
The lab found testosterone,
all right. Lots of it.

172
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,168
The urine's from a male.

173
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,975
Ms. Finnoff has an accomplice.

174
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:40,745
Oh, I need the white pages for Ossining.

175
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,286
There's a notation in Mrs.
Batchelder's bank file.

176
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,958
Two days after she died,

177
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:53,697
they got a balance inquiry
from a bank in Ossining.

178
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,928
Here. Batchelder, Craig M.

179
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,700
The super said Mrs. Batchelder
had no other family.

180
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,502
But this guy crawled out of the woodwork

181
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,101
two days after she died. What a coincidence.

182
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,684
Listen, I was just, you know, I was
just doing some financial planning.

183
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,411
How much you getting?

184
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,089
$33 grand.

185
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,956
And because she didn't have a
will, I gotta wait for it.

186
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,191
Lighter fluid.

187
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,697
You thinking of doing
a Jimi Hendrix on your guitar?

188
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,497
No, it's for my lighter over there.

189
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,735
That's a butane lighter.
It doesn't take lighter fluid.

190
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,172
It takes gas.

191
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,904
I'm gonna be exchanging it.

192
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,741
You were gonna exchange it.

193
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,482
All these years, you never
visited your Aunt Helen?

194
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,677
I told you, I blanked out on her.

195
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,554
Soup's burning.

196
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,919
You know what takes lighter fluid, Craig?

197
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,254
Old table lighters.

198
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,885
You don't have one of those, do you?

199
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,557
You know, like a sterling
silver table lighter?

200
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,198
Where am I gonna get one of those?

201
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,895
You have an Aunt Helen.

202
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,130
Yeah.

203
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,332
It comes in a set.

204
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,442
There's a matching cigarette holder.

205
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,172
Your aunt's name is engraved on it.

206
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,474
Well, the lighter has your uncle's
name engraved on it. Right?

207
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,076
Right. Yeah.

208
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,486
Damn it!

209
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,787
You know he told me he
wasn't gonna say anything.

210
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:30,987
Who?

211
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,358
The guy.

212
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,028
The guy from the city office.

213
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,398
The one taking care of my aunt's stuff.

214
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,497
He said he wasn't supposed to do it, but...

215
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,902
But he let you swipe it.

216
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,598
It's mine anyway.

217
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,835
You know? He said it's better I take it now.

218
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:49,141
He said things this valuable have a way
of disappearing down at city storage.

219
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,745
Yes. Yes, they do.

220
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,846
That's ridiculous.

221
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,518
If I let him take the lighter,
I deserve to be fired.

222
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,562
Mrs. Batchelder's file,

223
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,755
is it in your current basket over there?

224
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,101
You know, she always does that with me.

225
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,966
She'll say like, "Where's the sugar?",

226
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,336
instead of, you know, just, "Pass the sugar."

227
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,238
You know somebody like that?

228
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,341
Yeah.

229
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,874
Estates that don't have heirs,
what happens to them?

230
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,277
Well, after all the assets are liquidated,

231
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,251
the proceeds go into a trust account.

232
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,451
You sell off the furnishings, the
stocks, the bearer bonds, right?

233
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,116
Everything gets liquidated.

234
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,288
It says here Mrs. Batchelder had a
safety deposit box. What was in it?

235
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,693
Birth certificates.

236
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,632
Husband's death certificate. Old photos.

237
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,327
No bearer bonds?

238
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,631
No. Just old papers.

239
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,640
No, I just... The reason why I keep
harping on the bearer bonds...

240
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,698
Do you have a medical condition?

241
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,773
Because I see all these 24-hour
pharmacy phone numbers.

242
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,774
It's my dad. He has a chronic condition.

243
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,719
Diabetes, among other things.

244
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,951
He lives with me. I take care of him.

245
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,793
The bearer bonds.

246
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,620
We think that Mrs. Batchelder gave one
to a young woman in her building.

247
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,001
A Kate Finnoff.

248
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,695
There might be others floating around.

249
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,932
Not that I found.

250
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,237
Ms. Finnoff had something
else of Mrs. Batchelder's.

251
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,911
A cigarette holder.

252
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,710
It's a set, probably a wedding present.

253
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,449
We can't figure out how
Ms. Finnoff came to have it.

254
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,077
Maybe the old lady gave it to her.

255
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,123
Why, and split them up? No.

256
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:46,361
Anyway, we'd like to go over and
look at Mrs. Batchelder's locker.

257
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,996
You know, try our luck
with those bearer bonds.

258
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,592
Well, I can't go with you today,

259
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,159
but I can arrange a time for you both...

260
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,001
We can go today.

261
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,098
We'll let you know what turns up.

262
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,403
This stuff is great.

263
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,639
If Mrs. Batchelder had
any idea it would end up

264
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,275
in her nephew's head-banger paradise,
she might've made out a will.

265
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,709
You know, maybe she did.

266
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,652
This is a family Bible.

267
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,986
It's got baptisms, marriages, deaths,

268
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,488
through 8 generations.

269
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,594
And she kept it up to date.

270
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,563
Something that she planned to pass on?

271
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,535
Even to a head-banging nephew.

272
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,963
Certificates of appreciation from
Bide-A-Wee, the animal charity.

273
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,543
A cat lover like her would
have left them something.

274
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,947
She would have had a will.

275
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,710
Yes, she would've.

276
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,480
She might have had a lawyer prepare it.

277
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,386
Maybe the same lawyer who took
care of her husband's estate

278
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,924
25 years ago.

279
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,162
All these lockers,

280
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,959
they're filled with the belongings

281
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,728
of people who died without a will?

282
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,265
Yes, sir. They're tied up in
here until they get settled.

283
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,638
Hey, Dad.

284
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,549
What game is that? That Broadway Joe?

285
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,759
They want me there an hour early tomorrow.

286
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,960
They change the appointment?

287
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,963
Well, I didn't change it.

288
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,599
I'm not in control of these things, Roger.

289
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,932
You always assume I'm the one
making things difficult.

290
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,802
Okay, I'll work through lunch, leave early.

291
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,071
Just meet me at the curb.

292
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,805
Roger, I have a bad hip.

293
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,709
I cannot wait at the curb
in the dead of winter.

294
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,416
Maybe it's more convenient if I
took the bus over the bridge.

295
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,750
Is that what you want, Roger? Me on a bus?

296
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,117
What?

297
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,263
Roger, is that what you want me to do?

298
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,934
No, no.

299
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,705
I'll pick you up,

300
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,208
and I'll come upstairs and get you.

301
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,592
It's Roger, and call me back.

302
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,860
I need to clear out my inventory.

303
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,604
I tracked down Mrs. Batchelder's
late lawyer's secretary.

304
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,574
She remembers her having a will.

305
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,669
She remembers it was filed with
the court after the lawyer died.

306
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,580
And she remembers the old lady had a
stack of bearer bonds an inch thick.

307
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,448
If the will was filed with the
court, there'd be a record, no?

308
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,681
No. Coffman had access to those records,

309
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,916
and he has access to a delete key.

310
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,284
And when people die without a will,

311
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,262
he becomes lord and master of their estate.

312
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,899
And then he robs their graves.

313
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,625
Graves he dug.

314
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,272
I can't talk right now.
I'm in the middle of overtime.

315
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,071
At 2:00 in the afternoon?

316
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,405
Where are they playing, Tokyo?

317
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,810
Did I just hear them call
Johnny Unitas' number?

318
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,848
Yeah, that's the '58 championships...

319
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:29,250
Yeah, I know. Sudden death
overtime. My dad was at this game.

320
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,686
You don't mind if I have a look, do you?

321
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,155
You just move in, Mr. Coffman?

322
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:37,453
No, 5 years ago. After my wife passed.

323
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,398
It's a good son you have there,
letting you move in with him.

324
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,492
I don't know how good. He
stuck you in the dining room.

325
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,327
Well, that's because he was
still with Angie then.

326
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,633
His ex-wife.

327
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,368
The Princess.

328
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,376
No, my son takes good care of me.

329
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,571
I bet you don't catch him here much.

330
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,011
He knows he can't leave me here alone.

331
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,242
Not with my health. Diabetes. My kidneys.

332
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,818
He stays with me.

333
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,822
Come on, Mr. Coffman, he's a single guy.

334
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,917
I bet on weekends he has a little,
you know, love shack in the country.

335
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,984
He has plenty of time for that after I'm gone.

336
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,553
I think he's making time for it now.

337
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,500
Isn't that why he has a lock on the door
here so you don't, you know, walk in on him?

338
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,264
You know, you're awfully snoopy.

339
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,999
A lot of people point that out.

340
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,369
This isn't locked.

341
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,669
Of course it is. It's always locked.

342
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,710
No, no, no, look at the deadbolt.

343
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,871
You can see the light coming through.

344
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,643
Here, go ahead, look. Look, try. See?

345
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,718
Look, I bet all this time

346
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,313
you were dying to just have a
little peep in this room here.

347
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,651
I don't care what he has in here.

348
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:45,125
You see, this one here, I can't
tell if it's locked or not.

349
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,291
Now, you can't go in there.

350
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,094
It's just clothes.

351
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,269
There's dust on the floor
where boxes used to be.

352
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,145
Big boxes.

353
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,810
Your son move them recently?

354
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,854
To a storage facility or somewhere else?

355
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,548
No, there's no storage.

356
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,847
I didn't see him move any boxes.

357
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,157
Wait a minute, what is that?

358
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,601
It's a side view mirror from a model car.

359
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,036
Roger have kids?

360
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,298
No.

361
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,566
He did build models when he was a little boy.

362
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,202
Used to spend all of his paper
route money on them. Big waste.

363
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,677
I gotta get a glass of
juice. Let's go. Come on.

364
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,688
You do dialysis, right, for your diabetes?

365
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,453
Go to the hospital for that?

366
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,829
4 times a week. Over in Queens.

367
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,099
They hook you up for
what, like 3 hours or so?

368
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:03,572
What does Roger do during that
time? Does he sit with you?

369
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,302
No, I don't expect that.

370
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,605
He goes to dinner close by the hospital.

371
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,577
Buys me lottery tickets.

372
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:15,109
You mean like these here? Lucky Kim's Grocery.

373
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,483
I feel lucky already.

374
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,854
Yeah, I've seen him before.

375
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,951
He comes in a few times a week to buy tickets.

376
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,086
But he never wins.

377
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,188
Figures. Why does he keep coming back?

378
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,891
Does he have a place around here?

379
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,833
He says he's got a sick
relative over at the hospital.

380
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,269
Does he ever buy anything else but tickets?

381
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,535
Sandwiches, fruit. Last
month he bought light bulbs.

382
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,308
What kind of light bulbs?

383
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,673
Floodlights.

384
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,705
Floodlights.

385
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,686
Is there a storage place
nearby here somewhere?

386
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,484
Like mini storage? No.

387
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,617
But one street over there's
a guy that rents out space.

388
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,666
Not sure what he kept in here.

389
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,665
Just that he cleared out last week.

390
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,875
Motion sensors. Cameras.

391
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,609
Probably on the web as well so he
can watch things on his computer.

392
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,844
It's all disconnected now.

393
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,109
Shammy cloth.

394
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,387
Meguiars Wax. The good stuff.

395
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,685
My dad used to use it on his Cutlass.

396
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,760
6 sets of tire treads. 6 cars parked here.

397
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,172
The design of this tread,

398
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:53,274
It's simple. Like an old tire.

399
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,615
Paint flakes.

400
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,493
There's some more over there
near the front of the car.

401
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,586
Looks like all the cars had them.

402
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,494
And they're all clean underneath.

403
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,740
The oil drip.

404
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,472
There's...

405
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,776
There's one spot under each car.

406
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,918
These cars were never moved.

407
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,157
He just...

408
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,288
He just... He just sat in them,

409
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,090
turned the wheel.

410
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,125
Like some kid.

411
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,410
What was the wheelbase on this one?

412
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,276
108 inches.

413
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,044
Ford Shelby GT500,

414
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,283
'67 for sure.

415
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,878
The guy's using original stock tires.

416
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,855
I don't see any wear on them.

417
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,687
Detective Alex.

418
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,591
Down, boy.

419
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,821
Lewis, thank you, man.

420
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,921
- Sure, Bobby.
- You helped.

421
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,631
Goodbye, Detective.

422
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,126
Look at this.

423
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,441
Okay, this is a '57 Bel Air, '66 Stingray,

424
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,503
'64 Carrera, '68 Camaro

425
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,449
and a '65 XKE, and a '67 Shelby.

426
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,379
and they're all in mint condition,

427
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,247
all with the original equipment.

428
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:46,427
Over $1,000,000 of automotive masterpieces.

429
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,759
All this for a hobby?

430
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,962
Not just a hobby. A lifelong obsession.

431
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,733
Here, this is a side view mirror

432
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,298
from a model car which
matches the '57 Bel Air.

433
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,901
When he was a boy,

434
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,440
he made models of these cars.

435
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,311
But now he's killing for the real ones?

436
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,875
Maybe not. The ME reviewed all the deaths.

437
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,251
Natural causes. No foul play.

438
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,186
Except Mrs. Batchelder.

439
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:20,094
Yes. And unlike her, none
of the others had wills.

440
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,868
So Roger has a pattern.

441
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,606
He waits for people to die without wills,

442
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,131
with a modest estate, and
then he plunders them.

443
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,638
He does this over and over, doing
nothing to attract attention.

444
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,375
Until Mrs. Batchelder.

445
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,444
She's the only one with the will.

446
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,719
She's the only one that he killed.

447
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,587
The only one with millions.

448
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,520
Yeah. It must have been something urgent

449
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,058
that he needed it for.

450
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:57,760
He searched the records of wills
that are filed with the court,

451
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,063
he found her.

452
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,799
But, you know, she's got money,
she's old, she's alone.

453
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,000
The analysis on the orange paint flakes,

454
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,169
it's the same paint the city uses.

455
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,181
Of course it is.

456
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,317
Here's the cashier's check.
He made it out like you said.

457
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,052
So, kiss them goodbye.

458
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,938
Rog, the keys.

459
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,605
Okay, let's move them out.

460
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,004
He buys a pair at a time. As Christmas gifts.

461
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,339
He says people really appreciate them.

462
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,942
The Denver boot.

463
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,172
Nobody's gonna steal your car,

464
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,875
you got a couple of these
babies clamped on the wheels.

465
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,280
How does our guy pay?

466
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,183
Cash. He's bought 7 pairs.

467
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,149
7? When did he buy the last one?

468
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,116
A couple of weeks ago.

469
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,825
7 pairs for 6 cars. He's getting another car.

470
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,057
A two and a half million dollar car.

471
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,265
That's why he went after Mrs. Batchelder.

472
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,926
His need isn't just urgent, it's pathological.

473
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,971
We checked the auction circuit.

474
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,805
No car sold for over a million
in the last 6 months.

475
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,936
Ditto for private sales of antique cars.

476
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,309
A $2,500,000 car.

477
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,349
That's a big jump for Mr. Coffman.

478
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,578
Well, the car probably has a
special significance for him,

479
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,620
a token of achievement or self-worth.

480
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,658
Which is why he won't run
until it's delivered.

481
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:06,453
Public Administrator's office uses
shippers to send stuff out of state...

482
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,897
So he might use an existing
account to hide his car shipment.

483
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,697
All legitimate invoices would
be for outbound shipments,

484
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:16,399
so any inbound shipments,
that would be suspicious.

485
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,407
Like this one. It's a container.

486
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:22,001
Arriving at the Port of New Jersey.
It doesn't say what's inside.

487
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:12,960
Roger!

488
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,193
Wow!

489
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:21,603
It's a Ferrari. This is a 1962 Ferrari GTO.

490
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,833
This is incredible. What, they made only...

491
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,569
What, they made, like, 32 of these, right?

492
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:30,444
What, the leather. You
could smell that leather.

493
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,977
Have you ever sat in one of these?

494
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:40,247
No? I haven't, either. I think
I need to get inside.

495
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,182
I think I need to get inside.

496
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,022
- You can't!
- Yes, he can.

497
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,358
Baby, baby, baby.

498
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,561
I wish I could tell you how this feels.

499
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,226
I can't do it in mixed
company, but I wish I could.

500
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,464
Roger, you're under arrest for murder.

501
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,965
You have no idea.

502
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,140
You son of a bitch.

503
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,642
You have no idea.

504
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,941
Get out of my car.

505
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,743
Get out of my car!

506
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,095
You have to come out, now.

507
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,568
We have the urinalysis of the blanket.

508
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,936
We have his name on the rental
lease. We have the Ferrari.

509
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:36,042
And once the accountants untangle
your client's financial Gordian knot,

510
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,603
we will have everything.

511
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,410
I don't know who this guy Gordon is,

512
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,473
but let me cut through the crap.

513
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,447
My client was in Surrogate's
Court filing papers

514
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,954
when Ms. Finnoff was killed.

515
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,287
And this urinalysis, where's the Lipitor?

516
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,725
My client takes Lipitor for his cholesterol.

517
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,625
If it was his piss on that blanket,

518
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,823
it would have shown up on the test.

519
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,030
Well, there's still that little wet dream

520
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,899
that he took delivery of this morning.

521
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,967
A stolen car shipped from Marseilles?

522
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,666
That would be under the jurisdiction

523
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,768
of our good buddies, the French.

524
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,613
As for this jurisdiction, he might
be guilty of receiving stolen goods.

525
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,549
Just point him to a judge,
and he'll post bail.

526
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,990
The smell of Italian leather.

527
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:29,823
It's intoxicating. Have a smell, Roger?

528
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,046
My assistant checked
with the Surrogate's Court.

529
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:47,784
The time stamps on the
papers Mr. Coffman filed

530
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:51,753
provide enough of an alibi to
impress an arraignment judge.

531
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,152
We found the Ferrari.

532
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:57,785
Receiving stolen property.
He'd make bail and vanish.

533
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,386
No, I mean we found this Ferrari.

534
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,065
These are the boxes from his warehouse?

535
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,367
Anything of evidentiary value?

536
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,065
He only kept things that had value to him.

537
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,242
- It's a Chevy Bel Air.
- Whoa!

538
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,780
It's the one missing the side view mirror.

539
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,119
The Stingray.

540
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,152
Whoa.

541
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,848
XKE.

542
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,120
Now, this is a car!

543
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,788
And the Shelby.

544
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,257
The detail is remarkable.

545
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,402
There's no Ferrari, though.

546
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,269
You two having a play date?

547
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,542
The lab re-did the urinalysis.
No trace of Lipitor.

548
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,341
And Roger's doctor confirmed
he takes the stuff.

549
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,761
There's one more playmate that we forgot.

550
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,964
Right in here.

551
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,803
All right, not so fast. I'm
72 years old. I've got a bad hip.

552
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,172
What is he doing here?

553
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:21,575
He's here to help you, Roger.

554
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,738
I've gotta get you out of this jam.

555
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,342
Is there at least a chair here?

556
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,111
Right here, Mr. Coffman.

557
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,719
Here we go.

558
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,723
We believe Roger embezzled nearly $5,000,000

559
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,385
from the estates of dead people.

560
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,656
That's not true, Dad.

561
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,460
We believe he used the money to
buy vintage cars like these.

562
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,331
We're not saying that he killed these people.

563
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,063
They died on their own. Well, most of them.

564
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:53,967
But a few months ago he learned
that a car came on the market.

565
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:59,072
A car that he desired more than anything.

566
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,875
He needed a lot of money to buy that car,

567
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,581
and he found it in the
estate of a lonely old lady.

568
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,885
Except this old lady was still alive.

569
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:12,395
So your Roger set her on fire
in the middle of the night.

570
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,421
And when her young friend raised
a stink, he killed her, too.

571
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:20,698
My son's not a killer!
Come on, for just a car.

572
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,568
Well, if they were only

573
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,338
just cars.

574
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,808
You know, Mr. Carver and I, we were admiring

575
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:37,547
your workmanship and your detailing.

576
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,886
Especially the undercarriage.

577
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,293
How did you get this effect here?

578
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,523
I weathered it using Rustall,

579
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,624
baking soda and some white glue.

580
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,529
It's great work. And the tire stems?

581
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,904
Oh, I made a hole, using a .019 drill bit

582
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:00,136
and a piece of black wire.

583
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,245
And you said he was wasting his time.

584
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,339
Why did you stop model building?
Why would you stop that?

585
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,247
I got other interests.

586
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,488
That was around your...

587
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,523
Your 12th birthday, wasn't it?

588
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,691
All these dates on here are the same.

589
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,253
February 19th, 1969.

590
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,124
That's a couple of days after your birthday.

591
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:31,069
That's when you put all these away.

592
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:34,738
I really don't remember.

593
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:40,548
Well, I guess it just
slipped out of your memory.

594
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,514
There's one missing.

595
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:47,387
You know, the Ferrari. It's not in here.

596
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:51,125
No. I never had that one.

597
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,665
What about this one? You never had this one?

598
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,668
You had this one, right?

599
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,466
What, did you buy it
with your paper route money?

600
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,097
I got that for him on his birthday.

601
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,006
I bet he bugged you for months
for this model Ferrari.

602
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,169
Oh, yeah.

603
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,770
Had his little 12-year-old heart set on it.

604
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:17,482
This one came painted already
with the decals already on it.

605
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,790
Now, these here, how many pieces for each?

606
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,451
50? 100?

607
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,223
110.

608
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:31,094
The more pieces, the more
intricate, the better it is.

609
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:33,432
Right? I mean, that's the whole point.

610
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,535
This one only has 10 pieces.

611
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,636
See here, it says, "Snaps together
in 10 minutes. No glue required."

612
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:45,037
But, I mean, it's a birthday
gift, you know, from your Dad.

613
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,844
Still, I mean, slather on all the
Rustall and baking soda you want,

614
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,719
it's still kind of a cheap knock-off.

615
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,049
This is the only model of this car they had.

616
00:36:57,115 --> 00:37:00,790
No. No, no, no. That's not true.

617
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,989
That's not true, is it, Roger?

618
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,763
I mean, there were better models.

619
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,965
Right?

620
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,867
There were better models.

621
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:16,304
He was just too preoccupied to find one.

622
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,810
Too busy and preoccupied with his own life

623
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,714
to realize that it would
make a difference to you.

624
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,014
He probably picked this up, what, like,

625
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,784
last minute on the way home from work.

626
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,121
That hurt bad, huh?

627
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,086
To realize that you're...

628
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:39,165
you're just an afterthought
in your father's life.

629
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,130
Sucked the fun right out of making models.

630
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,835
That's when you put these away,

631
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,140
and you moved on with your life.

632
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:57,314
Huh? You got married. You
put all this stuff in the past.

633
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,255
Until your Dad came and moved
in with you and your wife.

634
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,724
The Princess. That's what he called her.

635
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,763
- Oh, but I didn't mean it in a...
- How could you?

636
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,457
It was her idea to take you in.

637
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,626
And then he drove her away.

638
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,962
Then what was left? Hmm?

639
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,130
Just the two of you.

640
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,104
You and him.

641
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,848
And that's when, what?

642
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:33,580
And that's when the clock
just rolled back to 1969.

643
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,426
And you were that disappointed child again.

644
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:41,430
That little 12-year-old with
the big hole in his heart.

645
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,230
And you needed to fill it.

646
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,430
But not with plastic cars, with real cars.

647
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:52,066
So, what you did is you stuffed
all of your resentment

648
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,408
and all of your hatred into that one task.

649
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:57,571
No, no.

650
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,548
It's not true. My son does not hate me.

651
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,851
He doesn't hate you? He
implicated you in a murder.

652
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,681
What?

653
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,225
You wear a catheter, Mr. Coffman, with a bag?

654
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,658
Yeah, so I'm a sick man.

655
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,788
Well, thanks to your son's
helpful suggestion,

656
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:18,300
we took another look at the urine used
in the murder of Mrs. Batchelder.

657
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,802
We didn't find his anti-cholesterol medicine,

658
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,965
but we found high levels
of protein and bacteria.

659
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,669
Protein because diabetics dump
protein into their urine,

660
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,769
while the bacteria's from the catheter.

661
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,111
Yeah, you see, that's
another thing we believe, Stan.

662
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,515
That you supplied the urine
used to kill Mrs. Batchelder.

663
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:40,112
You ungrateful little punk.
You mixed me up into this?

664
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:43,250
You don't know what you're talking
about. He's just a senile old man.

665
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,658
Senile? You, stealing from a poor girl

666
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,994
who only wanted to take
care of her sick mother!

667
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:53,458
You talked to her? Kate Finnoff?

668
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,040
How else would you know about her mother?

669
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,541
The hospice called Kate,

670
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,311
told her they were moving her
mother out of a private room.

671
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:13,015
Kate was desperate for
money, so she called you.

672
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,082
No.

673
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,616
She tried you at your office,
but you were out all day.

674
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:21,593
But you're in the phone book,
so she tried you at home,

675
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,793
and you were there, 'cause
you're... you're always there.

676
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,568
You talked to her a little bit, huh?

677
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,163
She told you just enough so you'd
know what Roger had been up to.

678
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:36,267
And then you panicked. You
panicked about Roger going to jail.

679
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,674
But you panicked for yourself.

680
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,047
You panicked about your own life.

681
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,054
What's going to happen to me?
Who's gonna take care of me?

682
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,249
- I don't want to be alone.
- I did no such thing.

683
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,691
And so you dragged yourself
over to Kate's apartment.

684
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,160
You talked to her just a little bit more.

685
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,561
How'd you get her into the stairwell?

686
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,622
Did you tell her you needed help?

687
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,001
Did you tell her that you had a bad hip?

688
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,561
And then you shoved her.

689
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,575
I don't have to listen to any
more of this. I'm going home.

690
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,668
We can prove it, Stan.

691
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,338
See how you have your hand on the wall there,

692
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,212
to steady yourself.

693
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,420
We will find your prints in her building.

694
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,215
I'm a sick man. I'm going home.

695
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,691
Do you believe this guy, Roger?

696
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,955
He's taken everything away from you.

697
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,089
First it was the model cars.

698
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,965
And then your wife, who loved you.

699
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:37,831
He's taken everything that ever
mattered to you away from you.

700
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,638
And just when you had it
right in front of you.

701
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,376
Well, if he hadn't killed Kate Finnoff,

702
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,813
we might not have gotten on to you.

703
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:56,081
You'd be riding this Ferrari
right out into the sunset.

704
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,094
Instead of a prison bus into a hellhole.

705
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,829
You stupid old man.

706
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:08,395
You stupid, stupid selfish old man.

707
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,673
You wrecked everything.

708
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,007
My marriage, my birthday.

709
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,337
You always wreck everything!

710
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:20,474
Wreck what? I gave you what you wanted.

711
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,449
How do you know what I wanted?

712
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,943
I never mattered to you.

713
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,221
Never!

714
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,127
Get away from me! Get away from me!

715
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,392
You never cared! You never, ever cared!

716
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:38,934
What about me, huh? What about me?

717
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,799
When do I get a little consideration?

718
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,930
Right now, Mr. Coffman, you
are under arrest for murder.

719
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,870
What?

720
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:52,145
Look what you've done to me. You dumb punk!

721
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:54,205
You see? You see what he's like?

722
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,945
- Yes.
- You see?
- Yes, I see.

723
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,324
What did Clarence Darrow say?

724
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:11,458
"The first half of our lives
are ruined by our parents,

725
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,627
"the second half by our children."

726
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,331
Only if you let them.
