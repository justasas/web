called one of the officers

keep records of folks like that?

175
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,119
She put change in her purse.

176

Was she holding her purse? Did
she have it on her shoulder?

177
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,288
On her shoulder. Here.

178
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,460
So she would have turned this
way to put her change away.

179

00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,715
Yes. She run across the street.

184
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,681
She was sure it was the right guy?
She got a good look at him?

185
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,585
Full face, not in profile?

186
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,420
He wasn't just walking by.

187
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,275
No, he came out of the doorway.

188
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,080
The windows, the second floor.

189
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,512
SUPERINTENDENT: The old man
move in 3 weeks ago.

190
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,525
Looks like this old man already moved out.

191
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,651
He sign a lease?

192
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,887
No, no lease.

193
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,952
He paid cash. Two months in advance.

194
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,396
He ever have visitors?

195
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,490
Good-looking young guy. Chinese.

196
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,331
Sometimes he's with a white guy,

197
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,166
not so good-looking.

198
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,804
That's all I know.

199
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,171
EAMES: How about yesterday afternoon, 3:00?

200
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,039
Yeah, they both here.

201
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,572
Eames.

202
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,082
Aha. Illegal baking.

203
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,543
Baking documents.

204
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,119
The old man's a forger.

205
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,688
Forging what? Passports?

206
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,917
Something worth more than passports.

207
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,365
Something worth a life.

208
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,704
DEAKINS: This good-looking
guy killed Ms. Littleton

209
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,241
because he was worried about
getting hooked up to fake ID's?

210
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,073
He was probably worried about
another kind of document.

211
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,379
Now, what am I looking at?
A Chinese jigsaw puzzle?

212
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,749
The lab says it's standard 30
weight, good quality rag paper.

213
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,680
But it's been aged.

214
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,383
Soaked in tea and mineral oil and then baked.

215
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,153
This bit of red is wax.

216
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,888
Probably to imitate an official seal or stamp.

217
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,987
But that's not the most interesting part.

218
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,226
This type of calligraphy,
the elongated character,

219
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,098
the sharp brush strokes,

220
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,161
is in the Imperial style of early
Qing Dynasty, 18th century.

221
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,106
It evolved from the "thin gold" calligraphy

222
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,336
developed by the Emperor Huizong.

223
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,811
He got that off his box
of Wheaties this morning.

224
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,479
Actually, the curator of the
Chinese galleries at the Met.

225
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,143
I faxed him a copy of it.

226
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,379
This curator have an idea
who might've written this?

227
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,858
Calligraphy is one of the great
achievement of the Chinese people.

228
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,522
But our children

229
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,925
do not study it.

230
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,161
They told us at the Met

231
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,830
you were the best practitioner
of it on the East Coast.

232
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,236
Thank you.

233
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,108
GOREN: Is this really that hard to do?

234
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,576
Because it doesn't look that hard.

235
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,739
Do you think that I could

236
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,146
(Hsu laughing)
pick it up?

237
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,946
If you study hard, sure.

238
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,782
Which is the easiest style?

239
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,378
Is it this one?

240
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,582
That's Han Confucian form of style.
Very old. Not so easy.

241
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,389
I like this.

242
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,225
Do a lot of people write in this style?

243
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,765
Yeah, the Flowing Grass style.

244
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,165
I know maybe 10 people who are very good.

245
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,570
And this one?

246
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,101
How many people here have mastered this one?

247
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:56,136
Not many. The Imperial Classic style.
The most difficult.

248
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,213
But you've mastered it?

249
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,374
Yes.

250
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,614
And you know everyone that has.

251
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,514
For example,

252
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,793
do you know what person did this?

253
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,167
I don't know who did it.

254
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,769
Maybe it's the same person
who did this scroll.

255
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,238
No. I did this.

256
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:28,234
Every stroke has the
personality of the writer.

257
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,113
His energy and vitality.

258
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,582
An expert could compare the two

259
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,823
and find that they were done
by the same person.

260
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,416
And that expert

261
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,193
could trace the writing

262
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,763
to the brush that you used.

263
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,964
We need to know who hired
you to do this, Mr. Hsu.

264
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,711
I don't know his name.

265
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,373
But he know my nephew's name in Ningpo.

266
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,272
I can't say no.

267
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,817
This man is PLA.

268
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,684
What did he have you write?

269
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,686
"The Court of Emperor Qianlong

270
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:24,062
"welcomes esteemed guest Lord Pembridge

271
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,896
"and request that he accept this gift

272
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,504
"from the Imperial Bronze Collection."

273
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,574
Did he say what it was for?

274
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,774
No explanation.

275
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,611
Just write and take it
to the Hotel St. Francis

276
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,278
and leave it at the desk for room 516.

277
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,054
Room 516? That would be Mr. Pembridge's room.

278
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,250
Mr. Pembridge?

279
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,317
Actually, he calls himself
the Fifth Lord Pembridge.

280
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,095
Would he be in his room?

281
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,789
I just saw him a couple of minutes ago

282
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,423
heading for the sundry store.

283
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,764
He has an ascot. You can't miss him.

284
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,178
Lord Pembridge?

285
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,475
Could we speak to you for a minute?

286
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,747
Well...

287
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,110
Dear, I don't know what for.

288
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,623
It's about some packages
that were delivered to you.

289
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,853
Packages? I wouldn't know
anything about packages.

290
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,558
Where are you from, Lord Pembridge?

291
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,292
From? Ah, my family's estate

292
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,561
is just outside a little town called Leeds.

293
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,494
A little town called Leeds?

294
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,504
And what's the purpose of your visit here?

295
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,597
- Pleasure. And friends.
- What friends?

296
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,642
Oh, well, I just had a dinner
from Mick and the boys.

297
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,177
Sent them off on their world tour.

298
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,837
And then I saw Gwynnie and Hugh.

299
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,938
Lovely people, just lovely.

300
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,677
Cut it out.

301
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,810
Isn't that the worst English
accent you've ever heard?

302
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,356
Next to the Irish Spring guy,
it's the worst accent, period.

303
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,446
I beg your pardon.

304
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,050
The mishmash of Cockney, Welsh.

305
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,623
But miraculously, I think I heard
a shred of the north of England

306
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,823
in one of your "R's."

307
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,026
There are so many sounds in
there, how can you tell?

308
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,762
Really, you are absurd.

309
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,138
I don't think he's trained.

310
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,470
Well, of course I'm trained.
With Strasberg himself.

311
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,942
I suppose you went to Yale.
Now, are we gonna play this or what?

312
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,945
No, we're gonna play this.

313
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,243
Is that a real gun?

314
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,512
Oh, my God, you're really cops, aren't you?

315
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,278
"George Weems."

316
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,023
What it says here on your SAG card.

317
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,725
You look familiar.

318
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:33,196
My last gig. I was the plump and happy
raisin in a snack food commercial.

319
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,291
Am I in trouble?

320
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,697
You tell us.

321
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,359
You checked into a hotel
under an assumed name.

322
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,769
Forged papers were delivered to your room.

323
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,297
An associate of yours is
suspected of murdering a woman.

324
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,243
You don't look so plump and happy now, George.

325
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,442
No, I didn't know anything
about a murder. I...

326
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,711
I was just hired to play a part, that's all.

327
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,081
Hired by whom?

328
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,644
I don't know. I never met
the guy. He called me.

329
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,817
He said his name was Jean.

330
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,416
That he saw me in this
Gilbert and Sullivan thing,

331
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,189
and that he wanted me to play some
Brit Eurotrash, Lord Pembridge.

332
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,924
For what? A movie?

333
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,865
Performance art. Improvisational.

334
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,226
Who were the other actors?

335
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,167
I don't know. I was meeting them today.

336
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,102
Where was this performance to take place?

337
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,299
In real settings.

338
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,205
They were picking me up
and driving out to JFK,

339
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,504
and it was gonna go from there.

340
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,772
Jean said they had a room
for me at the St. Francis.

341
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,973
That if anybody asked,
I was Lord Pembridge.

342
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,941
And you thought that we were
part of the performance.

343
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,144
Yes.

344
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,515
It never occurred to you that
something illegal was afoot?

345
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,393
I'm an actor. I'm constantly broke.

346
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,159
It was a couple of nights at the St.
Francis. It sounded like fun.

347
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,158
Fantastic.

348
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,728
What was the scene at JFK?

349
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,407
Lord Pembridge picks up a piece
of art from the cargo department.

350
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,842
A family heirloom.

351
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,878
That's it? One scene?

352
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,141
No, no, there were two scenes.

353
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,705
Lord Pembridge delivers the heirloom

354
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,546
to some posh apartment on Fifth Avenue.

355
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:05,881
WOMAN: Here it is.

356
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,549
One crate, household items.

357
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,092
Consignee, Lord Robert Pembridge.

358
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,388
He picked it up this morning.

359
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,519
This morning?

360
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,325
Yeah, this morning.

361
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,489
- Did he show ID?
- Yes.

362
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,625
And he had the waybill. It was all in order.

363
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,102
I don't need any more grief about this.

364
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,900
What other grief did you get?

365
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,575
Two guys came in a couple of hours ago.

366
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,507
I told them Pembridge already picked it up,

367
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,670
and I thought they were
gonna have a heart attack.

368
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,940
Especially that white guy.

369
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,913
- And the other guy?
- Chinese.

370
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,180
But then they said they must've gotten
their signals crossed with Lord Pembridge,

371
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,276
and they left.

372
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,352
This extra charge, what's that?

373
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,325
A re-crating charge slapped
on by the freight forwarder.

374
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,089
It says the amount was charged
to an existing account.

375
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,030
The freight forwarder can tell
you whose account that is.

376
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,361
I'm deadly serious. I need
an answer right away.

377
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,831
Someone's here. Let me get rid of them.

378
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,169
Are you Stuart Gaston?

379
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,178
(ORIENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

380
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,739
Yes. I'm sorry, I'm very busy right now.

381
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,546
Too busy for us?

382
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,314
I have a kind of a situation.
How can I help you?

383
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,880
Your account number turned up on the
waybill for a shipment from Hong Kong

384
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,448
addressed to a Lord Pembridge.

385
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,960
Oh. I don't see how that's possible.

386
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,394
I don't know any Lord Pembridge.

387
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,988
Do you have a copy of the waybill?

388
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,157
Thanks.

389
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,394
Yeah, I do have an account with this company,

390
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,267
but I certainly didn't ship
any household items.

391
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,237
They must've jumbled the numbers.

392
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,503
This must be some kind of
situation you got on your hands.

393
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,542
Why do you say that?

394
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,046
Well, you've loosened your tie,
you got a drink on your desk,

395
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,846
you got three phone lines blinking,

396
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,683
and you're chewing the inside of your
cheeks like some kind of frantic chipmunk.

397
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,020
Are you under a lot of stress?

398
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,661
You lost something.

399
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,997
No. I don't know...

400
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,766
No, I think you lost something
in transit, didn't you?

401
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,575
I'm sorry, you're wrong.

402
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,804
It's late and I need to close up.

403
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,079
Thank you for bringing that
billing mistake to my attention.

404
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,256
He smuggled that piece into the country,

405
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,348
and someone stole it right
out from under his nose.

406
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,756
Don't look so happy.

407
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,924
The obvious move is that Stuart
Gaston's Chinese partner

408
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,194
had an accomplice pick up
the package on the sly.

409
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,896
Well, that's all fine and good, but
we have no leverage against Gaston

410
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,063
to make him give up his Chinese partner.

411
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,765
No evidence he's involved in smuggling,

412
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,536
no idea even what it is he's smuggling.

413
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,474
It's a Chinese antique. A bronze.

414
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,978
- A fake?
- No.

415
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:46,538
If it were, they wouldn't go through all
this trouble to smuggle it into the country.

416
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,677
What's being faked is the
documentation, the provenance.

417
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,346
Because it's probably stolen.

418
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,548
Have you checked with Interpol?

419
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,251
They have no record of any
theft of major Chinese art.

420
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,453
That leaves one possibility.

421
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,921
That it was stolen from an
archeological dig in China.

422
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,896
A Chinese national treasure, and
Gaston found a buyer for it.

423
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,668
We find that buyer, maybe we find
evidence against Mr. Gaston.

424
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:15,074
ISABELLA: Well, I'd guess that the piece
in question dates from the Han Dynasty,

425
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,340
First century AD.

426
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,143
It's most likely a funereal piece.

427
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,547
Why would you think that?

428
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,676
Well, of all the bronzes,
it would be the most valuable.

429
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,879
Otherwise, why go to all the trouble?

430
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:28,119
No, a rare and important and legal
piece can fetch easily $1.5 million.

431
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,387
$3 million, if it's a smuggled piece.

432
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,326
But that's a risky business.

433
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,359
You know all the collectors

434
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,493
that Stuart Gaston usually deals with.

435
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,897
Which one would risk it?

436
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,101
For a special piece?

437
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,804
Most of them would take the risk,
otherwise they wouldn't be collectors.

438
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,337
How about just the ones who can afford
to lay out $3 million in cash?

439
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,814
I'd be hard pressed to say.

440
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,583
Are any of the collectors holding off?

441
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,245
- Careful.
- Oh, sorry.

442
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,280
You know, holding off making
acquisitions? Building up a cash reserve?

443
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,089
Well, I can't speak for every auction house.

444
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,457
Come on.

445
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,224
We know you compare notes.

446
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,392
Why don't we take this outside?

447
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,233
I'd be happy to get you both a cup of coffee.

448
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,704
There's a café. We could talk about it...

449
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,933
(GASPS)

450
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,777
I'll bet you this camel

451
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:25,048
that you all know who's buying and who's not.

452
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,983
You think about that.

453
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,854
I'm gonna have a look at the other,

454
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,391
you know, lovely stuff that you...

455
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,451
No, wait. You know, there is Lucille Mobray.

456
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,758
She's one of Gaston's regulars.

457
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:47,327
I haven't purchased anything recently
because I haven't seen anything worth buying.

458
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,729
This moon vase is stunning.

459
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:56,305
I've read about the Imperial
ceramic factory in Jingdezhen.

460
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,445
Was it made there?

461
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:02,213
Yes. It's from the collection
of Pere D'Entrecolles himself.

462
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,980
EAMES: I love this teapot.

463
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,490
Is it old?

464
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,782
3,000 years old.

465
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,419
EAMES: How'd you get
interested in Chinese art?

466
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,294
I lived in Shanghai when I was a girl.

467
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,558
My father worked for the National City Bank.

468
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,367
He gave me my first piece, a terracotta doll.

469
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,209
It was a magical time.

470
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,107
This collection,

471
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,146
it's your legacy.

472
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,581
Stuart Gaston help you put it together?

473
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,056
Yes. I've always relied on Stuart.

474
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,085
He made sure that each piece
had the proper provenance,

475
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,290
to show that it wasn't, you know,
smuggled out of China yesterday.

476
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,834
Of course.

477
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,907
Because owning smuggled art is a violation
of the National Stolen Property Act.

478
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,500
The Chinese could go to
court and have it seized.

479
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,544
That's perfectly true. But what
does that have to do with me?

480
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,513
It has to do with Mr. Gaston.

481
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,882
We suspect he smuggled something into
the country a couple of days ago.

482
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,946
Stuart?

483
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,422
No, I don't think he's capable
of anything like that.

484
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:16,386
No, see, he's capable of it, and a lot more.

485
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:20,020
And once we arrest him, he's liable
to make all kinds of accusations,

486
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,826
just to save his skin.

487
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,357
Someone's entire collection
could come under suspicion.

488
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,562
A whole legacy tainted.

489
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,106
I mean, no reputable dealer or auction house

490
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,142
is gonna do business with a person like that.

491
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,574
No more acquisitions.

492
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:38,547
Of course, it's possible such a
person was being duped by Mr. Gaston.

493
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,515
We are discreet with innocent victims.

494
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,585
If they behave like innocent victims.

495
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,567
Stuart told me he had an exceptional piece

496
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,533
From the Lord Pembridge estate.

497
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:05,734
He assured me the provenance
was well documented.

498
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,870
What's the piece?

499
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,075
All he told me was that it was a
bronze from an Eastern Han tomb.

500
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,950
He said that the Fifth Lord Pembridge

501
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,852
was bringing it himself from Hong Kong.

502
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,593
Gaston has a Chinese associate?

503
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,886
(LAUGHING)
You must mean Pang.

504
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,725
A very crude individual.

505
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,797
EAMES: You know where we can find him?

506
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:32,995
Yes.

507
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,269
Stuart told me where he works.

508
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,102
You'll never guess.

509
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,377
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

510
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,984
Hey! They're gonna charge you for that.

511
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,257
Bad day, Mr. Pang?

512
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,365
What a good soldier. He
knows when to surrender.

513
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,872
One down, one to go.

514
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,809
Where's this contraband my
client's accused of smuggling?

515
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,204
Is there even a photograph?

516
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:21,480
What we have is what we
found in his gallery.

517
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:29,191
Forged documents attesting to
the object's phony provenance.

518
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,261
It's just paper and ink.

519
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,659
Novelties.

520
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,823
Yeah, well, these "novelties"

521
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,262
match materials we found in an apartment

522
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,203
across the street from where
this woman was killed.

523
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,138
Killed because she recognized
your partner, Mr. Pang.

524
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,615
Also known to his admirers as the
Screaming Butcher of Tiananmen Square.

525
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,913
Oh, you didn't know that?

526
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,992
(door opens)

527
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:07,425
Oh, sorry. I didn't know you were in here.

528
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,406
Mr. Houghton,

529
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,708
say hello to your client's business partner,

530
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,706
Pang Chiangji.

531
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,982
We'll be next door.

532
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,303
My client might have a statement to make.

533
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,167
GASTON: (ON TAPE) He shot that woman.

534
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,271
She recognized him. He
went back and killed her.

535
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,476
I didn't even know that he did it until
it was in the newspaper the next day.

536
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,042
He killed her. He double-crossed me.

537
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,381
I should never have trusted him.

538
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,447
So ends another beautiful friendship.

539
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,551
This being the land of
second chances, Mr. Pang,

540
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,063
you do get to tell your side of the story.

541
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,871
My friend, an officer in the PLA,

542
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,834
he wrote to me.

543
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,777
He works on an excavation in the Gobi Desert.

544
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,080
He said if we can get a piece out,

545
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,513
people pay millions for it here.

546
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,720
Two years it took us to get it out.

547
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,419
I'm dishwasher here.

548
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,790
Gaston the pig takes my future,

549
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,727
and now I have nothing.

550
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,129
I go back to China, they kill me.

551
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,265
What do I have here?

552
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,868
PANG: (ON TAPE) I did not shoot this woman.

553
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,170
She recognized me. So, so what?

554
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,768
I told him nobody cares,

555
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,012
but he wanted me to do something.

556
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,175
So I left. I went home.

557
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,775
But I didn't...

558
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,916
He's like a crocodile,

559
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,480
lying in the water pretending
he's a big lump of nothing.

560
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,524
But then he shoots this woman in the back.

561
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,926
He steals from me. It's all lies.

562
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,390
I didn't shoot that woman.

563
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,330
(STAMMERING) I don't even own a gun.

564
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,800
There's no evidence Mr. Pang does either.

565
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,497
Nor is there any evidence he stole the object.

566
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,473
Why would I steal it from him, a killer?

567
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,239
What do you think, I'm crazy?

568
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,876
Maybe you thought you could pull a
fast one on some poor dishwasher.

569
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,348
Poor dishwasher?

570
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,548
What, Pang? No, he owns
a factory in Hong Kong.

571
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,657
CARVER: You know this for a fact?

572
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:56,561
No. But why would I ever get
into business with a dishwasher?

573
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,335
We searched the dump he lives in.

574
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,776
He owns two suits, two pairs
of shoes, and a clock radio.

575
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,006
No factory.

576
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,345
Evidently Mr. Gaston never checked
his client's employment record.

577
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,781
But someone else did.

578
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:21,051
LUCILLE: Now, tell me where you're going,
Liam, in case I need to find you.

579
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:24,219
I'm not terribly interested in
being found right now, Lucille.

580
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,194
I'm not liking what I'm
hearing about these police.

581
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,290
No, no, no. They think poor Stuart
and that Mr. Pang did everything.

582
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,732
It's perfectly safe.

583
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,930
I'll make my own decisions
on that, if you don't mind.

584
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,806
You went above and beyond this
time, Liam. I do appreciate that.

585
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,981
I might try to get up into Bhutan.

586
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,679
See what I might catch coming out of Tibet.

587
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,880
Oh, that sounds so exciting.

588
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,354
I'll keep you in mind.

589
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,025
Goodbye, Liam. And thank you.

590
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,836
Lucille Mobray a murderer?

591
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:13,502
My God, Carver, this is a 73-year-old
woman we're talking about.

592
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:18,241
A very rich 73-year-old woman who can get
anything she wants done for a price.

593
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,408
And that's your probable cause? She's rich?

594
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,418
CARVER: She knew where Mr. Pang worked.

595
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,512
The only way she could have known
was by having him followed.

596
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,752
Look, this search warrant application
can't even describe this, this, this...

597
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,624
What is this, a rice steamer?

598
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,057
You want me to sign this, you
put some meat on the plate.

599
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,600
Can we give the man what he wants?

600
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,262
Maybe Lucille Mobray can.

601
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,634
Given the right performance,

602
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,543
by the right performer.

603
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,414
For heaven's sake, sit down.

604
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,682
I was just being polite.

605
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,923
You make some vague threat on the phone,
and now you're being polite? Please.

606
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,966
You said you had something to
show me. Let's get on with it.

607
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,197
This is the documentation for the...

608
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,398
I know what it is. What are you doing with it?

609
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,668
It was delivered to my
room at the St. Francis.

610
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,142
I'm the person who was supposed
to deliver the object to you.

611
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,303
You?

612
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,074
The Fifth Lord of Pembridge.

613
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:28,106
This magnificent object has been
in my family for 300 years.

614
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,211
I see. Stuart thought that
accent would fool me?

615
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,984
It's a perfectly acceptable
English music hall accent.

616
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,856
What makes you think I'd want this?

617
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,054
I did some research.

618
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,391
The Chinese are very paranoid

619
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,160
about people stealing national
treasures. They're very litigious.

620
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,064
So I thought this might come in useful.

621
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,796
You expect me to pay for this?

622
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,132
Did you know that the Chinese
consulate's not very far from here,

623
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,469
on 42nd Street?

624
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,203
I just learned that in my research.

625
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,869
Did you bring your checkbook?

626
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,579
Write a check out to cash.

627
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,752
What amount?

628
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,149
$10,000.

629
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,957
My grandchildren are waiting for me.

630
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,562
Have a nice existence.

631
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:23,563
Frankie, be careful. You don't wanna spill it.

632
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,040
I want to play with my fire truck.

633
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,268
That's fine, sweetheart, but
you've just got to be careful.

634
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,509
Hello, Ms. Mobray.

635
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,643
That's a cool fire truck.

636
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,448
My grandma bought it for me.

637
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,115
Grandma got me a carriage with two horses,

638
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,851
but I had to leave it at home.

639
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,187
(laughing)

640
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:47,196
The privileges of being a grandmother.
You're allowed to spoil them a little bit.

641
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,595
Excuse me.

642
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,530
I see that you've spread your
generosity around a lot lately.

643
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,597
Look what we have here. Forged documents.

644
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:01,604
Why in the world would you spend so
much money for forged documents?

645
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,509
I thought it would be fun to have them.

646
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:07,539
We think it would be fun if you accompanied
these gentlemen down to our offices.

647
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,319
Everything here is listed
on her insurance declaration.

648
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,592
Same story with the
items at her storage vault.

649
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,327
Piece isn't here.

650
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,963
The doorman says a Liam Montgomery

651
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:30,666
visited Ms. Mobray a number of
times in the last few weeks.

652
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,735
It so happens

653
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,072
there was a Liam Montgomery
registered at the St. Francis

654
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,703
around the same time as Lord Pembridge.

655
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,408
Probably the guy she had keeping
tabs on all the players.

656
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,179
In other news, the Captain wants
to know what we've turned up here.

657
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,220
Squat, that's what we turned up.

658
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,185
These books and catalogs of Chinese bronzes,

659
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,317
I want Latent to go through them,

660
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,225
page by page.

661
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,063
MAN: On these pages we have a partial thumb,

662
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,730
index, partial palm, here, here and here.

663
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,375
She spent a lot of time looking at these.

664
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,533
How fresh are these prints?

665
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,513
Well, the oils are still viscous.
A couple, three days.

666
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,703
And that one.

667
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,732
It's beautiful.

668
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,571
"A heavenly horse
with a flame-shaped forelock.

669
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,343
"Bronze horses are extremely rare."

670
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,016
We need another search warrant.

671
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,522
Wonderful. Another gray room.

672
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,788
Please have a seat.

673
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,830
Liam Montgomery. Do you know him?

674
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,177
He runs an art consulting
business out of London.

675
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:21,283
Your doorman said he's made periodic
visits over the last seven years.

676
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:24,010
Yes, he's helped me. I'm an old woman.

677
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,579
I'm easy pickings for the
like of Gaston and Pang.

678
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,319
I need to protect myself.

679
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,195
And your acquisitions.

680
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:38,359
Which he seems uniquely qualified to do.

681
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,870
He has some kind of police record in Britain.

682
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,638
If you have questions about Mr.
Montgomery, ask Mr. Montgomery.

683
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,543
He's left the country. He got the job done.

684
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,871
But he made your dream come true.

685
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,884
What is this, a toy?

686
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,518
Not a toy.

687
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,688
Your granddaughter was sorry to see it go.

688
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,430
Detective, please, please.
This is irreplaceable.

689
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,661
Lucille.

690
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,965
Have you ever seen anything so exquisite?

691
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,540
To think it was made
during the time of Christ.

692
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:23,278
I'm prepared to be conciliatory
in view of your client's age.

693
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,816
You knew what it was
before you actually saw it?

694
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,043
Yes.

695
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:35,791
Liam bribed someone in Hong
Kong and snuck a peek.

696
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,022
He sent me a photograph.

697
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,926
Lucille, please. Oh, enough
of the charade, Harry.

698
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,794
They're making us an offer.

699
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,528
Six months in a minimum security prison.

700
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,765
A fine. A substantial fine.

701
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,202
We'll take it, Harry.

702
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,274
It's just... To have owned it
even for such a short time.

703
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,781
Even just to look at it.

704
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,477
The contours, the workmanship.

705
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,655
It's so precious.

706
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,122
(chuckling)

707
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,318
(laughing)

708
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,089
There were...

709
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,996
There were two little men in the carriage?

710
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,431
Yes, there were. Where's the other one?

711
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,474
Well, maybe they're in here.

712
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,077
Oh, look at this. It's Gaston and Pang.

713
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,013
They were in Chinatown.

714
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,942
Gaston. You know, Pang.

715
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,718
Someone else I forgot. Oh, let's see.

716
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,989
(CLATTERING)

717
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,051
Annie Littleton.

718
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,025
She was in Chinatown, too.

719
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,309
And she saw Pang, and she
screamed, "Tiananmen, Tiananmen!"

720
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,608
Detective, please, please.

721
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,272
Then it looked like trouble.

722
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,908
Oh, yes.

723
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,246
(LAUGHING)
Oh!

724
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,753
There looked like there was gonna be trouble.

725
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,118
But don't you worry.

726
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,651
(WHISPERING) Don't you worry.

727
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,755
Liam Montgomery.

728
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,334
'Cause he has his eye on things.

729
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:33,204
He told you there was
trouble, and he called you.

730
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,107
"There's trouble, Mrs. Mobray."

731
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,641
And you said, "Take care of it," and he did.

732
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,310
And bang, bang, Annie Littleton.

733
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,883
No, I did no such thing.

734
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,893
But... But then, all hell broke loose,

735
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,657
and Gaston and Pang, they were fighting.

736
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,457
Pang wanted it, Gaston
wanted it, Pang wanted it...

737
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,127
Stop it! This is not a joke.

738
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,296
These are precious, precious artifacts.

739
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,668
They're priceless, in fact.

740
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,071
Priceless?

741
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,341
And that's why you had him
kill Annie Littleton.

742
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,433
No.

743
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,742
Never mind that she had two kids.

744
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:16,110
Oh, they can get along fine
without their mother. Why not?

745
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,114
You did.

746
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,452
After your parents were killed.

747
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,160
After the Japanese bombed Shanghai.

748
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,957
There you are. Little Lucy
and her loving parents.

749
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,194
Living an enchanted life.

750
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,602
And there's your handsome father,

751
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,837
who, every day, brought you a new treasure.

752
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,045
"Here, Lucy.

753
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:51,776
"Here's a beautiful terracotta
doll for my most special girl."

754
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,495
(sniffling)

755
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,596
Those were the happiest days of your life.

756
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,031
(sobbing)

757
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,033
Then they were finished by a bomb burst.

758
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,642
But this toy, it takes you back.

759
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,945
And that's what makes it priceless.

760
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:21,380
'Cause you would do anything to
get back to that magical time.

761
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:28,583
And, well, Annie Littleton
just got in your way?

762
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,721
She...

763
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,698
She was going to ruin everything.

764
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,600
I just had to have it!

765
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,323
Chinese should be happy to get that back.

766
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,426
It's the only one of its kind.

767
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:16,131
Annie Ming Littleton was one of a kind.
