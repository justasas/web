1
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,668
Joel.

2
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:24,828
Yeah.

3
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,663
This is Rick. He's taking
over your route on Monday.

4
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,399
Yeah, sure, how are you doing?

5
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,638
Rick's gonna ride along with you today.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,008
I thought we were doing that tomorrow.

7
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,547
Tomorrow Rick's got his physical.

8
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,947
You pay attention. Joel
knows all the shortcuts.

9
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,489
I'm not worried, all right?

10
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,495
It's gonna be what it's gonna be.

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,690
Hey.

12
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,465
Luke!

13
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,661
Wait.

14
00:00:58,325 --> 00:00:59,463
What?

15
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,031
I want you at work at 2:00.

16
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,074
Dude, we're good.

17
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,613
Mr. Halliwell likes to check
the shipment himself.

18
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,016
If he's not here to sign for it,

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,519
you don't deliver it, got that?

20
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,646
Uh-huh.

21
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,584
You can put those over there.

22
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,345
Tepper. His last name was Tepper.

23
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,909
No, I don't know him.

24
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,478
Why're you turning?

25
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,046
Shortcut.

26
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,830
Geez! Hey, what's the matter with you?

27
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,627
What's the matter with you, assface?

28
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,792
Rick, let it go.

29
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,563
This little punk thinks he owns the streets.

30
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,195
Excuse me.

31
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,363
Keys.

32
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,031
Rick, they just want the drugs.

33
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,007
We stay cool, we're gonna be okay.

34
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,375
Shut up! You talk, I waste him.

35
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,442
Hurry up!

36
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,249
These, too.

37
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,856
Go. Go, go, go.

38
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,993
Okay. Okay. We're gonna be okay.

39
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,329
Hey!

40
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,235
You talked.

41
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,152
Witnesses saw three males,
late teens, early twenties.

42
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,192
One on a skateboard, and one on a bike,

43
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,456
one driving a van, dark gray, dark
blue or black, take your pick.

44
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,360
No one grabbed the plate numbers.

45
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,365
The shots came from this side.

46
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,094
Which one was standing here?

47
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,760
The bicycle guy.

48
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,030
He was covering the passenger,

49
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,437
probably shot him first.

50
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,032
Maybe the passenger was the bigger handful.

51
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,669
Or a bigger question mark than the driver.

52
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,208
Their last delivery was at Houston and Pitt.

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,477
The next one was on the Bowery at Prince.

54
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,883
He had no business being on this street.

55
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:06,083
Unless the driver had his
own delivery schedule.

56
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,418
Maybe Joel was showing
the new guy a shortcut.

57
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,930
Joel couldn't sit still in traffic
for more than 10 seconds.

58
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,465
He was always looking for a shortcut.

59
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,523
Did he know he was gonna
have a passenger today?

60
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,228
No. It was a last-minute thing.

61
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,702
So what's the damage here?

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,731
Well, all I can see that's missing
are four boxes of somatropin.

63
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,843
Somatropin. That's human growth hormone.

64
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,675
Athletes use it to bulk up.

65
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,510
That's not a legal use of the product.

66
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,277
How much were the four boxes worth?

67
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,341
A little over half a million dollars.

68
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,413
Now, the boxes were ordered
by four different pharmacies.

69
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,254
It's interesting how they all
turned up on the same day.

70
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,626
That's because they were all
ordered on the same day last week.

71
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,025
By four different pharmacies?

72
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,328
That's a little too interesting.

73
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,993
Could Joel have faked these orders?

74
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,230
No. The company has safeguards.

75
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,103
The orders have to come directly
from a licensed pharmacist.

76
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,144
Maybe Joel had a helper
in one of these pharmacies.

77
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,511
Xavier's worked for me for three years.

78
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,415
I know his wife, his children.
He's a good person.

79
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,182
You know anybody else who has
access to your order forms?

80
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,486
No. Could I see this phony order?

81
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,925
I actually placed this order for somatropin.
It's not a forgery.

82
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,364
You just remembered you ordered it?

83
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,738
Well, I had a flood back here last month.

84
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,999
Defective fire sprinklers.

85
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,340
Had to replace a lot of my stock.

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,313
Now seeing the paperwork
reminded me of the somatropin.

87
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,543
I'm sorry for the confusion.
Was there anything else?

88
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,279
- No. Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

89
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,321
Well, Mr. Halliwell,

90
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,481
I just wanna make sure
that I'm reading this right.

91
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,721
It says here, somatropin is contraindicated
for people with diabetes.

92
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,094
What happens if they take somatropin?

93
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:59,899
Well, without a doctor's supervision,
you run the risk of diabetic coma.

94
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,438
That's what I thought. Thank you.

95
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,007
We need to call some hospitals.

96
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,409
We've had four young males with severe
diabetic episodes in the last 48 hours.

97
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,919
We still don't know what triggered them.

98
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,978
You might wanna try and look for somatropin.

99
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,455
Are any of the kids still here?

100
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,253
Only one, Ryan Hendrickson.

101
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,453
His friends brought him in seven hours ago.

102
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,518
He'd already slipped into a coma.

103
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,862
We've stabilized him, but we haven't
determined how much damage there's been.

104
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,526
Are his friends still here?

105
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,503
His parents are in the waiting area.
And there's a young woman.

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,699
She was with him when they brought him in.

107
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,175
Over PA: Dr. Johnson,
please call extension 2198.

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,970
Miss DeSantis?

109
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,376
Can we speak to you over here?

110
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,650
We need to find out what happened to Ryan.

111
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,192
His diabetes messed him up.

112
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,989
He took something just before, right?

113
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,394
Something he wasn't supposed to?

114
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,500
Melinda, we think Ryan took a
growth hormone called somatropin

115
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,269
to help him build up his muscles.

116
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,033
That's why he's in a coma.

117
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,437
We need to know where he got it,

118
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,806
so other kids don't end up
in the bed next to him.

119
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,680
Ryan injected this stuff
he got from this guy Lane.

120
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,215
Lane Ruddock.

121
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,611
Lane said Ryan needed
to get bigger and stronger.

122
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,586
Why? Was Ryan doing sports?

123
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,747
He wrestles.

124
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,586
On a team at school?

125
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,960
It's not a school thing.

126
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,589
Come on! Dude, if you gotta
clothesline him, sell it.

127
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,760
Don't just stand there, move into him!

128
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,168
And, Jace, you have got to sell getting hit.

129
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,070
Grab your throat like you got
a badger stuck in there.

130
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,507
Come on, give me the face of pain. Sell it.

131
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,171
You Lane Ruddock?

132
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,009
What, the neighbors again?

133
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,143
Look, we got a right to wrestle, okay?
It's safer than hockey.

134
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,619
What do you mean, this?
We don't have a problem with this.

135
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,146
In fact, I've always wanted to try it.

136
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,387
Come on, come on. Climb in with me?

137
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,098
It's okay. Look, what're
you people doing here?

138
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,260
You know, what's that move...

139
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,837
You know, the one where
you take the other guy,

140
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,067
you spin him over the top of your head?

141
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,804
- What, the flying helicopter?
- Flying helicopter.

142
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,506
And then you plant him head down on the mat,

143
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,242
it's so extreme.

144
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,486
You know, I'm surprised
more guys don't end up like,

145
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,614
well, your buddy Ryan,

146
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,784
in a coma, on a respirator.

147
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,695
What? Hey, look, I had nothing to do with it.

148
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,761
Detectives.

149
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,956
Who are they?

150
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,435
Those are our buddies. They're
searching your parents' house.

151
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,335
We found 1 box. Two-third's full.

152
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,772
The somatropin, where are the other 3 boxes?

153
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:54,337
Hey, buddy, you better answer her question,

154
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,610
or you're going smackdown for two murders

155
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,277
all by yourself.

156
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,925
I didn't kill nobody, okay? I swear.
Those guys, they fronted me 1 box.

157
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,927
That was it. It was just 1 box.

158
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,598
Excuse me. Could you get
that box for me, up on top?

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,335
Thank you very much.

160
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,876
Drop the box.

161
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,045
What's going on? What're you doing to my son?

162
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,278
Arresting him.

163
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,583
Seems he went into the
pharmacy business for himself.

164
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,924
We have Lane Ruddock. We have the box
of stolen somatropin you sold him.

165
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,157
We have an eyewitness who puts
your van at the crime scene.

166
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,631
Am I forgetting something?

167
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,760
- The sneaker.
- We have a sneaker print in your van

168
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:55,034
that matches a sneaker print in
the cargo area of the truck.

169
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,435
That's it for now.

170
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,637
We'll have an update once we
grab up your accomplices.

171
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,472
You know, I don't wanna tell you
anything you already know, Luke,

172
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,152
but this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity you have here

173
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,119
to tell us your story.

174
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,656
Now this opportunity has the shelf life

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,319
of, like, one, maybe two hours.

176
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,661
By then, we'll have all
your buddies in custody.

177
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,859
Oh, the tales they will tell.

178
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,266
None of them with a happy ending.

179
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,136
- An hour, Luke.
- Two at the most.

180
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,796
Hang on a second.

181
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,078
Do I have your permission to
talk to them about it?

182
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,817
My client's ready to cooperate.

183
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,022
He had no prior knowledge of
any plan to kill the drivers.

184
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,120
He wasn't even aware
his accomplices were armed.

185
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,528
He didn't come forward before because...

186
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,190
Because he was afraid for his life.

187
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,735
We know all the disclaimers by heart.
What does he have to say?

188
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,270
Nothing, until the DA
signs off on the agreement,

189
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,532
which is as follows:

190
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,938
20 years in a medium-security facility

191
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,342
in return for his testimony and
his plea to second-degree robbery

192
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,970
and 4 counts of forgery.

193
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,416
4 counts of forgery?

194
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,914
4 boxes, 4 forged order forms, 4 counts.

195
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,623
Do I need to repeat anything?

196
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,096
No. We'll be right back.

197
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,831
That's a deal I can live with.

198
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,036
What?

199
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,112
The kid's copping to forging 4 order forms.

200
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,047
One of the pharmacists, Halliwell,

201
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,087
he told us his order was
legit, it wasn't forged.

202
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,918
One of them's lying.

203
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,284
My bet, it's not this kid.

204
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,552
Just got the good word.

205
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,792
His accomplices are in custody.
Two weapons recovered.

206
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,630
One's the same caliber
as the slugs from the victims.

207
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,170
The kid's stuck to his story.

208
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,172
He dummied up 4 orders of growth hormone,

209
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,572
including the order from
Halliwell's Pharmacy.

210
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,372
If Halliwell didn't order this
stuff, why tell you he did?

211
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,971
Because if he told us the truth
that the order was faked,

212
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,175
he knew we'd be back. He
knew he'd have to testify,

213
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,583
he knew he'd be under more
scrutiny than he wanted.

214
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,143
What do you think he's hiding?

215
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,820
Mr. Cardenas, is Mr. Halliwell here?

216
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,796
No. You just missed him.

217
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,299
Oh, rats.

218
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,699
So, maybe you can help us

219
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,900
with some information about this
flood, with the sprinkler system.

220
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,876
You should wait for Mr. Halliwell.

221
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,341
It's not that complicated.

222
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:54,846
The flood was just back there where
you keep all the prescriptions?

223
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,977
Yes.

224
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,384
Well, the sprinkler system
runs through the whole store.

225
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,288
Why wasn't the whole place flooded?

226
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,055
Well, Mr. Halliwell said
that the back sprinklers

227
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,222
are on a different waterline than the front.

228
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,391
Excuse me, but...

229
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,164
Don't worry, he does this all the time.

230
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,103
Were you here when the sprinklers went off?

231
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,834
No. It happened overnight.

232
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,105
Mr. Halliwell was already mopping up
when I got in on Saturday morning.

233
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,544
Do you know why they went off?

234
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,313
Well, he said it was 'cause they hadn't had
the scheduled maintenance done on them.

235
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,978
Something about, you know,
insurance not paying.

236
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,546
Was there a lot of damage?

237
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,250
Well, yeah, the whole back was wet.
We lost a lot of inventory.

238
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,489
How much?

239
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,589
Well, I don't know. Mr.
Halliwell took care of that.

240
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,465
He's the one who keeps
track of the inventory?

241
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,095
For the prescription medicines, yeah.

242
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,461
Thank you.

243
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,941
And who fills out the prescription
mostly, you or Mr. Halliwell?

244
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,274
I count out the pills. And
I do the ointments.

245
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,714
Mr. Halliwell does the fluids,
IV drips, cancer meds.

246
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,216
It's very toxic stuff.

247
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,217
Hey, what are you doing.
You're gonna set that off.

248
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,555
It's not going off because there's no water.

249
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,762
Your boss disconnected the front
sprinklers from the water line

250
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,958
so when he set off the sprinkler system,

251
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,503
only the back of the store got wet.

252
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,498
Mr. Halliwell did it on purpose? Why?

253
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,443
Why don't you just tell us what
you saw that Saturday morning?

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,810
Just that everything back there
was all wet, that's all.

255
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,372
Where were the drugs?

256
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,817
I don't know. He told me to
take the rest of the day off.

257
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,320
When I got back on Monday morning,

258
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,981
everything was back on the shelves.

259
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,085
I got my file on Halliwell over here.

260
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,932
He put in a big order six
weeks ago, I know that.

261
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,492
You sure you don't want
any cake? It's really good.

262
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,299
No, thank you. Sorry to pull you
away from your birthday party.

263
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,273
Every year I tell my assistant,
"Please, no parties."

264
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,866
But, hey, what can you do?

265
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,604
Just smile and eat cake.

266
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,701
Yeah.

267
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,372
So what did Halliwell order?

268
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,710
Oh...

269
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,912
Doxorubicin, gemcitabine,

270
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:14,057
dactinomycin, ifosfamide, BCNU.

271
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,649
What kind of drugs are those?

272
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,854
Chemotherapy drugs. Cancer.

273
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,696
Did he order any other drugs?

274
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,787
No.

275
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,662
Oh, he said a fire sprinkler went off,

276
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,362
and his supply of chemo
drugs got contaminated.

277
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,166
Just the chemo?

278
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,864
That's what he said.

279
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,303
Well, our records show

280
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:34,470
he bought almost $180,000
worth of drugs from you.

281
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,774
Mmm-hmm.

282
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,710
Is that considered a large purchase?

283
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,514
Well, it's triple the amount he bought
from us in the previous quarter.

284
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,145
- $60,000.
- Mmm-hmm.

285
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,353
Why such a big jump?

286
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,518
Well, I did my homework.

287
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:54,463
I put together that he sold 4 times more
chemo drugs than he was buying from me.

288
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,394
I was losing business to a competitor.

289
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,160
A competitor? Do you know who?

290
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,064
Well, he wouldn't tell me.

291
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,335
When did you have this conversation with him?

292
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,140
About two months ago.

293
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,775
You know, on second thought,

294
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,450
I think I'll have a piece of cake.

295
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,378
Be right back.

296
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,857
This competitor he's worried about?

297
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,627
There isn't any.

298
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,857
He's Halliwell's only supplier.

299
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,557
So Halliwell's doing a neat trick,

300
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,363
turning $60 grand worth of cancer drugs

301
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,927
into over $200,000 in sales.

302
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,438
His customers might not think it's so neat.

303
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,211
Jim, I'm sure you realize
that commitments were made

304
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,614
based on the one you made to us.

305
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,246
And I intend to live up to it.

306
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,819
I'm glad to hear that.

307
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,414
I never expected any less from you.

308
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,156
I just need to renegotiate the terms.

309
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:05,497
The amount of the gift every month,

310
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,568
it's just too much.

311
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,237
How much would you be comfortable with?

312
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,447
I need to cut it by half.

313
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,648
I really need some relief here.

314
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,056
I'll see what I can do.

315
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,496
People consider you someone
they can count on, Jim.

316
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,799
You don't wanna risk disappointing them.

317
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,203
How did you people get my name?

318
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,646
From the state Medicaid.

319
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:55,208
You and your wife have your prescriptions
filled at Halliwell's Pharmacy?

320
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,221
It's just me now. My wife
passed away two months ago.

321
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,950
We're very sorry.

322
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,792
Mr. Lowell, if you don't mind our
asking, what did she die of?

323
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,595
Claudine died of ovarian cancer.

324
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,700
She was diagnosed two years ago last March.

325
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,034
She had surgery and...

326
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,837
Then she went on chemo.

327
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:20,473
Here. Smell this. It's a brandy wine.

328
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,611
We planted them three months ago.

329
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,909
That was the last day she was outside.

330
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,554
What was your wife's prognosis
when she was diagnosed?

331
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,455
They said that she could beat it,

332
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,686
she was in the early stages.

333
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:43,164
And there was no sign of
improvement during the two years?

334
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,159
No. The cancer just spread.

335
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,595
It got worse.

336
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,807
The suffering, the pain and the nausea.

337
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,866
What did her doctor say?

338
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,842
"Every cancer is different."
That's what he said.

339
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,748
Then he'd go and write another prescription.

340
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,447
You didn't happen to keep any of them?

341
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,047
No.

342
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,824
What would I do with that stuff?

343
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,387
I mean, it didn't do us any good

344
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,292
when Claudine was alive.

345
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:28,008
Two years from diagnosis to death,

346
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,841
with a survivable cancer, a
full course of chemotherapy.

347
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,214
And her doctor's giving her good odds.

348
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,380
Yeah, odds don't mean anything
when the medication you're
taking might as well be water.

349
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,757
That's Halliwell's neat trick.
He's diluting the drugs.

350
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,596
We talked to the families of eight of
Halliwell's customers who died of cancer.

351
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,397
They all said the same thing.

352
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,064
There was no improvement, the
medications weren't helping,

353
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,936
the cancers just got worse.

354
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,441
How long has he been at it?

355
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,067
We checked the drug company's records

356
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,372
and Halliwell's sales records.

357
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,675
He's been selling more cancer
drugs than he's been buying

358
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,716
for at least four years.

359
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,882
We could be talking about thousands
of diluted prescriptions.

360
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,421
And hundreds of deaths
that might've been prevented.

361
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,923
What about the drugs
Halliwell is dispensing now?

362
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,726
They're at full potency.

363
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,126
His conscience finally got to him.

364
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,461
More likely the drug company
salesman did, when he told Halliwell

365
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,695
he noticed the discrepancy between
his sales and his purchases.

366
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,294
That's why he had the flood.

367
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,831
Making a case against him solely
on the basis of sales records

368
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,469
will turn into the battle
of the bean counters.

369
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,448
We need physical, medical proof
he diluted those prescriptions.

370
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,949
None of Halliwell's customers thought of
saving a sample of their old prescriptions.

371
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,955
The dead ones might've.

372
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,521
Since I needed soft tissue for the tests,

373
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,894
I only looked at people who
died in the last six months.

374
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,797
Of those, I identified 14 cancer patients

375
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,563
who statistically should still be alive

376
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,434
if they'd received the right
dosage of chemotherapy.

377
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,634
Nine families gave me permission
to exhume the bodies.

378
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,937
Only nine?

379
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,308
Well, you must have some bedside manner.

380
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,540
There's a reason I work with dead people.

381
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,879
After putting their livers under the
microscope, here's what I have.

382
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,319
Five had very low
concentrations of chemo drugs,

383
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,118
75% lower than it should have been,

384
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,284
had they been getting the
dosage they were prescribed.

385
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,884
And the four other victims?

386
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,658
Well, the results on three were
inconclusive for a variety of reasons.

387
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,963
On the other hand, number nine showed
an unusually high concentration

388
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,765
of the drugs doxorubicin and ifosfamide.

389
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,370
This number nine actually have a name?

390
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,746
The medical examiner just told me

391
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,282
they wanted to do some tests on Claudine,

392
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,251
to see how the medicine she was
taking affected her cancer.

393
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:54,251
I said if it's gonna help somebody
else, sure, go right ahead.

394
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,594
You don't want anybody
going through what she did.

395
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,993
No, ma'am.

396
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,062
You were frustrated and angry
the drugs weren't working.

397
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,129
Yeah.

398
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,602
It must've been discouraging
for the both of you.

399
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,511
Anyone in your position...

400
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,656
You might, at some point,

401
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,055
think that death was inevitable.

402
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,624
Mr. Lowell,

403
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,728
there's no easy way to say this.

404
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,599
We think we know why the
drugs weren't working.

405
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,245
We believe Mr. Halliwell
was diluting them for profit.

406
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,749
Your wife never got
the full dosage, Mr. Lowell,

407
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,561
or the full benefit of the chemotherapy.

408
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,205
You thought we were gonna say
something else, didn't you?

409
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,678
That we found out that your wife died

410
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,183
of a massive dose of cancer drugs.

411
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,017
Doxorubicin and ifosfamide.

412
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,824
Maybe that the pain was unbearable,

413
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,917
the drugs weren't working.

414
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,387
You had no way of knowing that Mr.
Halliwell was diluting them.

415
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,994
So, you thought

416
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,865
that you would do the one thing
that would stop Claudine's agony.

417
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,209
So you and your wife, you made a decision.

418
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,213
And you used the rest of the
medicine that she had left

419
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,148
and injected it in her IV.

420
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,752
Oh, God.

421
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,860
Oh, my God.

422
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,806
I killed her...

423
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,865
I killed her for nothing.

424
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,573
Oh, God.

425
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,179
You know I hate hypotheticals.

426
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,278
If there's a factual basis to your question,

427
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,346
then let's deal with those facts.

428
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,591
Like, hypothetically,

429
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:51,001
if one of the nine exhumed bodies died
as a result of an assisted suicide,

430
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:55,198
then, yes, that's murder. And, yes,
I'd be duty-bound to prosecute it.

431
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,467
Well, then, forget we brought it up at all.

432
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,837
It's not that easy.

433
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,913
If we use the other eight
exhumations against Halliwell,

434
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,739
there is no legal way to hide
the results of the ninth,

435
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,787
from me or anyone else.

436
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,222
Like you, I'd hate to put
some poor widower in jail,

437
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,250
but once the cat's out of
the bag, I have no choice.

438
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,362
Well, then we don't use
the exhumations at all.

439
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,527
Those exhumations are good evidence against
Mr. Halliwell and I will be using them.

440
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,837
So we can't convict Halliwell
without sending Lowell to jail.

441
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,931
Apparently not.

442
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,237
If it weren't for him,

443
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,802
Lowell and his wife would never have even
considered suicide in the first place.

444
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,543
Carver says he has no choice.
Let's give him one.

445
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,347
Let's give him better
evidence against Halliwell.

446
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,479
Look, I was noticing here.

447
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,585
Some of the pharmacy's customers
have the same address.

448
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,149
- The Brightest Star Home.
- Sounds like a nursing home.

449
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,922
It's up in Westchester.

450
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,658
Halliwell's home turf. He's
even ripping off his neighbors.

451
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,427
That's what's interesting.

452
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,365
According to the Medicaid records,

453
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,462
Mr. Halliwell was practically giving
the meds away to these people.

454
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,712
Mr. Halliwell has been
filling our prescriptions

455
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,145
for our residents for many years.

456
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,341
At less than cost.

457
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,906
That's our arrangement with him.

458
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,885
An arrangement. Does he have a
financial interest in the home?

459
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,080
No.

460
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,054
I see there's a Reverend Mills,

461
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,989
heads the board of your trustees.

462
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,685
Are you owned by a religious group?

463
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,355
We are a nondenominational residence.

464
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,920
But you're owned by a religious group.

465
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,795
The Church of the Sacred Redeemer.

466
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,334
Are you a member of the church?

467
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,562
I'm an elder.

468
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,365
And Mr. Halliwell?

469
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,497
He's an elder also.

470
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,805
So supplying drugs to the residents here,

471
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,844
that's his gift to the church.

472
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,402
And this arrangement, that's
a pledge he made?

473
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,312
A very generous pledge, yes.

474
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,941
A couple thousand dollars
prescriptions a month

475
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,417
doesn't sound very generous,

476
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,751
especially from a church elder.

477
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,981
There's more to it than that, right?

478
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,953
Jim Halliwell has pledged

479
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,793
$1.5 million toward a recreation center.

480
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,767
$1.5 million bucks. When did
he make this pledge?

481
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,393
Four years ago.

482
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,131
His generosity to the church
has set a terrific example.

483
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,069
I see it's inspired your employees.

484
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,240
These charities they're involved in,

485
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,541
AIDS babies, the indigent sick.

486
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,853
One of the employees collects clothing

487
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,652
and other items from the residents.

488
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,454
Yes, once they've passed away,

489
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,924
whatever the family doesn't want.

490
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:38,061
Whatever's in the room, whatever
would normally get thrown away.

491
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,395
Yes.

492
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,542
Could we meet this employee, you know,
to give him a, you know, "attaboy"?

493
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,407
Kenny'll be home from school next week.

494
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,012
He still doesn't know what
he's gonna do with his degree.

495
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:02,422
So, I would really appreciate
if you'd talk to him,

496
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,461
give him some career guidance.

497
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,087
Well, that would be fine.
Just have him give me a call.

498
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,962
Good stuff. Thank you, Jim. Penny.

499
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,467
See you on Sunday, Reverend.

500
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,232
That's quite a compliment,
sending you his son for advice.

501
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,404
The Reverend told our committee
he's diverting funds

502
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:24,413
from the volunteers' bazaar to the
planning group for the recreation center.

503
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,539
Why is that?

504
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,483
He said some people weren't
living up to their pledges.

505
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,383
He told me to talk to you about it.

506
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,853
Oh, for heaven's sake.

507
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,719
What's going on, Jim?

508
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,224
Business has been off,

509
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,455
and I told him I had to cut
back on our monthly giving.

510
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,895
We can't. We made a commitment.

511
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,933
Well, it's not forever.
We're not the only ones.

512
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,763
Other people have had to cut back.

513
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,700
Other people buy pews.

514
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,902
We're building a recreation center.

515
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,133
What kind of example are we setting?

516
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,232
Well, we can make it up
to them in other ways.

517
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,368
We can volunteer more time at the church.

518
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:58,643
We don't just go to church with these
people, Jim. We're on the PTA with them,

519
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,706
the chamber of commerce.

520
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,346
You want everyone to know
we're pleading poverty?

521
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,409
We're not poor.

522
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,719
Jim, people respect us. They look up to us.

523
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,158
They like us, our kids. We can't back out.

524
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,464
I only take what the families let me

525
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,230
and I give it to homeless groups,

526
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,294
shelters for runaways, battered women.

527
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,272
What else besides clothes?

528
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,832
Old purses, unopened toiletries.

529
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:27,876
Clock radios.

530
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,935
Sure, yeah. Small appliances,

531
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,278
kitchenware, everything gets used.

532
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,613
What about over-the-counter
medications, like aspirin?

533
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,949
Sure, vitamins, cold medicines.

534
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,511
Prescriptions?

535
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:41,021
No. No, we have to throw those away.

536
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,820
That's expensive stuff.

537
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:47,227
I mean, all this is nice, but those
medications can save people's lives.

538
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:52,199
You see first hand how people suffer

539
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,602
just because they can't
afford the right medications.

540
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:59,234
Like doxorubicin, and
interferon, and aldesleukin.

541
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,900
I know what you mean.

542
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,172
You do?

543
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,576
When someone dies at the home, of cancer,

544
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:11,446
the drugs that they have left, they just
get tossed away, doing no one any good?

545
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:17,358
I mean, aren't you a little tempted
to slip them in your pocket,

546
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,429
and make sure they get to the
people who really need them?

547
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,924
That's against regulations.

548
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,223
But it crosses your mind.

549
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,634
How about…

550
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,772
Mrs. Barlowe who passed away 3 days ago?

551
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,438
They told us she was taking
aldesleukin, for renal cancer.

552
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,144
That's a treatment for AIDS, isn't it?

553
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,120
And you just threw it in the trash?

554
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,647
Yes.

555
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,421
Then it would've been in the
dumpster when we checked.

556
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,659
You see, we did a little dumpster diving.

557
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,891
It's pretty nasty.

558
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,603
But we didn't find any of Mrs.
Barlowe's medications.

559
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,573
Well, look, maybe society thinks
what I'm doing is illegal...

560
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,472
But it's not immoral.

561
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,527
How old are these prescriptions?

562
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,362
Some of them might've been
filled a couple of months ago.

563
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,364
I thought these drugs could help people.

564
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,697
Not these drugs.

565
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:42,439
We were able to recover eight more chemo
prescriptions that came from the rest home.

566
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,482
Of the 23 we had tested, half were diluted.

567
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,017
The labels are partially scraped off,

568
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,486
but they're still identifiable as
coming from Halliwell's Pharmacy.

569
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,187
It's a fine piece of detective
work, but I can't use it.

570
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,318
The medications have been
through too many hands.

571
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,862
I couldn't prove to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt,

572
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,922
Halliwell's the one who
diluted them. I'm sorry.

573
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:06,101
The exhumations are still our best evidence.

574
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,936
Good news, Charlie.

575
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:17,372
Well, these might not convince a jury

576
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,714
but they might convince someone else.

577
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,817
This is an incredible story.

578
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,450
Well, you have the lab
report right in front of you.

579
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:34,429
And as you can see, the vials
still have Mr. Halliwell's label.

580
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,466
But there's nothing wrong with the medication

581
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,399
Mr. Halliwell is dispensing now?

582
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,937
Apparently not.

583
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,972
Then I don't understand how I can help you.

584
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,975
We believe Mr. Halliwell
diluted the drugs to pay off

585
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:49,240
the $1.5 million pledge
he made to your church.

586
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,310
You know, you two make a very good team.

587
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,319
Look, if Jim had given me any hint
that this pledge was a hardship,

588
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,821
I never would've accepted it.

589
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:02,688
But so far, he's kept up
his end of the bargain.

590
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,060
How's he been doing the last six weeks?

591
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,118
Well, he's been wanting to cut back.

592
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,096
He told me business hasn't been good.

593
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,326
I bet.

594
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,098
I'm sure you're both terrific detectives,

595
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,472
but I can't reconcile the
Jim Halliwell you describe

596
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,135
with the one that I know.

597
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,737
Jim and his wife Penny are
both pillars of the community.

598
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,944
How long have they been
pillars of the community?

599
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,814
I really couldn't say.
It's something you grow into.

600
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,619
Can you say when he became a church elder?

601
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,784
When was that, about four years ago?

602
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,828
That sounds about right.

603
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,866
I can't help noticing, Detective, the way you

604
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,232
pull together all these different elements.

605
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,435
Good stuff.

606
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,503
It's good stuff.

607
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,972
Reverend,

608
00:33:55,367 --> 00:34:00,248
what I can't help noticing, is that's about
the third time you've complimented us.

609
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:07,285
Is that how you got Jim Halliwell
to pony up a $1.5 million bucks?

610
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,857
Ultimately, the gift has
to come from the heart,

611
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,487
but a little encouragement goes along way.

612
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,294
And making him a church elder
went all the way to the bank.

613
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,360
Those kinds of things are important to Jim.

614
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,373
Jim and Penny are very
involved in the community.

615
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:31,437
They're well-regarded, and they
take justifiable pride in that.

616
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,307
They wouldn't wanna
disappoint their neighbors.

617
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,509
They'd be ashamed.

618
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,817
Well, you know, Detective,

619
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,188
shame is a very underrated emotion.

620
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:46,923
In the big city, it's very easy
to go unnoticed by others.

621
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,260
So your conscience becomes your only witness.

622
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,531
And for most of us, that's not enough.

623
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:58,672
And I'm sure every Sunday you play
that card for all it's worth.

624
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,143
Thank you very much for talking
to us. One more thing.

625
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,407
Assisted suicide. What's
your church's position?

626
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,710
It's contrary to God's Law.

627
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,979
A sin.

628
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,509
Thank you.

629
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,692
I filled the syringe

630
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,754
with the chemo medicine,
all the way up to the top,

631
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,528
and then I injected it into her IV,

632
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,928
and then I filled the syringe again

633
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,473
all the way up with the rest of the medicine.

634
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,641
What happened after you injected the drugs?

635
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,973
She was feeling worse,

636
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,145
her breathing became hard,
and she kind of, like,

637
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:44,785
seized up.

638
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,381
Yeah, she stayed like that,

639
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,956
in a coma

640
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,916
for two days.

641
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,454
It took her two days to die.

642
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,596
How did you get the idea
to use the cancer drugs?

643
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,630
Well, when Claudine first
started using the chemo,

644
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,001
the doctor told her to be careful,

645
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,305
because the medicine is a poison.

646
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,249
If you use too much, you could die.

647
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,317
You never discussed what you
were doing with anybody?

648
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,412
No.

649
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,650
Did you buy extra medicine from Mr.
Halliwell to make sure you had enough?

650
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,152
No.

651
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,995
Claudine and I, we didn't want
anyone knowing what we were doing.

652
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:37,633
We just did what we had
to do, you know, just...

653
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,905
Just the two of us.

654
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:50,546
Mr. Lowell, it took Mrs. Lowell
2 days to die?

655
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,418
Yeah. 2 days.

656
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,561
I can't imagine what he went
through, waiting for her to die.

657
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,124
That must've been the worst hour of his life.

658
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:08,137
Hour? He said two days.

659
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,797
Well, I'm pretty sure I
heard him say an hour.

660
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,275
Maybe I need a prescription for my hearing.

661
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,508
- Reverend.
- Jim,

662
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,078
I'm really glad you're back on board.

663
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,746
It'll make all the difference.

664
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,785
Thank you, Reverend.

665
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,660
Hey, Jim?

666
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,135
Can we have a word?

667
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,464
Hello.

668
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,939
Aren't you gonna introduce us?

669
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,374
Penny, this is Detective...

670
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,676
I forgot your name.

671
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,011
I'm Robert Goren, and this is
Detective Alex Eames.

672
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,278
- My wife Penny.
- Nice to meet you.

673
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,321
What it's about is one of
your customers, Frank Lowell.

674
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,247
Maybe you don't remember him.

675
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,949
No, I know who he is.

676
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,720
Then you know his wife Claudine died.

677
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,193
Of ovarian cancer, yes.

678
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,161
Actually, that's not what killed her.

679
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,222
Mr. Lowell admitted to us
it was an assisted suicide.

680
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:14,232
He pumped her full of
doxorubicin and ifosfamide.

681
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,170
I'm sorry to hear that.

682
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,934
But it's really none of my business.

683
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,340
Well, no, apparently, it is your business.

684
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,139
Mr. Lowell made a statement.

685
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,670
He said he came to you. He told
you his wife was getting worse,

686
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,307
she was in constant pain,

687
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:30,512
and he asked you to give him something
to take her out of her misery.

688
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,577
You told him to give her

689
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,950
all the cancer medication that she had left,

690
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,517
in one big shot.

691
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,720
That's not true.

692
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,696
It's right here in the statement.

693
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,461
You told him how to kill his wife.

694
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,661
That's assisting a suicide.

695
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,800
Well, that's ridiculous.
I didn't do anything wrong.

696
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,100
Nothing wrong?

697
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,944
Excuse me, Reverend, didn't you tell
us assisting a suicide is a sin?

698
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,744
Well, yes, but...

699
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,911
Well, there you go. It's a sin.

700
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,113
But it's all lies.

701
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,247
I never talked to this man about suicide.

702
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,689
Come on, Penny.

703
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,124
Oh, that's it, run away.

704
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,786
You better get yourself a lawyer

705
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,889
'cause the next time you see us,
we'll be arresting you for murder.

706
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,361
This is crazy. I never murdered anyone.

707
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,333
Jim wouldn't help anybody commit suicide.

708
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,537
"He told me to give Claudine
all the drugs at once.

709
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,806
"That's what I did. An hour
later, Claudine was dead."

710
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,869
That's what Frank Lowell told us.

711
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,481
He's lying.

712
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,743
You keep saying that.

713
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:39,186
No, he is lying, and I can prove it.

714
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:40,314
How?

715
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,221
There's a fact in here
you can prove isn't true?

716
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:47,555
Show me this untrue fact.
Is it on this page or...

717
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,997
She didn't die in an hour. She couldn't have.

718
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,525
Why is that?

719
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,901
The drugs wouldn't have worked that fast.

720
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,965
We know how much doxorubicin
and ifosfamide she had left.

721
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:02,409
Our experts said it was enough
to kill her in an hour.

722
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,205
It's impossible.

723
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,714
Listen, I've been a
pharmacist for over 20 years.

724
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,753
I know what I'm talking about.

725
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,550
Well, how long? Two hours?

726
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,684
Twelve? One day?

727
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,127
I don't know. But there's
no way she died in an hour.

728
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:24,158
Well, I'm sure we'd all
like to know why that is.

729
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,699
I'd just be speculating.

730
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,238
There's no way that she
would die in one hour.

731
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,865
I mean, that's not speculating,

732
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,470
that's certainty.

733
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,174
There was something wrong
with her drugs, wasn't there?

734
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,274
No.

735
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,517
You diluted her drugs, didn't you?

736
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,610
No.

737
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,351
That's why you knew she
wouldn't die in one hour.

738
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,560
You wanna know how long it took her?

739
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:57,498
You know how long it took for the
poisons to eat away at her heart,

740
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,091
and her lungs?

741
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:01,899
Two days.

742
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,602
Two days.

743
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,172
It was a mistake.

744
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,112
It was an honest mistake.

745
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,415
An honest mistake he made for four years.

746
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,513
You even diluted the drugs that
you sent to the old age home.

747
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,852
- No.
- Jim,

748
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,593
they found the vials. They showed them to me.

749
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,731
Tell them why you did it, Jim. Go ahead.

750
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:39,904
Tell them you did it to pay
off the $1.5 million pledge.

751
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,942
Go ahead.

752
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,777
Who knows, they might forgive you.

753
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,691
I'm sorry.

754
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,503
I just didn't wanna let you down.

755
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,932
Please forgive me.

756
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,602
You're under arrest, Mr.
Halliwell. Please forgive me!

757
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:18,407
Penny!

758
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:49,708
The final tally was 26,000 prescriptions.

759
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:53,374
He plead to one count of fraud and
tampering for every patient affected.

760
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,484
1,200 counts.

761
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,320
We agreed to a sentence of 15 years to life.

762
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,686
His chance to be the pillar
of a whole new community.
