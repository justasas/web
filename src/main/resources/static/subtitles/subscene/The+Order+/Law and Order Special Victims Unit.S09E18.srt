1
00:00:00,405 --> 00:00:02,207
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:05,992
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,159
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:10,843
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:13,779
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,542
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,659
Push it back, Frankie.
Push it back.

8
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,442
It's coming out of
that apartment down the hall.

9
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:25,055
Engine 99 to command, we got a fire
and a taxpayer on the first floor.

10
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:26,453
Hallway's knocked down.
We're going in.

11
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:28,831
Come on, baby.
Open up for me.

12
00:00:29,793 --> 00:00:31,646
Let's get it done, ladies.

13
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:39,080
10-45 in the bedroom.

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,012
Command 99.
We need EMS on scene.

15
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,564
She's not breathing.
No pulse.

16
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:53,460
Engine 99.
10-45. Code one.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,766
Send a Fire Marshal and PD.

18
00:00:56,276 --> 00:00:58,848
Frankie, cut the hose
so we can get her out.

19
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:02,901
On my count.
1, 2, 3, go!

20
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,322
Stabler. Special Victims.

21
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:11,806
Was she dead
when you found her?

22
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:14,110
Yeah. Nobody could survive that smoke 
for more than a couple of minutes.

23
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,367
What makes you think
she was raped?

24
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,816
Her panties were pulled down
and her dress was ripped.

25
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,173
She had a big gash on her head.

26
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:20,939
Must have been unconscious
when the fire started.

27
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,461
Thanks.
Any luck?

28
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,964
Yeah, I got a name.
Jenna Ludlow. 25.

29
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:27,291
She lived here a couple of months.
Kept to herself.

30
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,067
Nobody heard any screaming
or fighting last night.

31
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,990
So he raped her, knocked her out,
lit the place up to finish her off?

32
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,824
No, she was dead before the fire.

33
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:36,613
There's no soot
in Miss Ludlow's nostrils.

34
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:37,931
CSU find a murder weapon?

35
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,795
There was a lamp on the floor
next to Jenna's body.

36
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:41,449
Perp must have bashed
her head in with it.

37
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,180
You guys are this good,
what do you need me for?

38
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,168
Other than to turn the world on
with your smile, how about a pelvic?

39
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:48,122
Done. Fluids present.

40
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:50,685
And there's thick mucus
at the cervical os.

41
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:51,733
She has an STD?

42
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,756
No. Bun in the oven.

43
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:56,157
From the looks of her belly,
she wasn't too far along.

44
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,263
Wonder if Jenna knew
she was pregnant.

45

62
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:50,545
Is anything salvageable?

63
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,731
Whatever traces evidence wasn't burned
the fire boys washed away.

64
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:54,826
And we get hosed.

65
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:57,404
We'll gather and sift,
but I hope you find a good witness.

66
00:02:57,404 --> 00:03:01,350
Prada shoes. Gucci.
She was living the life.

67
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,722
All good things come to an end.

68
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:06,101
Eddie Brancato,
Fire Marshal.

69
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,339
Shame about these oak ceilings.
Varnish is a natural accelerant.

70
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:12,714
You light them up. These beams are
like fuses on a Roman candle.

71
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:13,999
Where'd the fire start?

72
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,219
Right here.

73
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:17,139
And it was no accident.

74
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,785
I don't see any signs
of an accelerant.

75
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:20,824
That's because you're looking
at what's here.

76
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:22,708
Now look for what's missing.

77
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:25,217
Drapes.

78
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:28,053
Destroyed.
Actually after the fire bug lit them up.

79
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:29,208
Any idea what he used?

80
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:33,067
It's in the air, Detective.
The nose knows.

81
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:36,561
- Alcohol.
- Jellied methyl alcohol.

82
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:39,546
Otherwise known as Sterno.

83
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:43,031
Your victim kept it under the sink.
Two pack.

84
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:46,760
- Missing a can.
- Hey. Check this out in the kitchen.

85
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,215
What do you got?

86
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:52,319
Dishwasher was shut.
Contents untouched by fire or water.

87
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:56,324
- Maybe we just got lucky.
- Jenna had company last night.

88
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:58,390
Those glasses could have been
sitting there for a week.

89
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,936
A single woman with a full-time job?
Trust me.

90
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:06,085
Well... digs like these?
Must have been some job.

91
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:09,171
Found a site where Jenna
advertised her services.

92
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:13,547
This discount suit cost 250 bucks
at Morty's suits for less.

93
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:18,650
But with my personal touch,
you can look like you spent two grand.

94
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,582
Size doesn't matter, guys.
The size of your budget, that is.

95
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:27,034
I'm Jenna Ludlow,
and I'm gonna help you dress... to kill.

96
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:30,136
Dress to kill... too bad
she didn't get to help Munch.

97
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,750
Are you insulting
my sartorial splendor?

98
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,158
- Well, if that means clothes, yes.
- Easy, fellas.

99
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:38,549
Now, what kind of a living
could Jenna make being a stylist?

100
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,537
With the right clientele, big bucks.

101
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:42,767
She only had $300
in her business account.

102
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:45,946
I'm not surprised,
with all those Gucci bags in her closet.

103
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:47,989
I don't know how
she could have afforded them.

104
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:49,945
She hasn't made
any deposits in months.

105
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:53,364
Cause someone else has been 
making them into her personal account.

106
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:55,666
Ten large wired in
for the last three months.

107
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,619
- From where?
- Liechtenstein.

108
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:00,160
Yeah.
Conveniently untraceable.

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,851
Jenna had an offshore sugar daddy.

110
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:05,274

Payments started right about the time
Jenna must have got herself knocked up.

111
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:07,635
So she blackmails him
with the baby.

112
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:10,549
He comes over, they fight,
he rapes her, he kills her.

113
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,767
Well, how do we find
count Liechtenstein?

114
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,265
Go to heaven.

115
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:16,698
Heaven Moskowitz.

116
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:19,099
Jenna's been writing her a check
every week for 200 bucks,

117
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,034
and the memo line
reads "therapy".

118
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,720
Heaven only knows
who Jenna was sleeping with.

119
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,131
I can't talk to you about Jenna.
Doctor/Patient privilege.

120
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:30,510
- You're a doctor of... what?
- Angel healing.

121
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,481
You got a license to practice?

122
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:35,008
I'm certified by a higher authority.

123
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:38,466
I'm sorry, but cherubim
don't have legal standing in this state.

124
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:44,221
What Jenna and I discuss in this room
is between us and the angels.

125
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:46,184
What's this about?

126
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:49,286
I guess you didn't get
the 411 from on high.

127
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:51,148
Jenna was murdered this morning.

128
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:55,019
No, it can't be.
It's before her time.

129
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,339
It usually is in our line of work.

130
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,465
Your guardian angel is supposed 
to protect you from untimely death.

131
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:03,341
You see, that's the problem
with guardian angels.

132
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:04,819
They're never around 
when you need them.

133
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,188
I know you think this is a big joke.
But Jenna believed.

134
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:10,231
I taught her how to speak to the angels.

135
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:11,891
About what?

136
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:15,045
Her future.
Jenna had a choice to make.

137
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,953
Together, we asked
the angels for help.

138
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:18,437
What choice?

139
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:20,472
I don't listen to words.

140
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:24,234
I... feel them and spirit them
to the other side.

141
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:26,978
You feel anything about
Jenna having a boyfriend?

142
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,779
I see... Africa.
Possibly Ethiopia.

143
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:37,493
Great body.

144
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:39,478
Is his name Fabio?

145
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:40,990
Pierson.

146
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:45,762
Six million people in this city.
And Pierson is the best your angels can do?

147
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:52,662
Okay. Cleopatra says to try
the commodities exchange.

148
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:56,624
EASTERN COMMODITIES ECXHANGE 
249 VESEY STREET

149
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,692
What's special victims unit
doing down here?

150
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,993
We're looking for
somebody named Pierson.

151
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:02,608
A first name would really help.

152
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:04,796
We think he's African,
maybe from Ethiopia.

153
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:07,298
And we were told
that he has a great body.

154
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:10,667
Ethiopian? A great body?
Someone's yanking your chain.

155
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,329
Sounds like your guy trades coffee,

156
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,631
so you're probably talking
about Pierson Bartlett.

157
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,798
Okay, what can you
tell us about him?

158
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:17,973
Fourth generation 
coffee trader.

159
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:20,492
Family had seats here in the exchange
since it was founded.

160
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,136
You see him around here?

161
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:25,261
No. But he might be
up in the grading room.

162
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,614
Looks like the world's 
greatest coffee break.

163
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:30,645
They're all traders.

164
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:34,486
They sample the coffee and cocoa
to make sure it's up to trading standards.

165
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:37,495
- There's Pierson Bartlett over there.
- Thanks.

166
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:43,350
- Mr. Bartlett.
- Hold on. Last cup.

167
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:53,834
- Great body.
- Excuse me?

168
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,423
The coffee.

169
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:59,204
But I'll bet yours is...
smooth and robust.

170
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:01,189
I didn't catch your name?

171
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,793
Detective Benson.
I'm Detective Stabler.

172
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:07,360
- What can I do for you?
- Tell us about Jenna Ludlow.

173
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:10,439
Why? / She was found
murdered this morning.

174
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,893
Oh, my God.

175
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:14,927
Jenna?

176
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:17,621
How do you know her?

177
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:20,501
She's my son PJ's fiancee.

178
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,416
They met when Jenna temped
in our office.

179
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,130
- And where is he now?
- Brazil.

180
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:30,412
That's... where most coffee is grown.
PJ works with me.

181
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:33,033
He took our corporate jet down
there on business last week.

182
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,660
Well, can you get him back here?
We need to ask him some questions.

183
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,735
He'll want to come home right away.

184
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:42,544
Oh, but, you know, Rio's a ten-hour flight,
so it won't be before tomorrow.

185
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:44,998
Well, we'd appreciate
a heads-up when he lands.

186
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:47,665
Yeah.
I'll call when I know.

187
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:51,449
CRIME LAB ONE POLICE PLAZA
MONDAY, JUNE 4

188
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,415
Dad's story checks out.
The Rio airport confirms

189
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:56,600
that Bartlett’s plane has been 
parked there since last Tuesday.

190
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,172
I wonder if PJ knew about the baby.

191
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,687
Don't know about him,
but Jenna was planning to keep it.

192
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:01,619
How do you know that?

193
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,857
High levels of folic acid
in her system.

194
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,570
- She was taking prenatal.
- You got a lunch date with Ryan?

195
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,268
Special delivery.

196
00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:10,036
Anyone you like for Jenna's murder?

197
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:13,609
Well, fiance was out of the country,

198
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:16,229
so probably a stranger,
maybe a push-in rapist?

199
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:17,350
I don't think so.

200
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,259
That's why you brought
over Jenna's clothes?

201
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,372
They were torn to shreds,
but there wasn't a mark on her...

202
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:22,912
no cuts, no bruises.

203
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,805
Nothing on her skin that
matched up with those tears.

204
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:27,712
- So I asked Ryan to take a look.
- Check it out.

205
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:33,583
Okay, so the tears start out smooth.
They get ragged at the ends.

206
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,427
Your perp used scissors
to start each tear,

207
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:37,244
then ripped it the rest
of the way by hand.

208
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,875
After he killed Jenna,
to make it look like a stranger raped her.

209
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,920
Because it was someone she knew
well enough to have sex with.

210
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,630
Let's make sure our fiance
didn't jet back here for a booty call.

211
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:50,424
"November-Six-Eight-Tango
-Five-Delta."

212
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:54,831
Left last Tuesday for Rio
and hasn't returned. / You're sure.

213
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:58,539
Aircraft just can't fly into
American Airspace willy-nilly.

214
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,710
They have to file
a return flight plan.

215
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,989
Did they file one for today?

216
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:04,320
Not until early this morning.

217
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,535
Mr. Bartlett's plane was scheduled 
to depart Rio at 0600, local time,

218
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,959
which puts them in here at...

219
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,667
- Something wrong?
- Weird.

220
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,549
They should be landing
just before 3:00 this afternoon.

221
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:21,366
But they scheduled
a refueling stop... in Aruba.

222
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,362
Why's that weird?

223
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:26,032
Their G-4 can fly from here
to Tokyo without a pit stop.

224
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:27,744
Rio's a lot closer.

225
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,799
Your victim has some record.

226
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:33,392
Arrests? / Employment.
Jenna was a job hopper.

227
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:36,418
Temp agency said she never worked 
anywhere for more than two months.

228
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,948
- She was fired?
- No. She'd request transfers.

229
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:43,390
"Receptionist at a White-Shore Law Firm.
Secretary to a plastic surgeon.

230
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,980
Event planner for a 
Fortune 500 company."

231
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,805
All jobs where she
could meet rich men.

232
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:49,493
Looks like Jenna
was shopping for a husband.

233
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:51,861
And when she didn't find Mr. Right,
she'd move on.

234
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:55,528
Her last gig was at the Commodities 
Exchange working for the Bartletts.

235
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:58,363
She may not have had a nose for coffee,
but she sure could smell money.

236
00:10:58,363 --> 00:10:59,838
And she went after it
any way she could.

237
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:02,398
One guy dumped her, and she
sued him for breach of promise.

238
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:03,518
She could do that?

239
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:07,006
Be careful, my brother.
Being a player can be very, very costly.

240
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:10,067
Park Avenue surgeon proposed,
then he broke off the engagement.

241
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,378
Find out about her past?

242
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:14,845
Girl went wild. Jenna logged 
a lot of hours at spring break.

243
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:17,027
Apparently, she's
into girl-on-girl action.

244
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:19,583
Not quite the pedigree
for a society doctor's wife.

245
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,967
The court let him off the hook,

246
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,473
but they let her keep
the engagement ring

247
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,506
for pain and suffering...
2 karat rock.

248
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:25,781
Big payday for getting jilted.

249
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:27,719
She was up for an even bigger on.

250
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,930
The Bartletts' net worth
is about a quarter of a billion dollars.

251
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,541
Our little gold digger
caught herself quite a big fish.

252
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,407
You think PJ killed her
to get off the hook?

253
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:36,612
You know, he should be landing soon.

254
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,695
Why don't we go pick him up 
at the airport?

255
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,733
Thanks for the heads-up
you promised.

256
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:47,252
Sorry.
It slipped my mind.

257
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:50,012
Right. Hand your passport
to the customs officer.

258
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,976
What's going on here, Dad?

259
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:55,057
They're police officers, PJ.

260
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:57,647
My son and I are grieving.
You can talk to him tomorrow.

261
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,587
The last entry stamp in here
is for Aruba.

262
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:01,656
- There's nothing for Brazil.
- Oh!

263
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,409
So you were never in Rio.

264
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:06,823
You sent him to Aruba yesterday
after we told you Jenna was dead, huh?

265
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:09,867
So your plane could pick him up and 
make it look like he was in Rio all along.

266
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:12,380
- Wait, I... I didn't kill Jenna.
- Let's go.

267
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,765
You're not taking my son anywhere.

268
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:15,182
So we'll take you both.

269
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:18,305
- For what?
- Obstruction of justice.

270
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:24,513
We don't have enough
to charge PJ with Jenna's murder.

271
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:26,484
Well, if we hadn't collared him,

272
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:29,342
that jet would be on its way back
to Brazil with both Bartletts on board.

273
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,596
So now they're just gonna waltz out
the front door of the courthouse

274
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,297
after a judge slaps them on the wrist
for the obstruction charge.

275
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,941
I think that PJ's soft.
We grill, and he'll give it up.

276
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,392
You think?
Because I think once you mention murder,

277
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:42,626
Richie Rich and Daddy Starbucks out there
are gonna lawyer up.

278
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,219
So what's your plan?

279
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:47,437
You guys are gonna get what we need 
to charge PJ with Jenna's homicide

280
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:49,198
while you and I do
a little legal tap dance.

281
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:50,453
Casey, it's 2:00 in the morning.

282
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:54,265
You can't just snap your fingers
and expect us to PJ to Jenna's murder.

283
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,726
Well, then PJ walks.
It's your choice.

284
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:59,333
Let's wake up O'Halloran,
see what he can give us.

285
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,574
Why don't you call Munch, tell him to haul 
his ass out of bed and get down here.

286
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,336
I apologize for the inconvenience.

287
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,852
My detectives were a little overzealous.

288
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:12,353
- So we're free to go.
- Yes. I voided your arrests.

289
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:14,104
It's as if none of this ever happened.

290
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:17,292
We still need to talk to you
about your relationship with Jenna.

291
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,453
I'll send detectives
to the exchange tomorrow.

292
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:20,433
In front of everyone?

293
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,633
Unless you'd rather answer
a few questions now.

294
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:27,627
Sergeant Munch, would you take
the Bartletts up to the lounge, please?

295
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:31,506
Yeah, but can I put on a pot of coffee
first, for the love of all things holy?

296
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,943
Gentlemen, could you please
have a seat upstairs?

297
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,570
As long as it doesn't take forever.

298
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,299
We've got a conference call
with Addis Ababa at the crack of dawn.

299
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:42,236
- We'll stall as long as we can.
- Good.

300
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,353
Any progress?

301
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:47,430
Warner called. She has the preliminary
DNA matches on Jenna's fetus.

302
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,670
PJ's the father.

303
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,292
What about the semen inside Jenna?

304
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:53,001
Confirmed match.
Also PJ's.

305
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,853
How did Warner know
that DNA belongs to PJ?

306
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:58,902
Wine glass from Jenna's apartment.

307
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:01,312
I pulled epithelial cells
from one of his fingerprints.

308
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:02,329
They show up in the system?

309
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:04,578
SEC prints all traders
before they're bonded.

310
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,143
So PJ and Jenna were having
a romantic glass of wine

311
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,895
before he whacked her
and faked the rape.

312
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,112
Tox screen didn't show
any alcohol in Jenna's system.

313
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:12,814
She probably wouldn't drink
when she's pregnant.

314
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:14,543
Explains why the second glass
and Jenna's prints

315
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:15,808
and nothing but cranberry juice.

316
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,806
Did you get any genetic material
off the lamp?

317
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,304
If there was any,
fire hoses washed it away.

318
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:23,168
- We're screwed.
- Oh, ye of little faith.

319
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:25,690
- I got something else to show you.
- Well, make it quick.

320
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,231
Munch has the Bartletts on ice back 
at the station, and the clock's running.

321
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:31,916
It's, uh, 4:00 in the morning.
Are we done here?

322
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,051
I'm sorry. I have to ask you 
a few more questions.

323
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:37,413
Can't you people afford anything 
better than this high-acid crap?

324
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:40,496
Another shining example
of your taxpayer dollars at work.

325
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:43,765
This stuff is so vile, we won't 
even trade it on the exchange.

326
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:47,000
You know, I took a coffee appreciation 
course at the learning Annex,

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,454
and it turned out it was just
a bunch of Barista wannabes.

328
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:52,968
Yeah, those national chains
have ruined the American palate for coffee.

329
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,528
Can I ask you a question?

330
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,692
How do you make
a good cup of Joe?

331
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:01,366
Well, it starts with
the right water-to-bean ratio.

332
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,609
You can't rush the process.

333
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,420
CRIME LAB
ONE POLICE PLAZA
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 6

334
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,889
We sifted through the ashes
and found something interesting

335
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,549
on the desk in Jenna's apartment.

336
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:12,760
Everything there was burned 
to a crisp.

337
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,045
What are you gonna do,
read a piece of toast?

338
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,208
Even burnt toast still
has bread underneath.

339
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,024
Put a charred piece of paper
between two photographic plates.

340
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,719
Keep them away from light
and develop the film.

341
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,783
And if you're lucky,
you get a negative

342
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:27,619
from which you can create
a photo duplicate of the original document.

343
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:30,621
credit card receipt.
Complete with Jenna's signature.

344
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,488
This receipt's one of the 
few we found intact.

345
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,102
Most of the others
are in fragments.

346
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:36,588
But maybe there's something
you can use.

347
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:41,390
"By and between 
the parties Jenna Ann Ludlow

348
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,023
and Pierson David Bartlett, Jr.
whereas the parties intend to be married

349
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:49,107
- and wish to enter this agreement..."
- It's a prenup.

350
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:50,813
It makes sense.

351
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:53,923
PJ was bringing home the coffee.
He wanted to protect his beans.

352
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:55,536
Or Daddy insisted on it.

353
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,922
I didn't insist that PJ get a prenup.

354
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:00,006
I just... suggested.

355
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:02,867
I bet your suggestions sound
an awful lot like orders.

356
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:06,319
I don't interfere
with my son's personal life.

357
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,824
Orders are for business.

358
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:09,600
Oh, I think this was business.

359
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,243
Your son got Jenna Ludlow pregnant.

360
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:14,794
Now, was she pressuring him
into marriage?

361
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:16,881
Getting married was...
was my idea.

362
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:19,786
So you have wine.
You make love to soften her up.

363
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:21,801
And then you lay the prenup on her.

364
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,133
It didn't work.
Uh...

365
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,154
She went ballistic.
She...

366
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:29,981
she said, "I'm gonna be the mother 
of your child, you don't trust me?"

367
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:33,306
I guess ten grand a month just wasn't 
enough for Jenna anymore, hmm?

368
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:35,055
PJ was wiring her money?

369
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:37,194
From one of your tax shelter accounts.

370
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:39,561
By the way, the IRS
says that those are illegal.

371
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,863
We were just trying
to put aside some cash.

372
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:44,831
Well, Jenna and her baby
were gonna cost you plenty.

373
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,785
Y... you think that my son murdered 
his fiancee just to save a few bucks?

374
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:52,905
I think you found out about the baby.

375
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,093
And Jenna was gonna bleed
PJ for child support.

376
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:57,859
You didn't want her getting her
hooks into half your company.

377
00:16:57,859 --> 00:16:59,942
So you told PJ to handle it.

378
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,732
No. / But you didn't think
that he would kill her.

379
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,540
And when he told you what he did,

380
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,439
you hustled him onto the first
plane out of the country.

381
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:12,012
Dad had nothing to do with it.

382
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,936
Going to Aruba was my idea.

383
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,196
Okay, look, I can help you out here.

384
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:19,623
But you've gotta cowboy up
and tell me everything.

385
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:23,735
Uh... after we fought
about the... the prenup,

386
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:28,195
Jenna threw me out.
I just wanted to get away.

387
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:31,721
Uh... we have a house in Aruba.

388
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:34,282
I asked dad if I could take the jet.

389
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:37,011
But it was in Rio, so he...

390
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:40,231
he drove me to the airport,
and he bought me a plane ticket.

391
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:42,264
And you didn't know
what happened to Jenna.

392
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:45,544
I swear, when I left her apartment,
she was still alive.

393
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,924
I wouldn't kill Jenna.

394
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:50,664
I loved her.

395
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:54,071
Don't say another word, PJ
Avery Hemmings.

396
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:56,563
How dare you interrogate my client 
without counsel present.

397
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,302
Your client didn't ask for counsel.

398
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:00,272
- You okay?
- Yeah.

399
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:03,122
- What did you tell them?
- The truth. I didn't do it.

400
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,953
You should have called me, PJ.

401
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,541
You defend PJ often?

402
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,342
We've been friends since college.

403
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:12,367
Their friendship explains 
why she took his murder case.

404
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,752
Miss Hemming usually tries
SEC violations in federal court.

405
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:17,822
Well, she's in over her head
on this one.

406
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:21,053
Junior's DNA matches
the semen in Jenna and her fetus.

407
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,645
No, it doesn't.

408
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:27,032
PJ's DNA only matches the semen.
I jumped the gun.

409
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,715
Who's the baby's father?

410
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:32,867
Congratulations, PJ.

411
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:34,875
You were gonna be a big brother.

412
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:37,748
- What?
- If this is some kind of trick...

413
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:40,156
No. No trick.
DNA proves it.

414
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:42,707
Big Pierson here's 
Jenna's baby daddy.

415
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:44,803
You screwed her?

416
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:48,140
You slept with my fiancee,
you son of a bitch?

417
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:52,180
I was drunk. She came on to me.
I never meant for it...

418
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:58,058
Hey. Hey, you... hey.
Take it easy.

419
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,488
Come on, back off.

420
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:03,412
Oh, God.
Somebody call an ambulance.

421
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:16,353
After what you did today, I should file 
a complaint with the ethics committee.

422
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:18,900
You're lucky your cheap stunt
didn't kill my client.

423
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,060
We didn't throw PJ through that window.
His father did.

424
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,609
After your detectives baited them 
so they'd turn on each other.

425
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,834
I need to see PJ
I've got to apologize.

426
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:31,258
He doesn't want to talk to you.

427
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:34,008
Then convince him... please.

428
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:36,653
All right.
I'll try.

429
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,370
Any more shenanigans, and I'll make sure

430
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,653
you spend the rest of your short career
tied up in lawsuits.

431
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,288
My son and I have had our problems,
Miss Novak, but he's not a killer.

432
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,639
I'm beginning to think he's right.

433
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:57,944
Are we looking 
at the wrong Bartlett?

434
00:19:57,944 --> 00:20:00,432
Well, marrying PJ
would make Jenna very rich.

435
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,127
But a paternity suit against Pierson Sr's
like hitting the mega millions.

436
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:05,595
Look at them.

437
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:09,777
He pushes his kid through a pane of glass,
and they're still thick as thieves.

438
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,588
There's no way
we're gonna split them up.

439
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,298
Then find something
that ties dad to Jenna's murder.

440
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:19,582
APARTMENT OF JENNA LUDLOW
450 WEST 22ND STREET
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 6

441
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:23,297
Soot is a natural fingerprint dust
under the right conditions. / Which are...

442
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:26,368
Any smooth surface that wasn't
hosed down during the fire.

443
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:29,487
Bathroom's the only room
that was spared. / Okay. Any luck?

444
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,629
Not yet.
But I put our chances at slim to none.

445
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:35,025
Well, Pierson Bartlett was here the night 
Jenna died, so...

446
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,090
you gotta give me something.

447
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,367
You may have to settle
for more burnt toast.

448
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:43,676
Just another batch of photos
from the burnt papers on Jenna's desk.

449
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:49,677
So some more receipts,
phone bill, catalog.

450
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:56,291
What is it?

451
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:00,365
You're sure this stuff
came off the desk.

452
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:02,162
Yeah. Why?

453
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,860
- We were wrong.
- About what?

454
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,505
Why Jenna Ludlow was killed,
and who did it.

455
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,856
So you're dropping
the charges against my client.

456
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:14,165
In your dreams. I'm charging you both with
conspiracy to commit murder.

457
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,210
Conspiracy... this is insane.

458
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,814
Your divide and conquer strategy
blows up in your face,

459
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:20,416
and now they did it together?

460
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,541
You're gunning for disbarment.

461
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,945
Read them and weep.

462
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,260
Where did you get this?

463
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,779
It rose from the ashes
of your fiancee's apartment.

464
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:33,925
What is it?

465
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,293
It's a printed email about the Bartlett's 
top-secret plans

466
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:38,684
to buy a coffee plantation
in El Salvador.

467
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:42,158
Apparently, their coffee's such a find, 
it's going to make them even richer.

468
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:43,827
You wanna tell me
how Jenna got this?

469
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:45,368
You let that tramp
get her hands on this?

470
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:46,784
Well, she must have stolen it
from my briefcase.

471
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:49,022
- How can you be that stupid?
- Shut up.

472
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:50,337
Both of you.

473
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:52,012
Not only was Jenna
going to have your baby,

474
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:54,571
she was threatening to spill
the beans on your big deal.

475
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:57,365
Mr. Bartlett, you're
going to need your own attorney.

476
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:03,045
TRIAL PART 17
MONDAY, AUGUST 6

477
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:06,039
How long have you been in the coffee
trading business, Mr. Bartlett?

478
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,024
40 years. My great-grandfather
started the company in 1896.

479
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:16,629
Uh... this... was his cupping spoon.

480
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,878
I still use it to sample and grade coffee.

481
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:23,553
People's three.
You recognize it?

482
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,108
Yes. That's an email about our plan
to purchase a coffee plantation.

483
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:30,247
What's so special
about this email?

484
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:33,427
Nothing. It's just a piece of routine
business correspondence.

485
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:36,590
And yet the DA thinks 
you killed Jenna Ludlow

486
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,385
in some sinister plot to silence her
when she got hold of it.

487
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:42,905
Sounds like something
out of a trashy beach novel.

488
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:46,512
Mr. Bartlett, did you have anything to do
with the murder of Jenna Ludlow?

489
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:50,154
No. / Thank you.
Nothing further.

490
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:54,713
What kind of coffee grows 
on this plantation, Mr. Bartlett?

491
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:57,188
It's a new Arabica hybrid.

492
00:22:57,188 --> 00:23:00,140
Mild, low caffeine,
class-one quality.

493
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,511
How much would you stand to make
if it were successful?

494
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:07,492
Oh, it depends on whether our beans 
were picked up by one of the big chains.

495
00:23:07,492 --> 00:23:09,977
Would it be fair to say
in the many millions?

496
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,009
From your lips to God's ears.

497
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,290
So if some competitor learned
about your special coffee beans

498
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,646
and bought the plantation
out from under you,

499
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,282
it would be a financial disaster.

500
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:21,065
We'd lose our initial investment.

501
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,393
And the millions
you stand to make.

502
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:26,646
Jenna Ludlow stole that email and 
threatened to sell your trade secrets

503
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,761
- unless you paid her off, didn't she?
- That's not true.

504
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:31,721
But $10,000 a month
in hush money wasn't enough.

505
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:35,108
Like all blackmailers, Jenna got greedy,
so there was only one way to stop her.

506
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:38,006
Jenna wasn't blackmailing us.
That's not what that money was for.

507
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:39,712
What was it for then?

508
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:41,634
It was for the baby.

509
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:46,128
When did you start negotiating to buy 
that coffee plantation in El Salvador?

510
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:47,448
February.

511
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:50,522
February 10th,
according to the email.

512
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:55,796
When did Jenna 
tell you she was pregnant?

513
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:58,726
Uh, Valentine's day.

514
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:00,694
That's why I proposed.

515
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:02,146
People's exhibit ten.

516
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:05,322
The autopsy report on Jenna Ludlow.

517
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:09,768
Could you please read
the highlighted passage?

518
00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:15,912
"Examination of victim's 
uterus reveals a fetus,

519
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,048
estimated age... 
ten weeks."

520
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:24,992
- She wasn't pregnant yet.
- Jenna lied to you.

521
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:28,125
She wasn't pregnant in February
when you started paying her off.

522
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:31,932
Jenna didn't get knocked up
until late March... By your father.

523
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:35,469
PJ, I got more news for you.

524
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:40,217
People's 18. The report from the lab
on the semen found inside Jenna's body.

525
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:44,187
"DNA testing confirms fluids are 
from Pierson Bartlett Junior."

526
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:47,065
Note that sperm are immotile.

527
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,436
PJ, did you know
that you were shooting blanks?

528
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:52,396
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

529
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:57,861
You're wrong. / I'm sorry, PJ
you've just got funky sperm.

530
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:01,296
Jenna was pretending she was pregnant
because you couldn't deliver the goods.

531
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:05,248
Then she figured, hey, why settle for you
when I can bang daddy and really rake it in?

532
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:08,455
- Your Honor, please, she's testifying...
- Jenna loved me.

533
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:12,024
No, Jenna loved your family's money.
And she hit the trifecta.

534
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:13,873
Marrying you,
having daddy's baby,

535
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:16,658
and learning the secret plans
to buy the plantation.

536
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:19,721
I mean, you and dad had no choice
but to solve the Jenna problem,

537
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,974
so what'd you do?
Did you plan it over a late-night latte?

538
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:24,891
- I didn't kill Jenna.
- Oh, so you're saying that he did it.

539
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,637
- Stay strong, son.
- Be quiet, Mr. Bartlett.

540
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,417
Did your father kill Jenna Ludlow?

541
00:25:33,818 --> 00:25:35,880
No, he wouldn't... do that.

542
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,046
I bet you didn't think
he'd screw your fiancee either.

543
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,299
Did he kill Jenna?

544
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:49,826
Uh... I don't know.

545
00:25:49,826 --> 00:25:51,603
PJ... please.

546
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:53,484
Mr. Bartlett,
I am not warning you again.

547
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:55,478
- I put you on that plane.
- Mr. Bartlett.

548
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:57,859
- I did everything I could to save you.
- Mr. Bartlett, please.

549
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,590
- Why are you doing this?
- Counselor, control your client.

550
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:04,119
Thank you.

551
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,868
There's nothing further, Your Honor.

552
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:13,929
I've seen CEOs who rape their employees'
pension funds get better treatment than this.

553
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:16,612
You're the one who screwed your client.
Did you even read the autopsy report?

554
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:17,793
Of course I read it.

555
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:20,036
Then maybe you should go back
to defending white collar criminals,

556
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,322
because a first-year law student
wouldn't miss the age of Jenna's fetus.

557
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:24,641
The trial's not over yet.

558
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:27,950
Oh, yes, it is. Only question is 
how long the jury's out.

559
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,762
TRIAL PART 17
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22

560
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:37,781
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you've been deliberating for nine days.

561
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:41,203
Would further deliberation
Help you reach a unanimous verdict?

562
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:44,890
No, Your Honor. We've been 
hopelessly deadlocked from day one.

563
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,702
Then I have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

564
00:26:47,702 --> 00:26:50,446
Defendants are free on posted bail.

565
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:52,195
This court is adjourned.

566
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,450
We're refilling immediately.

567
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,373
Why waste everyone's time?

568
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:08,476
The verdict's not gonna change.

569
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,740
Hey, Dana, wait up.

570
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,762
Hey, Case, tough break.
You almost had him.

571
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:24,213
Yeah, 11 to 1 to convict.

572
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:25,889
You have any idea what
the hell happened in there?

573
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:28,030
Yeah.
You had one crazy-ass jury.

574
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,324
Crazy how?

575
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:31,422
Day one, I bring them lunch.
Everything's hunky-dory.

576
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:33,100
Second day, 
they're all screaming.

577
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,130
At each other?

578
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,213
No, at the holdout.
Juror number four.

579
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:37,662
I felt sorry for her.

580
00:27:37,662 --> 00:27:40,172
You took pity on the moron
who screwed my case?

581
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:44,055
Not for that. She's a single mom
with a disabled kid.

582
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,819
APARTMENT OF DEBRA JACKSON
712 WEST 181ST STREET
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22

583
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:54,246
Devon has cerebral palsy.

584
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,773
It must be tough.

585
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:57,840
We get by.

586
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:00,798
Why are you here?

587
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,403
I checked your bank account.

588
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:08,553
You deposited $25,000
the day the jury started deliberating.

589
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:11,833
And another $25,000 this morning.

590
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:18,796
I got an interest-only mortgage.

591
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:22,232
And I was doing fine.

592
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,990
Until the rates went up.

593
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:31,637
We lose this place,
we got nowhere to go.

594
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:34,812
And Devon can't live
in a homeless shelter.

595
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:37,531
He's gonna go to foster care

596
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:41,598
while you do 4 and 1/2 years in prison
for selling your not guilty vote.

597
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,397
I know it was wrong.

598
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,484
But I was trapped.

599
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:52,530
They were gonna foreclose
on us next month. Please... Miss Novak.

600
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,910
You tell me what happened,

601
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,501
and I'll cut you a deal.
You won't spend a day in jail.

602
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,428
The night we got the case,
a man called.

603
00:29:05,428 --> 00:29:08,658
Said he knew all about my money problems
and that he could help.

604
00:29:08,658 --> 00:29:10,537
Did he tell you his name?

605
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:15,927
Roger Fromm.
He's a private investigator.

606
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:21,858
- Get away from the shredder.
- Who are you?

607
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:23,467
- Police.
- Where's Roger Fromm?

608
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,050
He retired.

609
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,473
- When?
- About three hours ago.

610
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:28,712
Said he's just come into some money,

611
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:31,543
told me to shred all his records
and gave me a lousy thousand bucks.

612
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:33,459
Where'd he retire to?

613
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:35,491
The Dominican Republic.

614
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:40,746
This is a cross-cutter.
Everything in there is gone for good.

615
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,220
Here's a deal.

616
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,382
You're going to prison unless you 
tell us who your boss was working for.

617
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:47,721
You think that cheap bastard
told me anything about his business?

618
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:49,436
I just answered the phones.

619
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:52,073
He never brought any clients
into this dump.

620
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:55,773
I know who paid him.

621
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:58,890
Pierson Bartlett.

622
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,319
I didn't bribe anyone.

623
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,791
No, that $50,000 payment
to juror number four was charity.

624
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,513
Your errand boy took care
of the bribery part.

625
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:17,027
Roger Fromm? / Your former 
vice president of security.

626
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:20,088
I fired him four years ago.

627
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:22,387
He couldn't keep his mouth off
the business end of a bottle.

628
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,208
So now he's your personal bagman.

629
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,160
Is Mr. Fromm prepared
to testify against my client?

630
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,419
We have a sworn statement
from the juror he bribed.

631
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:30,071
But you don't have Fromm.

632
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,653
Come on, Pierson.

633
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:34,880
- We're not done here.
- Yes, we are.

634
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:42,311
Hey.
Take that steak dinner now.

635
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:43,578
Ouch. What was the bet?

636
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:45,660
That Roger Fromm
erased his computer memory.

637
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,644
He deleted the files,
but he forgot to scrub the hard drive.

638
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:52,377
- That's not Jenna.
- Yeah, but that's PJ.

639
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,007
How many more of these you got?

640
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,957
Hundreds.
With dozens of different girls.

641
00:30:55,957 --> 00:30:59,779
Bartlett had his old crony tailing PJ.
Full-time for years.

642
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:02,805
So why is dad stalking his son?

643
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:04,181
Well, why don't you ask PJ?

644
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:05,972
His lawyer's never gonna
let us question him.

645
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:08,086
But you're not interviewing him 
as a perp.

646
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:10,490
Stalking makes him a special victim.

647
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:16,077
TOWNHOUSE OF P.J. BARTLETT
49 EAST 69TH STREET 
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22

648
00:31:16,077 --> 00:31:18,656
So my father had me under surveillance.

649
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:23,938
Any idea why he'd do that?

650
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:26,819
Uh, sure.
He's a control freak.

651
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:30,061
And he has to be the boss
of everyone and everything.

652
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:33,454
Your father strikes me as somebody
who's used to getting what he wants.

653
00:31:33,454 --> 00:31:37,177
Well, he did from me.
I wanted to be a painter, but ...

654
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:39,508
he made me go into the coffee business,

655
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:42,455
and he made Jenna get into his bed.

656
00:31:42,455 --> 00:31:44,833
- Sure that wasn't her idea?
- Well, he's done it before.

657
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,887
Slept with one of your girlfriends?

658
00:31:46,887 --> 00:31:50,293
Yeah. Yeah.
Right after my mom died.

659
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:53,767
I lost my mother and
my girlfriend in the same month.

660
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,942
You see, everything
with him is a competition.

661
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:00,682
If I make a big trade,
he's gotta make a bigger one.

662
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:05,395
If my girl's 25, he has to show up
with one who's barely legal.

663
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:08,925
Well, you won this round.

664
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:11,163
Jenna was marrying you,
not your father.

665
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,793
Yeah, well, he couldn't
let that happen.

666
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,700
My father and I were not
in a conspiracy to murder Jenna.

667
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,300
He killed her because...
Because he was jealous.

668
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,816
And he was your dad, so he wasn't gonna 
let you go to prison for something he did.

669
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:27,869
He hired Roger Fromm
to bribe that juror.

670
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,469
He bribed that juror
to save his own ass, not mine.

671
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:32,439
And I hope he rots in hell.

672
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:35,797
When are you guys gonna arrest him?

673
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:37,889
As soon as we can tie him to Fromm.

674
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,825
Now, your father
paid for these pictures.

675
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,378
Which means that 
he has to have a set.

676
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,996
Do you have any idea 
where he would keep them?

677
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:48,421
You're gonna burn down my house.

678
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:51,667
Like you burned down Jenna's.
That'd be justice.


679
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:52,743
You have no right to do this.

680
00:32:52,743 --> 00:32:54,567
No, the search warrant says we do.

681
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:55,704
There's nothing in there.

682
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:58,128
Do you think that we're here by accident?

683
00:32:58,128 --> 00:33:00,398
PJ gave you up
because he knows what you did.

684
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:03,483
Last chance... gimme the
combination, or I'm going in.

685
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,113
The hell you are.

686
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:08,504
I have an injunction
invalidating your warrant.

687
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,923
On what grounds?

688
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:13,148
You violated PJ's right to counsel.

689
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:14,781
We weren't questioning him
as a suspect.

690
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:18,296
Nice try. But Judge Tatum saw 
right through your little charade.

691
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:22,140
Avery Hemmings doesn't
know what she's talking about.

692
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,595
You didn't violate PJ's rights.

693
00:33:23,595 --> 00:33:26,528
So get the judge to reverse the injunction,
and restore the warrant.

694
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,571
What's the point, you know, 
Bartlett's already disappeared

695
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,134
- the photos from that safe.
- It doesn't matter.

696
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:33,060
We already have him for Jenna's
murder on his son's say-so.

697
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:35,160
How did Bartlett get here before we did?

698
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,986
You miss the chopper in his backyard?

699
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:38,662
- Congratulations.
- For what?

700
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:42,226
Whatever you said to big daddy,
he's rolling over on his son like road kill.

701
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,990
He fingered PJ for Jenna's murder?

702
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,476
Just waiting on you
to seal the deal, counselor.

703
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:47,860
What did Bartlett say to you?

704
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,094
That he can't protect his son anymore.
And that PJ has a violent streak in him.

705
00:33:52,094 --> 00:33:55,202
PJ did throw the first punch
the day his dad put him through the door.

706
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:58,596
Bartlett also said PJ told him 
he had to get out of the country

707
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:01,513
the night that Jenna died.
That's why he sent him to Aruba.

708
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:02,593
What a mess.

709
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:04,236
First we can't get 
either one of them to talk,

710
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:05,412
not they're flipping on each other.

711
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,111
I'm never gonna get a conviction.

712
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,576
And so what?

713
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:11,252
If Jenna were alive, we'd be
collaring her for blackmail.

714
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:14,005
She's no innocent victim here.
She's a hustler.

715
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:16,468
Hustlers deserve justice too.

716
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:20,863
This discount suit cost 250 bucks.

717
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:22,899
How many times you
gonna watch that thing?

718
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:25,169
Until I figure out
how this little scam artist

719
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:27,612
had such a hold on two powerful
guys like the Bartletts.

720
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,789
Well, she was gonna bleed them
for millions.

721
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:31,734
Okay, so call the cops, 
hire a lawyer,

722
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:33,155
but don't risk everything 
by whacking her.

723
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,982
And I'm gonna help you dress...
to kill.

724
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:37,682
Wait a minute.

725
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:40,279
- What is it?
- You get the evidence inventories?

726
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,730
- Yeah. Right here.
- Come here.

727
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:47,116
- You see something?
- Well, I'll blow it up for you.

728
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:52,126
Look.
That lamp there was the murder weapon.

729
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:55,687
That means Jenna
made this video in her bedroom.

730
00:34:56,262 --> 00:35:00,114
So then why didn't we find any trace
of the camera or videotape?

731
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:26,523
- Bathroom's clear.
- Yeah. How about the bedroom?

732
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:29,772
I opened the pillows, the mattress, 
everything in there...There's nothing.

733
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:31,255
For someone who slept
with coffee traders,

734
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,368
you'd think Jenna
would have brewed better beans.

735
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,391
What do we got brewing here?

736
00:35:38,391 --> 00:35:40,798
SD card.
I can play it on my laptop.

737
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,693
That bedroom cam
sure came in handy.

738
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:47,966
Jenna's got some big insurance policies...
The baby, and now home movies.

739
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:49,761
Maybe she sent a copy
of this to Bartlett,

740
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:51,203
and that's why he didn't
want us in his safe.

741
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:53,683
She puts this on the Internet,
it's a huge scandal.

742
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:55,199
Exchange takes away
Bartlett's seat.

743
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,141
It's bye-bye to his 100-year-old
coffee trading empire.

744
00:35:58,496 --> 00:36:00,089
He tried to buy her off.

745
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:02,348
She decides it's not enough.
He whacks her.

746
00:36:02,348 --> 00:36:04,378
You guys, in the bedroom.

747
00:36:04,378 --> 00:36:07,732
The camera was hidden here
inside the wall.

748
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,704
But how did it shoot through plaster?

749
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:12,022
Didn't have to. 
It's got a remote lens.

750
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:15,357
She probably hid it in the crown molding
on this wall, facing the bed.

751
00:36:15,357 --> 00:36:18,378
Lens burned up.
The camera body's in perfect shape.

752
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:21,987
And... there's an SD card still inside.

753
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:23,819
We didn't come here to watch TV.

754
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:25,495
You should stick around, counselor.

755
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:28,074
You've never seen
a performance like this one.

756
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:31,900
Jenna had a secret booty cam.
You two have starring roles.

757
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,842
She made videos of us
having sex with her?

758
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:35,762
Including the last night you were together.

759
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:39,389
She threatened to sell them to the Tabloids 
if we didn't keep paying her.

760
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:41,140
Dad, why didn't you tell me?

761
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:43,335
I was trying to protect you.

762
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:46,746
Well, you're not gonna
make us watch it, are you?

763
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,913
- No. Just the encore.
- PJ had already come and gone.

764
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:53,267
The killer showed up
after he'd already left.

765
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:54,761
Turn it off.

766
00:36:54,956 --> 00:36:57,048
Why?
It'll prove we're innocent.

767
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,846
I said turn it off.

768
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:01,010
We can fast-forward it.

769
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:05,107
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to this.

770
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:14,806
- I know exactly what you're doing.
- What are you still doing here?

771
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:16,219
He doesn't love you.

772
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:18,085
- I'm not gonna...
- I'm not lying to you.

773
00:37:18,085 --> 00:37:19,510
You're a money-grubbing whore.

774
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,971
You don't know anything about me.

775
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:22,818
Get out.
I'm not going anywhere.

776
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:25,662
Who do you think you are?
Look, we're engaged. / What?

777
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,097
See that ring?
Get out. He loves me.

778
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:30,522
- He doesn’t.
- I said get out.

779
00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:36,742
Avery killed Jenna?

780
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,173
Why? / You're not just gonna let her
get away, are you?

781
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,691
Front door's the only way out of here.
I've already alerted security.

782
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:45,462
They're not gonna let her leave.

783
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:49,180
Emergency stairs to the roof.

784
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:54,731
Avery.

785
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:57,453
Don't come any closer.

786
00:37:57,453 --> 00:38:00,642
- I swear, I'll go over.
- Avery, what did you do?

787
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:03,175
I begged Jenna to let you go.

788
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,192
You wanna know what she said?

789
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:08,513
"He's mine, every last penny."

790
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:13,007
She was no good for you, PJ.
None of them were.

791
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,128
So you had a PI follow me?

792
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:18,283
- Why?
- To protect you.

793
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,680
All of those whores,
they just loved your money.

794
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,858
I loved you, PJ.

795
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:26,042
Ever since college.
I always have.

796
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,935
You almost got me sent to prison.
And my father.

797
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:32,445
That's why I bribed the juror.
I never would have let you get convicted.

798
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,850
I would never do anything to hurt you.

799
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:39,789
I said get back.

800
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,793
- Avery...
- Careful.

801
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:47,285
Avery, we can work this out, okay?

802
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,895
Why don't you just
come with me, all right?

803
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,870
- It's too late.
- No, it's not.

804
00:38:53,904 --> 00:38:57,143
Please.
For me, okay?

805
00:38:57,143 --> 00:38:58,532
Okay.
Come on.

806
00:38:58,532 --> 00:38:59,923
Get away from my son.

807
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,182
- No.
- Bartlett, get back.

808
00:39:01,182 --> 00:39:04,291
- She almost destroyed us.
- Me?

809
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:07,657
This is all your fault.

810
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:10,152
If you hadn't knocked up Jenna,
none of this would have happened.

811
00:39:10,152 --> 00:39:13,135
Back away from her.
She's nuts. / Shut up, dad.

812
00:39:13,135 --> 00:39:15,349
Haven't you done enough damage?

813
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:18,338
I love you, PJ.

814
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:23,253
I love PJ.

815
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:27,305
And I'm never gonna let you
hurt him again.

816
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,757
- Stop!
- PJ!

817
00:39:43,135 --> 00:39:44,300
No!

818
00:39:49,065 --> 00:39:55,041
No, no, please, no.
Please, no God.
