1
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,316
How long was Mr. Richter your patient?

2
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,827
A little over 10 years.

3
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,230
It's imperative that I get in touch with him.

4
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,165
This new information directly
impacts his condition.

5
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,362
This new information you can't tell me about.

6
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,100
You never did say what your specialty was.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,573
I'm a psychiatrist.

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,443
And how did you find out
Mr. Richter was my patient?

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,413
Did you snoop through confidential records?

10
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,382
- Dr. Dysart...
- Dr. Roland,

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,251
I think Mr. Richter probably had
good reason to stop seeing you.

12
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,516
I need to see him, Mr. Garcia.

13
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,926
I am his doctor.

14
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,292
He's never mentioned you.

15
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,127
Why don't we ask him? Is he here?

16
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,725
Derek, this man needs to go.

17
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,932
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Can I leave him a note?

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,872
Jeff. Jeff. It's me, Michael.

19
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,175
Hey. did you get my note?

20
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,772
I don't want to talk to you.

21
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,043
Do you still like steak?

22
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,243
There's a place right over on Lexington...

23
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,945
Listen, you just stay away.

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,318
I faxed that note to Katherine B. Thompson.

25
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,617
She's at the New York Times.

26
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,488
You can tell me all about it right over...

27
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,548
Don't touch me.

28
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,458
Don't ever touch me!

29
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,426
Jeff.

30
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,659
If he ever touches me again, I'll kill him.

31
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,102
Come on, man, let's go back inside.

32
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,840
Say goodbye to Grandma.

33
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,967
I can't believe she's gone.

34
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,904
It's just me now.

35
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,910
You have us. You have Matthew.

36
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,993
Come on, Maisy, one bush
is as good as the next.

37
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,056
Tough doggie.

38
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,399
Finally.

39
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,221
No wallet, no ID in the pocket.

40
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,889
You checked the dog tags?

41
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,298
Oh, right. I'm waiting on that.

42
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,528
Major Case catching muggings now, huh?

43
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,538
Only the ones in the Mayor's backyard.

44
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,198
We're ready for that witness.

45
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,740
I count 11 knife wounds
to the chest, shoulders, neck.

46
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,337
None on the hands or arms.

47
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,344
No defensive wounds.

48
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,681
He's got knife strikes coming
at him from all sides.

49
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,481
He would have put his arms
up to protect himself.

50
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,615
And look at the way he's
tangled up in these vines.

51
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,862
I don't know. This guy was disoriented.

52
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,296
Maybe because somebody
was trying to kill him.

53
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,866
Yeah, but he didn't do the things
that might have saved him.

54
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,598
You found the body?

55
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,573
Yeah, I was jogging. His
dog jumped out of the bushes.

56
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,664
You ever seen him?

57
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,870
Yeah, just before I decided
to turn around and go home,

58
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,105
around 10:00.

59
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,841
Is there a particular reason why
you turned around and went home?

60
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,008
Lightning. Dry lightning.

61
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,245
I caught a flash out of the corner of my eye.

62
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,717
Right. Okay, thanks.

63
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,923
I got an address for Maisy's owner.

64
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,892
Dr. Michael Roland, over on York.

65
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,951
Thanks.

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,261
Dry lightning?

67
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,338
In the park? Behind Gracie Mansion?

68
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,072
Is that where he usually walks your dog?

69
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,168
Yes. It's just so close.

70
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,474
Oh, my God, Michael.

71
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,649
We're very sorry.

72
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,016
He ever mention any problems with his
psychiatric patients, any threats?

73
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,181
No.

74
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,854
What did you think when
your husband didn't come home?

75
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,058
I didn't know what to think.

76
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,625
Did you think that he wasn't walking the dog?

77
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,061
He'd been out of the office a lot,

78
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,504
in the mornings, or in the
middle of the afternoon.

79
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,341
He always had an excuse.

80
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,040
People have been coming over, bringing food.

81
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,673
Yes. My mother passed away.

82
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,342
The service was two days ago.

83
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,414
Well, that must've been very
stressful for you and your husband.

84
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,416
Yes. Yes, it was.

85
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,762
I don't know what problems
Dr. Roland was having at home,

86
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,168
but I can guarantee
he was not having an affair.

87
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,103
I'm not opening these files.

88
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,971
And I'm not giving you
the password for his computer.

89
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,773
Dr. Roland would want his
patients' privacy protected.

90
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,007
Even if one of his patients
tried to kill him?

91
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,049
His patients are neurotic, not psychotic.

92
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,017
You logged on to his computer this
morning, after we called you.

93
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,111
- I did not.
- Says right here you did.

94
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,985
See, I can't open his folders,

95
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,026
but I can get a record of
when somebody last logged on.

96
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,157
So you, what?

97
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,395
You tried to erase his stash
of dirty little pictures?

98
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,936
Compromising e-mails?

99
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,028
Absolutely not.

100
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,540
Maybe she erased her own naughty things.

101
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,069
Were you having a...

102
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,405
you know, fooling around with Dr. Roland?

103
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,413
I didn't erase anything.

104
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,281
His lawyer told me to save
everything till he could look at it.

105
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,620
There.

106
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,887
That e-mail from Dr. Roland's
internet server.

107
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,087
"To user M. Roland,

108
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,357
"the New York Attorney General's
office has notified us

109
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,093
"of your unauthorized
attempts to access NYMEDD."

110
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,725
That's the Medicaid database.

111
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,896
He was trying to hack into it?

112
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,399
Medicaid said Roland was looking

113
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,637
for the records of somebody
named Jeff Richter.

114
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,770
Roland's secretary's never heard of him.

115
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,836
Have we?

116
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,213
There's a Jeff Richter with the
same social security number

117
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,683
Roland used for his search.

118
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,617
He's got a three-year-old assault charge.

119
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,120
- Bring him in.
- Easier said.

120
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,450
His last known's no good.

121
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,357
BCI doesn't have them.
Neither does the DMV, Con Ed...

122
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,122
Look what he gives as his
occupation when he was booked.

123
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,658
"De-programmed CIA assassin."

124
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,257
This guy's got problems.

125
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,463
He doesn't want to be found.
Probably resents people who try.

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,903
Well, he'd better get over it.

127
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,999
Put an APB out to the homeless shelters.

128
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,600
Right.

129
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,169
Okay, all right, thank you.

130
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,580
The weather service says no
reports of lightning last night.

131
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,979
When did Roland hack the Medicaid database?

132
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,992
About three months ago.

133
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,354
It's right after his mother-in-law

134
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,162
was diagnosed with cancer.

135
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,799
Derek saw him just before 9:00.

136
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,307
He was going up to his room.
Nobody saw him after that.

137
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,538
They say the doctor was stabbed 11 times.

138
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,172
He can do that. You know he can do that.

139
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,780
I know.

140
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,186
We have to protect ourselves.

141
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,412
Derek and me will take care of it.

142
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,685
Don't worry.

143
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,219
Work will go on.

144
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,801
Cinderblock. I know Cinderblock rooms.

145
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,494
How many floors underground are we?

146
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,835
We're 11 floors up, Jeff. Didn't you
see the buttons on the elevator?

147
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,602
Up is down. Down is up. I know the tricks.

148
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,734
You're him. He's you.

149
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,106
And who's he?

150
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,838
I don't know him.

151
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,040
You don't know Michael Roland,
your own brother-in-law?

152
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,947
Oh, I know that guy.

153
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,679
But that's a facsimile of that guy.

154
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,984
North Koreans have been turning
out facsimiles for years.

155
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:34,787
When's the last time you saw this facsimile?

156
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,293
Last week at the Garcia House.

157
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,487
He gave me a note about a funeral.

158
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,961
Your mother's funeral.

159
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,554
The whole thing was a trap.

160
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,464
You lived at the Garcia House on 117th?

161
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,769
Yeah, before the facsimile blew my cover.

162
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,833
They asked me to leave so
innocent people wouldn't be hurt.

163
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,140
That's the price you pay
when you work for the CIA.

164
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,772
You were still at Garcia
House Thursday night?

165
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,477
Yes. I ate spaghetti.

166
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,383
I had a smoke on the stoop and I went to bed.

167
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,046
Anybody see you on that stoop?

168
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,818
Millions of people. It's a big city.

169
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,053
No, I see what you're doing, Jeff.

170
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,956
You're using backward logic.

171
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,533
Like, only sick people take pills,

172
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,161
so if I stop taking pills, I...

173
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,870
I won't be sick.

174
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,339
You follow?

175
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,668
- I take my pills.
- Yes.

176
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,177
You didn't have anything on you

177
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,042
when they picked you up at the shelter.

178
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,877
And we looked up your Medicaid account.

179
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,678
No charges in over a year.

180
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,480
That's a lie. I take my pills.

181
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,952
See for yourself.

182
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,864
You know, I know it's hard
to stay on your meds.

183
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,127
It's like your head is,

184
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,736
you know, wrapped in a wet blanket.

185
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:59,800
But if you go off, then, well,
that's when the trouble starts.

186
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,411
Most schizophrenics aren't violent.

187
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,711
But sometimes you are.

188
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,009
That's why they asked you
to leave Garcia House?

189
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,020
It was to protect the innocent.

190
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,920
From you. Because you were starting fights.

191
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,186
I was not. I take my meds.

192
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,250
Geodon. I take Geodon.

193
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,059
Come on, Jeff. You even got
into a fight Thursday night.

194
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,292
You went for a walk.

195
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,594
I don't go out nights.

196
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,464
You ran into Michael and his dog.

197
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,060
I tell you, I don't go out at night.

198
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,366
It's too dark. I don't like it.

199
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,138
I like your socks.

200
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,843
Where'd you get them?

201
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,245
The mission.

202
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,710
Lucky you found a matching pair.

203
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,747
Yeah.

204
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,463
He squints. He doesn't
like going out at night.

205
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,564
He can't distinguish shades.

206
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,797
He's got nyctalopia, night blindness.

207
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,668
He wouldn't have attacked Roland at night,

208
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,264
he would've waited for daytime.

209
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,967
Maybe under normal circumstances,

210
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,068
but this guy hasn't taken
his meds in over a year.

211
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,305
Well, that's another thing.

212
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,144
Geodon only came out on the market last year.

213
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,242
The only way he'd know about
it is if he was taking it.

214
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,150
His fairy godmother must be paying for it

215
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,246
because there's no record Medicaid is.

216
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,814
There's no record of Richter
anywhere this past year.

217
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,518
He took himself off the radar.

218
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,193
More than likely someone else did.

219
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,723
My bet, it wasn't the North Koreans.

220
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,768
Richter applied for a new social
security number last year.

221
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,308
He said he was being stalked.

222
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,469
That's his supporting documentation.

223
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,480
Five pages, typed, single
spaced. I think he had help.

224
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,743
Medicaid ran his new social security number.

225
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,250
Besides his meds,

226
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,254
they pay for his chiropractor twice a week,

227
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,381
his dentist, once a week,

228
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,757
eye doctor, art therapy,
podiatrist, dermatologist.

229
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,057
That guy's sicker than he looks.

230
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,461
Let's find out.

231
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,737
Jeff, how you feeling?

232
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,494
Pretty good.

233
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,539
How's your sciatica?

234
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,443
Medicaid says you see a chiropractor

235
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,676
for sciatica nerve problems in your left leg.

236
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,376
Oh, that's all better.

237
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,713
Your feet? Says here you see a...

238
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,648
Podiatrist.

239
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,253
I have bad arches.

240
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,728
Can we see your feet?

241
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,803
These dogs don't look so bad.

242
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,175
What else does your doctor do
besides clean your feet?

243
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,041
Nothing.

244
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,670
My arches still hurt. I told Mr. Garcia.

245
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,946
Still, you have to admit,
my feet look pretty good.

246
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,981
They should, at $500 bucks a visit.

247
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,626
I had a chat with that doctor.

248
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:09,497
Our medical advisory board said his
fees and methods were pretty standard.

249
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,236
This is your advisory board here?

250
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,965
And lots of heavy hitters.

251
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,768
How's Jeff?

252
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,069
We've been so worried about
him since he ran away.

253
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,672
He told us he was asked to leave.

254
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,043
We don't turn anybody away.

255
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,353
When we bring people in off the street,

256
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,481
we make them a promise,
they'll always have a home.

257
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,954
And you served spaghetti
for dinner Thursday night?

258
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,154
That sounds right.

259
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,323
And after dinner Jeff likes
to have a smoke on the stoop.

260
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,367
I kind of lost track of Jeff that night.

261
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,562
We don't do bed checks,

262
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,562
so all I can say is, I don't...
I didn't see him.

263
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,437
And what about you, Mrs. Garcia?

264
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,140
I was upstairs in our rooms.

265
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,269
All right.

266
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:01,081
Well, so, maybe Jeff was here,

267
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,416
you know, maybe he wasn't.

268
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,445
Did he do any of these?

269
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,656
No. Our other residents.

270
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,921
We take them to art therapy twice a week.

271
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:15,058
Oh. Emily LeCroix, what
was she diagnosed with?

272
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,066
Schizophrenia.

273
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,899
- Really?
- Yes.

274
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,669
It's a wonderful painting, so full of hope.

275
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,907
Well, it certainly is, um,

276
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,808
you know, full of something.

277
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,347
That's my favorite.

278
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,247
Carol James.

279
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,448
Let me guess.

280
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,014
The lady has bipolar disorder.

281
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,328
My mother's roommate at
Carmel Ridge, she's bipolar.

282
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,593
She paints fruit, too.

283
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:53,228
But, you know, bright blue
apples, hot pink bananas.

284
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,340
Her paintings are raw.
They're filled with energy.

285
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,969
She's driven to express herself.

286
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,271
I didn't see any of that in that painting.

287
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,939
And the kids on the beach?

288
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,812
Well, schizophrenics are...

289
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,852
Well, they typically focus on the eyes.

290
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,285
Would have been the
children's eyes, the dog's.

291
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:13,916
No, I think the Garcias probably bought
those paintings at a garage sale.

292
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,826
The Garcias charged Medicaid $200 bucks
a week for Jeff's art therapy classes.

293
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,955
Plus $50 bucks transportation.

294
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,872
You feel like sticking around
for their next field trip?

295
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,701
They drove around for half an hour

296
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,609
and then went back to Garcia House.

297
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,113
Well, they let one of them out.

298
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,117
He had to go to the bathroom, so they
let him take a pee off the pier.

299
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,380
Off the pier? That's compassion.

300
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,682
Compassion has its rewards.

301
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,451
At $50 bucks a head, the
Garcias can charge Medicaid

302
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,992
$800 bucks for transportation.

303
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,494
If there is fraud
and Dr. Roland found out...

304
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,862
Well, the Garcias could have had one
of their counselors take care of him.

305
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,795
If fraud there is.

306
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,767
What do you call Jeff
Richter's $500 pedicures?

307
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,604
The art classes he doesn't
remember attending?

308
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,668
That's your star witness, Jeff Richter,
the one-time murder suspect?

309
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,735
You'd use him to impugn the characters

310
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,145
of two advocates of the homeless

311
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,081
who've earned the respect
of the people of this city?

312
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,641
We've seen their press clippings.

313
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,846
Good. I won't go near a grand jury

314
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:21,289
if your only evidence is the ramblings
of a lone, deranged individual.

315
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,585
How about the ramblings
of 10 deranged individuals?

316
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,863
What the hell did you get me into?

317
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,936
You lumped me in with those quacks.

318
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,272
I'm just saying, Doc, everybody's
got to get their stories straight.

319
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,505
My patients need to continue their treatment.

320
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,240
Which brings me to my last point,

321
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,839
your last state check should have come in.

322
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,282
You need to settle up.

323
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,217
How much do you want?

324
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,780
What the hell are you doing?
I can't take a personal check.

325
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,053
A money order, Doc, same as always.

326
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,791
I have a patient waiting.

327
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,769
You're Emily LeCroix. I saw
your painting at the Garcia House,

328
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,567
the kids on the beach with the dog.

329
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,198
No, I didn't do that.

330
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,707
Well, Mrs. Garcia said you painted
that at your art therapy class.

331
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,009
No. I don't like dogs at all.

332
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,775
Do you take art therapy classes?

333
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,484
Oh, yes. I went last Saturday.

334
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,685
What do you do in these classes?

335
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,615
We painted an office.

336
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,252
You mean you painted a mural on a wall?

337
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,888
Well, sure, we painted the walls.
We painted them white.

338
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,660
But Mr. Garcia said that's
what his friend wanted,

339
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,025
white walls.

340
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:43,437
Is that what they have you do
in these classes, paint walls?

341
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,034
And ceilings. It's very therapeutic.

342
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,480
Thanks, Emily.

343
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,612
Let's hear what the others have to say.

344
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,255
This is Mr. Biagiotti.

345
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,020
Tell them where they take you
every week for drama therapy.

346
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,357
Downtown to watch a show.

347
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,725
Tell them what kind of show.

348
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,628
You know, a TV show.

349
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,634
Care to know how much the Garcias
charge Medicaid for this drama therapy?

350
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,871
I can only guess.

351
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,665
Mr. Biagiotti told me the Garcias had
him change his social security number.

352
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,675
You'll have warrants by the end of the day.

353
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,246
I don't care what this says. You can't
come in like this. Our residents...

354
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,286
That's why we brought the
Department of Health with us.

355
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,413
Is Mrs. Garcia upstairs?
What do you want with my wife?

356
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,979
We have an arrest warrant for her.

357
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,786
We have one for you, too.

358
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,793
What is this?

359
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,730
Mrs. Garcia, you're under arrest.

360
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,096
Put your hands behind your back.

361
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,160
Why are you doing this
to me? I am Lupe Garcia.

362
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,899
This is an injustice.

363
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,976
If I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes...

364
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,739
Well, human misery pays well.

365
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,677
Mr. and Mrs. Garcia did not
go out last Thursday night.

366
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,984
That's for a fact.

367
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,414
You're very sure of this fact.

368
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,587
Mr. Garcia was in this
office from 8:10 to 10:27.

369
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,097
Lupe went upstairs at 9:14.

370
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,033
What about Derek and the other counselors?

371
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,003
Derek Ortiz, certified in special
needs care, punched out at 10:15.

372
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,182
Something wrong with your eyes, Reggie?

373
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,184
I had a recent intraocular scraping.

374
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,512
Cataracts?

375
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,282
Yes.

376
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,686
You take Geodon?

377
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,924
Mmm-hmm. By prescription only.
For my schizophrenia.

378
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,102
Okay, Reggie, thanks.

379
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,498
Okay.

380
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,837
Well, that makes 15.

381
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,778
Fifteen residents with eye problems.

382
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:07,306
Jeff Richter, Mr. Biagiotti from the park,

383
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,681
Reggie...

384
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,646
All of them schizophrenics.

385
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,486
I've just been upstairs.

386
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,287
Tell me I was imagining things.

387
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,758
The faucets really are gold plated.

388
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,392
It's disillusioning, to say the least.

389
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,196
On the bright side, everybody
on staff is accounted for

390
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,894
the night Dr. Roland was killed.

391
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,598
The Garcias might be thieves
but they aren't murderers.

392
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,271
The doctors the Garcias used in their scheme,

393
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,170
they switched them up every six months or so,

394
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,542
except for the eye doctors.

395
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,317
They've used the same one
for the last 3 years.

396
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,449
A Dr. Thomas Dysart.

397
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,895
Maybe he was actually treating these people.

398
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,029
Well, they don't seem better off for it.

399
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:03,537
When Dr. Roland hacked into
Jeff Richter's Medicaid files,

400
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,535
did we find out how far he got?

401
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,844
Jeff Richter? Yes, he is a patient.

402
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,545
But I'd have to look up his file.

403
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,646
We have his Medicaid file right here.

404
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:22,454
This $3,500 charge last September,
what's this code mean?

405
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,925
That's for cataract surgery.

406
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,520
Cataract surgery?

407
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:31,460
Isn't that the same code as this
procedure here, back in June?

408
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,270
Two cataract surgeries in one year?

409
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,663
One for each eye.

410
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,506
I told her you'd have a
logical explanation for that.

411
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,513
Now, are you a fan,

412
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,076
or are these up here to convince your
patients they have eye problems?

413
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,483
I put them up to invite ridiculous questions.

414
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,547
Now, I have a patient in five minutes.

415
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,219
There's a charge here
for another surgery in March.

416
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,490
Which eye was that for, Doctor?

417
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,357
That's for a pre-op exam.

418
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:03,999
You people don't know how lucky you are

419
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,501
not having to deal with Medicaid.

420
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,697
They assign a set fee for a procedure

421
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,297
which has nothing to do with the actual cost.

422
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,239
You're saying you overcharge Medicaid?

423
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,504
No. My billing service sends them an invoice

424
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,104
with all the bells and whistles.

425
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,446
They lowball me. We negotiate.

426
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,349
And I eventually get paid a fair price.

427
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,920
I told her there was a logical
explanation for that, too.

428
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,960
And that's the reason why there
are multiple surgery charges

429
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,759
for your patients at Garcia House.

430
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,225
Garcia House?

431
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,228
Yes.

432
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,672
The homeless are particularly
susceptible to eye problems

433
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,039
because of diet, hygiene, drug use...

434
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,578
But I really don't have
to justify my work to you.

435
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,010
Well, you just did.

436
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,708
You know, speaking for myself,

437
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,644
I'm satisfied.

438
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,746
That's an $8,000 piece
of equipment, Detective.

439
00:22:58,811 --> 00:22:59,915
Don't play with it.

440
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,788
I've always wondered what this was.

441
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,849
It's a transilluminator,
to check pupillary reflex.

442
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,386
Was Dr. Roland satisfied
with your explanation?

443
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,201
Roland? Never heard of him.

444
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,827
Jeff Richter was his brother-in-law.

445
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,031
Dr. Roland was looking for him.

446
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:18,974
Roland tried to hack into
Jeff's medical files.

447
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,577
He managed to download the
charges for the eye treatments

448
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,878
before he got booted off.

449
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,483
Sorry. Never talked to him.

450
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,926
What goes in there?

451
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,895
Nothing.

452
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,270
We bought this at a medical supply
store. It's called a glare tester.

453
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:51,035
That's what was missing
from Dysart's office.

454
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,634
It gives off a bright light
to test the retina's response.

455
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,370
And Dysart used this to blind Dr. Roland?

456
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,712
That's why Roland couldn't defend himself.

457
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,979
Now, this jogger confused

458
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,817
this bright light with dry lightning.

459
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:09,016
And Dysart probably damaged
his in the attack,

460
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,517
so he had to get rid of it.

461
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,156
That's the "how." I don't
quite see the "why."

462
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,861
Even if Dr. Roland discovered
he was defrauding Medicaid...

463
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:23,600
by performing cataract surgeries.
Isn't that assault?

464
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,871
First degree, no less, being
in furtherance of a felony...

465
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,879
Dysart knew he was facing serious prison time.

466
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,944
What actual evidence do you
have to tie him to the murder?

467
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,486
He lives alone, no one
saw him coming or going.

468
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,717
We could canvass the park again.

469
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,692
In the meantime, we'll build
an assault and fraud case,

470
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,820
have our own doctors examine his patients,

471
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,591
and talk to his billing service.

472
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,933
Tom, I'm your malpractice attorney.

473
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,629
This is beyond my field of...

474
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,832
I hate when you equivocate, Norman.

475
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,039
You will most certainly be charged
as an accomplice to the Garcias.

476
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,410
But it gets worse,

477
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,245
since you performed surgery on these people.

478
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,649
I'm not guilty, Norman.

479
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,950
Of course not. But you're
open to assault charges,

480
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,925
unless you can demonstrate that the
procedures are medically legitimate.

481
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,324
They are!

482
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,494
The patients are undergoing a
legitimate course of treatment.

483
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:22,588
Results.

484
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,301
You have to prove it with results.

485
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,030
Beneficial results.

486
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,871
You mean, someone who's
completed the treatment.

487
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,877
Yes. A success story. Can you do that?

488
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,243
Dr. Dysart sent us the worksheets

489
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,512
with the procedures checked off.

490
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,646
I had no way of telling if he
actually performed those procedures.

491
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,853
She's not trained to do medical
oversight. She's just a bookkeeper.

492
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,156
Dysart gave us a cock and bull story

493
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,697
about Medicaid lowballing his fees.

494
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,397
No, he's right.

495
00:25:56,455 --> 00:26:00,232
When I took over his billing, I noticed
he was being shortchanged on his fees.

496
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,837
It was your idea to inflate
the charges to Medicaid?

497
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,008
It's standard practice
to negotiate for every nickel.

498
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,510
Dr. Dysart must have been thrilled
you came up with this idea.

499
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,749
I don't think he cared.

500
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,218
Getting paid wasn't a priority.

501
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,725
He was always late getting
his worksheets to me.

502
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,797
He was probably too busy moving
patients in and out of his office.

503
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,567
I'd be surprised if he saw
more than 10 patients a day.

504
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,898
My other eye doctors,

505
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,961
they see that many patients in an hour.

506
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,503
You gotta hear this.

507
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,377
Dr. Emerson was just giving us his report

508
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,282
on Dysart's Garcia House patients.

509
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,982
Go ahead, Doctor.

510
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:55,153
I examined the 15 residents
Dysart operated on.

511
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,085
These individuals were subjected
to repeated and needless

512
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,954
retinal, corneal, and cataract surgeries

513
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,795
for a period of over two years.

514
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,996
Some had as many as 18
procedures during that time.

515
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,504
With what results?

516
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,307
Five have permanently detached retinas,

517
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,605
others have diminished vision,

518
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,271
oversensitivity to light, night blindness.

519
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,111
They all have surgical scars
on top of surgical scars.

520
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,878
They got laser cuts going nowhere.

521
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,648
Dysart said these people had unique eye
problems because they'd been homeless.

522
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,758
I don't care if these people
were living on Mars.

523
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,157
In my experience,

524
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,991
there is no medical justification for this...

525
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,088
This butchery.

526
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,156
You made your point, Doctor. Thank you.

527
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,864
Where are we on the murder?

528
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,400
We canvassed the park, we showed his
photo around, we fanned on every pitch.

529
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,707
But we still have him on fraud

530
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,247
and for assaulting these poor bastards.

531
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,907
He could simply claim incompetence

532
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,178
and hide behind his malpractice insurance.

533
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,686
We need proof he intended to defraud.

534
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,189
You're talking about making
a deal with the Garcias.

535
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,020
Not a generous deal, but a deal.

536
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,753
If it gets us Dysart.

537
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,560
Greedy son of a bitch.

538
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,598
It's worse than that. I don't
think he did it for money.

539
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,614
These are the doctors' statements
about the kickbacks to the Garcias.

540
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,515
This is from a livery service
whose offices were painted

541
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:30,645
by the residents of the Garcia House

542
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,916
under the guise of art therapy.

543
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,490
And this is from the staff

544
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,153
about field trips to parking lots.

545
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:43,328
You have your statements, we have ours.

546
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,602
From mental health advocates, civic leaders,

547
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,571
all testifying to the fact that
hundreds of mentally disabled persons

548
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:52,165
have been helped by the Garcias.

549
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,145
There are words and then there are pictures.

550
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:02,116
This is the work of your
ophthalmologist, Dr. Dysart.

551
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:11,656
You see this?

552
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,191
You see that?

553
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:20,328
That's Emily LeCroix's left eye, post-op.

554
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,366
That scar tissue is from three operations

555
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,466
in less than six months.

556
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:31,445
Thanks to Dr. Dysart, she's
legally blind in that eye.

557
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,214
This is Jeff Richter's eye.

558
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,548
Dysart didn't wait for his scars
to heal from one operation

559
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,316
before operating on him again.

560
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,449
So now he needs corneal transplants.

561
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,588
Dios. We didn't know that he was doing this.

562
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,562
Mrs. Garcia, wait.

563
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,428
What do you want from my clients?

564
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:50,933
Dysart.

565
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,068
You help us prosecute him,
I'll consider a plea.

566
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,164
First, I hear what they have to say.

567
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,274
He was just supposed to examine them.

568
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,471
I told him not to hurt them.

569
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,441
Where'd you find Dysart?

570
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,614
He came to me at a mental health benefit.

571
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,316
He'd heard about our work with schizophrenics

572
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,183
and offered his services.

573
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:18,357
He specifically mentioned schizophrenics?

574
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:19,924
Yeah.

575
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:23,563
He asked me how many diagnosed schizophrenics

576
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,568
were living at the house.

577
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,099
Did he say why he was interested?

578
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,102
No. He just wanted to work
with us, any way he could.

579
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,166
If you want their testimony against Dysart,

580
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,304
you'll reduce the charges
to misdemeanor larceny,

581
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,040
they'll pay a fine,

582
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:43,211
they'll retain their license
to operate Garcia House.

583
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,821
I can't accept their terms.

584
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,017
Dysart's a sadist with a medical license.

585
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,890
Looks to me he's the greater of two evils.

586
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,951
I want to put them all behind bars.

587
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:56,329
That means making a case against
Dysart without the Garcias' help.

588
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,766
Everything his bookkeeper tells us

589
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:01,236
demonstrates Dysart's indifferent to money.

590
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,273
He's in it for the joy of healing?

591
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,932
I'm not sure.

592
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,566
He targets schizophrenics.

593
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,508
Because they're easy prey.

594
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,676
So is any mentally ill person.

595
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,843
But schizophrenics, more
than any other group,

596
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,250
are more prone to visual hallucinations.

597
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,846
You're not suggesting
that this was an experiment?

598
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,892
You eliminate greed and sadism, what's left?

599
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:26,623
Experimental surgery without informed
consent, without supervision,

600
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,426
that's good for a trip up the river.

601
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,296
Get me the evidence.

602
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,062
Well, you don't do research

603
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,569
without a theory to back it up.

604
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,902
He might've published
a paper in a medical journal

605
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:39,272
or talked it up with a colleague.

606
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,182
I haven't spoken to Tom
since Columbia, 10 years ago.

607
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,742
I wouldn't know about his research.

608
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,446
You might try someone who's more current.

609
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,648
We couldn't find anybody.

610
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,748
We only came to you because
he used you as a reference

611
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,316
when he applied to the
Ophthalmological Association.

612
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,589
Ophthalmology? You sure?

613
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,397
That wasn't his specialty when you knew him?

614
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:05,128
No. It was oncology, same as me.

615
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,296
He lose interest?

616
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,963
I have no idea.

617
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,633
We had one year left.
I spent the summer in Boston.

618
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,266
When I came back, he was gone.

619
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,038
They said he took a sabbatical.

620
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,374
What did he say?

621
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,914
I never talked to him.

622
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,880
I didn't even know where he was.

623
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,578
Then, a year later, he got in touch with me.

624
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,520
Let me guess. He was in Amsterdam.

625
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,217
This is from the Van Gogh
Museum. It's on the back.

626
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,318
He sent me that as a graduation gift.

627
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,394
Never heard from him again.

628
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:41,236
And he never expressed
an interest in ophthalmology?

629
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,431
No.

630
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,134
Maybe when he was smoking
that legal weed in Amsterdam,

631
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,734
he figured out eye doctors have
a better chance of getting laid

632
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,937
than oncologists.

633
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,511
I don't think he was in
Amsterdam for the weed.

634
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,076
Look up for me, please.

635
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:01,354
Good. Now look to the left. Okay.

636
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,987
Dr. Dysart, I'm not sure
I understood you on the phone.

637
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,395
Marilyn's going into the
next phase of her treatment.

638
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,528
It's all covered by her Medicaid.

639
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,695
Are you still on Zyprexa, Marilyn?

640
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,897
My eyes are okay, Dr. Dysart.

641
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,908
It's been two years since
she's had any blurriness.

642
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,375
It's a multiphase treatment.

643
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,275
If we stop now, she'll never get better.

644
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,372
I assume you want Marilyn
to get better, don't you?

645
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,652
Columbia just faxed Dysart's records.

646
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,689
When he came back from his year off,

647
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,748
he doubled his workload to complete
his requirements for ophthalmology.

648
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,760
Finished in the top percentile.

649
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,288
He spent most of his sabbatical in Amsterdam.

650
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,832
He gave Columbia an address at a hotel there.

651
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,995
On Paulus Potterstraat. That's the same
street as the Van Gogh Museum.

652
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:51,139
Maybe Dysart was thinking of
becoming a reconstructive surgeon.

653
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,039
The story is,

654
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,410
Van Gogh gave his ear to a prostitute as,

655
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,244
you know, a token of love.

656
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:05,149
But who knows, what he was,
you know, really thinking.

657
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,976
All right, Marilyn, you've
been through this before.

658
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,670
I'm going to lower the chair.

659
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,203
Is my mother still here?

660
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,215
She's just outside.

661
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:37,318
This is a local anesthetic.

662
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:41,585
You've had this before.
Nothing to be worried about.

663
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,298
Put the needle down, Doctor.

664
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,164
What? Get out of here. I'm with a patient!

665
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,203
You're under arrest, Dr. Dysart.

666
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,704
What the hell do you think you're doing?

667
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,103
I'd ask you the same thing,

668
00:34:57,162 --> 00:35:00,234
but the answer would probably
make my hair stand on end.

669
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,609
It's unheard of.

670
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,013
Arresting a doctor in
the middle of a surgery?

671
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,484
Or as we call it, during
the commission of a crime.

672
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,020
Every procedure he performs

673
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,852
is guided by sound medical practice.

674
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,825
Well, maybe he can explain
which sound medical practice

675
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,986
guided him during these procedures.

676
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,886
This laser incision here,

677
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,990
our experts couldn't
figure out what it was for.

678
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,762
- Was it a mistake, a slip...
- I don't make...

679
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,532
My client hardly has to explain
himself to a couple of laymen.

680
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,301
Either two laymen now or 12 later.

681
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,802
Our experts were also mystified

682
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,439
by the multiple operations
to Miss LeCroix's left eye,

683
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,244
while it seems you hardly touched her right.

684
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,909
Did Medicaid only cover the left?

685
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,546
There is no medical explanation, is there?

686
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,418
His practice is exactly what it looks like,

687
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:53,020
a state-funded eyeball chop shop.

688
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,062
He's not going to respond.

689
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,499
If you're just going to engage
in character assassination...

690
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,035
There's no character there.

691
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,004
There's just this greedy,

692
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,042
grasping charnel house butcher

693
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,175
who's targeted schizophrenics

694
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,907
because nobody would believe
them if they complained.

695
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,381
Nobody would believe that a doctor would

696
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,651
deliberately mutilate
their eyes to make a buck.

697
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,244
That is not true.

698
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,347
I am not a butcher. I was treating them.

699
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,724
This cut was made to relax the upper zonules.

700
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,887
- Tom...
- And this.

701
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,294
Her presbyopia required me to scrape the lens

702
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,855
before a cortical cataract formed.

703
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,423
You're losing me.

704
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,300
You have to show us.

705
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,107
Show us how you helped these people.

706
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,505
The eye...

707
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,139
80% of our sensory intake
comes through the eye.

708
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,877
The brain interprets what the eye captures.

709
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,283
But these people, Doctor,
these schizophrenics...

710
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,083
Schizophrenia, specifically
the visual hallucinations,

711
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,682
occur when the sensory intake,
the information is corrupted.

712
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,193
Corrupted.

713
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,422
You mean, by the eye?

714
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,294
No. By the lens, here.

715
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:06,796
Corrupt information hits the
posterior subcapsular cataract

716
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,462
- back here, which blocks...
- The optic nerve.

717
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,398
Yes, which leads to the brain.

718
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:15,343
What I do is remove the
tainted part of the lens

719
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,381
by performing an extracapular
cataract extraction

720
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,642
to clean the lens.

721
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:23,584
So, a clean lens

722
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,087
let’s more light into the optic nerve?

723
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:30,820
Yes. More light stimulates the retina

724
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,862
which clears up the hallucinations.

725
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,295
You've actually succeeded?

726
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,463
Not yet.

727
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:42,971
I was in the final phase of treatment

728
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,904
on Marilyn Reese when you interrupted me.

729
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:47,204
All right, so, you get rid
of the hallucinations

730
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,801
and you get rid of the schizophrenia.

731
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,711
Is that the idea?

732
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,149
Yes. The patient is free of the disease.

733
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,311
Only sick people take pills.

734
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,946
If I stop taking my pills,
I won't be sick anymore.

735
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,918
Well, this is...

736
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,764
Well, it's...

737
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,028
Revolutionary.

738
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,861
When did you discover this treatment?

739
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,597
My last year at Columbia.

740
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,468
Right after your sabbatical.

741
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:23,369
Which is when you switched specialties.

742
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,778
Yes. How did you know...

743
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,016
Well, I have an interest in your career.

744
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,747
Why did you take the sabbatical?

745
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,882
I was exhausted.

746
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:39,190
I needed to clear my head,
reorder my priorities.

747
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,758
So you went to Amsterdam.

748
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,402
Is that where you developed an interest

749
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,595
in Van Gogh?

750
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,200
I'd always been attracted to his work.

751
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,337
But it was in Amsterdam where his work,

752
00:38:57,402 --> 00:39:00,849
well, acquired a special meaning for you.

753
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,379
I mean, as it does many people

754
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,719
whose lives are touched with schizophrenia,

755
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,850
which means split mind,

756
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,019
which is really misleading
because the mind isn't split,

757
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,996
it's just out of its owner's control...

758
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,430
That isn't accurate either.

759
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,764
It's simply responding to corrupted stimuli.

760
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,996
Real physical abnormalities
in the sensory organs.

761
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,404
Yes.

762
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,376
You talking about this?

763
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,815
Most people think he cut it off for love.

764
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:39,583
But some people say he cut it off

765
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,590
to stop the auditory hallucinations

766
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,284
from driving him crazy.

767
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,130
Isn't that where you got the idea?

768
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,805
That the disease isn't in the brain,

769
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:07,008
it's in the eyes, the ears, the fingertips.

770
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:13,584
But the brain is... your brain is healthy.

771
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,051
It's inconceivable that this instrument

772
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,323
that took you to the top
of your class at Columbia

773
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,092
could ever betray you.

774
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,062
It's intolerable.

775
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,606
How old were you, Doctor?

776
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,910
27?

777
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,010
My mother was 32...

778
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,245
There's nothing wrong with me.

779
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:47,017
No. Nothing wrong. Yes, you have schizophrenia.

780
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:53,959
That's... That's of no consequence.

781
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,561
My methods are sound.

782
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,005
You had a crisis.

783
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:12,271
10 years ago, you ran away to Europe.

784
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,139
You kept it a secret

785
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:19,615
while you applied your wounded
intellect to the problem.

786
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:24,017
And this is what you came up with. And this.

787
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,528
No! No! No!

788
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,359
I am fully in control of myself.

789
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,421
What you're afraid of, right,

790
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,832
people are going to find out,
pump you full of drugs,

791
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,870
- institutionalize you.
- There'd be no need.

792
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,964
You must have been terrified when
Roland showed up at your office.

793
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,031
Terrified that this psychiatrist

794
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,305
would see through your professional demeanor.

795
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,573
He was there under false pretenses.

796
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,705
He was conspiring to put you out of business.

797
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,840
They don't understand.

798
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,442
Your cure can make people with your
condition masters of their own fate.

799
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,011
- Yes.
- No more drugs, no more stigma.

800
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,182
- Yes.
- No more fear and shame.

801
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:59,217
No, you had to save yourself.
You had to stop Roland.

802
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,126
- Yes.
- You had to kill him.

803
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:06,427
Yes.

804
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:14,072
Oh, no. Now, I have to get back to my work.

805
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:19,246
Yeah. I need to get back to my work.

806
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,549
Please let me get back to my work.

807
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:40,829
We agreed to a plea of not guilty
by reason of mental disease.

808
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,338
Dr. Dysart agreed to be institutionalized

809
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,501
until our experts decide he's
no longer a danger to society.

810
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,635
He must be insane.

811
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,804
He's the only one who
wasn't in it for the money.

812
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,813
Where's Detective Goren?

813
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,147
On the phone.

814
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,154
Don't ask.
