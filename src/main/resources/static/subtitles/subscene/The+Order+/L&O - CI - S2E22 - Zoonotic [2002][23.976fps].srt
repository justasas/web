1
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,456
It’s Twyla's most accessible work.

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,688
I took a chance and got us tickets.

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,858
I hope you like dance. I'm game for anything.

4
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:21,962
I get so wrapped up in my work,

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,798
I forget there's a whole
other world out there.

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,065
It's time you enjoyed your life.

7
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,034
Here's to...

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,533
Here's to opening new doors.

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,245
It's my service. Sorry.

10
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,843
Dr. Stern here. Mmm-hmm.

11
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,045
Tell him the results are positive

12
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,489
and we'll resolve the problem Friday.

13
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,854
Oh, and no more calls tonight.

14
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,893
Come on, Melissa. It’s getting late.

15
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,497
I'll see you Friday.

16
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,132
Buzz, we're going to Florida next weekend.

17
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,972
I don't want to go with Ted,
I want to go with Daddy.

18
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,946
Oh, we will, honey. Real soon.

19
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,508
I'll take us all to Florida.

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,109
Give your Daddy a kiss. Get in the car.

21
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,389
Buzz, you know about making promises.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,190
This is one I'm, I'm gonna keep.

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,600
Listen, I'll come in. So we're clear,

24
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,643
you do not want to mess with me.

25
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,081
I just got into the city.

26
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,747
What?

27
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,413
But you...

28
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,825
All right, I got it. Back of the train.

29
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,826
You listen, no more changes.

30
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,916
Hey!

31
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,081
Help, I'm stuck!

32
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,409
We have bloody shoe prints,

33
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,149
a partial heading back to
the exit at the other end.

34
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,555
- Why not use that exit?
- Out of order.

35
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,120
Officer William Davis, Suffolk County PD.

36
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,167
He's a long way from home.

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,669
Well, he tried to let his
assailant know he was a cop.

38
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,970
Would've been better off
reaching for his piece.

39
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,176
He's wearing a vest. He expected trouble.

40
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,872
He found it.

41
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,980
So the killer...

42
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:05,249
He threaded the bars of the
gate and found major arteries.

43
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,258
He was sure-handed.

44
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,290
Unless these wounds are just for show.

45
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,524
Davis might've been trailing someone.

46
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,529
A pen.

47
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,166
No memo pad.

48
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,337
Buzz was a dedicated officer.

49
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,972
If he was on someone's tail,
he'd just keep doggin' the guy.

50
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,983
His case log has a butcher shop break-in,

51
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,144
vandalism at a laundromat.

52
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,513
Which of these was he dogging in the city?

53
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,251
- It'd be in his memo book.
- Which was swiped.

54
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,895
According to this time sheet, he
punched out at 4:00 yesterday.

55
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,022
You know how it is. You punch
out, you keep working.

56
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,132
Cigarettes.

57
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,461
From the reservation?

58
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,071
A smuggling investigation?

59
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,167
I'm not saying he was Serpico.

60
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,976
If Buzz was killed in the line of duty,

61
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,086
it doubles his family's death benefit.

62
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,681
Okay.

63
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,853
He's going through a divorce.
He's got child support, legal fees.

64
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,155
So he's been moonlighting. Any other sidelines

65
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,389
besides selling off-tax cigarettes?

66
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,663
That's the only one I heard of.

67
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,925
Maybe the one you didn't hear about

68
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,368
is the one that caught up with him.

69
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,275
How come all divorced cops
have the same decorator?

70
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,108
A diagnostic manual, medical encyclopedia.

71
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,317
The PDR.

72
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,054
Unless this guy's a hypochondriac,

73
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,647
he's not reading these for pleasure.

74
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,286
This was his bedtime reading.
Escort ads and 800 numbers.

75
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,956
That painting.

76
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,062
There was something bigger hanging here.

77
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,911
How many 8-year-old girls
you know who like sports cars?

78
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,479
Besides me?

79
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,686
It’s freshly cut.

80
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,400
Nothing.

81
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,769
Unless that's what he was
picking up in the city.

82
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,637
Something to stash in there.

83
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,080
We were saying goodbye,

84
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,073
and then he promised to take us to Florida.

85
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,887
He said this time he meant it.

86
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,216
And I almost believed him.

87
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,252
He give any hint how he was
going to pay for this trip?

88
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,263
No, but I figured it was his raise.

89
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,491
What raise?

90
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,031
He was up for a promotion, to detective.

91
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,402
They probably told you that at the station.

92
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,532
No, nobody mentioned it. Did he
say why he was being promoted?

93
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:15,046
He was close to cracking a
very big case. Medicare fraud.

94
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,443
That explains the medical books.

95
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:23,120
You're a secretary, Janice,
at an insurance company?

96
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,713
- A medical insurance company?
- Yes.

97
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,228
I bet your adjusters use these
in the office all the time.

98
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,993
If Buzz was investigating Medicare fraud,

99
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,792
he'd need access to insurance records.

100
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,541
Buzz being a quick-thinking cop,

101
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,074
he would've looked for a shortcut.

102
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,973
Especially if it was for critical information.

103
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,842
He would've looked for a computer password,

104
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,514
like this one here.

105
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,448
Maybe your password?

106
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,685
He said if I loaned him my password

107
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,061
it would be like giving him
the last piece to the puzzle.

108
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,462
He'd get promoted.

109
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,361
And Melissa could be proud of her Daddy.

110
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,577
The officer will take you home.

111
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,615
Her company can tell us
what files he accessed.

112
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,556
Maybe instead of investigating
fraud, Buzz was committing it.

113
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,064
Buzz, he was boning up

114
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,658
on infectious diseases.

115
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,703
Infectious diseases

116
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,769
and escort ads.

117
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,082
Have you told anyone about me yet?

118
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,359
There isn't much to tell yet.

119
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:12,791
Other than outside a spa, I've never
seen so many jets in one shower.

120
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,824
I like a clean body.

121
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,100
You're so beautiful.

122
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,234
There really isn't a jealous
boyfriend somewhere?

123
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,808
No, not for the last 3 years.

124
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,878
I've gotten used to being alone.

125
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,851
From now on, you'll be anything but alone.

126
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,291
Hi, Bobby. I'm Angel.

127
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,758
Come on in. Can I take your coat?

128
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,998
Oh, hi. He didn't mention he had a friend.

129
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,301
Actually, I'm his partner.

130
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,242
Whatever. You're cute.

131
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,809
Can you get me something from the mini?

132
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,209
Oh.

133
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,919
Right, "partner."

134
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,215
Do you remember on the phone,
when I didn't discuss specifics?

135
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,153
- I just came here for a little conversation.
- Save it.

136
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,959
We just want to ask you about one
of your conversation buddies.

137
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,157
I don't know him.

138
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,896
You should. His phone records have
him calling you every other week.

139
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,702
Hey, you know, it's Friday night.

140
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:33,903
I'm sure there's lots of guys out there
that are dying for, uh, conversation.

141
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,909
But if you'd rather sit here
with us all night...

142
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,542
Okay. I know him.

143
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,678
Buzz, the cop, right?

144
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,050
The first time we hooked up, he tinned me.

145
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,383
Then he asked for a PBA discount.

146
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,586
$50 bucks.

147
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,194
I tell you, you give a guy a badge and...

148
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,034
Did he ask about any of your other clients?

149
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,398
All cops are nosy.

150
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,470
What did he want to know about your clients?

151
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,070
Just who they were, where they worked.

152
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,642
Did he ask you if any of them had
a sexually transmitted disease

153
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,049
or any other infections?

154
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,679
Yeah, sure. But I think he
was just being careful.

155
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,926
Your regulars, any of them
stop seeing you lately?

156
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,429
Well, Reverend Tony

157
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,300
and Mr. Cabezas, a couple others.

158
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,860
We'll need telephone numbers,
whatever you have on them.

159
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,405
Buzz could have been looking at
her Johns' medical histories

160
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,778
and then using that information
to shake them down.

161
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,839
And one of the Johns shook back.

162
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,820
He said he was a police officer.

163
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,415
He shows me a badge, and
then he asks me for money,

164
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,121
otherwise he was gonna arrest me
in front of my wife and kids.

165
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,186
He blackmailed you. How much?

166
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,961
$1,600. That was all my savings.

167
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,029
And what did he have on you?

168
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,842
Evidence that you'd been treated

169
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,673
for a sexually transmitted disease?

170
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,145
No, no. I've never been treated for that.

171
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,978
Listen, I know that what I
did with Angel was wrong,

172
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,381
but it was safe.

173
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,119
Buzz took him for $1,600.

174
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,623
Pretty much the same
ballpark as the other Johns.

175
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,252
But it doesn't seem like he was blackmailing
them with their medical records.

176
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,922
Okay. As dirty as Davis was, he's
still a member of the family.

177
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,958
Let's keep this from the
press, for his kid's sake.

178
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,069
It would've taken 50 Johns to
fill up the hole in Buzz's wall.

179
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,873
Buzz had to be going for bigger fish.

180
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,379
Well, it looks like he was trying.

181
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,938
The insurance company
tracked the files he accessed.

182
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,782
The patient records of 3 doctors.

183
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,752
2 on the Upper East Side,

184
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,155
1 in Soho.

185
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,689
Why would someone access my patient records?

186
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:06,526
We believe the hacker was targeting
male patients with STDs.

187
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,265
We refer those out.

188
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,564
We're loathe to use antibiotics,
as are our patients.

189
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,165
Dr. Kantor, you're not the
subject of this investigation.

190
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,541
Of course not.

191
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,605
You don't believe us.

192
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,437
Is that because you've been
investigated before,

193
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,950
because you practice unconventional medicine?

194
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,178
Yes.

195
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:32,189
The AMA, the insurance
companies, managed care.

196
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,357
Has anybody bothered you lately?

197
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,885
The IRS called about 4 weeks ago.

198
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,589
They asked about your patients?

199
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,260
The investigator had a tip that some of
them took inflated medical deductions.

200
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,962
It was pure harassment.

201
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,469
Who were the patients?

202
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,666
One has lupus,

203
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,642
the other a tropical disease she's
been fighting for the past few weeks.

204
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,444
All women?

205
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,107
Yes. And none of them had an STD.

206
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,288
The last time I spoke
to the IRS was 8 years ago

207
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,824
over a tax shelter my former
accountant got me into.

208
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,793
Well, this would have been somebody
pretending to be an IRS investigator.

209
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,497
The same somebody who hacked into
your patients' insurance records.

210
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,862
Why would someone do that?

211
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,131
We think he was looking for embarrassing
information to blackmail your patients.

212
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,604
Maybe a married patient with an STD.

213
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,537
I don't handle STDs. Not
my specialty. I'm more...

214
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,907
Internal medicine. Yale.

215
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,709
And, uh, here you're being honored
for your work in South Africa,

216
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,885
combating infectious diseases.

217
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,226
We went into the townships,
we did what we could.

218
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,557
The diseases we saw were fascinating.

219
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,722
The way they mutate, they'll outlive us all.

220
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:50,393
You didn't bring this little fellow
all the way from Africa, did you?

221
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,869
Look, look, he brought a tiger
cub to the kids at St. Teresa's.

222
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,167
There are no tigers in Africa.

223
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,302
Not even in the Cape Town Zoo?

224
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,074
We'd like to go through your
patients' files with you.

225
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,380
See if anybody in there might fit
the bill as a blackmail victim.

226
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,913
I highly doubt it's worth your time.

227
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,823
Most of my patients have digestive
problems. Acid reflux, stuff like that.

228
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,150
I have to tell you, it doesn't sound like

229
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,786
the sort of thing blackmailers look for.

230
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:23,664
Dr. Stern, I gotta tell you,
blackmailing is right up our alley.

231
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,766
I mean, we are pretty good at
sniffing out potential victims.

232
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,707
My partner might be a little
hard on the furniture,

233
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,439
but he's right about sniffing
out blackmail victims.

234
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,775
There's just a little
matter of patient privilege.

235
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,546
You should discuss this with my attorney.

236
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,348
Let me give you his number.

237
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,524
You're already fobbing
us off on your attorney?

238
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,994
I don't like lawsuits from my patients.

239
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,992
Your hand shakes.

240
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:56,989
Uh-uh.

241
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,761
It's either nerves, or an intention tremor.

242
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,632
An intention tremor. It started in college.

243
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,777
I guess that eliminated surgery for you.

244
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:13,173
No loss. Even in college, I let my
lab partners do the dissecting.

245
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,018
Stern couldn't have killed Buzz.

246
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:27,086
Uh, he has a tremor. He lacks the
dexterity to have committed the crime.

247
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,198
This turn-gate was vandalized.

248
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,436
It was vandalized so that Buzz was forced

249
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,308
to use the one closest to the staircase.

250
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,717
Dr. Stern had a stainless steel
door on his cabinet rigged

251
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,779
so he could look at the
changing area from his desk.

252
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,417
He likes to watch.

253
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,727
If he arranged to have Buzz killed,

254
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,132
he would have wanted front row seats.

255
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,330
From the staircase.

256
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,341
So he sabotaged the other exit.

257
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,570
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

258
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,270
The woman with the tropical disease

259
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,144
slipped into a coma this morning.

260
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,015
Until you look close, you can't
tell it's varnished macaroni.

261
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,182
Isn't it fun?

262
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,987
Yes. As advertised.

263
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,186
Roger.

264
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,626
What are you doing at an opening?

265
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,791
Tish Van Der Wahl, meet Dr. Scott Borman.

266
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,960
He's got some of the biggest
patients in New York.

267
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,162
Really?

268
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,668
You must be the one who brought Roger here.

269
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,435
His idea of a big night is to stay
home and watch the Surgery Channel.

270
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,807
Well, we're going to change all that.

271
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,970
I bet you will.

272
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,212
Tish, let me get you a refill.

273
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,982
So, Scott, what's your specialty?

274
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,878
Hands-on care.

275
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,321
Roger's been keeping you under wraps.

276
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,553
Now I see why.

277
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,736
Was Dr. Roger Stern

278
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,568
one of the specialists you saw?

279
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,608
Uh, I saw him, yes,

280
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,909
but it was a while ago, for something
unrelated. Why do you ask?

281
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,846
Well, someone hacked into his
records, and yours, Megan.

282
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:30,752
And another woman, who's also being
treated for an unknown viral infection.

283
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,380
Emily Wagner?

284
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,349
You know her?

285
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,328
I got a call, and they mentioned
her name but I don't...

286
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,457
A call from somebody with the IRS.

287
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,994
Yes. He said he was investigating

288
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,765
some of Dr. Stern's business expenses.

289
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,843
He tried deducting the dinners
that you had together.

290
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,337
You dated him.

291
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,815
How did it end?

292
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,085
We just... we went our own ways.

293
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,453
He was married to his practice.

294
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,287
Was there any other reason for the breakup?

295
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,760
No. Would you excuse me? I'm awfully tired.

296
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,993
Sure, sure.

297
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,366
I just thought, being a germaphobic,

298
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,065
Dr. Stern broke up with you
when you got sick.

299
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,067
No, I got sick after.

300
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,371
Oh. Well, we'll show ourselves out.

301
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,650
Typhoid Roger. You dump him, you get sick.

302
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,779
Blackmail him, you get killed.

303
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,683
The CDC determined one woman was infected

304
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,127
with Rift Valley fever,
the other with Nipah virus.

305
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,765
They're obscure, potentially
lethal zoonotic viruses,

306
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,700
meaning they're found in animals.

307
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,005
Anything I could catch from my local vet?

308
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,132
Not unless he's been in
the Southern Hemisphere

309
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,971
playing fetch with flying bats.

310
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,535
Then these woman were more likely
deliberately, uh, infected?

311
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,445
Assuming you could get hold of the viruses.

312
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,011
Well, thanks, Doc.

313
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,054
Let's keep in lock-step with the CDC
and the Health Department, huh?

314
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,778
We're already best friends.

315
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,955
Even if you connect Stern to these women,

316
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,594
the guy's an acid reflux specialist.

317
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,859
How does he get his hands on these bugs?

318
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,263
The tiger cub. I need to
track down the tiger cub.

319
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,527
Thanks.

320
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,067
The tiger cub that Stern
brought to the hospital

321
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,803
was from the Hudson Zoo,

322
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,676
where his donations have made him
a special friend of the zoo.

323
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:42,251
And where he's taken seminars
on veterinary sciences.

324
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,885
Two civilians contaminated?

325
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,255
That's pretty wild.

326
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,390
Do you keep specimens of these viruses?

327
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,425
Uh, the lab keeps cultures

328
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,992
for diagnostic purposes.

329
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,434
If you need to change, Dr.
Borman, we can wait outside.

330
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,341
Oh, that's okay.

331
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:09,039
We're all mammals in here. Right, ladies?

332
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,842
Whatever you say, Doctor.

333
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,450
You do know, of course, that zoonotic

334
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,355
doesn't mean that the
viruses came from the zoo.

335
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,397
It doesn't? My partner was telling me that.

336
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,558
But it doesn't make sense to me,
because there's the word "zoo."

337
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,001
Guys. We never listen.

338
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,502
You conducted seminars

339
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,706
for special friends of the zoo.

340
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,372
Well, the directors think I'm a
good ambassador for the zoo.

341
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,144
Because you have so much in
common with your animals?

342
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,753
Like Tarzan, right?

343
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,327
There's a doctor, a Dr. Roger Stern.

344
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,492
- He attended some of your seminars.
- Sure.

345
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,624
Oh, these guys are like groupies.

346
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,499
They, uh, take one lecture,
and go on a field trip.

347
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,232
They think they're saving the planet.

348
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,864
Would you hand me those?

349
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,102
Did Dr. Stern ever ask you
about Nipah or RVF virus?

350
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,479
No, no, no.

351
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,510
But one of your seminars
was about zoonotic viruses.

352
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,283
Well, it was on arenaviruses.

353
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,449
A completely different viridae.

354
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,928
We classify viruses with what
we call the Baltimore system.

355
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,362
You've lost me.

356
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,897
It doesn't matter.

357
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,068
Uh, well,

358
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,000
it's almost showtime.

359
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,637
We have a male hyena
that we're going to neuter.

360
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,507
You are welcome to stay and watch me operate.

361
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,979
It's quite a specimen.

362
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,574
That's okay. I've seen my share of specimens.

363
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,422
It is fascinating how they
complement each other.

364
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,020
Tarzan and Dr. Stern?

365
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,622
Stern likes to watch,
Borman likes to be watched.

366
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,198
Megan's reasons for breaking up with Stern...

367
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,669
There's something she's not telling us.

368
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:27,150
The Health Department told
me it's an animal virus.

369
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,411
I can't imagine how I got it.

370
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,285
Well, before you fell ill,
you were dating Dr. Stern.

371
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,294
You might have gone someplace
where you got exposed.

372
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,355
I don't see how. We went
to the theater, to the opera.

373
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,695
He showed you a good time.

374
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,599
Yeah, I did most of the showing.

375
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,228
He said he hadn't been to the Met

376
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,796
since his mother dragged him
to La Boheme when he was ten.

377
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,436
I hope he appreciated your efforts.

378
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:56,446
He said before he met me,
his life was bereft.

379
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,310
That must have been nice to hear.

380
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,410
And you showed him new things.

381
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,679
So if...

382
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,452
If he asked you to do things
that you hadn't done before,

383
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:12,359
you might try it, just to make him happy.

384
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,430
Well, yes, within reason, I guess.

385
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,770
Did he ever ask you anything involved
with his friend, Dr. Scott Borman?

386
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,014
I was so dumb not to have seen it.

387
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,607
How did it happen?

388
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,884
I was at Roger's. We'd been drinking.

389
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,923
The doorbell rang. It was Scott.

390
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,188
He said he was in the neighborhood.

391
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,325
It didn't occur to me they'd planned it.

392
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,058
So you drank a little more,

393
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,999
one of them made a suggestion...

394
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,162
Yeah, I thought they were joking.

395
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:58,265
But Roger said it would draw us closer.

396
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:05,475
Roger kind of drifted away,
and Scott took his place

397
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,513
in bed with me.

398
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,485
And right away, it felt wrong.

399
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:14,046
And so I looked to Roger. He was
sitting next to the bed, staring.

400
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,592
I got scared.

401
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,089
With the way that he was looking at you?

402
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,691
Yeah, I felt humiliated. I wanted him to stop.

403
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,100
I started crying,

404
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,365
and he got this

405
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:30,998
little smile.

406
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,834
He saw me crying, and he smiled.

407
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,679
After this, you stopped seeing him?

408
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,581
He kept calling, apologizing.
I told him there was no going back.

409
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,385
But you did see him again?

410
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:48,447
Well, I agreed to have dinner, in public.

411
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,061
When I got there, he gave me
a "no hard feelings" gift.

412
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,721
A pair of earrings.

413
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,564
And he insisted putting them on you.

414
00:25:58,957 --> 00:25:59,958
Yes.

415
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,363
But with that hand tremor of his...

416
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,932
He pricked me. My earlobe started bleeding.

417
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,612
Tish, please. You're having a bad reaction.

418
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,081
A bad reaction?

419
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,414
There's nothing wrong with
me, Roger. It’s you.

420
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,580
Take a look in the mirror. I
can't believe I almost... Don't!

421
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,750
Just stay away from me.

422
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:39,540
Stuck-up little prude. It’s too
bad we have to let this one go.

423
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,477
I'm not kidding, Roger. We
can't afford another mistake.

424
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,009
Get past it, Scott.

425
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,060
They infect these women for revenge?

426
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,691
Maybe.

427
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:06,667
Most killers get satisfaction
from witnessing their handiwork.

428
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,571
Not these two. When they inject these women,

429
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,001
it's fire and forget.

430
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,673
A voyeur and an exhibitionist.
It’s a wonder they found each other.

431
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,771
Isn't the world a swell place?

432
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,682
The lab tests on Megan's
earrings was inconclusive.

433
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:26,450
But the jewelry store said they sold
Dr. Stern 4 pairs of earrings.

434
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,389
One was returned by Emily Wagner.

435
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,755
The woman in a coma.

436
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,991
She returned it 2 days before she
first reported symptoms to her doctor.

437
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,921
Let me find a judge.

438
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,892
When you leave, I want everything
back where you found it.

439
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,699
Housekeeping duties aren't
stipulated in the warrant.

440
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,238
What's this autoclave for?
To steam vegetables?

441
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,907
Huh? Get him out of here.

442
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,068
Let's get everybody out of here.

443
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,841
Uh, we need a HAZMAT team.

444
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:32,620
Bolivian Hemorrhagic Fever, Lassa,
anthrax, alpha pathogens.

445
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,617
The baddest boys on the block.

446
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:38,025
Everything was safe and sealed,

447
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,721
or I wouldn't keep them in my home.

448
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,423
Where'd you get these specimens?

449
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,763
The Bolivian and the Lassa
I acquired from doctors

450
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,732
who encountered them in the field.

451
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,139
And the anthrax? Because
there are a lot of people here

452
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,267
interested in knowing how you
got your hands on a bio-weapon.

453
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,842
It's from South Africa. A fellow
collector in their defense department.

454
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,939
I can give you his name.

455
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,143
I should have gotten rid of it, I know.

456
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,652
I will pay a fine. I won't do it again.

457
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,315
If it were only that easy.

458
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,486
Our lab told us

459
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,993
some of the vials have been
opened recently and resealed.

460
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:17,693
Those open vials included
the Nipah virus and RVF.

461
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,861
Two women that you dated were
infected with these same viruses.

462
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,899
I have 267 specimens.

463
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,540
Whatever virus anyone gets in this
city I probably have in my collection.

464
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,141
Ah.

465
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,276
Or you infected these women

466
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,514
because they wouldn't be part of
your other little collection.

467
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,579
The one you share with Dr. Borman?

468
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:44,119
Oh? This sounds rich.

469
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,921
Megan Colby told us when she
opted out of your health plan,

470
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,900
you infected her with a pair of earrings.

471
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,367
Like this pair we found in your home.

472
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,335
Which lucky lady are these for?

473
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,169
No one. Poor Megan.

474
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,940
You know, the viruses can impair memory.

475
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,808
Even cause paranoia.

476
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:09,208
She had a very clear memory of the look
in your eyes when you were watching her.

477
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,348
And I see my lawyer's here.

478
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,685
Our threesome's over.

479
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,923
Lab says the virus strains
in the women are too degraded

480
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,263
to match with the ones in his collection.

481
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,064
As far as finding other victims,

482
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,163
now we have 267 pathogens
Stern might have used.

483
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,901
This just doesn't stop.

484
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,739
If Buzz Davis hadn't tried to
put the squeeze on Dr. Stern,

485
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,610
he might have actually busted this
case and earned his promotion.

486
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,913
Stern kept his specimens sorted
according to the Baltimore system.

487
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,852
But this one vial,

488
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,317
it's out of order.

489
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,525
It's a rabies virus.

490
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:56,422
Of all the pathogens, he was
only using the zoonotics.

491
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,762
Animal virus.

492
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:01,498
At least we can narrow our search
to women with those infections.

493
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,338
He said I was the missing piece in his life.

494
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,869
I really thought he enjoyed
going to art galleries, plays,

495
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:12,882
all the sissy things he said his
mother tried to interest him in.

496
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,915
Sissy things? He used those words?

497
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,014
That's what his father called them.

498
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,420
Did he say anything else about his father?

499
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,793
Just that he was in shipping.
Worked himself to death.

500
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,262
Roger didn't want that happening to him.

501
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:33,329
Those finer things, did they
include his friend, Scott Borman?

502
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,636
Actually, Scott's the one who introduced us.

503
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,708
I used to volunteer at the zoo as a docent.

504
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,247
Did Scott do anything besides introduce you?

505
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,741
Okay, look, I really
don't want to revisit that.

506
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,685
It's a thing, it happened, that's it.

507
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,649
After that, did you go back
to work at the zoo?

508
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,027
And risk running into Scott? No. I resigned.

509
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,057
You had to go back to get your things.

510
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,689
They sent them to me.

511
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,632
What exactly?

512
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,637
Stupid things. A sweater, makeup,

513
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,001
my case for my contact lenses.

514
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,278
You wear contacts?

515
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,710
I used to.

516
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,144
Before the infection.

517
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,978
My lawyer will be here soon.

518
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,023
But if you wanna tell me what these
assault charges are all about...

519
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:31,026
It has to do with infecting one of the
volunteers at the zoo with a virus.

520
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,688
Excuse me?

521
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,355
Anais Hutchinson. She dated Roger Stern.

522
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,333
We've been wracking our brains
trying to figure out

523
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,396
how a zoonotic virus, the Hendra virus,

524
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,006
went from his little wine cooler

525
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:52,208
into a contact lens case that
was left by her at the zoo.

526
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,351
That's how she was infected.

527
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,783
The rewetting solution in
the case was contaminated.

528
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,221
You didn't tell us

529
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,594
just how close you and Dr. Stern were.

530
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,431
The ladies are talking, Scott.
You wanna know what they said?

531
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,028
Tell me everything. Don't leave out a word.

532
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:19,471
I'll tell you. What they're
talking about is how

533
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,745
after you and Roger tag-teamed them...

534
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,544
They couldn't find soap strong
enough to get rid of the stench.

535
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:32,183
Well, they weren't singing the blues
when I was plowing the field.

536
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,449
Roger dumped them.

537
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:40,291
As much as it turned him on to watch
them with me, he'd get jealous.

538
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,067
No, they bailed out of your little freak show.

539
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,533
And then the next thing they knew...

540
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,037
They were hooked to an IV being
pumped full of antivirals.

541
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,638
Please.

542
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:53,070
Miss Hutchinson worked at a zoo.

543
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,202
Wild beasts rolling around in their own feces.

544
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,643
You said that he got jealous.

545
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,411
Well, maybe he thought

546
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,617
that he was being taken advantage of, by you.

547
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,957
- Well, I don't see that.
- Well, he's a Park Avenue doctor.

548
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,894
- You're a vet.
- Yeah. I mean,

549
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:18,867
he's doing all the work, bagging all these
beautiful, cultured young socialites.

550
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,493
What do you bring to the table?

551
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,498
What do I bring? Well, I'll tell you.

552
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,468
Roger can't satisfy these women.

553
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,278
That's where I come in. I seal the deal,

554
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,447
and Roger likes to watch.

555
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:36,282
See these women going out of
their mind with pleasure.

556
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,652
If I'm guilty of anything,

557
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,715
it's spoiling these girls for other men.

558
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:55,471
His Speedos must be pinching off
the blood supply to his brain.

559
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,632
In the midst of all his strutting,

560
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:01,075
he did present an alternative theory
to Miss Hutchinson's infection.

561
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,408
One that creates a reasonable doubt.

562
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,051
If both doctors hold to their stories...

563
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,950
You know, we know Scott's story,

564
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,319
but we don't know Roger's.

565
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:17,019
Now, he said that seeing
women being pleasured

566
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,052
was what Roger found exciting.

567
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,898
But Megan saw something else in the
way that Roger was looking at her.

568
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,563
- He was getting off on her humiliation.
- Yes.

569
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,469
Scott and Roger were using these
women to meet their needs.

570
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,808
But I doubt they really know
what each ether's needs are.

571
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,514
It's time that we show them.

572
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,559
Why don't you just copy the form you
filled out when you first arrested me?

573
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,428
It's ridiculous. My lawyer told me
I'm supposed to get bail today.

574
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,660
Okay, your father's name.

575
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,959
Joseph.

576
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,895
His occupation.

577
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,134
Your father's occupation.

578
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,308
Longshoreman.

579
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,576
That's right, shipping.

580
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,577
What are you looking at?

581
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,716
Nothing. I'm just thinking about
these preposterous charges.

582
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,553
Well, we feel pretty good about them.

583
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,026
And our witnesses.

584
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,457
Like Megan Colby?

585
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,999
Her character leaves a lot to be desired.

586
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,535
He was right. You are jealous.

587
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,764
No, Dr. Borman told us that
you're jealous of his prowess.

588
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,899
That's nonsense.

589
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,567
He said that you couldn't satisfy them,

590
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:44,478
so you brought him in to pick up the slack.

591
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,277
He told us that it turned you on

592
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,978
to see what a good time
they were having with him.

593
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:53,521
And that excitement, well,
gave way to jealousy.

594
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,057
No, he's a brute.

595
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,993
A pig. Why would I be jealous of a pig?

596
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,385
Hmm.

597
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,992
Scott told us that your girlfriends
had the time of their life with him.

598
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,368
What are you talking about?
They were debased, humiliated.

599
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,930
I turned them into the corncob in the pigsty,

600
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,101
with that rutting hog on top of them.

601
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,839
They'd look at me, wanting
me to call him off!

602
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,939
They wanted you to save them?

603
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,450
We have to redo his booking form, too.

604
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,816
Well, I won't be long with Dr. Stern.

605
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,325
Have a seat right there.

606
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,691
Now, where were we? Your
mother, I need her name.

607
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,393
- Vivian.
- Vivian. That's nice. Sophisticated.

608
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,933
One of your girlfriends told us that Vivian

609
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,471
- used to take you to the opera. Is that true?
- Yes.

610
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,100
She wanted to enrich your young
life. You must've liked that.

611
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,812
I bet your mother never
dragged you to the opera.

612
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,211
Yeah, she knew better.

613
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,715
Well, Roger here, now, he got stuck

614
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,013
doing all the sissy things with his mother.

615
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,151
Isn't that what his father called it?

616
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,155
That's right. Sissy things.

617
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:04,421
You know something just occurred to me.
Those women, Megan, the others.

618
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,958
They were trying to change you.

619
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:10,995
Like your mother.

620
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,266
Let's leave her out of this.

621
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,103
No, Vivian didn't want you
to end up like your Dad.

622
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:23,802
A brute of a longshoreman,
working himself to death.

623
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,172
My parents respected each other.

624
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,114
Why don't you just tell the truth, Roger?

625
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,914
That everything you did wrong,

626
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,616
Mom said it was because of
your Dad's side of the family.

627
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,519
Your mother, she put on airs.

628
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,951
Like Megan.

629
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,328
She made you do sissy things.

630
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,593
But you were too young
to do anything about it.

631
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,796
But then you became an adult,

632
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,202
and you found a way

633
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,902
to square things up.

634
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,679
That little scenario, what
we talked about earlier,

635
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,318
the one with Scott and Megan.

636
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,851
He is kind of like your Dad.

637
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,359
A big swaggering brute.

638
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,890
What are you talking about?

639
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,898
Forget it. It’s dime-store psychology.

640
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,865
Even so, there is something to it.

641
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:21,836
When you used him to humiliate
those women, to degrade them,

642
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,539
that was your mother being humiliated.

643
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,072
Your mother being degraded.

644
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,578
Sorry to tell you, Scott, but it wasn't
your technique that turned him on.

645
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:48,061
It was the humiliation that he
inflicted on them by using you.

646
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,291
What is it that you said you did?

647
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:53,302
You turned them into the corncob in a pigsty.

648
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,429
And, well, Scott, you're the pig.

649
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,406
- That's not true. I never said that.
- I'm no pig.

650
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,908
Women crave me. Roger knows that.

651
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,540
Oh. Does he?

652
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,444
Oh, look.

653
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:10,383
This webcam up here on top has been on.

654
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:19,260
Scott said that your girlfriends
had the time of their life with him.

655
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:23,129
What are you talking about?
They were debased, humiliated.

656
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,430
I turned them into the corncob in the pigsty,

657
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,437
with that rutting hog on top of them.

658
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,939
They'd look at me, wanting me to call him off

659
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,474
A rutting hog?

660
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,177
You called me a rutting hog?

661
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,645
He used you to turn them into animals.

662
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,682
You prissy bastard!

663
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,115
You think you can use me like a donkey?

664
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:47,213
And then when they walked away from him,
he got them sick with animal viruses.

665
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,723
Animals, Scott.

666
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:54,560
Like you, Scott, the rutting hog.

667
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,257
He's the animal, not me.

668
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,823
- He did it to them.
- Shut up, you dope.

669
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:01,268
It was his idea to punish
them. He infected them.

670
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:05,604
No, it was him. Look at him.
So full of himself.

671
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:10,305
The veterinarian, wallowing
in the muck with his animals.

672
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,312
I'm gonna kill you!

673
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,113
Yeah, who's in the cage now, huh?

674
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,949
Who's the animal now, huh?

675
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,716
Who's the animal? Who's in the cage? Huh? Huh?

676
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,485
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

677
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,585
You know what he does all day?

678
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,192
You know where he puts his hands?

679
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,097
He's a filthy animal, a pig.

680
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:35,336
He's a killer. He killed Buzz Davis.

681
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,997
Yes, yes, that's right,
A killer. A wild beast.

682
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,367
And you watched.

683
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,215
I'm not like him

684
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,012
I'm nothing like him.

685
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:59,659
Both Dr. Stern and Dr. Borman are willing
to plead to multiple counts of assault.

686
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,998
Stern offered to roll on Borman
for the murder of Officer Davis.

687
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,133
How much time just on the assaults?

688
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,367
Separate counts to be served consecutively,
minimum 15 years each count.

689
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:15,742
So they'd be very old men before
they got out, if they ever get out.

690
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,906
And if no one's prosecuted
for Buzz Davis' murder,

691
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,109
the circumstance of his death
wouldn't be on the record.

692
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,379
That's true, but...

693
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,752
For all anybody'd know,
he died in the line of duty.

694
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,491
It matters?

695
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,818
Yeah. It matters to his daughter.

696
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,903
What is it?

697
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,915
The South African source for Stern's anthrax.

698
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,387
He told the FBI he gave Stern
5 grams of the stuff.

699
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,588
But our lab only found
3 in Stern's collection.
