1
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,100
<i>Le Vaillant was struck by the hypocrisy</i>

2
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,771
<i>of killing fellow human beings
in the name of religion.</i>

3
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:31,550
<i>Especially since these people
professed belief in the same God.</i>

4
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,080
<i>The Fazar, Le Vaillant's written account
of his experiences in the Holy Land,</i>

5
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,242
<i>tells us he wandered the streets
of conquered Jerusalem</i>

6
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,120
<i>for days after that bloody battle,</i>

7
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,790
<i>until he found the entrance of a cave</i>

8
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,210
<i>that ran beneath
the length of the holy city.</i>

9
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,922
<i>Inside that cave, he began
to record his epiphany,</i>

10
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,300
<i>which became the basis
for a new religious sect.</i>

11
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,512
<i>An order that would combine
the fundamental tenets</i>

12
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,598
<i>of the three major religions of his day.</i>

13
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,935
<i>His first converts were
Christian knights</i>

14
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,355
<i>who'd also become disenchanted
by the bloodshed.</i>

15
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,569
<i>The force of his convictions even won
over a number of Muslims and Jews.</i>

16
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:19,907
<i>Former enemies who now became
willing converts to the new faith.</i>

17
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>Many years after completing
the original Fazar,</i>

18
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,080
<i>Le Vaillant had further revelations.</i>

19
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:31,377
<i>He wrote these down, intending them
to be added as the final chapter.</i>

20
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,548
<i>Around this time he and his followers
were being accused of heresy</i>

21
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,175
<i>by the crusader authorities.</i>

22
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:42,513
<i>On their way to Syria, he and
a group of disciples were intercepted</i>

23
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:48,352
<i>by some of the very same crusaders
he had once commanded.</i>

24
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,639
<i>During the battle that followed,</i>

25
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,060
<i>Le Vaillant died a martyr's death.</i>

26
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:43,032
<i>The final chapter
he had written was lost.</i>

27
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,799
Do you have the alarm code?
And no guards, right?

28
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,179
You'll be like the fox in the henhouse.
Heh, heh. Take as many eggs as you like.

29
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,058
Yuri, it's Russian mob.
No mistakes on this one.

30
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,478
My friend, this is 1000 percent.

31
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:17,024
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be in New York making a deal.

32
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,653
And I'll be in Tel Aviv
waiting for my commission.

33
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,351
Visual is all clear.

34
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,616
- Come on.
- Done.

35
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,341
Way to go, Yuri. I'm in.

36
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,394
Do you see the egg?

37
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,565
It's beautiful.

38
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,858
Yes! Yes! Yes!

39
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,736
I'm going for it.

40
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,174
- I got it.
- Yuri's the man with the plan!

41
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,010
- You're the man with the plan.
- I told you...

42
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,430
- Shit.
- Rudy?

43
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,728
Are you okay?

44
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,692
- Was that a gunshot?
- No, I farted.

45
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,898
Yuri, guide me out of here.

46
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,463
Oh, shit, Rudy. I'm sorry.

47
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,097
Toilet!

48
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,910
Hey, pal, this is a taxi zone.
You wanna get towed away?

49
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,870
Sorry. Watch it for me.

50
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,622
- Hey.
- Thanks.

51
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,791
Right on.

52
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,380
Perhaps you've seen enough
stones and carvings. Come with me.

53
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,843
I will show you a garment.
A most controversial acquisition.

54
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:41,473
This was unearthed beneath
a false storage room,

55
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,893
situated by Theodosius
as a decoy against thieves.

56
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,815
But often success as an archeologist
depends on knowing where to dig.

57
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,734
Well, I can dig her. Heh.

58
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,362
Rudy! Would you take over?

59
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,156
Can I have your?

60
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,533
Okay, everybody, follow me.

61
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,827
Dad, what's up? My main man!

62
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,164
Why must you always attract attention?

63
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,541
Come on, I love people, I love life...

64
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,336
You love to embarrass me.

65
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,297
I'm just having fun, Dad.

66
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,094
- Anyway, you called. You want to talk?
- Yes, but not here. Come on.

67
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,265
Tell me, are you still involved
with that same nonsense?

68
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,267
Hey, I'm legit now.

69
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,729
Straight. Import-export.
And I'm kicking ass.

70
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,107
Now, check this out.

71
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,487
Here, take it. For you.

72
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,783
Fancy watches, fast cars, easy money.

73
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,912
What does it prove
in the grand scheme of things, Rudy?

74
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,499
- Yeah?
- <i>You have the egg?</i>

75
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,959
I've got it. Trust me,

76
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,378
it's in pristine condition.

77
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,880
- <i>Ten o'clock.</i>
- Yeah, I'll be there.

78
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,094
Later, tonight. Some business.

79
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,806
- I hope for your sake it is legal.
- A thousand percent.

80
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,307
Come on.

81
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,644
Damn plane tickets.

82
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,355
They are here somewhere.

83
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,193
- Where you going? On a dig?
- No, an interview.

84
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,614
Someone I've been trying to meet
for a very long time.

85
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,993
- Don't touch that!
- Sorry.

86
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,621
What is it?

87
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,792
The lost chapter of the Fazar.

88
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,169
Oh.

89
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,172
The Fazar happens to be
the holy scripture

90
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,425
for an obscure Middle Eastern sect.

91
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:44,721
And, yes, to answer your inevitable
next question, it is quite valuable.

92
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,683
But only to practicing members
of the Order.

93
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:52,229
What can I say, Dad?
You have an exciting life.

94
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,442
Rudy, we need to discuss some issues.
Come by my apartment this evening.

95
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,028
- Uh, I've got some business tonight.
- Mm-hm.

96
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,949
In fact, uh, it's time to go.

97
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,660
All right. Can you at least call me?

98
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,370
Of course.

99
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,622
Absolutely.

100
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:15,377
- Tonight. It has to be tonight.
- You've got it, Dad.

101
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,137
<i>♪ In your new dress
As you spend your night ♪</i>

102
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,097
<i>♪ Walkin' and boppin'

00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,641

104
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,728
<i>♪ It's a mystery to me

105
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,771
Be careful.

106
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,952
Mr. Cafmeyer, this way, please.

107
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,413
So let's see what Santa brought for me.

108
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,165
Mm?

109
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,085
This egg was designed
by Peter Carl Fabergé.

110
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,547
A special gift to Czar Nicholas.

111
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,218
Look at the inlay.
Twenty-four-karat gold.

112
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,930
What can I say? One of a kind.

113
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:12,309
- That's why it's so expensive.
- You cannot find this on the Net. Ha, ha.

114
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,773
That's for sure. But stealing it
from the Russian mafia, come on.

115
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,858
Russian mafia?

116
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,447
In fact, he's got some friends.
Very nasty guys.

117
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,784
If they found out about this,
you'd end up with

118
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,578
your balls stuffed
and sewn inside your mouth.

119
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,749
Whoa. So the deal about...

120
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,043
No, no, no. Here's the deal.

121
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:43,382
I'm giving you an easy out.
I'll take this hot potato off your hands.

122
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,511
- And I'll assume the risk.
- Risk is my business.

123
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,263
You're not listening, Rudy.

124
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,183
Just a second, please.

125
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:55,978
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Rudy!

126
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,565
Where are you?
You promised to call me tonight!

127
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,067
Uh, I'm in a business meeting.

128
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,528
Really? Are you buying a disco?

129
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,906
- Dad, please.
- I can hear that music!

130
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,158
Hey, where are you going?

131
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,495
That is just what I'm trying
to explain to you.

132
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,375
Rudy, what is going on?

133
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,711
Give it to him.

134
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,170
Rudy.

135
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,924
Hey, come here!

136
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,177
Rudy?

137
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,938
My egg.

138
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,463
Move!

139
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,136
Oh, shit.

140
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,064
My eyes!

141
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,191
Got a problem here?

142
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,823
Hey, can I make a phone call over here?

143
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:36,578
Not yet, Rudy.
Heard you had a big night last night.

144
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,956
How are you gonna pay for all that?
Sell your Ferrari?

145
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,501
Listen, I had a bad night, okay?

146
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,587
Why do I have to look at your face
in the morning? Huh?

147
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,466
Is your father Oscar Cafmeyer?

148
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,302
Yeah. Why?

149
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,389
Yesterday, there was
a manuscript in this case.

150
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:59,059
Last night,
security discovered it missing.

151
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,310
So what?

152
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,896
Your father was last
to leave the building.

153
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,857
This morning, nobody seems
to know where he is.

154
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,110
A case of like father, like son?

155
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,570
- You're full of shit.
- Rudy, relax.

156
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,157
Why should he break the glass
if he had a key?

157
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,662
Nobody's making any accusations.
We just wanna ask him some questions.

158
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,206
You have any idea where he is?

159
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,166
No.

160
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:49,651
<i>Rudy, I've been trying your mobile,
but all I get is this recording.</i>

161
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:54,197
<i>Oh, never mind. I will try again later.</i>

162
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,410
<i>I'm staying at an old friend's home.</i>

163
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:03,165
<i>Remember Walt Finley?
He is teaching at Ben Gurion University.</i>

164
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,169
<i>Now, this is his number: 972...</i>

165
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,548
- Hello?
- <i>Rudy?</i>

166
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,676
- Dad, how are you?
- <i>Thank God you're there.</i>

167
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,762
- Where are you?
- <i>Israel.</i>

168
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,639
- Israel?
- <i>Pay attention, I beg you.</i>

169
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:24,436
I was at the police station. You know
what they're saying about you?

170
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,815
<i>Not now. I'm afraid I've gotten myself
into some big trouble.</i>

171
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,235
- What do you mean?
- <i>What are you doing? Hang up!</i>

172
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,696
Dad! Who's that?

173
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,867
Book me on the first flight to Israel.
Tel Aviv. Right away!

174
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,711
Take your glasses off, please.

175
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,967
Visiting Israel on business or pleasure?

176
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,220
Pleasure, always.

177
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,890
Excuse me, uh, what's the delay?

178
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,229
Our database shows that
you've had several arrests

179
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,564
for illegally transporting artifacts.

180
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,776
Does it also show I was never convicted?

181
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,737
Please open your carry-on.

182
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,039
Any artifacts which you
have not declared?

183
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,375
Oh, the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

184
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,254
- Hmm. You like to joke.
- They say laughter opens up the soul.

185
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,257
Well, let it open the rest
of your luggage too.

186
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,219
- You're joking, right?
- Ha-ha-ha. No.

187
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,139
You know, this is bullshit.

188
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,143
No, Mr. Cafmeyer. This is Israel.

189
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,237
I apologize.
Security is extra tight this month.

190
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,991
Muslims are making their pilgrimage
to Jerusalem for Ramadan.

191
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,534
Passport, please.

192
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,828
Rudy? Rudy Cafmeyer!

193
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,621
- Who is this?
- Walter Finley.

194
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,791
Professor of archeology
at Ben Gurion University.

195
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,086
And what is your relationship
to this man?

196
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:17,841
Not that it's any of your business,
I'm a friend of his father's.

197
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,427
I've known him since he was in knickers,

198
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:24,389
which would have put you in diapers.

199
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,101
Now, are there any more
insurmountable obstacles

200
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,478
we have to overcome here, young lady?

201
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,025
Thank you for your cooperation.

202
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,153
<i>Shalom.</i>

203
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,907
- Good to see you.
- You too.

204
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:48,246
- Where's my dad?
- Look, let's get your bags into my car.

205
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,135
- Watch where you go!
- Up yours!

206
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,183
Ozzie Cafmeyer is a cranky old fool.

207
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,227
Calls me two days ago
to pick him up at the airport.

208
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,357
So I took him back to my house.
We had dinner, talked...

209
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,525
What was he doing here?

210
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:21,529
I'm getting to that!
What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?

211
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,492
A few years ago, he found scrolls
near the Syrian border.

212
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:31,289
The lost final chapter of the Fazar
written by Le Vaillant himself.

213
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,375
Was he translating it?

214
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,212
More than that.
He was writing a history of the sect.

215
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,048
An unauthorized history.

216
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,551
He's been e-mailing me his chapters,

217
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,304
having me lock them
in a safe-deposit box here.

218
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:51,351
- Why a safe-deposit box in Israel?
- Because he trusted me.

219
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,729
Here, here's the key.
You ought to have it anyway.

220
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,608
- Okay, where can I find these guys?
- I'll show you.

221
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:27,929
Their monastery is in east Jerusalem.
The other side of the Mount of Olives.

222
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,349
- We're wasting time. Let's go.
- The present-day Order

223
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,476
is just as reclusive as ever.

224
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,939
Fanatically adverse to publicity.
No contact to

225
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:42,110
the outside world. You'd do better trying
to get an audience with the pope.

226
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,906
Those are the guys that came by
the house and picked up your dad!

227
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,742
Hey! Hey, you!

228
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,286
- Jump in. I'll drive.
- You don't know the way.

229
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:57,584
- You'll navigate, okay?
- Be careful. This is a classic car.

230
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,931
Professor, buckle up.

231
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,814
- Aah!
- It's them!

232
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,078
Get down!

233
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,195
My car!

234
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:09,424
Shit. Sorry about the car.

235
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,520
- There they are.
- Let's just nail these sons of bitches.

236
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,534
You okay?

237
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,581
- I'm fine.
- Good.

238
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,114
Where's my father,

239
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,282
you son of a bitch?

240
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,958
I'm gonna kill you!

241
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,215
You okay?

242
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,508
Finley, look out!

243
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,430
Rudy...

244
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,941
- Stay right there! Don't move!
- He needs a doctor. Help me!

245
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,193
- Hey, it's not me!
- Up.

246
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,820
- Get up.
- It's not me!

247
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,288
And so you are telling us
these men kidnapped your father.

248
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,582
They took him somewhere.
No one's heard from him.

249
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:11,421
Mr. Cafmeyer,
I can smell bullshit a mile away.

250
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,715
You're only five feet from me.

251
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,634
I believe you're using
the alleged disappearance

252
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,595
as a cover to smuggle artifacts
out of Israel.

253
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,182
Alleged? My father was here.
Now he's missing.

254
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:27,687
This has nothing to do with
why you are in police custody.

255
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,149
You were found next to the corpse
of a prominent professor.

256
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,402
Let me guess.
You're accusing me of killing him?

257
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:39,157
Until we have more facts,
all options are open.

258
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:43,661
I'm placing you under house arrest.
You'll be taken to a hotel

259
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,749
until we complete our investigation
into the professor's death.

260
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,960
You know why you're smelling bullshit?

261
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,087
Because you're up to your nose in it.

262
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,224
I'll be next door if you need anything.

263
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,812
- What about a taxi?
- Within reason.

264
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:16,319
- What about my father?
- We're looking into it. Good night.

265
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,907
- Good night, officer.
- Lieutenant Barr. Dalia Barr.

266
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,160
- How are you?
- Okay.

267
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,204
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

268
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,118
- Yuri.
- Rudy!

269
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,372
<i>Rudy, let me explain
what happened in Odessa.</i>

270
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,792
Explain what? You left me hanging
like a piece of laundry.

271
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,127
But there was this cop...

272
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,382
Admit it! You little slimeball.
Or you'll never see your money.

273
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,219
- What money?
- I sold the egg. Remember our deal?

274
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,557
<i>Ten percent.
That's 50 G's for you, my friend.</i>

275
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:36,185
Lucky for you,
this place makes me generous.

276
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,562
Thank you, Rudy.

277
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,063
<i>Thank you.</i>

278
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,067
Rudy, do you have the cash with you?

279
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,361
It's under my mattress.

280
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,198
Of course I have it.
But I'm leaving tonight.

281
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,826
Tonight? Uh...

282
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:54,996
<i>Can we meet first?
Come to my office in Tel Aviv.</i>

283
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:59,709
I have a beautiful new penthouse suite
in the diamond district.

284
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:03,129
You'll be my special guest.

285
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,839
We'd like to use the phone.

286
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Rudy?

287
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,803
Uh... Yuri, I have a much better idea.

288
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,205
Yuri.

289
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:29,918
Yuri.

290
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:33,326
Is that you, Rudy?

291
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,302
You slimeball. You almost got me killed!

292
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,263
Hey, Rudy, it wasn't my fault!

293
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,225
- You owe me.
- Owe you?

294
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,186
- You owe me.
- What do you mean?

295
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,856
- You owe me, I said!
- Anything, Rudy. Anything.

296
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,611
Just tell me what I can do
to help, my friend.

297
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,740
I need this map translated.
Can you do it?

298
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:13,949
- Sure.
- Sure?

299
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,701
- Sure.
- Sure.

300
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,995
I'm positive! I'm a pro, my friend!

301
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,999
- And this print.
- Done. For you, anything.

302
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,169
Understand something.
I know where you sleep...

303
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,963
It wasn't my fault! There were cops...

304
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:33,260
Cops. Let's split up.
I'll call you. Go. Go.

305
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,871
<i>Shalom.</i>

306
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,210
Look, there he is. Stop!

307
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,131
Hey, you! Stop!

308
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,176
Cafmeyer! Hey, you! Stop!

309
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,538
Get away! Move! Hey, hey! Stop!

310
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,902
No.

311
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,284
Hey, you! Stop!

312
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:21,813
Stop!

313
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,920
Stop!

314
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,980
Come on! Come on!

315
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,880
Don't move!

316
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,564
Freeze!

317
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,932
Huh?

318
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,187
Excuse me.

319
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,695
Cuff them.

320
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,871
You know how much trouble I'm in
because of you? Do you know?

321
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:14,083
Let's have a coffee and talk about it.

322
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,462
You have proved to me
that my original hunch was correct.

323
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,631
You cannot be trusted.

324
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,008
I came here to look for my father.

325
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,553
I did what I had to do
because nobody gives a shit!

326
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,847
We spoke to Immigration.

327
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,558
They have no record
of him entering the country.

328
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,851
That's impossible.

329
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,728
What's really going on?

330
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:39,233
Were you perhaps planning
to smuggle out a little something, hm?

331
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,654
Hey, those are mine!

332
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,863
What's going on?

333
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,492
Yes, we checked you out of the hotel.
Change at the airport.

334
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,035
You're going home.

335
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,247
- You cannot do that.
- I can, and will.

336
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,667
Can you take him to the airport
without him escaping?

337
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,752
Yes, sir.

338
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,840
- What about Finley's murder?
- You're no longer a suspect.

339
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,675
I'm still the only witness!

340
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,762
We have your testimony, thank you.
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Cafmeyer.

341
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,184
You're not helping me! You're helping
yourself! You're full of shit!

342
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,811
- Move it!
- What's going on?!

343
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,230
What did you find?

344
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:33,912
Today, as every year at this time,

345
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:38,459
we come to this special place
to commemorate

346
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:43,839
the departure of the knights
of Christendom from these shores.

347
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,303
Brother Cyrus will now lead us
in a passage from the Fazar.

348
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,014
Thank you, first disciple.

349
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,272
As was prophesied in
the Book of Tribulations, we await

350
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,691
the return of the Army of God,

351
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:08,489
who shall rise like a tide against
the sea of those who do not believe.

352
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:24,338
Cyrus, by what authority do you quote
from that disreputable source?

353
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,258
As second disciple,
you should know better!

354
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,971
I beg your forgiveness.
It was an unpardonable error.

355
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:37,893
Le Vaillant himself once followed
a false path toward God.

356
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:43,232
We must choose our words carefully.
Wars have started for less.

357
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,277
I will ask for forgiveness
at evening vespers.

358
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,728
Your flight doesn't leave
for a few hours. You hungry?

359
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,606
Someone here actually cares about me?

360
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:29,069
We may be overly cautious
with security and our artifacts,

361
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,157
but we're not barbarians, Mr. Cafmeyer.

362
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,953
It'd be a shame if you left without
sampling some fresh hummus.

363
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,086
You like?

364
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:50,299
- I'd like it more without this.
- Sorry.

365
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,260
Look, I came here to find my father.

366
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:58,599
He told me he was in trouble.
He's the type of guy who never lies.

367
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,601
It sounds like
you really care about him.

368
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,605
The two of you must be very close.

369
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:12,321
He taught me everything about
paintings, antiques, you name it.

370
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,823
You certainly applied that knowledge.

371
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,368
Let's say I did.
I never meant to hurt him.

372
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,165
- That's bothering you now?
- Yes, because now he's missing.

373
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,752
And I'm just starting to realize
what I missed.

374
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,839
Why am I telling you all this?

375
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,591
You're tired.

376
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,638
You're jet-lagged. You'll feel a lot better
once you're back on a plane.

377
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,849
No, I'll feel better when I find him.

378
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:54,238
<i>This attack was a brutal
and senseless act</i>

379
00:42:54,656 --> 00:43:00,744
<i>perpetrated on a man who devoted
his life to God and to peace.</i>

380
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:05,123
<i>His brothers and sisters
mourn his passing</i>

381
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,418
<i>and pray that those responsible
find repentance.</i>

382
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,128
Who died?

383
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,341
Pierre Gaudet,
the leader of some religious sect.

384
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,385
- You mean the Order?
- Mm-hm.

385
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,495
Come on, this way.

386
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,630
Come on. Please keep on moving.

387
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,072
- Hello.
- Get the prisoner off the plane.

388
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,658
- I want him brought back here.
- Why?

389
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,661
We've been informed
he's leaving with an artifact.

390
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:29,666
- Customs checked him. I saw...
- Just do it, lieutenant!

391
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,927
- What's going on?
- You're staying in Israel.

392
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,804
What?

393
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,640
They said you're trying
to smuggle an artifact.

394
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,352
Do you believe that?

395
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:54,191
Something is not kosher here.
I'm not trying to be funny, okay?

396
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:06,495
When I signal, run to the back stairs.

397
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:13,418
If you make it to the service road,
I'll be waiting.

398
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,254
- If I make it?
- Now push me.

399
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,048
Just push me.

400
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,596
Over here! He's escaping! Quick!

401
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,690
- Unh!
- Quick! I need assistance up here!

402
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:56,586
What? What are you doing? Hey! Hey!

403
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,697
The stairs are slowing him down!
We can catch him!

404
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,342
Rudy! Get in the back. Hurry.

405
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,639
Get down. Get down!

406
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,932
You all right?

407
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,273
You missed him. He went over the fence.

408
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:44,004
- You're safe now.
- Safe from what?

409
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,923
I've got some questions for you, okay?

410
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,928
- I used to belong to the Order.
- What?

411
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,142
- You should've told me this before.
- I couldn't.

412
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:02,939
- Of course not. You're part of it.
- No, I didn't know this was related.

413
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:08,028
- Oh, sure. You knew about my father.
- Where are you going? Hey!

414
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,363
Hey!

415
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:13,283
I just risked my ass for you!

416
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:16,661
Why? So you can hand me over
to the Order?

417
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,663
I left the Order when I was 18.

418
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,375
- Oh, you left the Order?
- I wanted to create my own life.

419
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:26,171
So meeting you at the airport
was no accident.

420
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,799
Look, Rudy, let me explain
a few things to you, okay?

421
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,678
Most of the followers are peaceful
and life-affirming.

422
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,682
There is a small group of fanatics
who believe in a darker path.

423
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,976
They call themselves the Army of God.

424
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,021
They've been on standby for years.

425
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,399
And you think they took my father?

426
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,654
I don't know. They might also
be the ones who killed Gaudet.

427
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,916
Hey, Rudy, my friend!

428
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:07,962
- Who's the cop?
- Everything's fine. She's with us.

429
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:13,510
Uh-huh. My friend, look what
I printed out for you from the disc.

430
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:37,617
- It's not translated yet, but... Uh-huh.
- It looks like a map of Jerusalem.

431
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:42,080
Middle Ages, European design.
What's the language?

432
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:47,252
Aramaic. The language of Palestinian
Christians at the time the Crusades.

433
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,130
See these lines? Here and here?

434
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,258
They are caves and tunnels
beneath the old city.

435
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,302
They've remained hidden
since the holy wars.

436
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,471
Professor Finley told me about those.

437
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,725
What he didn't tell you
is what they lead to.

438
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:07,272
Why would an archeology professor
bring the scrolls to New York

439
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,818
but leave the map in Israel
hidden inside a safe-deposit box?

440
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:16,948
Because the map leads to something
even more valuable.

441
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,002
- The people who left forgot something.
- Let's hide this.

442
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,222
Hands in the air!

443
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,435
Get them up! Move!

444
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,606
Where is it? Where is it?

445
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,154
Freeze!

446
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,698
Oh!

447
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,558
Oh.

448
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,143
Give me that.

449
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,438
Come on.

450
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,318
Hold on.

451
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,787
Rudy.

452
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,655
Thank you, Avram.

453
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:54,077
After all this time,
you come back to me like this.

454
00:56:56,997 --> 00:57:02,418
Avram, you know I've had
to make some difficult choices.

455
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:05,588
You chose to leave.

456
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:08,299
Please, can we talk about this later?

457
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,720
I really need some water
and clean rags right now.

458
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:22,230
- Here's some water.
- Thank you, Avram.

459
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:44,544
- Where am I?
- A friend's.

460
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,132
How long have I been here?

461
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:54,053
Two days now. Hey. Shh.

462
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,180
You really should rest.

463
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,601
- I'm okay.
- Well enough to leave?

464
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:10,486
- Israeli hospitality kills me.
- No, it just saved your life.

465
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:19,036
- Here. Your father's book.
- Yeah.

466
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:24,792
I've been going through this.
You really should too.

467
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:37,597
<i>The lost chapter predicts a revolution,</i>

468
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,892
<i>one that is peaceful
and spiritual in nature.</i>

469
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,604
<i>This will not be good news
to the radical Army of God</i>

470
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:49,400
<i>who contend that Le Vaillant
prophesied a catastrophic holy war.</i>

471
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,612
<i>I suspect this militant faction
will stop at nothing</i>

472
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,990
<i>to suppress the true contents
of this final chapter.</i>

473
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,159
<i>Though my safety may be an issue,</i>

474
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:01,454
<i>I have requested an interview
with the first disciple</i>

475
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,041
<i>to make these matters known.</i>

476
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:10,004
Your scholar seems to be
on the verge of enlightenment.

477
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:13,633
It wouldn't hurt you
to sample some of it yourself.

478
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:19,347
Dalia, the world is as filled with
temptations as it is with false prophets.

479
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:25,686
Onions. I need onions.

480
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,819
- Is everything okay?
- We were just...

481
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,988
We were discussing the manuscript.

482
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,032
It's a fraud.

483
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:42,119
A fraud? The scrolls, they were tested.

484
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:45,957
- By whom? Secular scientists?
- If you would open your mind...

485
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,918
- To what?
- To this, Avram.

486
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,133
What is this? What is this?

487
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,510
It's mentioned in the Fazar.

488
00:59:57,678 --> 01:00:01,305
Solomon's gold. A treasure
the ancient Hebrews hid under the city.

489
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:05,893
Which might explain why people
with guns have been chasing us.

490
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,479
It explains nothing but your ignorance.

491
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:13,317
The treasure is a metaphor
for the wisdom of the ancient sages.

492
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:18,197
Avram, I need to get to the monastery.
I think they're holding my father.

493
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:21,450
Impossible. No outsider is permitted.

494
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,036
What about an insider?

495
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:28,332
A member from overseas
that is here on pilgrimage?

496
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,086
That's Cyrus.

497
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,465
The new first disciple.

498
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:33,981
Children of God, I stand here
before you today in great sorrow.

499
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:37,735
For what should be
a celebration of hope and joy,

500
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,946
must instead be looked upon
as a call to action.

501
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:46,077
God's vengeance for this murderous
deed will be swift and without mercy!

502
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,209
May the eternal spirit of Pierre Gaudet

503
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:56,045
guide us on this path of deliverance.

504
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:04,387
- Time to see if my father's alive.
- Try the catacombs first.

505
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:13,396
That door leads to a small stairway.
Follow it all the way down.

506
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:17,942
Rudy. Be careful.

507
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,527
Rudy.

508
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:13,581
- Dad! Are you all right?
- Rudy. Yes.

509
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,125
Let me get you out of here. Unh!

510
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:21,005
No, no, I already tried.
No, forget about me.

511
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,924
You have to stop them.

512
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:28,929
Pull off that tarp. You will see
what this is all about.

513
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:31,682
Rudy, go. Go!

514
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,249
- This looks like a...
- A bomb?

515
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:04,507
Sorry we're late, but I could give
a shit about this coronation.

516
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:09,178
Tonight, we will all witness a miracle.

517
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:13,182
As God's fury cleanses the souls
of those against us,

518
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,143
let the new age begin!

519
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:20,814
- Where are you going?
- To find Rudy.

520
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,359
Avram, we have to put a stop to this.

521
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,781
All right, I'm coming with you.
This way.

522
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,494
Rudy!

523
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:36,622
Dalia, stop! It's a trap.

524
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,794
Now be a good girl, Dalia,
and come down here.

525
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,798
Since when did you take your vows
with the Order, major?

526
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,301
The day Cyrus vowed there was
treasure under the Temple Mount.

527
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:52,930
That's the day I found religion. Ha, ha.

528
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:55,808
Hello, professor.

529
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,814
Dad, meet Dalia. She's a good cop.

530
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:08,153
Now let's ask the major
what the big bomb is for. Huh?

531
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,242
It's Ramadan.

532
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:17,955
Islamic leaders from around the world
will be on the Temple Mount at noon.

533
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:22,918
What are you saying?
This nut case is gonna blow it up?

534
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,254
That will start World War III.

535
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:30,342
Especially when they find the bodies
of an Israeli and an American.

536
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,178
No, no, you're crazy!
This is impossible.

537
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,890
You've completely misinterpreted
the words of the first disciple.

538
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,936
And you are a naive moron.

539
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,401
You have truly lost the way, Cyrus.

540
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:51,530
On the contrary, I've found it.

541
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,617
I want to thank you, young Cafmeyer,

542
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:58,078
for unwittingly providing
the final piece of the puzzle.

543
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,040
And thank you, Avram,

544
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,125
for your loyalty and devotion.

545
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:05,794
But, first disciple,
what they're saying here...

546
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,173
Avram, If you've read
the Book of Tribulations carefully,

547
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:13,969
you are aware that the holy war
is triggered by a singular event.

548
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,889
Behold the event.

549
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:24,188
And as my unwavering one, I shall
grant you the privilege of assisting us.

550
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,358
Bind him, and her too.

551
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,611
Now, where's my guide?

552
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,292
- Unh! Dad!
- No! Stop!

553
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:49,630
- There is no need for that!
- Then you will be assisting us too?

554
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,424
- What's he talking about?
- With the map,

555
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,469
your father can guide us
under the Temple Mount.

556
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,556
Cyrus, please. Millions will die.

557
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:03,894
It is written! I will raise Mount Moriah
and build a new temple.

558
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,939
That prophecy you are quoting
is a fabrication!

559
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,857
- Unh!
- Dad! Unh!

560
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,695
Don't do shit for him.

561
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:17,408
Apparently, stubbornness
is an ingrained family trait.

562
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,952
Beats a messiah complex any day.

563
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:25,290
- Aah! Unh.
- Stop! I will do it. I will guide you.

564
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,126
God help us all.

565
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:32,631
He helps those who
help themselves, professor.

566
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:36,487
We are near the Temple Mount.
That is where the traps begin.

567
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:41,658
Perhaps we should use someone
expendable to lead the way.

568
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:46,622
Young Mr. Cafmeyer,
we have a job for you.

569
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:54,296
Rudy!

570
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,716
- Rudy, be careful.
- Okay.

571
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:01,970
Go.

572
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,058
Avram.

573
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,527
Avram! Somebody help him!
No! Let me go, damn it!

574
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,116
Careful, Rudy.

575
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:25,661
Come on, Avram.

576
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:39,675
- You deceived me.
- This is the way according to the map.

577
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:43,428
- How do we proceed?
- What's the matter with you guys?

578
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,807
See these beams? We take them down
and we build a bridge.

579
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,837
Oh, my God.

580
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,169
- This is not the Well of Souls.
- Unh!

581
01:10:57,337 --> 01:11:00,130
In the next chamber, I swear.

582
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,465
Show me.

583
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:31,453
Directly above us, the Dome of the Rock,

584
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:35,624
Islam's third holiest shrine.

585
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:41,922
And henceforth from this day forward,
the holiest shrine of the Order.

586
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:55,602
Cyrus, I beg you to reconsider.

587
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,945
Bring the bomb.

588
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,114
Hey, hey. Hold on, hold on.

589
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,492
We'll get to that.
First, we fill these bags.

590
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,120
There's no time.

591
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,916
Would you take a look around you, Cyrus?

592
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,210
There's a king's treasure here.

593
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,505
Enough to finance 10 of your holy wars.

594
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:27,384
We set the bomb now.

595
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,469
We can do this the easy way,

596
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,932
or the very easy way.

597
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:42,024
I have a prophecy to fulfill.

598
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,318
And I have a Swiss bank account to fill.

599
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:49,948
That's the only reason I joined
your crazy scheme in the first place.

600
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:56,580
- Idiots!
- Professor, here.

601
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:58,957
Stop them! Don't let them get away!

602
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,378
- Unh!
- Aah!

603
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,797
No!

604
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,426
Avram, no!

605
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,936
- Rudy, your dad!
- Dad, you're hit.

606
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:24,608
- Unh! Unh.
- Dalia, come on.

607
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:27,360
Let's go. Over here.

608
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,082
Dad, you stay here. We'll be back.

609
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,167
I'll be fine.

610
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,086
Let's go. Come on.

611
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:50,258
They couldn't have come this far.
We must've passed them.

612
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,094
Come on, let's double back.

613
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,888
Let's split. Go!

614
01:13:57,475 --> 01:14:01,561
Get after him!
I'll take care of that bitch!

615
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:48,984
- Ah. Help me with these.
- Assist him.

616
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,086
Shit!

617
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:50,939
Hey, Dad, meet Dalia.
She's the dead cop!

618
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:53,817
Wrong, major.

619
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:06,454
- Professor, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

620
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:15,505
- Take my father out of here.
- What about you?

621
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:20,343
- I've got to stop the bomb.
- Rudy, please be careful.

622
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:26,057
Come on, professor. Let's go.

623
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:30,979
- Are you ready for this?
- Thank you.

624
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:38,945
Psst.

625
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:52,751
The bomb is set. It's irreversible.

626
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:02,260
The prophecy will be fulfilled,
and I will vanquish my enemy.

627
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:49,742
You can't stop the prophecy.

628
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,710
You read the wrong book, pal.

629
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:06,903
Now it's time to say bon voyage.

630
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,279
<i>Shalom!</i>

631
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,371
Please, stay calm.

632
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,133
- Hey, Dad.
- Rudy!

633
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:53,551
My main man!

634
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:57,722
Hey, this is great.

635
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,600
A few more to sign,
then we can go to lunch.

636
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,852
Take your time.

637
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:12,612
- Don't touch that!
- Oh!

638
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,449
I'm sorry. What is this?

639
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:20,620
It is a map which purports
to show the location

640
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:25,792
of the fabled seven cities of Cibola
near Cancùn on the Yucatán peninsula.

641
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:30,213
- Oh.
- These, ostensibly, hm,

642
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:34,217
are the legendary cities of gold

643
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,762
containing the Mayan treasure,

644
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:42,975
which the Spanish conquistadors
so desperately had sought.

645
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:47,313
And to answer your
inevitable next question:

646
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:51,192
Yes, it is quite valuable. Ha, ha.

647
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:56,239
Rudy? Rudy?

648
01:23:56,407 --> 01:23:57,907
Rudy!

649
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:00,284
So where to, young Cafmeyer?

650
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:01,619
- Cancún, Mexico.
- Mm-hm.

651
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:05,748
- Will that be business or pleasure?
- Pleasure, always.

652
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:08,960
- Rudy!
- Oh.

653
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,978
Cut?
