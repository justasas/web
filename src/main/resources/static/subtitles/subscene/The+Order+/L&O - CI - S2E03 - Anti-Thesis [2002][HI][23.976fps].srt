1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,711
In New York City's war on crime,

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,278
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,581
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,680
These are their stories.

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,325
...until George finally pulled me aside

6
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,955
and explained the difference
between hegemony and hominy.

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,959
In any event,

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,061
the reason that I crashed this
wonderful gathering, George,

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,130
was to thank you for your years of service

10
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,903
as Chairman of the Department
of American Studies.

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,378
Well, have you made a
decision on my replacement?

12
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,582
No.

13
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,451
You know, if Sanders doesn't get the chair,

14
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,051
he's threatening to leave.

15
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,360
George, it has to be my decision
along with the regents'.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,797
I mean, Sanders is a brilliant teacher

17
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,630
when he bothers to show up to class.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,533
But with lectures and talk shows...

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,095
He even did an ad for the Gap.

20
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,834
And where is he today?

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,206
Probably still working on that rap record.

22
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,809
- Dr. Winthrop?
- Well, what can I do for you, Mark?

23
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,614
I need to talk to you about another
extension on my dissertation.

24
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,087
Hmm. I was hoping you could
speak to the new chair...

25
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,179
Well, as soon as there is one,

26
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,849
you can speak to him or her yourself.

27
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,955
FELLOWES: I can't believe he said rap record.

28
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,018
Sanders will flip his afro.

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,962
Hello, Mark. Were you waiting for one of us?

30
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,021
Mmm-mmm.

31
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,460
So, if Winthrop's soured on Sanders,

32
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,696
does that put you in the lead?

33
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,101
Winthrop doesn't much like me, either.

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,403
My critique of patriarchy in academia
hit a little too close to home.

35
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,206
Oh, donnez-moi un break. I thought
the politics at Oxford were insane.

36
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,508
You know why the battles
in academia are so vicious?

37
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,640
It's because the stakes are so low.

38
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,807
Are you sure?

39
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,853
I distinctly heard him say him or her.

40
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,580
And "her" can only mean Dr. Fellowes.

41
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,812
I talked to her last week.

42
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,824
She said it was obvious I'd
never finish my dissertation,

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,723
and it was time to let
someone else have my spot.

44
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,386
I'd hate to see that happen, Mark.

45
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,861
A decade of hard work down the drain.

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,524
Now if you were head of the
department, would you...

47
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,898
But I'm not head of the department.
That's up to Winthrop.

48
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,027
You know that.

49
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:13,469
How dare you characterize
anything I do as a rap record.

50
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,841
Call it whatever you want.

51
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,745
I prefer "danceable education."

52
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,348
I expect my professors to be
in the classroom, teaching.

53
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,988
I'm not your professor.

54
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,151
Just because you run this
university like a plantation,

55
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,685
don't make you massa and we your field hands.

56
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:36,531
I came here to discuss the future of
American Studies at Hudson University.

57
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,935
I am the future of American Studies.

58
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,402
And if you don't make me
head of the department,

59
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,141
I will leave.

60
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:52,313
And sue you for discrimination. Dig?

61
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,846
We may be here awhile, Kate.

62
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,980
I'll make coffee.

63
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,730
How did you get in here?

64
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,597
What are you doing? No! No!

65
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:02,087
DETECTIVE PONDS: The guard saw
them come in at around 9:15.

66
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,554
We'll need a list of everybody
with keys to the building.

67
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,251
Any idea what Winthrop was
doing here with his secretary?

68
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,760
Well, the guy who should know,
the vice-rector, Mr. Frisch,

69
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,353
well, he doesn't know.

70
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,197
Nothing in his book.

71
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,930
Just a breakfast meeting with
something called the "AS Committee."

72
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,994
Ask Mr. Frisch what that is.

73
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,608
The killer came out from
the front. Winthrop...

74
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,038
he raised his arm,

75
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,345
took the first blow to his wrist from a...

76
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,545
a blunt instrument

77
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,386
with a round striking face.

78
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,938
The killer chose a weapon
that would have meaning.

79
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,396
A gavel.

80
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,400
The killer wanted justice.

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,243
Winthrop came in the room.

82
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,511
The killer was already waiting.

83
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,183
Winthrop turned on the light,

84
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,316
and the killer attacked him.

85
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,983
The secretary had gone to make coffee,

86
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,355
she walked in on it.

87
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,690
She tried to get away.

88
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,570
Mr. Frisch, when's the last
time you spoke to Mr. Winthrop?

89
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,131
Around 5:00.

90
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,041
And that meeting you asked about,

91
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,306
it was a search committee for the
American Studies Department.

92
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,041
They're deciding on a new
chairman for the department.

93
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,280
Does Miss Robbins live alone?

94
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,287
I believe she has a roommate.

95
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,490
LIN: Oh, my God, what am
I gonna tell her parents?

96
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,086
They're supposed to come up
from Charleston this weekend.

97
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,028
Did you see her last night?

98
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,430
When I came back from the gym,

99
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,526
she was working on her computer
and listening to a CD.

100
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,231
And she was listening on these?

101
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,908
Yes. I think there was
something wrong with the CD.

102
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,410
Why do you say that?

103
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,412
She kept pressing stop
and play, stop and play.

104
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,208
Well, there's no CD in here.
Did you see her leave?

105
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,344
Yes.

106
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,410
She grabbed something out of her printer.

107
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,213
She said she had to go to Winthrop's office

108
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,623
for a couple of hours to work.

109
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,853
(PHONE RINGING)

110
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,623
Here's the last document she printed.

111
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,663
Hey, it's lyrics.

112
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:41,168
The writer came of age in the '60s and '70s,

113
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,579
probably in the Bay Area, Oakland.

114
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,177
Here, "Flipping Pancakes for Preschoolers."

115
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,517
That's the Black Panthers' breakfast program.

116
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,458
And he works for Hudson University.

117
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,185
Okay, how do you figure that?

118
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,190
Here, "Massa will go the way
of the Dutchman's mercenary

119
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,926
"who gave his name to the plantation."

120
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,367
Henry Hudson sailed for
the Dutch East India Company.

121
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,365
He's the Dutchman's mercenary,

122
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,704
and the plantation is Hudson University.

123
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,607
And massa would be Winthrop.

124
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,442
So the writer's middle-aged, African-American,

125
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,244
from California, works at the university.

126
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,018
And wanted Winthrop to
disappear like Henry Hudson.

127
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,014
Hmm.

128
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,023
You could tell all that
just from these lyrics?

129
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,089
Do you know why Dr. Winthrop had his secretary

130
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,859
transcribe the lyrics to your CD?

131
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,328
You're asking the wrong person.

132
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,199
Unfortunately, we can't ask the right persons.

133
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,066
GOREN: You're up for the chairmanship
of your department, right?

134
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,111
Winthrop was meeting
with the search committee?

135
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,310
The committee had already voted

136
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,213
to approve my recommendation.

137
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:58,513
Well, maybe Massa Winthrop was hoping
your lyrics would change their mind.

138
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,188
What is this about?

139
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,229
Your whereabouts Tuesday night.

140
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,026
I was in my office, here, grading papers.

141
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,359
These papers here?

142
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,130
Yes, sure, those papers.

143
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,334
"Bitch: Gender Metaphors in the
American Literary Tradition."

144
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,544
These courses sound like a lot of fun.

145
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,683
I try to keep things lively.

146
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,211
This is cool here, what
you wrote in the margin.

147
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,846
"Civilization, an old bitch gone in the teeth."

148
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,284
Did you make that up?

149
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,825
No, Ezra Pound did.

150
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,862
EAMES: Can anybody vouch
you were here all evening?

151
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,695
Valerie Goodman, she's one
of my teaching assistants.

152
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,903
Good old Ezra Pound.

153
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,270
VALERIE: I was checking footnotes

154
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,073
for Professor Sanders'
next book until about 10:00.

155
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:57,047
He told us he was grading
papers on gender metaphors.

156
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,377
That sounds right.

157
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,611
He made an interesting
notation on one of the papers.

158
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,677
"Civilization, an old bitch
gone in the teeth."

159
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,781
It's by Ezra Pound. Did you know that?

160
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,017
No, but it sounds like Pound.

161
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,995
Professor Sanders knew it was Pound.

162
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,022
Why wouldn't he?

163
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,960
Well, he would. But you see,

164
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,937
the person who made the notation,

165
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,033
the person who actually graded the paper,

166
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,103
attributed the quote to T.S. Eliot.

167
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,478
Professor Sanders wasn't in that
night grading papers, was he?

168
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,287
True or false, Miss Goodman?
And we don't give incompletes.

169
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,061
He said he had a dinner with some people

170
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,620
from NYU about a job offer.

171
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,029
How long was the dinner?

172
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,861
He came back around 8:30.

173
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,434
- He was in a bad mood.
- Why?

174
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,430
He didn't say. He just
shut himself in his office

175
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,735
and got on the phone.

176
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,205
Then he left at 9:30.

177
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,775
He told me if anybody asked,

178
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,978
he was grading papers all night.

179
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,811
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,548
It's okay, Valerie. Thanks.

181
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,596
Doesn't sound like he got that job offer.

182
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,289
That would make him more desperate
to get his promotion here.

183
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,029
Except Miss Goodman alibis him
for the time of the murder.

184
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,965
He made a call from his office.

185
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,835
Professor Sanders is a charismatic teacher

186
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,537
surrounded by impressionable minds.

187
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,043
Students lie for him.

188
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,377
Maybe one of them killed for extra credit.

189
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,820
Doorknobs in Winthrop's office
had been wiped clean.

190
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:47,086
No witnesses who saw anybody leave
the administration building.

191
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,649
Any candidates for the extra credit?

192
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,661
We've cleared Sanders' teaching assistants.

193
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,755
Now we're looking at the PhD
students in American Studies.

194
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,734
Sanders is their adviser. He's
probably known some of them for years.

195
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,201
How's this for a dissertation topic?

196
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,063
"Fighting in the Captain's Tower.

197
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,335
"The Influence of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound

198
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,468
"on American Popular Culture."

199
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,107
Sounds like the same guy
who graded Sanders' papers.

200
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,446
Yeah, and confused Eliot
and Pound. Mark Bayley.

201
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,250
He's been working on this
dissertation for 10 years.

202
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,490
Don't universities put a
clock on these things?

203
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,787
Bayley's gotten five extensions.

204
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,693
And a nice chunk of change in student loans.

205
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,135
BAYLEY: Professor Sanders travels a lot,
so I offered to grade those papers.

206
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,639
Is that why your thesis is taking so long,

207
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,301
you're too busy doing favors
for Professor Sanders?

208
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,541
My thesis is coming along fine.

209
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,243
"The old bitch gone in the teeth."

210
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,175
That's Pound, right?

211
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,410
No, Eliot.

212
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,611
Professor Sanders says it's Pound.

213
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,583
EAMES: You sleep here?

214
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,921
I'm between apartments.

215
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,321
Besides your student loans,
how do you support yourself?

216
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,863
I work at the library on Saturdays.

217
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,730
Well, at least you eat healthy.

218
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,172
I told you it was Pound.

219
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,373
Maybe that's why your
thesis is taking so long.

220
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,039
When'd you quit?

221
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,986
You've got nicotine gum.

222
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,355
Two years ago.

223
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,789
When does your current extension
run out? At the end of this semester?

224
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,091
It's just a technicality.

225
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,393
Winthrop's phone logs have you
calling him every day about it.

226
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,866
You were practically stalking him.

227
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,903
That's not true.

228
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,637
Anyway, extensions are up to
the chair of the department.

229
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,797
The new chair.

230
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,534
Your hero, Professor Sanders.

231
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,372
Sanders call you Tuesday
night to see Winthrop?

232
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,909
No, I was here Tuesday
night. Nobody called me.

233
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,483
What about your girlfriend?

234
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,815
What girlfriend?

235
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,781
The one who bought you these shoes.

236
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,249
- I bought them.
- No, you didn't.

237
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,727
Those are the kind of shoes
you buy. Converse, Vans.

238
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,231
Come on, these are...
Well, they definitely have a woman's touch.

239
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,959
I bought these shoes myself. I had a wedding.

240
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,437
You wore tan shoes to a wedding?

241
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,005
Yes, I wore tan shoes.

242
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,972
You people are wasting my time.

243
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,311
Not just any tan shoes.
$2,000-a-pair John Lobb tan shoes.

244
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,856
We could just ask.

245
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,052
(SIGHING)
See anything you like?

246
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,329
I don't see anything I don't like.

247
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,522
My wife thinks I need a new
pair of everyday shoes.

248
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,123
Well, I should say.

249
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,665
Darling. These?

250
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,830
I don't know. The whole ankle-boot thing...

251
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:52,536
I know. You really liked the
pair that Mark was wearing.

252
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,600
He said he bought them here recently.

253
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,839
Not him, his girlfriend.

254
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,675
Mark never pays for anything
unless he has to.

255
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,912
Do you see the shoes here?

256
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,017
Not the exact shoe.

257
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,820
Oh, I'm starting to get frustrated.

258
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,828
Well, you'd have a record
of what they bought, right?

259
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,220
I mean, you could look it up.

260
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,732
Mark's early thirties, curly hair.

261
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:20,328
Student at Hudson, orange backpack,
chews gum, nicotine gum.

262
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:24,034
Oh, yes, yes. He came in
wearing skateboard loafers.

263
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,669
But his girlfriend, she's a stunner.

264
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,713
Then again, I'm a sucker
for the take-charge type.

265
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,577
Oh, you noticed that about her.

266
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,714
She must've made him try on 30 pairs.

267
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,718
She was whipping him into shape.
Not that he seemed to mind.

268
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,415
Oh, here they are. It was a pair
of double-buckle Williams.

269
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,394
Look at how Elizabeth spells
her last name. Hitchens with an “e”.

270
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,829
Is her number on there? I want
to ask her to dinner Saturday night.

271
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,195
What a good idea.

272
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,296
Excuse me.

273
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,200
Isn't that the Hudson University switchboard?

274
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,937
She did say something about
being a visiting professor.

275
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,635
A professor?

276
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,945
Well, he didn't tell us that.

277
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,509
Your cousin's a very bad boy.

278
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,374
Thanks.

279
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,214
HITCHENS: Terrible business, this murder.

280
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,885
My colleagues at Oxford gave me
dire warnings about America.

281
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,428
And this just confirms their worst fears.

282
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,359
Well, we hope it doesn't
sour you on our country.

283
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,231
Oh, heavens, no. A little
danger keeps you on your toes.

284
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,864
This place doesn't look all that dangerous.

285
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,964
Hudson's taking good care of you.

286
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,542
Actually, an Oxford alumnus volunteered it.

287
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,740
He's spending the year abroad. So
rather than having the flat sit empty...

288
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,212
How lucky for you.

289
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,980
Well, I assume that my good fortune
isn't what brought you here.

290
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,746
You are obviously here to talk
to me about Winthrop's murder,

291
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,587
which I'm sorry to say I know nothing about.

292
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,520
We're going with the theory it's
somebody at the university.

293
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,729
Well, everyone knows that academics
are all talk and no action.

294
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,528
Does that include you?

295
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:00,795
If it did, I would've stayed in my
cozy little office on Manor Road

296
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,703
lecturing women's writing

297
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,834
and punting on the Cherwell on the weekends.

298
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,970
No skinny-dipping in Parson's Pleasure?

299
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,774
Very good, Detective.

300
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,944
Did you memorize the Oxford
tour guide on your way here?

301
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,210
No.

302
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,851
No, I spent a couple of weeks there once

303
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,717
chasing coeds.

304
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,593
Took you that long to catch one? I'm shocked.

305
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,926
Well, that's very funny, Professor.

306
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,964
Does Mark Bayley find you funny?

307
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:39,767
He might, if he had a sense of
humor. I don't know him that well.

308
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,812
Well enough to buy him a pair of shoes.

309
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,312
Just a gesture.

310
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,374
You know graduate students.
They never have a pot to piss in,

311
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,788
and Bayley was on his uppers, literally.

312
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,645
I see you like opera.

313
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,586
These tickets for Don Giovanni.

314
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:00,355
Yes. Not my favorite.
I lean towards Penderecki.

315
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,534
I hate to be a spoilsport, but did
you see Bayley Tuesday night?

316
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,197
No. Why would I?

317
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,100
EAMES: You might have, if you
were having an affair with him.

318
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,834
Well, that would be
against university policy.

319
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,347
The bottom line, she didn't alibi Bayley.

320
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,349
No. But she lied about
having an affair with him.

321
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,208
Men only let two kinds
of women buy shoes for them,

322
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,619
their mommies and their significant others.

323
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,389
Hitchens' work visa expires in three months.

324
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,917
Any extension has to be supported by
the new chairman of her department.

325
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,730
Assuming Sanders would support her

326
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,788
and that she even wants to stay.

327
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:39,393
She's bought a new subscription
for the opera.

328
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:43,335
She's applied for a driver's license.

329
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,834
She's making herself at home.

330
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,406
I didn't tell them about the shoes.

331
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,881
It's that big detective who noticed them.

332
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,677
That big detective is smart.

333
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,517
He traced the shoes to the store.

334
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,093
The whole thing's coming apart.

335
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,954
People think Sanders had
something to do with it.

336
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,828
Now he won't get the chairmanship.

337
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,563
It'll blow over.

338
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,330
What?

339
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:20,701
Nothing. Just have your gum and get into bed.

340
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,821
I doubt if Roland Sanders would
want to keep Elizabeth on.

341
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,057
He once accused her of being an apologist

342
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,219
for Australia's shabby
treatment of the aborigines.

343
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,058
- She's Australian?
- Mmm-hmm.

344
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,595
A graduate of the University of Sydney.

345
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,662
Well, you could never tell by her accent.

346
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,998
What else do you know about her?

347
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,700
Well, she ran an educational
foundation in Australia.

348
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,705
Rising star at Oxford.

349
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,607
If she's a rising star at Oxford,
why leave in the first place?

350
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,809
I don't know. Whatever her
plans, they don't matter now.

351
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,981
Sanders has no hope of becoming
chair. His candidacy is tainted.

352
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,320
Who's next in line?

353
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,855
Christine Fellowes. It's pretty much a lock.

354
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,201
In theory, I wouldn't be opposed to
offering someone of Elizabeth's caliber

355
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,565
a permanent position.

356
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,468
In theory. What about in practice?

357
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,302
I'm not head of the department yet.

358
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,502
Please, the regents will decide on Friday.

359
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,340
- But you're already packing.
- Well...

360
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,347
Let me help you with this.

361
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,383
Penderecki. The Devils of Loudon.

362
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,111
You like opera?

363
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,951
I'm getting to. This was a gift.

364
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,387
There was a beautiful performance

365
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,985
of Don Giovanni the other night.

366
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,655
You would've loved it.

367
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,157
I did. A friend took me.

368
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,004
Friends with good taste, huh?

369
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,971
One more thing.

370
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,407
This professional student, Mark Bayley,

371
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,911
would you give him an extension
if you became chair?

372
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,985
He's already written a
thousand pages of his thesis

373
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,817
and he's nowhere near done.

374
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,486
He needs to go.

375
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,124
Professor Hitchens will be sorry.

376
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,460
Why would she? She thinks he's an idiot.

377
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,998
Oh, no. I think she's

378
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,969
been able to overlook his shortcomings.

379
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,635
They've become close friends.

380
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,238
At least, that's what we heard. I...

381
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,842
Your source is wrong.

382
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,622
Elizabeth wouldn't violate
university policy.

383
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,817
Not if she wanted to be asked back.

384
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,197
In American literature,
the descent into madness

385
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,858
is usually preceded by obsession.

386
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,634
A consuming obsession. Example, anyone?

387
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,067
All right. I'll get you started.

388
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,734
Moby-Dick.

389
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,835
What characterizes Ahab's obsession?

390
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,478
Yes, in the back.

391
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,015
The dogged, unrelenting pursuit of evil.

392
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,351
Interesting, evil.

393
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:26,827
I always fancied it was man's
unrelenting pursuit of his own potency.

394
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,361
All right, everyone, I expect
you to make a dent

395
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,595
in Moby-Dick by the end of the week.

396
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:39,070
Sometimes a whale is just a whale.

397
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,435
Nothing is ever just something.

398
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,913
Not even detectives.

399
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,506
Or professors.

400
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,515
Or graduate students, for that matter.

401
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,282
That sounds a bit ominous.

402
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,692
Well, it's certainly not
good news for Mark Bayley.

403
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,925
We're about to arrest him
for Winthrop's murder.

404
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,122
Am I expected to run and warn him?

405
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:06,068
Because you've seriously misconstrued
my relationship with him.

406
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,738
But you can settle a bet for me.

407
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,137
My partner thinks that

408
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,234
Bayley acted alone.

409
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,801
But I think that...

410
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,545
I think that Professor Sanders...

411
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,076
he put him up to it.

412
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,317
Why do you think that?

413
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,683
Well, Sanders,

414
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,986
he had the most to gain
from Winthrop's murder.

415
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,787
And the killing, well, it required

416
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,092
qualities that elude Bayley.

417
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:41,397
Planning, organization. I mean, you agree?

418
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,107
Well, you're not wrong about Mark.

419
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,201
There is a reason why
he hasn't finished his thesis.

420
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,177
He has no discipline.

421
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,816
I heard his thesis runs a thousand pages.

422
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,920
T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound have a love
child and his name is Bob Dylan.

423
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,819
I mean, donnez-moi un break.

424
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,018
This is what passes for
scholarship in this country?

425
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,425
So you don't think
popular culture's fair game?

426
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:08,226
Well, Mark's is the worst kind
of pop literary analysis.

427
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,928
Pathetic attempt to synthesize
high and low culture.

428
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,765
It wouldn't butter your parsnips.

429
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,606
You're right. We did

430
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,105
Misconstrue your relationship.

431
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,712
No, Mark.

432
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,881
Well, just tell them you don't know anything.

433
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,325
You don't know, you don't remember.

434
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,088
Yes, those are all good answers.

435
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,256
No, I can't see you tonight.

436
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,630
Look, Mark, you'll be fine.

437
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,997
Yes, same here.

438
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,613
Who was that on the phone? It was Bayley.

439
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,910
Why is he calling your cell phone?

440
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,110
I was calling him back, silly.

441
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,555
He's worried because his great mentor
Roland Sanders has fallen out of favor,

442
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,421
and he wants me to put in a
good word for him with you.

443
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,517
Why does he think you can help him?

444
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:14,029
Well, he's under the strange
delusion that you and I are friends.

445
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,409
GOREN: Hey, that's quite
a woman you got there.

446
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,671
A real take-charge lady, Elizabeth Hitchens.

447
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,743
I don't know.

448
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,278
The clerk at the shoe store said
she had you jumping through hoops.

449
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,314
I don't remember.

450
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,483
Well, let's face it, Mark.

451
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:47,156
That's exactly the kind of
woman a guy like you needs.

452
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,994
Somebody that helps you,

453
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,731
you know, keep those thoughts focused.

454
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,735
Do what has to be done, right?

455
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,533
I don't know.

456
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,438
Like killing Winthrop.
I mean, that was her idea.

457
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,603
No. It wasn't anybody's idea.

458
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,476
We're pretty sure it wasn't Sanders'.

459
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,344
I'm sure it wasn't yours.

460
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,384
I mean, even Hitchens thinks

461
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,680
that someone would have had
to put you up to it.

462
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,153
What do you mean, she thinks?

463
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:16,025
Well, she said that you
didn't have any discipline.

464
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,617
That's why you...

465
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,796
Well, you never finished your thesis.

466
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,763
The title, "Fighting in the Captain's
Tower," that's Dylan, right?

467
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,895
Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting
in the captain's tower.

468
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,064
Desolation Row.

469
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,541
The whole album's a touchstone
of American literature.

470
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,500
That's my thesis. Exactly.

471
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:38,139
What Hitchens said, exactly,
is, "Donnez-moi un break."

472
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:41,375
I'm trying to remember what else she said.

473
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:45,945
"The worst kind of pop literary analysis."

474
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,615
She said it was brave.

475
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,592
"A pathetic attempt to synthesize
high and low culture."

476
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,597
No, no. You're making it up.

477
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:55,854
Oh.

478
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,829
How did she put it?

479
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,773
"it wouldn't butter your parsnips."

480
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,903
I'm not making it up, am I?

481
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,338
She used you, Mark,

482
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,476
to kill Winthrop, to discredit Sanders,

483
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:17,043
so the promotion would go to her
friend, Christine Fellowes.

484
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,985
Her close and intimate friend.

485
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,928
Oh, my God.

486
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,435
Oh, God.

487
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,901
What did I do?

488
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,867
You want to tell us what happened?

489
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,376
She told me to...

490
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,409
She planned it.

491
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,543
I'll get a stenographer.

492
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,826
She told Winthrop to meet her at his office.

493
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,063
Why did I listen to her?

494
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,037
How did you get in the building?

495
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,505
She gave me a key.

496
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,267
She took it from Professor Fellowes.
She said she never uses it.

497
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,671
You still have it?

498
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,147
No. I gave it back.

499
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,547
Mark, are you all right?

500
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,187
Call the paramedics!

501
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,724
There's no pulse. He just stopped breathing.

502
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,237
Bayley died of anaphylactic shock

503
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,138
brought on by an allergic reaction.

504
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,199
- A reaction to what?
- They don't know yet.

505
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,270
We're waiting for the tox report
and Bayley's medical records.

506
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,110
Before he died, he implicated Hitchens.

507
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,844
His statement's of no use now.

508
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,011
Have you heard from Scotland Yard?

509
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,145
They have no outstanding
warrants for Hitchens,

510
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,587
no open investigations.

511
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:03,252
Bayley's allergic reaction was to
peanuts, specifically peanut oil.

512
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,319
The nicotine gum. She spiked it

513
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,660
with a needle through the packaging.

514
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,756
She knew he was a liability.

515
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,868
When I went to her class,

516
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,035
she knew what I was doing.

517
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,870
She knew I'd use her words to turn him.

518
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:23,106
We can't assume she knew he had an allergy.

519
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,239
It's in his medical records.
He might have mentioned it to her.

520
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,542
What I had in mind was proof she knew.

521
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,886
Well, it depends if Bayley eats alone.

522
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:36,893
Two months ago, he was rushed to
Emergency from a Thai restaurant.

523
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,955
Peanuts are a common
ingredient in Thai cooking.

524
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,192
VANA: Yes, I remember them.

525
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,862
He got very sick. They should have told us

526
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,530
- he was allergic to peanuts.
- Who ordered?

527
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:53,042
The woman. She ordered
som tum. Green papaya salad.

528
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,175
Thai chili, fish sauce and peanuts.

529
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,841
Well, it's clearly marked which dishes
have peanuts. Didn't he see this?

530
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,043
Sure. But the woman ordered in Thai.

531
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,885
So Bayley wouldn't understand.

532
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:07,284
She speak fluent Thai?

533
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,792
Yes, but low-class.

534
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,187
Did she say how she learned it?

535
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,027
She said she lived in Thailand 15 years ago.

536
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,998
(STAMMERING)
She say where?

537
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,229
I asked. She laughed. She said in Chatuchak.

538
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,164
Chatuchak is the location

539
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,367
of the Lard Yao Maximum Women's Prison.

540
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,137
I did a search for Australian women

541
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,304
who had been imprisoned in Thailand.

542
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,678
I found one who matched Hitchens.

543
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,610
Nicole Wallace.

544
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,216
She and her French boyfriend

545
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,919
were convicted of killing eight
male tourists in Thailand.

546
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,322
She'd seduce them, they'd rob
them and he'd kill them.

547
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,730
At the trial, she testified against him.

548
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,793
He got life, she served 10 years

549
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,065
and got deported back to Australia.

550
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,238
It could be her.

551
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:01,339
The Australian Consulate's getting me a
passport photo of the real Elizabeth Hitchens.

552
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,971
The one who was studying
at the University of Sydney

553
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,016
while Nicole Wallace was in prison.

554
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,813
Wallace passed herself off
as a professor of literature.

555
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,354
- Quite a feat.
- Well, maybe it was catching up to her.

556
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,153
That might explain why she's
desperate to establish herself here.

557
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,463
Then where's the real Professor Hitchens?

558
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,199
Nicole Wallace killed
the real Elizabeth Hitchens,

559
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,435
applied for a passport in her
name and went off to Oxford.

560
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,145
This woman's very, very good.

561
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,890
Oh, good, you're both here.

562
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,324
Can we come in?

563
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,429
We heard. It's official.

564
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,755
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

565
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,231
Now that you're chair of the department,

566
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:59,235
you can give your friend that
permanent job she's wanted so much.

567
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,565
Well, I don't know about that.

568
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,232
GOREN: She's a real catch.

569
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,043
Now I could be wrong,

570
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,516
but there can't be many Oxford professors

571
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,644
who've spent time in Thai prison.

572
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,449
For eight murders, no less.

573
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,023
Are we meant to take this seriously?

574
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,463
It's thanks to her you got your promotion.

575
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,635
She helped Mark Bayley kill Winthrop.

576
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,469
You can stop right now.

577
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,638
Bayley told us the whole
story before he died

578
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,005
from poisoning.

579
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,908
I don't believe any of this.

580
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,140
Prove it for yourself.

581
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:51,745
She stole the key to the
administration building from you

582
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,487
and gave it to Bayley.

583
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,417
I would've noticed.

584
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,257
She slipped it back on your key ring.

585
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,300
Except Bayley gave her back
the wrong key by mistake.

586
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:09,004
He gave her his spare to his office.

587
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,771
You've really outdone yourselves, Detectives.

588
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,611
Well, let's check Bayley's office.

589
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,849
This should be the administration key.

590
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:37,365
It's you who outdid yourself, Nicole.

591
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,603
That is your name, Nicole Wallace?

592
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:44,474
This is utter nonsense, Christine.

593
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,772
It's a trick. I didn't take your key.

594
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,312
(WHISPERING)
You did sleep with him.

595
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,577
You lied to me.

596
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,943
For heaven's sake, Christine.

597
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,786
I can't have you here.

598
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:59,448
You're relieved of your
duties as of immediately.

599
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,491
In that case, you're under arrest.

600
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,048
For what?

601
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:06,856
You just got fired. You're in
violation of your work visa.

602
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,469
Nothing has happened to Elizabeth Hitchens

603
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,870
because I am Elizabeth Hitchens.

604
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,466
I mean, do you honestly think that
I could fool the dons of Oxford

605
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,604
for one minute if I wasn't who I say I am?

606
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,978
You had plenty of time
to read in Lard Yao Prison.

607
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:30,884
My dear woman, there is more to literary
scholarship than reading books.

608
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,854
Nobody said you aren't bright, Nicole.

609
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,755
- Elizabeth.
- Nicole.

610
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:40,958
The game's up. You botched the key exchange.

611
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,562
Bayley gave you the wrong key.

612
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,624
You know bloody well that that's not true.

613
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,829
No, I don't bloody well know.

614
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,498
But the real culprit does.

615
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,545
Now you see the problem.

616
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,919
You can't expose our trick without
exposing your own culpability.

617
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,349
EAMES: And you know what that's called,

618
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,725
your being an expert on the
modern American novel and all.

619
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,661
Yes, well, I never much cared for Heller.

620
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,427
Look, you can bang on all you want,

621
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,992
but I am invoking my right to be silent.

622
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,560
No, you don't have that right.

623
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,403
I know what rights are, and I'm also
invoking my right to an attorney.

624
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,977
- No, you don't have that right either.
- What are you talking about?

625
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,138
EAMES: You're a foreign national

626
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,114
with no green card, no tourist visa,

627
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,481
no valid work permit.

628
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:39,114
GOREN: That makes you a person with no status.

629
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,952
I can keep you as long as I want to.

630
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,622
Until we build a case against you.

631
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,832
You wouldn't dare.

632
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,202
What do you mean, I can't see her?

633
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,966
I have been retained by the
university to represent her.

634
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,700
She's in this country illegally.

635
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,766
She is here employed under the
terms of a valid work visa.

636
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,140
I reinstated her.

637
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,942
I found out the police changed
the lock on Bayley's office

638
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,643
so that it could be opened with a
key to the administration building.

639
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,151
The whole thing was a sham.

640
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,949
We still believe Miss Hitchens
is here under false pretenses.

641
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,614
You're not entitled access to her.

642
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:14,782
We'll see.

643
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,820
I'm walking down the block into federal court

644
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,395
and filing for a writ of habeas corpus.

645
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,998
If you really are Elizabeth
Hitchens, this will be easy.

646
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,802
Just tell me the name of the
educational foundation in Melbourne.

647
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,476
I don't have it in my papers.

648
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,810
I'm sure that that's a lie.

649
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,275
And if I am impersonating Elizabeth
Hitchens, don't you think

650
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,719
that I would have committed her
entire work history to memory?

651
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,391
That's my

652
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,267
social security number and my birth date.

653
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,765
Yes, it's remarkable

654
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:08,010
the fountain of information that can
spring from those little numbers.

655
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,075
Home address, next of kin,

656
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:16,045
mother's maiden name, mother's address.

657
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,886
Tell me, Robert, how often do you
get up to the Carmel Ridge Center?

658
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,361
Once a week.

659
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,534
And a phone call every day.

660
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,632
How old were you when you first realized it?

661
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,233
No.

662
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,280
You want to play, then it's
gonna have to be tit for tat.

663
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,908
You have to tell me something true about you,

664
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:50,981
about Nicole.

665
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:53,950
All right.

666
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,955
I did meet Nicole before I left for England.

667
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,487
She told me things.

668
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,325
Where is she now?

669
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,629
I don't know.

670
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,139
Carried away by dingoes? It
happens a lot in Australia.

671
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,601
What did she tell you?

672
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,510
She told me that she

673
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:22,845
enjoyed being under the thumb
of her French boyfriend,

674
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,451
that relinquishing responsibility to him

675
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,350
gave her the unimaginable freedom

676
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:34,227
to commit violent crimes
without any guilt at all.

677
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,793
My turn.

678
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:46,035
How old were you when you
first realized your mommy

679
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,836
wasn't like all the other mommies?

680
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,532
Seven.

681
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,767
Were you ashamed?

682
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,438
And frightened. It's my turn.

683
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,247
How old were you when your
father first molested you?

684
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:37,716
It's the only explanation for
your intense hatred for men.

685
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,023
The murders in Thailand were an attempt

686
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,333
to correct the tragedy of your childhood.

687
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,132
To punish your abuser,

688
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,470
absolving yourself of guilt

689
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,209
by using a man to kill other men.

690
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:07,154
And not that you think much of women either,

691
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,089
but since your mother was

692
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,184
too scared

693
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,722
and too drunk,

694
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,363
too self-absorbed...

695
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,562
- No.
- To protect you.

696
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,868
None of those things happened.
None of those things are true.

697
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,101
No, that's why you can't form connections.

698
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:31,975
That's why you use sex as
an exercise in self-hatred.

699
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,219
That's why when you came back from Thailand

700
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,945
you supported yourself with
prostitution, didn't you, Nicole?

701
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:48,391
I am Elizabeth Hitchens. I am a professor

702
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,491
- of literature at...
- No. No!

703
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,603
When I met you,

704
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,765
you wanted me to know who you truly were.

705
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,868
How smart, how funny, how charming you are.

706
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,610
You wanted me to know you, Nicole Wallace.

707
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,710
The sparkling little girl

708
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,948
who survived horrible abuse

709
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,282
with her wits intact.

710
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,552
(DOOR OPENING)

711
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,360
- HARDIN: Professor Hitchens.
- (WHISPERING) Nicole.

712
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,231
I was retained by the
university to represent you.

713
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,172
The federal court has issued
a writ of habeas corpus

714
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,537
Ordering your immediate release.

715
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,544
I advise you to leave with me. Now, please.

716
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,957
That foundation that you
asked me about in Melbourne,

717
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,527
it was the George Hurstwood Foundation.

718
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,764
Come on.

719
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,436
I'm sorry, Detective.
There was nothing I could do.

720
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,374
No, the foundation, it's called
the New Covenant Foundation.

721
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,646
Why did she say the George Hurstwood?

722
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,647
She was trying to tell me something?

723
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,858
George Hurstwood.

724
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,526
Well, it's Sister Carrie.
It's a novel by Theodore Dreiser.

725
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,964
(STAMMERING)

726
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,268
George Hurstwood was a saloon keeper

727
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,531
who stole money from his boss' safe.

728
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,235
Nicole used the name of a thief to...

729
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,912
(STAMMERING)
I need to call Melbourne.

730
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,183
Okay. Thank you. Yes, we'll be back in touch.

731
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,112
The Melbourne police
recently started investigating

732
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,158
the financial affairs of the
New Covenant Foundation.

733
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:59,559
They suspect that five years
ago $400,000 were embezzled

734
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,154
by the then-president of the foundation.

735
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,496
Elizabeth Hitchens. The
real Elizabeth Hitchens.

736
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,365
Nicole Wallace stole the
identity of an embezzler.

737
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,471
I'm sure she didn't know it at the time.

738
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,173
She found out when she heard
about the investigation.

739
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,644
She knew the Australians would
catch up to her in England.

740
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,374
They'd extradite her back home.

741
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,750
That's why she wants US citizenship.

742
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,842
Because non-violent financial crimes

743
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,285
aren't covered by US extradition treaties.

744
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:29,223
If she became a citizen, the
Australians couldn't touch her.

745
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,756
She's not a citizen yet.

746
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,397
She's gone.

747
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,941
I came here, the door was
open, her things were gone.

748
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:46,998
I'll call the airports.

749
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,444
(FELLOWES CRYING)

750
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,019
What did you think, she'd have
scones and a glass of sherry for us?
