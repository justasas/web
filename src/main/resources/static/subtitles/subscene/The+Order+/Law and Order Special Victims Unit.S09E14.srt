1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,155
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:05,879
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,048
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,720
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,640
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,611
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:19,124
Hey, yeah, I'm on my way 
to an interview.

8
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,464
Yeah, communication degree is 
finally paying off.

9
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:23,440
Big bucks.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,810
Yeah, a high-tech firm wants 
my input on a project.

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,829
May I help you?

12
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:35,585
Actually, I'm here to help you.

13
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:41,242
You advertised in my alumni magazine
for ivy league sperm.

14
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,834
Says it pays up to $50,000.

15
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,631
That's for egg donors.

16
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:48,320
What about the boys?

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,703
$100 per collection.

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,107
That's a big pay gap.
Sexist, really.

19
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:59,032
Your procedure's much simpler
and you perform it yourself.

20
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:03,791
Well, since I'm here, I...

21
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,526
You need to fill out 
a detailed medical history.

22
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:06,939
Then we'll schedule you for a physical.

23
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:10,186
If you qualify, then you can donate 
twice a week for two years... / Stop!

24
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:13,709
- Somebody stop her!
- Hey, I think they want you to... Unh!

25
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:27,986
Chief of d's is heading our way,
and the captain doesn't look happy.

26
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:29,250
What did I do now?

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,042
Olivia.

28
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:34,283
Elliot, I understand 
you're a proud new papa.

29
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:38,023
- Hmm... Oh, this is the little tyke?
- Eli.

30
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:41,759
- Hmm, now that is fine work, detective.
- Thank you.

31
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,189
The chief has personally assigned us a case.
Wants it top priority.

32
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,613
Absolutely. What is it?

33
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,904
Robbery and aggravated assault.

34
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:52,928
A deranged female perp stole 
a portable cryotank from a clinic.

35
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:56,492
Put a good samaritan who tried to stop her
into bellevue with a concussion.

36
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:59,802
2-6 caught it a couple of days ago.
They're sending over the file.

37
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:01,054
What's in the cryotank?

38
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,953
The victims.
About 100 frozen embryo.

39
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:06,499
Fertilized eggs. 
Eight cells each.

40
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,817
Don doesn't believe this falls 
under your purview.

41
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:12,286
But those are potential children
who have been kidnapped.

42
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:15,551
If they're not special victims, who is?

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:2008/01/22

59
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:08,320
Of all the detectives to have had this case
before us, why'd it have to be fiorello?

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,928
Marty's a good guy. 
What's your problem with him?

61
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,785
I can't understand his handwriting.

62
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:14,646
- It's like a serial killer's. 
- Worse. It's like a doctor.

63
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:16,156
I gotta tell you, 
he didn't do much leg work.

64
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:18,563
There's no prints, no suspects.
There's no leads.

65
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:20,309
Can you make this out?

66
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,067
"Hormonal wannabe mama. 
Re-interview." nice...

67
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,338
Look, I like marty,
but it's probably best we're handling this.

68
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,806
And here's the reason we are.

69
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:30,552
Guess who one of 
the stolen embryos belongs to?

70
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:32,051
Police commissioner and his wife.

71
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,934
Well, I'm sure that he's every bit upset
as the rest of the victims.

72
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:37,617
Yeah, I know, but we've got a lot of cases
we should be working ahead of this one.

73
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,437
Well, it's not like somebody stole 
their hubcaps, Elliot.

74
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,578
Do you know what they went 
through to get those embryos?

75
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:45,139
You know, I don't.
I had kids the old-fashioned way.

76
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,682
Well, some people aren't as blessed 
as you are.

77
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,868
Fiorello red-flagged a couple of client

78
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,298
whose embryos were were stolen 
as troubled cases.

79
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:55,656
We'll go talk to them.

80
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:56,592
We'll take the clinic.

81
00:03:56,592 --> 00:04:00,710
What I want to know is why are some 
of the names on this patient list redacted?

82
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:03,728
HUSDON CRYOBANK
313 WORTH STREET
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16

83
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:06,663
These names are blacked out
to prevent doctor-client privilege.

84
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,461
If patients don't want their information 
released, my hands are tied.

85
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,294
But why wouldn't they cooperate?
If my future kids were stolen, I would.

86
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,687
For some it's a very private matter.
Others I haven't gotten a hold of yet.

87
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,957
Anybody unhappy with your services?

88
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,433
People are always disappointed 
if the procedure fails.

89
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,082
And then there are those who are
morally opposed to what I do.

90
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:26,204
Well, maybe one of them did this
to stop you from playing god.

91
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:28,514
Unlikely.
To them, every embryo is sacred.

92
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:31,596
- Could have they been destroyed?
- It'd be a tragedy.

93
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:36,242
You know, many of these couples
have been trying for years to get pregnant.

94
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,904
One woman went through in vitro

95
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,991
before undergoing chemotherapy,
which made her infertile.

96
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,753
It's her last chance to have a baby.

97
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:44,771
She's been hounding me 
to do the implantation,

98
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:47,810
but I've insisted she wait six months 
after the chemo.

99
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,436
Maybe she got tired of waiting.

100
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:51,912
Another client, kelly ryland,

101
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:56,708
froze her eggs before shipping out to iraq
as an insurance policy for her husband.

102
00:04:58,082 --> 00:04:59,569
How long will the stolen embryos last?

103
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:03,091
Six or seven days until the liquid nitrogen 
in the tank evaporates.

104
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:04,515
She grabbed them two days ago.

105
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,064
It was filled two days before that.

106
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:08,740
So the best case scenario,
we have less than three days to find them.

107
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,171
Would she know whose she was taking?

108
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:14,263
Each client's is stored
in an individually marked ampoule.

109
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,443
The bigger tanks can hold up 
to 20,000 samples.

110
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,089
You do a booming business.

111
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:23,618
Women are putting off having children
longer and longer now.

112
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:26,917
Especially those with careers.
Some wait too long.

113
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:31,400
And for these women with limited time,
these embryos are extremely valuable.

114
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,473
Clients spend tens of thousands 
of dollars each.

115
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:34,819
You're saying they have a street value.

116
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:37,872
Well, a few of the embryos screened 
positive for rare diseases

117
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:40,139
and were marked by their owners
for disposal.

118
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,585
To a researcher, they'd be priceless.

119
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:46,129
You punched a keypad to get in here.
How did the thief know the code?

120
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,025
I'm an idiot. I let her right in.

121
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:51,145
Why would you let a stranger 
in a restricted area?

122
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah. Hold on.
I don't want to make another stupid mistake.

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,617
That's an embryo.

124
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:58,315
Three days old.

125
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:02,069
I'm extracting a cell
for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis

126
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,452
to make sure 
we implant only healthy embryos.

127
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:08,791
I was running out to give Dr. Berletch
some bad news on one,

128
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,408
and I think that's when she slipped in.

129
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:11,507
Get a good look at her?

130
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:13,141
I had my nose in a file.

131
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:16,072
The screening showed a marker
for duchenne muscular dystrophy.

132
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:17,929
All I remember is blonde hair.

133
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:20,662
- These all accounted for? 
- Thankfully, yes.

134
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:23,941
Before freezing, they have to be kept 
at a constant 98.6 degrees,

135
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:25,575
just like in the womb.

136
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:29,099
They're all babies Dr. Berletch 
helped conceive through in vitro.

137
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,905
Do you have some place we can interview
the rest of the employees?

138
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,370
The procedure rooms are private, 
but a bit cramped.

139
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,167
I'll ask Dr. Berletch 
if you can use his office.

140
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,805
How about ex-employees? 
Any disgruntled ones?

141
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:42,020
No, but we have a few clients
that are tied up in lawsuits.

142
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,828
APARTMENT OF MAYA JORGENSEN
607 WEST 87TH STREET
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16

143
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:48,873
They were holding my babies hostage.
Now they conveniently disappear?

144
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:50,702
Why were they keeping 
your embryos from you?

145
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,952
Because Stan, my sadistic ex-husband,
got a court order.

146
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:57,287
The clinic won't implant them 
till it goes to trial.

147
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,605
- Wait a minute. Who's the father?
- Stan.

148
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,441
You're trying to have the baby 
of a man you hate?

149
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:03,775
I didn't always hate him.

150
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:05,829
We tried for years to get pregnant.

151
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:09,387
Finally we go through in vitro... Bam!
Jerk decides he wants out of the marriage.

152
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,720
The baby would be his too.

153
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,561
You don't think he should have a say 
in the matter?

154
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:14,606
He had a say 
when he fertilized my eggs.

155
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:16,790
What am I supposed to do? 
Toss 'em in the garbage?

156
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,176
Trust me, you're going 
through a nasty divorce.

157
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,990
You're lucky you're not dragging 
a kid through that.

158
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,297
I'm divorced with no prospects.

159
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:27,294
I want children. 
All I have are these embryos.

160
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:29,119
Do you have them, maya?

161
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,725
Oh, you think I took them?

162
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,283
If I have a baby in nine months, 
come arrest me.

163
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:36,116
If anybody took them, it was Stan.

164
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:38,615
I don't want kids in any form.

165
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:40,524
Yeah, that's what we call a motive.

166
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,219
Hold my calls, Joanie.

167
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:44,672
I was here monday from 8:30 on.

168
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,131
We weren't going to ask you that, Stan.

169
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:49,696
But I would like to know 
where your secretary was.

170
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,523
Joanie? You gotta be kidding.

171
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:53,289
You ever have her run any errands for you?

172
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,120
Like pick up your laundry, lunch?

173
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,748
Future kids?

174
00:07:57,748 --> 00:08:00,424
- She was here. Ask anyone.
- We'll do that.

175
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:02,347
How's your court case coming?

176
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,796
Well, it's making my lawyer very rich.

177
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:07,860
Again, Stan, motive.

178
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,267
You want motive?
Talk to my greedy pig of an ex-wife.

179
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,173
Taking half my earnings isn't enough.

180
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,745
Now she wants to stick me 
for child support too.

181
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:20,224
And those embryos disappearing
save you from 18 years of ball squeezing.

182
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:22,832
I'm fighting a financial 
and biological relationship

183
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:25,692
I don't want, but I'm not a sociopath.

184
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:28,665
What would I have against
all those other couples' embryos?

185
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:30,730
Fertility clinics are death camps.

186
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,411
People have a big problem 
with nazis practicing eugenics,

187
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,300
but no one's bothered
that doctors determine

188
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,557
which embryos are the purest
and then destroy all the rest.

189
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:40,619
- Or donate them to stem cell research.
- It's genocide.

190
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,993
Give us a minute.
Turn off the camera.

191
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:43,806
Who are you?

192
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:45,795
James and Victoria Grall with the VDL.

193
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:47,014
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar.

194
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:48,433
The values defense league.

195
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:52,032
You just admitted on camera that you 
had a personal vendetta against this clinic.

196
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,448
Which was recently vandalized.
Was that somebody from your group?

197
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:57,886
You obviously didn't see
the beginning of our press conference.

198
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:00,454
Yeah, well, so did most of the press.

199
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:02,587
We believe that life begins at conception.

200
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:05,187
Embryos are human beings.
We wouldn't hurt a single one.

201
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:07,842
Now, we made an appeal that 
whoever took them return them to us,

202
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:09,124
no questions asked.

203
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:11,651
Which would make you an accessory 
after the fact.

204
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,265
No, no, we're gonna return them here.

205
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:15,415
Back to the place that 
you consider a death camp.

206
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:18,356
We'd like people to consider
adopting the extra unwanted embryos

207
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:19,501
and then bringing them to term.

208
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,936
Because donation is always an option.

209
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,559
There's no reason a single one 
ever has to be destroyed.

210
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,438
These people believe that if an embryo
screens positive

211
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:31,158
for some devastating fatal disease,
like tay-sachs,

212
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:32,719
- it should still be implanted.
- Yeah.

213
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,505
Knowing full well 
that the baby that comes out

214
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,192
will never know anything 
but pain and suffering.

215
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:37,872
- Look, it's tough. 
- No, it's not.

216
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:40,031
You give your kid a fighting chance.

217
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,927
Hi. Detective Benson.
Can I help you?

218
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:45,312
I hope so.

219
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:48,278
The cryobank said 
you were handling my case.

220
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,811
- Your embryos were stolen. 
- Yeah.

221
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:52,713
Have you made any progress?

222
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:54,746
We're working on it.

223
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,773
Can I get your name, please?

224
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,724
Eva Sintzel.

225
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,627
Okay.

226
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:02,719
I need you to know how important it is
that you find them.

227
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,434
I do, Mrs. Sintzel.

228
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:07,215
No, I'm not married. 
I'm not dating for that matter.

229
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:10,707
Okay, so the father's no longer 
in the picture?

230
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:13,695
No, my eggs were fertilized 
by donor sperm

231
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,830
that I picked out of a catalog.

232
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,890
Now really how I dreamed 
of it happening growing up,

233
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,347
but I ran out of time.

234
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:25,521
Forgive me for prying,
but you're so young and attractive.

235
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:27,418
I'm not that young.

236
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:31,072
I got caught up in my career,
and time just...

237
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:32,926
Got away from me, you know?

238
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:36,840
I was in complete denial 
about my biological clock.

239
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:39,806
And then I got cancer.

240
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,584
Oh, Dr. Berletch told me about you.

241
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:48,224
That because of the chemotherapy
you can't produce any more eggs.

242
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:51,340
So these embryos are my last chance.

243
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,005
Liv.

244
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,209
Well, I'll let you go. thank you.

245
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,287
Okay.
Eva...

246
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,103
We'll find 'em.

247
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,456
Dr. Berletch called. Says there's 
another couple that we should check out.

248
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:08,541
Why? / Wouldn't say.
Just that their case is controversial.

249
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:12,409
HARVEY RESIDENCE 
1402 OAKCREST AVENUE 
HEWLETT, NEW YORK
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16

250
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:15,541
We took her to dozens 
of specialists for years.

251
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,703
They did test after test on her.

252
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:20,894
They never figured out
the cause of alicia's brain damage.

253
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:23,184
She has the mental age 
of a three-month-old baby.

254
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:25,921
- And how old is she now?
- Eight.

255
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:29,758
She'll never be able to walk, talk,
eat on her own, even hold her head up.

256
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,063
You had her through in vitro?

257
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:32,905
No, we had her naturally.

258
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:34,294
So you're screening 
to make sure that

259
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,102
your next child doesn't have 
the same disorder.

260
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:41,010
We didn't have embryos 
in the stolen tank. Just eggs.

261
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,741
Our case was published 
in a medical journal.

262
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:44,786
A lot of people are upset about it.

263
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:48,331
We've been flooded with hate mail,
hang-up calls, even threats. / Why?

264
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,158
The eggs aren't mine.

265
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,198
Well, whose are they?

266
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:54,355
They're my little girl's.

267
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:06,181
Girls' eggs don't start to mature
till they hit puberty.

268
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:07,727
Your daughter is only eight.

269
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,436
Alicia is taking high-dose 
estrogen treatments.

270
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:11,782
Turn her into a baby-making machine.

271
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:15,304
We only did one collection cycle.
I'd be her surrogate.

272
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:17,607
You'd be giving birth 
to your own grandchild.

273
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:18,761
She wouldn't be the first.

274
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:22,016
A 51-year-old woman in the brazil
just carried twin boys for her daughter.

275
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:24,458
Did the daughter have a say in it?

276
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:28,390
I'm unable to conceive again,
and alicia can never get pregnant.

277
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,254
Without harvesting our daughter's eggs,
our family line ends with her.

278
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:35,852
Maybe somebody thinks that it should
and stole the cryotank.

279
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:38,086
Now, you said you received hate mail.
You still have it?

280
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:39,445
We throw it out as it comes.

281
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:43,472
Have you been bothered by anybody
from the values defense league? / No.

282
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,623
And you really think
that carrying on your family name

283
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:49,451
justifies putting alicia 
through fertility treatments.

284
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,298
That wasn't the original goal.

285
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:54,931
Menstruation is a side-effect of 
an experimental procedure she's undergoing.

286
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:57,795
- To do what?
- Stunt her growth.

287
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:00,721
Why?

288
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,035
Alicia doesn't understand words,
but like babies she reacts to tense voices.

289
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:09,846
Let's take this downstairs.

290
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,287
Growth plates fuse at the end of puberty.

291
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:16,240
Doctors started hers early
to stop her from getting any bigger.

292
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,184
Oh, so you're purposely deforming 
your daughter.

293
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:19,745
To enhance her quality of life.

294
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:20,901
Sounds like a great future.

295
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,257
Alicia can't turn herself over.

296
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:24,861
We carry her to the dinner table.

297
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:27,768
Give her baths, put her in a stroller
to take her for a walk.

298
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:28,918
This is for your convenience.

299
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,634
The more movement Alicia gets 
the better her circulation,

300
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:34,015
which means fewer sores and infection.

301
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,518
What you're doing is wrong.

302
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:37,537
The bioethics committee disagreed.

303
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,782
We're not the first ones to do this.

304
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:42,416
It was done once 
before in washington state.

305
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,058
- Who are you calling?
- Children services.

306
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,979
Don't. / You can't possibly be okay
with what they're doing to her.

307
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:52,049
Look, it's a nightmare, but it's a bad 
situation no matter what they do.

308
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,668
They think they're doing 
what's best for the kid.

309
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:56,213
They're trapping her 
in a child's body forever.

310
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:58,654
Parents have to make hard choices.

311
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,346
Now, this last pregnancy,
kathy was over 40.

312
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:04,739
It... It makes for much higher risk.
Things like down syndrome...

313
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:06,921
And you know what? 
Eli turned out perfect.

314
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:10,883
So spare me the perils
of women over 40 having babies.

315
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,337
You know you'd make a great mom.

316
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:20,423
Oh, my god, 
I'm not having this conversation.

317
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:24,099
- You're great with kids.
- Yeah, I know.

318
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:31,681
Look, maybe you should start thinking
about having kids.

319
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:33,163
And any way you want to do it, 
I'll support you.

320
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,614
Elliot, do me a favor. / Yeah.

321
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:36,390
Shut up and drive.

322
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,249
NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY
PARK SLOPE BRANCH
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16

323
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,096
It's humane to get rid 
of the defective ones.

324
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:49,111
Babies born with 
homozygous achondroplasia

325
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:51,452
usually die within a year.

326
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:55,676
Their tiny chest cages 
cause constriction,

327
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:58,950
resulting in respiratory distress.

328
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,569
It's a nasty death.

329
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,054
That's what you were screening for.

330
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:06,352
We had a little girl named rose 
who had it.

331
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,020
She died in my arms.

332
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,884
I'm so sorry.

333
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:12,209
My husband is also a dwarf,

334
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,845
which gives us a 25% chance
of having a baby with the condition.

335
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:20,164
So you had them weed out the embryos
with the death sentence attached.

336
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:21,996
I donated them to research.

337
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:25,367
Sounds like the clinic helped you,
but we heard you caused a disturbance.

338
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,653
Yeah, well, after all of that,

339
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:29,692
my doctor refused to implant 
one of my healthy embryos.

340
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:31,548
He discriminated because of your size.

341
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,784
No, because of my baby's.

342
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:38,515
He wanted to use an embryo that 
would become what you'd call normal size.

343
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:40,172
I wanted an LP.

344
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,819
LP? Little person?

345
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:45,925
You wanted to purposely create a child
with a disability.

346
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:48,379
Size is not a disability.

347
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:51,252
We have normal lifespans and lives.

348
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:53,849
Why shouldn't I be allowed to have a child
who looks like me?

349
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,241
Everybody else can.

350
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:59,828
So if you weren't allowed to,
why should all those other parents, right?

351
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:04,118
I think someone would've noticed
if the thief were 4'1".

352
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,741
We getting anywhere?

353
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:08,020
Well, we had our sketch artist 
do a rendering.

354
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,901
That's one of our victims.
Should I put out an APB on him?

355
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:12,950
Where are we on suspects?

356
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,410
Maya and Stan Jergensen
are battling over embryo custody.

357
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,235
- Anybody else?
- I got one. Thirteen, actually.

358
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:24,139
Meet the masturbated race. 
They're donor sibs.

359
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,423
What does that mean?

360
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:28,910
Many mothers, only one daddy.
Donor 10-29.

361
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,011
They're wondering where to send
their father's day cards to.


362
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,606
Well, those kids have gotta be pissed.

363
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:35,398
Hudson Cryobank keeps 
sperm donors' names anonymous.

364
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:37,551
For all they know, 
I could be donor 10-29

365
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,422
Those kids don't look like freaks to me.

366
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:40,542
Well, of course not.

367
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,477
They're a fine-looking bunch 
I may or may not have sired.

368
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:47,963
Liv, if you're in the market,
you could do worse than donor 10-29.

369
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,095
You're an idiot.

370
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:56,702
How did these kids find each other?

371
00:16:56,702 --> 00:17:00,197
It's called donor sibling search.
They've got over 12,000 members signed up.

372
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,025
What's up with liv?

373
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,076
Case is getting to her.

374
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:12,328
Hey, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

375
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:14,502
No, I'm grateful 
that you could see me at all.

376
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:17,837
You sounded so upset when you called
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

377
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,100
Have you gotten anywhere 
since we last talked?

378
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,978
Well, I... I can't discuss
the details of the investigation with you,

379
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:27,219
but... No, nothing solid yet.

380
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:30,024
- Menu?
- Just coffee, please.

381
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:34,793
You're not gonna find them, are you?

382
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:37,171
I'm not gonna stop until I do.

383
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:39,114
And it'll be too late.

384
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:47,209
I should've forced Dr. Berletch
to implant them right after chemo ended.

385
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,930
Or taken them to a doctor who would.

386
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,964
But your chemo was successful, right?

387
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:55,872
Yeah, four months cancer-free.

388
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,603
And infertile.

389
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:05,982
I thought I was getting
a second shot at having a life.

390
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:08,606
And now this.

391
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:10,545
Eva, we still have some time.

392
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:12,570
No, we don't.

393
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,578
You know that, right?

394
00:18:14,578 --> 00:18:16,936
It's gonna run out.

395
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:24,337
Do you have kids?

396
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:26,830
Uh, no.

397
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,915
No.

398
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:31,469
Don't you want them?

399
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,517
I... yes, I do. Very much.

400
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:41,167
Then what are you waiting for?

401
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:48,732
Let's start in there. 
You can just leave it.

402
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:50,489
- Hold on a second. 
- Hey.

403
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:53,700
- Look, last night when Munch made that... 
- El, can we please just drop it?

404
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,479
Hey, I got something.

405
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,559
Fin, come here. 
I want to show you something.

406
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,042
This better not be 
another one of your jokes.

407
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,925
You think that's all I'm good for?

408
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,778
I've trying to figure out 
when the thief came in,

409
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:06,037
so I matched up the exits 
with the entrances.

410
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:08,094
Somebody came in 
that didn't go back out?

411
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,210
No, everyone who came in 
that day was accounted for.

412
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,285
So you called me over here 
to tell me you got nothing.

413
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,154
- She got in another way. 
- On another day.

414
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,429
I pulled the tapes from that night.

415
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,246
Blonde cleaning lady.

416
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,581
Yeah, she emptied the trash, 
but she didn't vacuum.

417
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:26,369
Not a very hard worker.
At least till she gets here.

418
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,293
Techs clean out the restricted areas themselves.

419
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,090
Cleaning company's not allowed in there.

420
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,215
Yeah, looks like she's trying
to figure out the code, but can't.

421
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:36,827
There she is leaving.

422
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,844
Yeah, and here she is coming back,

423
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:42,440
but we never pick her up 
leaving the building.

424
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,739
Where'd she hide all night?

425
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:46,189
Well, this is a business
that requires discretion.

426
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:49,638
There are no cameras in the procedure room.
Just... Magazines.

427
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:52,969
I'm afraid they're gonna have to get 
themselves a new cleaning lady.

428
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,647
Hudson Cryobank 
313 WORTH STREET
FRIDAY, JANUARY 18

429
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,854
So what do you guys want with me?

430
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:01,227
You're the regular cleaning person
for Hudson Cryobank, huh? / Yes.

431
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:03,796
- You work sunday night?
- Yeah.

432
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:07,833
- You look hotter on camera, Enrique.
- What?

433
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,912
We know you were involved in the burglary.
It had to be you, right?

434
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:15,121
Your service said
you put in a time card for it.

435
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,521
That wasn't me.

436
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:22,025
Who was it, Enrique?

437
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:24,653
I don't know.
Nobody was supposed to be working.

438
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:27,427
Look, you're already going down
for the aiding and abetting.

439
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,890
Don't take the whole grand larceny.

440
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:35,582
Last week she told me not 
to come in sunday night.

441
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:38,886
- Said I could put in for it anyway.
- Who?

442
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:43,446
Who was it, Carol?

443
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:44,659
What are you talking about?

444
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:45,997
Cuff her.

445
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:47,419
- Why? 
- You set it all up.

446
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,826
You told Enrique not to show up
to work last sunday.

447
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:51,515
You let your friend in here 
to steal those embryos.

448
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:54,118
Which in less than 12 hours 
are no longer viable.

449
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:57,588
Where are they?  / It was just for publicity.
They weren't going to hurt them.

450
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:59,469
They were supposed 
to bring them back today.

451
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:01,468
Who's they?  / You don't understand.
They called me.

452
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,662
They mailed me literature.
They... They talked to me on my way in.

453
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,416
And finally it got to me.
I mean, they have a point, you know...

454
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,104
who?

455
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:12,510
James Grall and his wife.
Victoria was wearing a wig.

456
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,858
You talking about those nuts 
from the values defense league?

457
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,951
Yeah, nice values.

458
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:24,107
Joining us now from the values defense league
are James and Victoria Grall...

459
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:26,421
She's on the air. 
You can't do...

460
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:28,981
I think what this theft highlights
is the fact that.

461
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:32,699
That embryos are human beings
and as such have constitutional rights.

462
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:33,631
You want rights?

463
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:35,329
How about your right to remain silent?
Let's go.

464
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:38,243
- Victoria Grall, you're under arrest.
- Don't do this.

465
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:41,351
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

466
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:42,970
You have the right to an attorney.

467
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,803
If you cannot afford one, 
one will be appointed to you.

468
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:51,219
There are over 400,000 frozen embryos
being warehoused in this country.

469
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:52,666
You just reduced that number by 100.

470
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,917
- They haven't been harmed.
- Time is running out here, James.

471
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:59,668
Now, you may not believe in science,
but it is very real here.

472
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,634
So does what's being done to them.

473
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:03,599
There's only a small fraction 
that will be implanted.

474
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,650
The rest will be destroyed.

475
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,689
The ones you took won't be viable 
in a few hours.

476
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:10,715
Drastic measures needed to be taken.
I had to get people's attention.

477
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:14,190
So tell us where they are,
and we will give you a full press conference.

478
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,332
People need to be told
that there are organizations out there

479
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:19,917
that will arrange for the adoption
of unwanted embryos.

480
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:24,620
That's great, especially for all those
gay and lesbian couples in the market.

481
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:26,732
They're only put in suitable homes.

482
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:29,232
Straight, christian, and white.

483
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:31,331
We're not racist.

484
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:33,646
There are christians of all colors.

485
00:22:33,646 --> 00:22:36,314
Where are the embryos, Victoria?

486
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:39,932
James already sent them back.

487
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:43,031
Wrong, there's no sign of 'em.
And their little clocks are ticking.

488
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:45,889
We know your husband
dragged you into this, Victoria.

489
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,476
You shouldn't have to do 
as much time. / Time?

490
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:50,609
You're both going to jail. 
You know that, right?

491
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:53,767
A lot of great men have gone to jail
to bring about social change.

492
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,827
Martin Luther King, Gandhi,
Nelson Mandela...

493
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,526
Don't you dare compare yourself...

494
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:59,584
Now, James, listen to me.
You gotta help us out here.

495
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,912
- Just tell us where they are.
- They're fine.

496
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:03,494
No, but if they're not.

497
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:05,177
Okay, if they're not,

498
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:08,068
according to your belief,
you'd be murdering them.

499
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,366
They've already been returned.

500
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:14,616
No, they haven't.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

501
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,373
Who was supposed to 
bring them back?

502
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:17,916
They over-nighted them yesterday

503
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,019
They guaranteed they'd arrive 
first thing this morning.

504
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:22,647
The moron checked the overnight box,
but not the early morning delivery.

505
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,325
Luckily, they scan it every step 
of the way.

506
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:26,770
- Well, where are they?
- We tracked it to the hub in pittsburgh.

507
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,100
For a cross-town delivery?

508
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,567
All their packages are 
routed through there.

509
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:32,790
- So they're in pittsburgh?
- No, it landed at jfk at 5:33.

510
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,326
Put on a truck to the distribution center
on 96th street. / Tell 'em to hold it for us.

511
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:38,508
No, no, no, they just sent it out 
on another truck.

512
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:39,730
Where are they now, munch?

513
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,526
We're trying to get in touch with the driver.

514
00:23:41,526 --> 00:23:43,123
Where was his last delivery?

515
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:45,746
That's what I'm waiting for... 
What? Thanks.

516
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:48,678
He just scanned a drop-off on 57th street.

517
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:56,941
No sign of the truck here.

518
00:23:56,941 --> 00:24:00,172
If he sticks to his route, 
he's turned onto 54th.

519
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:04,463
Got him!

520
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,675
Cab's empty

521
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:12,211
You in there?!

522
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,927
Must be making a delivery.

523
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:17,745
He just scanned a package 
on the 24th floor.

524
00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:21,716
He should've made a prompter delivery.

525
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:25,424
Come on, it's gotta be a big container.

526
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,060
Right size, wrong address.

527
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,521
Here's a section going to park avenue.

528
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:33,143
No. Hudson Cryobank. 
Here it is.

529
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:38,606
That's it.

530
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:44,705
Hey, what the hell...  / police emergency. 
We couldn't wait on you.

531
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,725
Let's get 'em into the fresh tank!

532
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,656
Just under the wire, right?

533
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:59,206
- How are they?
- There's no vapor.

534
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,314
The liquid nitrogen evaporated.

535
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:02,547
But if it just ran out.

536
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:05,056
if there's even a little left 
on the bottom

537
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:07,136
to keep them frozen...

538
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,563
Hey.

539
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:48,169
I'm sorry.

540
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:03,724
ARRAIGNMENT PART 46
MONDAY, JANUARY 21

541
00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:08,224
Docket ending 2-5-8-0-1.

542
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:11,191
People versus James and Victoria Grall.

543
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:13,331
One count assault in the second degree.

544
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:15,786
One count grand larceny. 
One count burglary.

545
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:17,657
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty, your honor.

546
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:19,186
They should be charged with murder!

547
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:21,975
Court officers, remove this woman.

548
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:30,890
She's right.
We should be charged with murder.

549
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,789
Would the people like to amend 
the charge? / No, your honor.

550
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,869
The defendants are only grandstanding
to further their political agenda.

551
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:39,450
If you were fit for your job,
you'd seek justice for these lost souls.

552
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,201
- It was an accident.
- Mr. Hunter, control your clients.

553
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,945
As your honor well knows, 
according to new york law,

554
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:48,532
life does not begin 
until a baby draws breath.

555
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:50,771
It begins at the moment of conception.

556
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:52,469
Even in the cases of 
abandoned newborns,

557
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:56,696
a murder charge cannot be brought
if it's determined the infant was stillborn.

558
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:57,982
The charges stand.

559
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:01,458
Actually, your honor, the grand larceny
should be dropped to petty larceny.

560
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:05,444
Human bodies cannot legally be sold,
and therefore have no monetary value.

561
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:07,497
The couples who went to 
Hudson Cryobank

562
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:10,714
each spent tens of thousands of dollars
to get those embryos.

563
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:15,296
That was for services provided.
It wasn't a sticker price of an embryo.

564
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:17,447
That's an issue for your trial judge.

565
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:21,034
I'll add on the lesser charge
and hear the people as to bail.

566
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:23,509
- $100,000 each.
- Excessive.

567
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,865
Defendants are not a flight risk.
They have ties to the community.

568
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:30,927
Bail is set at 10,000 each.
Cash or bond.

569
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,769
Next case.

570
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:35,668
Thanks for the call.
Eva was gone by the time we got here.

571
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:38,906
She played right into their hands,
screaming for murder charges.

572
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:41,106
I'm sure the Gralls will be using 
that for the free publicity.

573
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:43,892
Yeah, we passed a gaggle of reporters 
on the way in.

574
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:48,369
The wife doesn't seem to be enjoying
the notoriety as much as James.

575
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:51,090
Detectives, i wonder 
if I could ask you a favor.

576
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,322
You can ask.

577
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:55,506
I've tried, but they won't give me
the names of the parents of those embryos.

578
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:56,771
It's none of your business.

579
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:59,015
I want to express my condolences.

580
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:02,169
If any of them are having funeral services,
I'd like to attend.

581
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:04,679
For eight microscopic cells. Please.

582
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,724
James, let's go.

583
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:08,727
- Those people don't want to talk to you.
- Oh, I disagree.

584
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:11,780
I'm sure a lot of them will be seeing you 
in civil court.

585
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,420
I hope the values defense 
league has lots of assets.

586
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,728
James.

587
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,697
I want something good 
to come out of this.

588
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:21,455
Against the advice of my attorney,
we're going to talk to the press.

589
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,027
No, I can't.

590
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:26,440
Victoria, people are finally starting 
to pay attention. / No!

591
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,173
No, after what we've done
I can't look those people in the eye.

592
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:35,312
All right, go on home. I'll...
I'll meet you there.

593
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:41,949
- Trouble with the missus?
- You should follow her lead.

594
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:45,182
Do me a favor.
Leave with me out the back way.

595
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:49,872
These parents didn't lose property...

596
00:28:49,872 --> 00:28:51,644
Oh, the idiot didn't listen to his lawyer.

597
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:54,455
Good, everything he tells them now
through the trial can be used against him.

598
00:28:54,455 --> 00:28:56,767
Can't believe the press is lapping it up.

599
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:08,020
See the shooter?

600
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,562
I don't see him.

601
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:19,685
There's been a shooting on 
the courthouse steps. I need a bus.

602
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:23,472
He's dead.

603
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,016
Olivia?

604
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:33,351
Eva, thank you for coming down.

605
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,674
It didn't sound like I had a choice.

606
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:36,504
Listen, I'm gonna have you out of here 
in a few minutes.

607
00:29:36,504 --> 00:29:38,651
- This is just standard procedure.
- Really?

608
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,149
You treat all of your victims like criminals?

609
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:44,546
Eva, you made a scene 
at his arraignment.

610
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:46,847
You... You think that I killed him?

611
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:50,297
You left the courthouse minutes
before the shooting.

612
00:29:50,297 --> 00:29:52,210
Because of your actions, 
somebody had to talk to you,

613
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,073
and I thought that you'd prefer it be me.

614
00:29:55,572 --> 00:29:59,205
Why? Because we've become 
such good friends?

615
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:05,830
Can anybody vouch for your whereabouts
after you left the courthouse?

616
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,014
No.

617
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,307
Then until we know who killed Grall,

618
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:14,434
I'm gonna have to ask you 
not to leave the city.

619
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,967
No problem, Olivia.

620
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:22,244
Sorry. Detective Benson.

621
00:30:28,582 --> 00:30:30,911
He was holding a press conference,
and with all those people,

622
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:33,602
- and nobody tried to tackle the shooter?
- Nobody saw him.

623

00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:36,540
- Including us, and we were right there.
- Was it a sniper?

624
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,920
Warner says it was a small caliber handgun.

625
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,245
Got him clean through the heart
from two inches away.

626
00:30:41,245 --> 00:30:43,161
So he had to be in the crowd of reporters.

627
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:45,497
Doesn't that mean 
we should have the killer on camera?

628
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:46,813
I'm working on it, cap.

629
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:51,011
Vultures already aired
Grall taking a bullet on their newscasts.

630
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:54,890
With a little prodding, they were kind 
enough to give us this footage.

631
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,522
These parents didn't lose property.
They lost lives at their very genesis.

632
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:01,462
What this means to future gen...

633
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:02,728
There's the moment of impact.

634
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,346
So where's the gun? 
All I see are microphones.

635
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:07,972
Which is why no one paid attention
to another hand reaching up to Grall's face.

636
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:09,740
Look at this.

637
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,021
Why cover your mike with a jacket?

638
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:15,074
Has to be our shooter.
Tell me you got his face.

639
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:23,017
- There he is.
- Well, it definitely isn't Eva.

640
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:25,999
Must be somebody 
who lost an embryo, right?

641
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,873
Anyone recognize him?

642
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,194
No one we talked to.

643
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:31,751
We didn't interview them all.
Just the red flags.

644
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,543
I say release his picture to the news.
Somebody'll turn him in.

645
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:35,541
Or tip him off.

646
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,546
Well, right now he thinks 
he got away with it

647
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:40,084
You air it. He knows he's been id'd.
He skips.

648
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:43,510
Run the picture by the clinic.
Gotta be one of their clients.

649
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:46,335
I've never seen him before.

650
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:49,258
Look, Doc, I know you're dedicated 
to your clients.

651
00:31:49,258 --> 00:31:50,664
I am. He's not one of them.

652
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:52,776
This doesn't fall under 
doctor-patient privilege.

653
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:54,998
If you know who he is, 
you have to tell us.

654
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,697
If I knew, why wouldn't I say?

655
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:59,955
Well, the guy did do you a favor.
He killed your embryo-napper.

656
00:31:59,955 --> 00:32:02,172
I don't support people 
who take an actual life.

657
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:04,529
I wanted James Grall sued, not dead.

658
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:07,201
I have no idea who this man is.

659
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:14,519
Hey, come and look at this.

660
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:17,469
You still on that machine?
Since when did you become super tech?

661
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,333
Since you dumped me for lake.

662
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,495
Bessie here is the only one 
who'll have me as a partner.

663
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:23,967
I think you like her better. 
Whatcha got?

664
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:28,502
The shooter on "b" roll.
Victoria Grall left before her husband.

665
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:31,777
The press mobs her.
She refuses to speak to them.

666
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:35,342
There's the shooter.

667
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:37,836
There's no sound, 
but they talk for a while.

668
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:41,768
Widow Grall seems to be pretty friendly
with her husband's killer.

669
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:46,259
GRALL RESIDENCE
309 EAST 55TH STREET
MONDAY, JANUARY 21

670
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:47,711
We're sorry for your loss.

671
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,685
I know you didn't see it, 
but he really was a good man.

672
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:54,273
But you decided not to stand by him 
at the press conference.

673
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,549
What is wrong with you?

674
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:59,141
Why aren't you out there 
looking for his assassin?

675
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:01,011
We were hoping 
you could tell us who he is.

676
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:05,126
I left in a cab.
I wasn't there when it happened.

677
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:07,344
But you talked to the killer first.

678
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:09,363
What?

679
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,075
Who is he, Victoria?

680
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:18,393
He stopped me on the street.

681
00:33:18,393 --> 00:33:21,290
But you wouldn't talk to anybody else.
Why stop for him?

682
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,175
He said, "are you all right, ma'am?"

683
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:27,678
He sounded so sincere. It was...

684
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:32,561
You know, it was the first kind word
I'd heard all day.

685
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:34,590
Say anything else to you?

686
00:33:36,175 --> 00:33:39,700
He said he recognized me.
He knew I was with the VDL.

687
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,408
He had heard about our troubles.
That he would pray for us.

688
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:49,261
I said thank you, and that our love and...

689
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:51,959
faith would get us through.

690
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,361
He didn't sound angry with you?

691
00:33:53,361 --> 00:34:00,513
No, he said, everything would work out
even though we were going to prison.

692
00:34:02,437 --> 00:34:05,419
That I'd be fine as...

693
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,908
long as James and I still had one another.

694
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:13,854
He punished them both.

695
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:15,704
James got death.
Victoria got life without James.

696
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:18,664
He wanted one of them to feel his loss.
Lucky they don't have a kid.

697
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:21,461
Gotta be one the fathers. 
Who else could it be?

698
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,111
You gotta know I didn't say anything 
to the guys about you wanting a baby.

699
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,646
I mean, that was munch being munch.

700
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:34,981
- El. 
- No, I understand.

701
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:38,507
Your biological clock's ticking.

702
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:44,054
I'm gonna shut up.

703
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,882
Elliot, a few months ago 
I looked into adoption.

704
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,802
- That's great.
- They turned me down.

705
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:55,368
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I'm single.

706
00:34:55,368 --> 00:35:00,294
I don't have an extended family 
support system. I work all hours.

707
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:03,650
They didn't see me 
as prime parent material.

708
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,463
They're wrong.

709
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:17,609
Elliot, there's one person at the clinic
that we didn't show the shooter's picture to.

710
00:35:18,262 --> 00:35:19,475
Carol, the ex-receptionist.

711
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:21,368
Everybody who went in there 
had to walk by her.

712
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:23,045
She make bail yet?

713
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:26,575
RIKERS ISLAND
TUESDAY, JANUARY 22

714
00:35:28,964 --> 00:35:32,055
Hi, Carol.
I'm here for my appointment.

715
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:33,830
- Who are you? 
- You ever see this guy?

716
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,270
Maybe he came into Hudson Cryobank
with a friend or a sister?

717
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,186
Hung out in the waiting room?

718
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:41,974
- He looks familiar.
- Well, think hard,

719
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:46,344
because he killed your dearly 
beloved friend, James Grall.

720
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,548
No, it doesn't make any sense.

721
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,571
So you do recognize him.

722
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:58,459
I think he might be Kelly Ryland's husband.

723
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:00,773
She showed me a picture once 
while she was waiting.

724
00:36:00,773 --> 00:36:04,581
Well, if they were gonna get in vitro,
why wouldn't he go in with her?

725
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,688
No, she wasn't getting in vitro.

726
00:36:06,688 --> 00:36:07,515
She was in the military,

727
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:11,824
and she had some of her eggs
stored and frozen before she went to iraq.

728
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,468
Scott Ryland!

729
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:16,582
Police! Open the door!

730
00:36:18,297 --> 00:36:21,563
- I don't hear any movement.
- Mr. Ryland, we have a search warrant.

731
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:44,743
Subject isn't here, but hold your positions 
out front in case he returns.

732
00:36:44,743 --> 00:36:48,051
Hey. Scott and Kelly Ryland.

733
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,075
Liv!

734
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,546
Nine millimeter browning.

735
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,284
That'd fit as our murder weapon.

736
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:09,650
Good thing to know 
he doesn't have it on him.

737
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,048
'cause he knew 
he couldn't get it on the plane.

738
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:13,662
La guardia, 2:45.

739
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:16,468
It's 2:00 now.
He's gotta be at the airport already.

740
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:20,570
He didn't write the airline, 
just the departure time. Check 'em all.

741
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,609
I've got flights to denver, phoenix,
and boivia, 2:45.

742
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,189
But scott ryland's not on 
any of the manifests.

743
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:28,277
I'll check the charter flights.

744
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:33,066
Munch, we're at the airport now.
Where is he leaving from?

745
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:35,614
Guys, it's not a departure.

746
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:37,407
It's an arrival.

747
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:53,712
Forward... Huh!

748
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:59,862
We got into a big fight once 
she joined the reserves.

749
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:04,800
But, uh, she just wanted to serve 
her country. It made her proud.

750
00:38:05,777 --> 00:38:09,013
Kelly was a supply truck driver,
and, uh,

751
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:13,257
a suicide car bomber attacked her convoy.
and...

752
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,224
and, uh...

753
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:23,352
all the hoopla and the media attention
those nuts who stole her eggs got, and, uh...

754
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,551
this is all that shows up for her.

755
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:32,471
That's why she had her eggs frozen.

756
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:38,250
In case something like this happened,
we could still have a child.

757
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:43,382
That way I'd always have a part of her.

758
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,627
Somebody who'd, uh, 
carry her on her memory.

759
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:51,441
Somebody who'd care.
Somebody...

760
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,719
who'd know she died a hero.

761
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,196
Step.

762
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:03,903
Step.

763
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:06,558
Front face!

764
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:19,918
The jury will understand 
what you went through,

765
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:22,103
- but you're still gonna have to do time.
- Doesn't matter.

766
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:24,085
My time already ran out.
