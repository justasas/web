1
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:16,556
Who does she think this is
going to fool? It's ridiculous.

2
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:21,524
Maybe. But it contains all the
necessary elements of a valid codicil.

3
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,090
It's not even his signature.

4
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,602
- I swear, Oliver, I am gonna...
- Jack.

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,061
Come.

6
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,873
How long now?

7
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,208
Not long.

8
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,821
Jack,

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,763
the President's on the phone.

10
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,270
Get the girls ready for bed. I'll be in later.

11
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,306
Am I too late?

12
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,876
No. Eloise, you're always just in time.

13
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,878
Oliver showed me your so-called codicil.

14
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,208
Everything's clear then.

15
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,771
The only thing clear is how low you've sunk.

16
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,684
It's okay, Daddy.

17
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,922
I'm here.

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,262
I've taken care of everything.

19
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,697
We're gonna be together again.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,600
Daddy?

21
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,790
What the hell's going on here?

22
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,423
Where is my father?

23
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,188
Your attorney can explain everything.

24
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,124
My condolences.

25
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,297
The Durning name is synonymous
with singularity of vision

26
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,275
through 3 generations.

27
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,972
From my grandfather to my father to me.

28
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,875
There are some in our family who would
like to split the Durning Foundation

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,716
into so many little fingers.
But it is only as one

30
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,279
that we remain a force for good.

31
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,527
Just a minute.

32
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,588
Yes?

33
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,058
When?

34
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,669
We'll get on it.

35
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,272
I'm telling you all now
that when the time comes,

36
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,642
control of the Durning
Foundation will pass to one man.

37
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,437
To my son, Nicholas.

38
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,316
Oh, I hope I haven't kept you waiting long.

39
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,982
Oh, hi. No, I just got here myself.

40
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,583
I'm just gonna run to the ladies' room.

41
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,991
- Okay?
- Okay.

42
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,029
Hey, what are you doing?

43
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,504
Her friend said a woman followed her in here.

44
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,065
No description, just a brown leather coat.

45
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:29,808
Well, it's a single cut
along the femoral artery.

46
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,350
It's very precise, no hesitation marks.

47
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,440
A pro.

48
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,544
Her friend said that there was a purse.

49
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,555
Well, it's not in here.

50
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,957
She has soap on her hands. She...

51
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,154
She'd already come out of the
stall, she was washing up.

52
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,500
And the brown leather coat,

53
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,503
after her purse, she followed
her in the bathroom.

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,471
Miss Kittridge went into the stall...

55
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,373
She hung her purse on the hook here.

56
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,542
Leather coat would've just been
able to reach over and grab it.

57
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,846
No, I think Miss Kittridge
probably just put it on the floor.

58
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,915
No. She hung it up.

59
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,556
Right. A girl thing.
So the purse is on the hook

60
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,592
within easy reach.

61
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:24,568
But leather coat waited
for her to leave the stall.

62
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,431
This wasn't a robbery gone bad.

63
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,530
It was a murder gone good.

64
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,308
I called everyone on her emergency list.

65
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,003
Her ex-husband's taking the first
flight out tomorrow from Minneapolis.

66
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,605
Who else is on the list?

67
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,811
Her lawyer, Mr. Broome, a couple of friends.

68
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,649
She having any problems with anybody,

69
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,347
maybe legal problems?

70
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,424
No, nothing like that.

71
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,461
Because she has an entry in
here for tomorrow afternoon.

72
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,360
31 Chambers, Part 8.

73
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,490
It's some kind of court hearing.

74
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,495
31 Chambers is Surrogate's Court.

75
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,339
Her father's only been dead for 3 days.

76
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,203
It's too soon to contest the will.

77
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,767
Eames. Tell them not to move anything.

78
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,113
We'll be right there. And call the DA.

79
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,348
You won't believe this.

80
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,918
This restraining order bars an autopsy

81
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,183
and entitles me to take custody

82
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,191
of Miss Kittridge's body immediately.

83
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,726
What did the DA say?

84
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,260
To give the man what he wants.

85
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,318
The remains aren't being destroyed.

86
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,228
If a judge later rescinds the order,

87
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,164
the body will be available for inspection.

88
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,059
Where are they taking the body exactly?

89
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,036
I am not at liberty to say.

90
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,003
Sorry, let me give you a hand.

91
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,142
I hope you guys are getting double time

92
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,442
for hauling this corpse around
in the middle of the night.

93
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,709
Triple time.

94
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,216
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,911
What do you got in there? Dry ice?

96
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,816
Must be taking her on
a hell of a road trip, huh?

97
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,347
Just to JFK. And they got
a private jet waiting.

98
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,958
- Private jet?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:00,328
Man, even dead, these people
go first class, huh?

100
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,388
Yep.

101
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,695
All right. Thanks.

102
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,837
Three private flights left between
3:00 and 5:00 this morning.

103
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,402
One for Mexico City,

104
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,943
one for Seattle and one
for Scottsdale, Arizona.

105
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,914
Now, I'm betting that Miss Kittridge
was on the one to Scottsdale.

106
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,548
For the dry heat?

107
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,813
No, for the freezing cold.

108
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,012
Cryogenics.

109
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:33,662
Scottsdale is the home of the largest
storage facility in the world.

110
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,131
It's why they packed her in dry ice.

111
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,694
It's why her lawyer got a court
order to prevent her autopsy.

112
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,569
So she'll have all her fingers and toes

113
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,542
when George Jetson defrosts her in the future.

114
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,171
Maybe by then we'll be able
to tell her who killed her.

115
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,043
Yeah, or who had her killed.

116
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,276
That hearing in Surrogate's
Court this afternoon,

117
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,512
It's Kittridge v. Kittridge.

118
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,120
I can think of two Kittridges
who won't be there.

119
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,520
Who does that leave?

120
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,259
My father told me of his wish
to be interred at Arlington.

121
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,992
We discussed the kind of
ceremony, who would attend.

122
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,524
Your Honor, the Senator's wish was that
he be placed in suspended animation,

123
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,538
so that he could be reunited with his
daughter at some point in the future.

124
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,131
He never even mentioned cryogenics to me.

125
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,576
Even the Senator's will stated that he
wanted to be interred at Arlington.

126
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,045
Your Honor, that will was superseded

127
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,276
by the codicil Miss Kittridge
presented to the court.

128
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,249
Much as I loved my sister,

129
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,845
it is clear that she was
exploiting my father's frailty.

130
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,384
He wasn't at the signing. My client was.

131
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,187
Since she's not here to authenticate
it, I must rely on the will of record.

132
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,697
Therefore, I order that
Randolph Kittridge's body

133
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,394
is to be disposed of
as stipulated in the will,

134
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,494
and that it be released into custody
to his son, Jack Kittridge,

135
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,096
for that purpose. We're adjourned.

136
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,974
Thank you.

137
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,971
Mr. Kittridge, I'm Detective Eames,

138
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,983
this is Detective Goren. We're
investigating your sister's murder.

139
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,848
Oh, yes. I got your messages.

140
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,942
It's okay.

141
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,147
I appreciate everything that you're doing.

142
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,451
Do you mind telling us
what just went on in here?

143
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,459
Yeah, we just settled a minor dispute

144
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,552
over the disposal of my father's remains.

145
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,120
Your sister is gonna have a rude awakening.

146
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,723
She's expecting your father
to be there waiting for her

147
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,235
when she gets brought back to life.

148
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,872
Eloise and I had different views
about what was appropriate.

149
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,207
You mean, like, dipping your old
man in a vat of liquid nitrogen.

150
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,705
That probably wouldn't be appropriate,

151
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,677
especially if you're running
a senate campaign.

152
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,379
I guess people might think
that you're from a family of

153
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,956
fruitcakes.

154
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,151
Well, it never came to that.

155
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,627
It could've.

156
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,795
Eloise had the codicil.

157
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,923
If she were here she
could've authenticated it.

158
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,230
Oh, but she's not, is she?

159
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,801
I hope that you find the
people who killed my sister.

160
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,240
Anything I can do, let me know.

161
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,740
Good luck.

162
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,598
Those are the originals.

163
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,294
There are no copies.

164
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,402
You people are clear on my terms?

165
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,035
Crystal.

166
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,675
Let me ask you, the other material,

167
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,507
you never told me why you wanted it.

168
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,240
No, we didn't.

169
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,511
Please accept my condolences
on the death of your sister.

170
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,189
The storage facility said the
sister made arrangements a year ago

171
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,757
to have herself and her dad frozen.

172
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,794
But Jack Kittridge didn't start
litigating to stop her until last month.

173
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,430
If you're worried about bad publicity,

174
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,838
what could be worse than a court fight

175
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,934
with your sister over your old man's corpse?

176
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,175
Well, he might have something else
to worry about besides publicity.

177
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,183
The will said his father wanted to be
interred. I just talked to Arlington.

178
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,219
Jack arranged for his father
to be interred all right,

179
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,585
but not in the cemetery, in the crypt.

180
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:18,850
The crypt?

181
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,619
He's having him cremated.

182
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,887
He had, as of an hour ago.

183
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,723
Nothing like a 2,000 degree
fire to destroy evidence.

184
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,528
Randolph died of lymphoma.

185
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,503
He fought the cancer for 3 years.

186
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:35,971
We thought he'd beat it,

187
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,441
then I found a malignant polyp in his colon.

188
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,001
Was he a candidate for
a bone marrow transplant?

189
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,240
Well, yes. We were looking for a donor.

190
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,680
The kids weren't a match?

191
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,114
Well, Eloise wasn't.

192
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,378
Jack was never tested.

193
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,783
Afraid of needles?

194
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,377
I have no idea.

195
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,251
He did make several appointments, though.

196
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,589
But he was always too busy,
because of the needles.

197
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,526
Thank you, Doctor.

198
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,766
Well, that leaves the other option.

199
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,829
He was always too busy to get tested

200
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,929
because he might not really be a Kittridge.

201
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,702
I hear skeletons in the family closet.

202
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,343
You were assigned to protect the Senator

203
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,747
back around the time his son was born?

204
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,444
Around then, yes.

205
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,946
Well, the Senator, he campaigned
for LBJ's Civil Rights Act,

206
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,652
and there were death threats
against him and his family.

207
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,558
Mr. Manahan, this is from
the Senator's archives.

208
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,996
The Secret Service agent at the door here,

209
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,227
holding it for the Senator's
wife and little Eloise,

210
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,291
is that you?

211
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,134
Looks like it.

212
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,470
So they were your primary assignment

213
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,839
when the Senator would
go away to Washington?

214
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:50,747
Yes, Mrs. K stayed up in Bedford with Eloise.

215
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,841
She have any friends?

216
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,751
Any special friends who visited
her up there in Bedford?

217
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,287
Special friends she didn't want
her husband to know about.

218
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,024
Mrs. K. loved the Senator very much.

219
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,461
Sure. But you see,

220
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,228
she was up there in Bedford all
alone for weeks at a time,

221
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,167
and then her son was conceived.

222
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,803
I'm not getting into gossip.

223
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,605
You were reassigned just before Jack was born.

224
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,542
Yeah, I was bored. I wanted to
be in DC where the action was.

225
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,581
A different kind of action.

226
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,285
Mr. Manahan, this old picture

227
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,260
isn't a very good likeness of you.

228
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,225
Now that I see you in person,

229
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,302
your chin...

230
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,303
Jack.

231
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,838
Jack has your chin.

232
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,577
I've gotta get to the store.

233
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:02,143
Mr. Manahan, we think Jack was
afraid somebody might find out

234
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,415
the Senator wasn't his biological father.

235
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,650
That's why he had him cremated.

236
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,228
No one knew.

237
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,694
Not even the Senator. No one.

238
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,167
Has your car been broken into recently?

239
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:29,712
'Cause this tint here is

240
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,083
less faded than the other glass.

241
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,153
Has this glass been replaced recently?

242
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,954
Yeah, about a month ago. Some neighborhood
punks, they smashed the window.

243
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,685
What did they steal?

244
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,923
Nothing really. The change in the ashtray.

245
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,293
I see you have lip balm there.

246
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,458
Yeah.

247
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,662
They take that, too?

248
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,068
Well, the one I had in there was missing.

249
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,834
But I doubt that they stole it.

250
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,307
I mean, a used stick of lip balm?

251
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:04,414
Well, if it wasn't used, there'd
be no point in stealing it.

252
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,251
Every time you put lip balm on your lips,

253
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,844
you leave dry skin cells on the stick.

254
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,517
That's what they were after,
to get Manahan's DNA to show

255
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,387
that he was Jack's biological father.

256
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,053
Jack got wind his secret's out.

257
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,257
So he had the Senator's remains cremated.

258
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,822
But by then, it's too late.

259
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,527
The proof's already out there.

260
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,161
2 weeks after Manahan's car got broken into,

261
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:31,436
Jack filed suit to keep Eloise
from freezing her father.

262
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:35,142
They used the DNA to blackmail
Jack into filing a suit.

263
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,181
Somebody didn't want that body preserved.

264
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,519
Or, they wanted something from the body.

265
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:50,385
Something a reanimated Senator Kittridge

266
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:55,127
couldn't live without, you
know, 100 years from now.

267
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,365
They brought Mr. Kittridge
here right after he died

268
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,238
and we cooled him down to 5 degrees Celsius.

269
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,300
They wanted him shipped
to a cryogenic facility,

270
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,107
but there was a legal hang-up

271
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,149
and we ended up sending him to a crematorium.

272
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,151
After you prepared him for cremation?

273
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,983
Not me. The family brought
in their own pathologist

274
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,923
out of concern for Mr. Kittridge's
dignity, which I totally get.

275
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,684
Do you remember what the instruments
looked like that the pathologist used?

276
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,058
I saw him set up.

277
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,099
He had scalpels, and retractors,

278
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,402
and a few instruments I'm not familiar with.

279
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,938
Well, you'd remember what they looked like.

280
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,974
I mean, you could sketch them.

281
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,574
We can work over here.

282
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,377
Put it on the plane to Geneva.

283
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,245
The lab will be up and running
by tomorrow morning.

284
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,743
Sorry for the interruption.

285
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,254
No, your son was just telling us

286
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,847
about your vaccine program in Africa.

287
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,620
That was all Nick's idea.

288
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,296
So have you decided what you're doing today?

289
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,023
Yes, I'm gonna take my parents
up to Connecticut for the night,

290
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,159
show them the house.

291
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,328
My grandfather used to
take me fishing up there,

292
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,169
to a little lake just outside of...
Outside... Outside...

293
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,264
Litchfield.

294
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,073
Katie says there's a room that
would be perfect for a nursery.

295
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,914
Fantastic.

296
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,385
Nick and Katie,

297
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,583
your engagement has made an old man happy.

298
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,213
Extremely happy.

299
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,418
Welcome to the family, all of you.

300
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,338
Stryker saw.

301
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,638
A bone mallet.

302
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:55,018
This one is a malleable retractor.

303
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,051
All this to remove a penile implant.

304
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,454
Imagine what it took to put it in.

305
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,857
They weren't removing an implant.

306
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,021
"Using a Stryker saw
to cut through the calva..."

307
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,863
it's the top half of the skull.

308
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,597
"...the skull cap can be pried loose
by twisting a t-shaped chisel

309
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,766
"along the saw cut and tapping
it gently with a bone mallet."

310
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,867
They cut open his skull?

311
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,234
"If the dura membrane is tightly adhered,

312
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,180
"a malleable retractor will
separate it from the brain."

313
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,820
Don't tell me they took his brain.

314
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,692
There's nothing in Kittridge's file
about any neurological disorders.

315
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,595
Nothing that would make
his brain worth studying.

316
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,860
A politician's brain?

317
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,301
Maybe they wanted to see how he talked
out of both sides of his mouth.

318
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,136
Well, is there anything unique
about brain cell DNA?

319
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,301
Nah. it's all the same DNA from head to toe.

320
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,311
They could have used hair or blood.

321
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,705
But they didn't.

322
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,249
Something has to be
remarkable about that brain,

323
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,684
enough to interest someone with the will

324
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,690
and the resources to blackmail Jack
Kittridge and kill his sister.

325
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,089
It's gotta be for research.

326
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,321
Well, they'd need a university-grade
lab, at the very least.

327
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,456
The Senator's doctor removed
a polyp from his colon.

328
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,898
- They did a biopsy. Do you...
- Yeah.

329
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,800
6 months ago. At the York Institute.

330
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,266
Senator Kittridge's polyp was used

331
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,036
in a study on the genetics
of neurological disorders.

332
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,374
Well, his medical file doesn't mention
he had a neurological disorder.

333
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,469
Well, he didn't.

334
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,776
The study collected tissue
from all their patients,

335
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,876
to look for chromosomal anomalies known
to cause a whole host of disorders.

336
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,887
Any anomalies on Senator Kittridge?

337
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,650
Oh, I'm afraid that's confidential.

338
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,192
Well, we'll just read the published paper.

339
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,089
There was no paper.

340
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,587
The study was terminated. The funding ran out.

341
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,963
We'll guess the funding "ran out"

342
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,933
when somebody pulled the plug.

343
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,870
Maybe because of some
negligence by the hospital?

344
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,701
There was nothing we could've
done to protect ourselves.

345
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,242
Against what?

346
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,041
Three months ago, someone hacked into our
computer and retrieved personal data

347
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,275
on the tissue donors.

348
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,245
Matching names and tissue samples?

349
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,341
Yes.

350
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,354
After the security breach, the
Durning Foundation pulled out.

351
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,017
They funded the study?

352
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,220
Yes. They threatened to sue.

353
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,152
They even sent their own people here

354
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,164
to destroy the data we'd collected.

355
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:25,468
Spencer Durning himself
called me. I was shocked.

356
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,174
We fund over 800 projects a year.

357
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,733
There are equally deserving programs

358
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,608
that are more competently run.

359
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,279
Senator Kittridge would be disappointed

360
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,182
his polyp didn't get to save mankind
from some terrible disease.

361
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,278
It was part of the study, did you know that?

362
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,516
No, I didn't. How would I?

363
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,753
Well, you wouldn't. It's a…

364
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,760
well, you know, funny coincidence.

365
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,923
Your foundation prepared a report on
cryogenics for the Senator's son.

366
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,660
It was Exhibit "L"

367
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,234
in his suit against his sister.

368
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,965
The Foundation had studies on the subject.

369
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,940
Jack Kittridge's lawyer
approached us for help.

370
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,705
Randolph Kittridge was a great American.

371
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,846
He deserves better than to spend
eternity hanging by his ankles

372
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,211
in a tub of nitrogen.

373
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,616
Come on. It was an act
of love by his daughter.

374
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:22,592
I mean, what if your son...

375
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,886
Your son...

376
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,454
Yes, Nicholas.

377
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,225
What if your son Nicholas,

378
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:36,070
preserved your body for the day
where they came up with a cure for,

379
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,673
well, whatever killed you.

380
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,409
Cryogenics is pie-in-the-sky
science. My son knows better.

381
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,778
I mean, you'd be worth bringing back.

382
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,680
I don't plan on dying.

383
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,354
Maybe it would've been

384
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,229
a greater act of love to donate
the Senator's body to science.

385
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,662
Especially if there was
something unique about him.

386
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,929
Something that came out during the
research at the York Institute.

387
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,034
Is that why you helped Jack Kittridge?

388
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,302
Mr. Durning already answered that question.

389
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,403
He said that the Senator was a great American.

390
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,281
I mean, you can't really believe that,

391
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,648
I mean, for a minute, can you?

392
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,689
I mean, don't get me
started on politics. It's...

393
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:30,559
I mean, you know, his marriage
was the great American joke.

394
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,357
He cheated on his wife,
his wife cheated on him...

395
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,863
I meant his public life.

396
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,728
His service to the country.

397
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,790
He wimped out on the country.

398
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,828
Ran for presidency in '76, dropped
out before the first primary.

399
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,765
I mean, there were rumors of drugs and...

400
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,308
Oh, no, that was ridiculous.

401
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,971
No. No, I saw it on TV. He started crying

402
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,480
right in the middle of
one of his press conferences.

403
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,848
The guy couldn't get though one
speech without losing his place.

404
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,888
He always forgot facts. I mean,
it's like, the guy didn't, you know,

405
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,616
know where he was.

406
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,190
You know, half the time.

407
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,799
As I remember, he was suffering from
exhaustion and he needed a rest.

408
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,138
We've faced an unrelenting barrage of slurs.

409
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,515
My wife Maureen, and my children

410
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,709
Eloise and Jack, don't deserve this.

411
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,053
It's not worth it,

412
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,893
so I am withdrawing my name as a candidate

413
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,229
for the presidency of the United States.

414
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:48,503
Here's another one from the
Boston Herald in January '76.

415
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,870
"Kittridge wandered off the stage
in the middle of a fundraiser.

416
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,672
"His wife said he had the flu."

417
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,473
Must have been some flu.

418
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,708
Senator, do you support the Supreme
Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade?

419
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,580
If elected, I will uphold the law of the land.

420
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,712
If elected, I will uphold the law of the land.

421
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,951
It's been a long day. Our children
are waiting for us. Thank you.

422
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,687
I remember this puppet show.

423
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,387
Everybody thought he was stoned.

424
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,625
Well, his eyes aren't glassy,
his speech isn't slurred.

425
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,394
But he is completely disoriented.

426
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,959
There's nothing in his record, not even a DUI.

427
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,767
And no hint of a substance
abuse problem in his files

428
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,239
or of a nervous breakdown.

429
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,540
Kittridge had unprovoked mood
swings, he had memory losses,

430
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,807
he neglected his appearance.

431
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,618
His lapses, they took place late in the day

432
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,484
and they got worse over a period of months.

433
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,082
You're describing my old man.
Except he has Alzheimer's.

434
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,727
Well, maybe Kittridge did, too, in '76.

435
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,796
But he was only what? 40, 42?

436
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:50,959
43.

437
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:57,666
There's a rare form of the disease,
it's called early-onset Alzheimer's.

438
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,142
It's genetically-transmitted,

439
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,679
strikes people in their 30s and 40s.

440
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:06,239
Except a year later, Kittridge went back
to the senate, and he was sharp as a tack

441
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,182
until he resigned 8 years ago.

442
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,585
And as far as I know there's
no cure for Alzheimer's.

443
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,388
There isn't.

444
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,256
Somehow, Kittridge recovered.

445
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,762
And that would make him
some kind of medical miracle.

446
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,025
And his brain worth studying.

447
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,666
Well, it would account
for all the bad behavior

448
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,171
if someone desperate enough

449
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,132
thought that it held a key to a cure.

450
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,776
I'm sorry for interrupting,

451
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,369
but he keeps trying to run outside.

452
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:37,675
He says he's late for school.

453
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,477
His afternoon pills are still here.

454
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,074
He forgot to take them.

455
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,483
He forgot?

456
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,450
That's what he does. He forgets.

457
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,183
It's your job to remember.

458
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,120
Come on. Let's go to bed.

459
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,460
But I'm gonna miss the bus.

460
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,795
I'm gonna be late for school.

461
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,631
No, it's not time to go to school, Nicky.

462
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,535
It's time for good little boys to be in bed.

463
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,008
Now we're gonna take our vitamins.

464
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,556
Take a big gulp.

465
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,692
That's my boy.

466
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,380
Everything's gonna be fine, Nicky.

467
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,076
Everything's gonna be fine.

468
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,555
Alzheimer's?

469
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,921
But he held office. He chaired committees.

470
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,424
He recovered.

471
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,866
Against all odds, against
conventional medical wisdom.

472
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,593
Certain people found out.

473
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,502
For their own reasons, they wanted
to study your father's brain,

474
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:14,135
so they blackmailed you
to get access to his remains.

475
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,180
Well, that's absurd. Blackmail about what?

476
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,074
We know about your mother's indiscretion.

477
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,015
Who got to you, Jack?

478
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,718
Spencer Durning?

479
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:32,190
He's ruthless enough to kill
to get what he wants.

480
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,165
Your sister.

481
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,895
They didn't tell you?

482
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:43,531
You wanna see what a neat
surgical job they did on her?

483
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,174
Don't even consider stonewalling

484
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,874
to save your campaign.
We have enough to indict.

485
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,972
This is just a courtesy.

486
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,446
It's a complete fabrication.

487
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,019
There isn't a grain of truth
to these allegations.

488
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,762
Consider your bluff called.

489
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,240
Maybe it's you who's wrong about Mr. Durning.

490
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,207
Why would a man like him

491
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,304
use such desperate measures to steal an organ?

492
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,647
Because he is desperate

493
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,016
to save his only child, his son Nicholas.

494
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,016
He is the right age for
the onset of the disease.

495
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,152
Then why all the secrecy?

496
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:39,092
They don't want anyone to find out.

497
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,522
For the last 4 years,

498
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,398
he's been fighting with relatives

499
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,798
to keep them from carving up
the family foundation.

500
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,238
Now, he's been able to fend them off

501
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,277
by naming his son as the sole successor.

502
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,403
Which wouldn't do him any good
if everybody found out

503
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,812
his heir apparent had Alzheimer's.

504
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,642
He can't hide it for long.

505
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,619
Maybe he won't have to.

506
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,025
Nicholas had a shipmate.

507
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,690
Nick didn't tell me he
gave his dad that photo.

508
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,995
It was taken last summer off Block Island.

509
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,332
On your brother's boat.
That's how we found you.

510
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:23,339
Don't worry, your brother didn't tell
us that you and Nick were engaged.

511
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,672
We found that out on our own. Why else would

512
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,475
his dad keep your picture on his desk?

513
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,109
Maybe I should call Mr. Durning.

514
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,619
Must be intimidating marrying into
a rich family with all their,

515
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,655
well, rules and secrecy.

516
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,254
Is Nick in trouble?

517
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,022
Would you be surprised if he was?

518
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,127
Nick's a very honest person.

519
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,462
Well, you wouldn't marry him if he weren't

520
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,764
or have kids with him.

521
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,770
You do plan on having kids with him, right?

522
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,470
We both want children.

523
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,170
Well, that's great.

524
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,611
And you live in different cities.

525
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,845
How's that working out for you?

526
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,083
Nick flies me to New York every
week or so to spend the day.

527
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,359
Meaning, in the... In the daytime.

528
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,490
What do you do in the evenings?

529
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,929
Nick gets very tired in the evening.

530
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,161
He has a medical condition.

531
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,904
Cerebral aneurysm. It's not life-threatening.

532
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,267
Is that what he told you, he had an aneurysm?

533
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,601
Yes.

534
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,079
He'll probably have surgery after the wedding.

535
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,384
The ME said if he had an
aneurysm, he'd have headaches,

536
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,681
dizziness, not just fatigue.

537
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,755
That's why he doesn't see her in the evenings,

538
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:49,122
'cause in the early stages of Alzheimer's,

539
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,286
that's when the symptoms
appear. He lied to her.

540
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,457
Or he did tell her he has Alzheimer's
and she's keeping the secret.

541
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,797
The disease is inherited.
Nick could pass it to their kids.

542
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:03,066
I can't imagine any woman having
children under those circumstances.

543
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:07,772
So Spencer Durning and his son
are deceiving this poor woman

544
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,245
just to produce an heir?

545
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,645
No. A spare.

546
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,812
If they can't find a cure for Nicholas,

547
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,250
Durning will use this grandchild

548
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,481
to retain the control over the Foundation.

549
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,192
That would be detestable.
And so far, unprovable.

550
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,894
Will a show-and-tell help?

551
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,461
It's our turn to call a bluff.

552
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,030
If I haven't committed any
crime, why am I under arrest?

553
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,233
You'll have to ask the DA. He's the
one who got the material witness warrant.

554
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,775
Oh, I'm a witness? To what?

555
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,969
Ask the DA.

556
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,376
He just wants to make sure
you show up to testify.

557
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,210
Once you post bail, you can go home.

558
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,476
When do I see a judge?

559
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,176
Sometime tonight.

560
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,851
Wheels of justice.

561
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,048
This is incredible. Can I at
least make a phone call?

562
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,852
Your dad's already been contacted.

563
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,985
We can contact your fiancée,
if you want us to.

564
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,060
Tell her that you're okay.

565
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,065
You know, just give us her number.

566
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,891
You already have the number.

567
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,163
She told me you went to
Providence to talk to her.

568
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,533
You're not worried,

569
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,372
given your condition?

570
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,640
Your aneurysm. Katie told
us that you got tired.

571
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,986
The judge will ask you questions,
you'll have to answer them.

572
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,112
Yeah, so I'll answer them.

573
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,848
Look, I won't be at my best, but so what?

574
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,224
So they know I have an aneurysm.

575
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,665
The doctors that diagnosed you,

576
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,895
they work for the Durning Foundation?

577
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,128
Yes.

578
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,999
Anyway, I take medication. I have
it with me. It's in my briefcase.

579
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,273
There's no problem.

580
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,242
If he has Alzheimer's,
the symptoms will show up

581
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,908
by the time he appears at the hearing.

582
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,384
If he's worried about people
finding out, he doesn't look it.

583
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,977
Maybe because he has an aneurysm.

584
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,420
Where's my son?

585
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,718
I wanna see him now.

586
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,122
Let me handle it, Spencer.

587
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,716
Then handle it. Get him out.

588
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,693
I wanna see this material witness order.

589
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,128
If you wanna challenge
it, you can file a writ.

590
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,757
I want my son home within the hour.

591
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,426
That's not gonna happen, Mr. Durning.

592
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,768
But for sure by this
evening, at the earliest.

593
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,400
What the hell are you waiting
for? File the damn writ.

594
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,568
I am not leaving without my son.

595
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:23,238
Why don't we wait in my office, Mr. Durning.

596
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,845
Now, that's a man who's worried and looks it.

597
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,287
Hmm.

598
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,962
Let's get Nick into interrogation.

599
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,999
Where is he? Why do you have him in there?

600
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,935
Where we had him was noisy and busy.

601
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,235
This is more quiet, less stressful.

602
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,902
Wouldn't want him to get stressed
out on account of his aneurysm.

603
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,374
He told us all about it.

604
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,315
You know you can't talk to
him without his lawyer.

605
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,149
On the contrary, he's a
witness, not a suspect.

606
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,120
Nick is looking a little peaked.

607
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,954
I got him something to eat.

608
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,752
That'll perk him up.

609
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,660
Oh! And the meds.

610
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,696
One or the other ought to do the trick.

611
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:54,000
I have to talk to my son.
I insist on talking to him.

612
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:57,370
Can't allow that. But you can listen in.

613
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,539
How are you holding up?

614
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,910
I'm a little tired, but I'll be okay.

615
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:13,279
I brought your pills. I mean,
you can't take them yet.

616
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,087
There's a protocol that we have to follow

617
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,422
just so that we know that they're
exactly what you say that they are.

618
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,035
And I'll just look it up.

619
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:31,370
I mean, you wouldn't believe the
things that people try and pull on us.

620
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,767
"Dexamethasone."

621
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:36,039
Yeah, it's an anti-inflammatory.

622
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:37,136
Right.

623
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,978
"Dexamethasone, anti-inflammatory,

624
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:43,781
"for the treatment of cerebral aneurysm."

625
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,897
Well, what's wrong?

626
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,467
Well, you can see in the book here that...

627
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,635
That it shows...

628
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,841
It has pictures of exactly
what the pill is, but...

629
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,479
And your pill doesn't look
anything like the one

630
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:17,410
in the book. You can see that the one in
the book is blue, and yours is yellow.

631
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,815
Yes, I don't understand.

632
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,057
Well, that's two of us.

633
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,592
Who fills your prescriptions?

634
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,926
I get them through my doctors' office.

635
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,398
The doctors who work for
your father's foundation.

636
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:31,525
Yes.

637
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,400
I'll be right back.

638
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,807
Well, you just keep looking through the book.

639
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,546
How long do you think it's gonna take him

640
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:56,456
to find out that the pills your doctors
are giving him aren't for an aneurysm?

641
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,289
You don't know what you're talking about.

642
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,885
If anything happens to my son

643
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,931
because you denied him his medications...

644
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,058
Yeah, I think he just found one.

645
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,502
I've gotta get in there.
I have to talk to him.

646
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,465
Dad.

647
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,137
Nick, you're gonna be all right.

648
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,180
Tom's working to get you out.

649
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,341
You'll be home soon, you can rest.

650
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,908
Never mind what they say.
You can take your medications.

651
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,478
No, but there's something wrong
with it. There's a mix-up.

652
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,784
We'll sort that out later.

653
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,291
Did you find that pill in there?

654
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:34,023
Yes. It's lorazepam. It's
an anti-anxiety drug.

655
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,393
Are you sure?

656
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,830
Why would they prescribe that?

657
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:39,061
Maybe you should look up those other pills.

658
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,704
No, this is a waste of time.
Now just give me the book.

659
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,570
Dad, Dad, why are you being like this?

660
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,005
I think he has a right to
know what drugs he's taking.

661
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,138
Here, the dexamethasone.

662
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,648
Nick, these people are not your friends.

663
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,648
I can see why you picked
him as your successor.

664
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,116
What?

665
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,455
Well, his spirit. He knows his own mind.

666
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:07,258
If not him, then one of those grand-kids
you're dying to get your hands on.

667
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,690
Did you find something, Nick?

668
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,034
Well, this... Well, this can't be right.

669
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,904
What does it say?

670
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,605
It's a drug called donezepil. It's...

671
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,544
it's for people with Alzheimer's.

672
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,604
I'm sure it has many other uses.

673
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,208
No. It just says Alzheimer's.

674
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,585
This is idiotic. Why don't we wait
until we can consult with the doctors?

675
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,194
Now, it makes sense.

676
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:44,633
They prescribe anti-anxiety pills
to people with Alzheimer's.

677
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,838
Why are they giving me these drugs?

678
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,901
Maybe you should tell him.

679
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,610
I have Alzheimer's?

680
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:07,054
A rare form called early-onset Alzheimer's.

681
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,956
How long have you known?

682
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,560
I'd say six to eight months.

683
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,168
He's been keeping it under wraps,

684
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:28,042
so no one will know that the
future of the Durning Foundation

685
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,307
was in the hands of someone whose
mind is slowly slipping away.

686
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,085
I had a right to know.

687
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,254
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

688
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,126
Because then he wouldn't get the grand-kids

689
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,499
that he's counting on taking your place.

690
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,868
See, Nick, your disease, it's inherited.

691
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,373
And you, you have a conscience.

692
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,966
Now, you wouldn't wanna play Russian
roulette with the future of your kids.

693
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,908
But your father, he would.

694
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,540
He'd sacrifice them,

695
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,176
your fiancée, you

696
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,619
on the altar of his grandiosity.

697
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:18,388
That's a lie. There's hope,
Nick. There are precedents.

698
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,259
I am moving heaven and earth
to find a treatment.

699
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,163
We're a year or two, maybe even months away.

700
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:27,863
He's right. He's right about that
one thing. There is a precedent.

701
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:32,997
Senator Randolph Kittridge, he got
Alzheimer's when he was 42 and he beat it.

702
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,408
He went on to have a brilliant career.

703
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,446
- But it was a fluke.
- No.

704
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:41,382
- It was an aberration with no
scientific value.
- No, no, no.

705
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,578
We can learn from that case.

706
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,314
He's already written you off.

707
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,754
- Go to hell!
- Listen to me, Nick.

708
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:53,628
My team is on the verge of isolating
the mechanism in his brain

709
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:58,056
that produced high levels
of the APoE2 protein.

710
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,692
That's the key.

711
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,904
You found high levels of E2
in Kittridge's brain?

712
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,235
Yes! Yes!

713
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:21,818
I guess all that blackmail and
murder is paying off after all.

714
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,760
Kittridge's daughter had other
plans for her father's brain.

715
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,298
So your Dad had her killed.

716
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,837
Don't you dare look at me like that!

717
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,278
You know where you got that disease!

718
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,283
Those weak genes from your Mother.

719
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,785
I had to fix what she did to you.

720
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,556
And if I did anything wrong, damn it,

721
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,284
I did it for you, for your future!

722
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,553
- His future?
- Your future!

723
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,526
You don't plan on dying, remember?

724
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,531
You wanna be immortal. You got to be immortal.

725
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,959
And not in a tub of nitrogen.

726
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,835
No, your vessel to eternity
is the Durning Foundation.

727
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,299
To carry your legacy burning
bright through the centuries.

728
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,867
No, it's not enough for you to
be humanitarian of the year.

729
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,039
You got to be humanitarian
of the millennium.

730
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,419
Shame on you.

731
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,014
Humanitarian

732
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:32,424
to everything and everyone,

733
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,360
except your son.

734
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,700
Your son's tragedy.

735
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:46,174
Because, Spence, however much
you may like humanity,

736
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,237
it's people that you can't stand.

737
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:54,749
Spencer Durning, you're
under arrest for murder.

738
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,461
Worst thing that can happen to a
man that wants to be remembered?

739
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,067
What's that?

740
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,866
In a year or two, his own
son won't know who he is.
