Yep.

chance of him walkin' outta here tonight.

I'd be shocked if he made bail.

36
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,922

<i>- What about the victim's D.N. A?
- [Woman] There we were dealing with a degraded sample.</i>

<i>And mitochondrial D.N.A., which can't be

- No, Your Honor.

There's one thing
that they all have in common-

92
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,217
is that none of them were raised
by their own mothers.

I just got off the phone
with the civil clerk's office.

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,790
Six years ago, a sexual harassment suit was
filed against an employee of Everton Consulting.

97
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,999
- Tell me it was our guy.
- Gabriel does freelance work in their I.T. Department.

98

You don't look like lawyers.
Well, uh, we're D.A. Investigators.

100
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,654
Mind if we ask you a couple
questions? [Woman] About?

101
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,523
The sexual harassment suit you filed against Gabriel Duvall
- We know there was a settlement.

102
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,720
Is this a criminal case?
Mm-hmm.

103
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,957
So confidentiality clauses
don't apply?

104
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,161
- I dated a lawyer.
- Hmm. What inspired the suit?

105
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,829
<i>Gabriel worked out of a cube
right next to the ladies'room.</i>

106
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,499
Every time I'd come out,
he'd be standing there waiting to talk.

107
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,372
I felt bad for the guy,
so I'd say we'd talk later.

108
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,811
Well, the next time I'd go to the bathroom,
he'd ask me if it was "later" yet.

109
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,110
Sounds persistent, not dangerous.

110
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,675
<i>He'd say things to me no one in
their right mind should say at work.</i>

111
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,017
I went to Human Resources,
but they wouldn't act.

112
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,057

<i>[Gabriel] It was consensual.
[Whitaker] Not according to Nina Zergin.</i>

114
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,362
<i>She's saying that you raped her,
and then you gave her $5,000.</i>

115
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,025
If I raped her,
why would she take the money?

116
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,263
Why were you having sex in an alley?
I wouldn't bring a girl like that home.

117
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,500
Ajury's gonna love that. People
have sex in all kinds of places.

118
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,032
<i>It was convenient.
I think that's enough for one night.</i>

119
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,980
Oh, darling, you've hardly touched
your dinner. I wanted meat loaf.

120
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,542
Would it be all right if I was excused?
I still have to unpack my books.

121
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,322
Gabriel's very particular about
routines. Well, he hates staying here.

122
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,264
But with the press camped out on his doorstep
- Anything you can do to make him comfortable.

123
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,430
We've gotta keep him on his game for his
testimony. Oh, that won't be necessary.

124
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,838
Well, you didn't invite me here
just to chat.

125
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:33,402
We both know this is going
to trial. This Nina girl-

126
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,110
is her testimony
all the prosecution has?

127
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:46,453
<i>Nina called the community center.
By the time I arrived,</i>

128
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,359

to clean it up.

129
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,026

130

131
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,301
Nina, are you hurt?
[Sniffles]

132
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:06,744
- Were you here when they did this?
- She was at work. The night shift.

Hey, come on. Let's get you to a

138
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,832
[Sniffles]
Okay.

139
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,098
They did this
to keep me from talking.

140
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,265
Now I have no reason left not to.

141
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,276
<i>I can't believe you're not going
after them for witness intimidation.</i>

142
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,780
<i>How would we prove it-
trace the spray paint on Nina's walls?</i>

143
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,977
- Anyway, it only strengthened her resolve and showed us what they're thinking.
- Which is?

144
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,384
<i>They're scared.
Did you find our nanny yet?</i>

145
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,287
Eva Wilke.
We know she was German.

146
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,793
She left the Duvalls when Gabriel
was packed off to military school.

147
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,091
<i>But she went back
to Germany years ago.</i>

148
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,395
Well
- [Sighs] Before Nannygate,

149
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,529
<i>weren't most houses with staff hiring
undocumented workers? [Gaffney] I checked that.</i>

150
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,168
According to Immigration, the Duvalls have sponsored
a series of aliens over the years. All legit.

151
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:15,236
<i>There was that nanny, and an
Irish maid named Julia Lonegan.</i>

152
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:20,445
She's currently in the Bronx at
the, uh, Fayerweather Nursing Home.

153
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,113
<i>You seem a lot younger

155
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:31,721
I got tired of being a burden on everyone
I loved, so I checked myself in here.

156
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,857
Let me ask you.
You came over from Ireland.

157
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,301
Came to work for the Duvalls
from 1971 to 1974.

158
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,704
- Yes.
- Not the best time to be in Belfast.

159
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:47,974
My brother was killed in the uprising. My father
knew someone here who worked for the Duvalls,

160
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,312
so I went from being
Catholic schoolgirl to housemaid.

161
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,353
<i>So why did you stop working for them?</i>

162
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,150
Because they asked me to.
You're here about Gabriel.

163
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,750
<i>[Ravell] What makes you say
that? It's just a matter of time.</i>

164
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,386
I'm sure he raped that woman.

165
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:07,660
He was only 14 years old when you stopped
workin' for the Duvalls. How would you know that?

166
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,926
Because he raped me too.

167
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,178
Both women are here?
In two separate rooms.

168
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,180
I hate putting Nina
through this again.

169
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,342
Well, it might help us
find a signature. Signature?

170
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:30,481
Serial rapists often exhibit a repetitive behavioral
pattern. Sometimes they're not even aware they're doing it.

171
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,424
If we can establish Gabriel's, we tie
the two rapes together. And we've got him.

172
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,930
- It's right here.
- The nanny was away, so I was giving him his bath.

173
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,729
He was 14
- a little old for you to be bathing him, isn't he?

174
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,704
Gabriel was forgetful. Uh, he was
a little bit touched, you know?

175
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:51,835
<i>Sometimes he went days without washing, and
the children at school were making fun ofhim.</i>

176
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,312
So I would draw the bath
and wash his hair, and he'd do the rest.

177
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,713
Okay. And this time,
it was different.

178
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:01,082
I know it wasn't right,
but Mrs. Duvall insisted.

179
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:05,715
I tried to hand him the washcloth, but
he wouldn't take it. He seemed confused.

180
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,057
- He was-you know.
- Erect?

181
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:16,928
He asked me to "take care of it,"
and then he said, " Please.' '

182
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,937
He kept repeating that word:
"Please.' '

183
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:24,499
<i>"Please.' '
He said it over and over again.</i>

184
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:29,105
He had his pants down
around his ankles.

185
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,718
[Quietly] Nina, you take
as much time as you need.

186
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,528
He pulled my underpants off,

187
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,499
leaned into me.

188
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,165
Inside I could feel a burning.

189
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,233
I was crying-

190
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:05,916
not just from the pain, but because
of what he was taking from me.

191
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,679
Then he stopped.

192
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:18,287
<i>I'm sorry.
He stopped-</i>

193
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,697
To wipe away my tears.

194
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,669
<i>I didn't even realize
I'd started crying.</i>

195
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,903
I was what they used to call
a"good girl" in those days,

196
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,672
and what he was doing,
it hurt me.

197
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,907
And he wiped away your tears?

198
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:42,852
<i>Yes. A nd then he started to rock
me in his arms and stroke my hair,</i>

199
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,913
like a mother does a child.

200
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,391
<i>He stroked my hair
and whispered, "Shush.' '</i>

201
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:55,332
He was finished,
but he held me like a baby.

202
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,037
<i>Is that when he gave you the money?</i>

203
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:05,372
He put it in my hand
and closed my fingers around it.

204
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,771
Why would he do something like that?

205
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,377
<i>I felt it was my duty
to tell Mrs. Duvall what had happened.</i>

206
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,048
She called me a whore,
threw me out of the house.

207
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:22,389
I had nowhere to go.
I couldn't go home.

208
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,055
I'm ashamed to admit it,

209
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,531
but she gave me a great
deal of money, and I took it.

210
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,204
Did Gabriel see this?

211
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,639
He was standing there in the doorway.

212
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,905
<i>Does the nameJulia Lonegan
mean anything to you?</i>

213
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,778
She worked for us.
I fired her.

214
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,840
Thank you, Rita.
I'll take it from here.

215
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,319
[Clears Throat]
She's saying Gabriel raped her.

216
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:59,292
That's ridiculous. Why should I give
credence to lies? Well, to you it's lies.

217
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,458
Ajury can see it
as convincing testimony.

218
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:06,027
She demanded money. I gave
it to her. She went away.

219
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,835
Apparently
not far enough.

220
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,836
Gabriel may have
had difficulties in the past,

221
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,405
but he worked very hard
to overcome them.

222
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,715
<i>No one will talk. That's
just it. People are talking.</i>

223
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,781
It's time you did
some talking of your own.

224
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,331
The investigation into Nina's rape
alluded to several other attacks,

225
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,799
all ending with the victims
receiving money.

226
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,359
We getJulia's story in,

227
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:43,707
<i>and it opens the door to nailing
Gabriel for the other rapes. [Knocks]</i>

228
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,507
<i>Tracey, you might wanna
take a look at this.</i>

229

<i>[Mrs. Duvall On TV] Talk about the

230

<i>To which you have made
a sizable donation.</i>

231
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,455
But I wouldn't be worth my weight if I
didn't mention the trial. Your son, Gabriel-

232
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,495
Unbelievable. Is facing
some pretty serious charges.

233
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,190
We're an easy target.

234
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:10,201
There's talk of more allegations
from a former employee.

235
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,830
Well, when you open
your home to someone,

236
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,603
you're putting yourself in
a potentially vulnerable position.

237
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,474
[King] So you're saying there's
no truth to her accusations?

238
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,949
People hear the name Duvall
and think "idle rich,"

239
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,714
but what I really am
is a widow and a mother.

240
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:32,052
I trusted someone,
and she's betrayed my trust.

241
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,922
<i>[King] You're saying she wanted money?</i>

242
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:40,432
[Inhales] Well, I'm not at
liberty to discuss the case.

243
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,832
These women, most of them
work the night shift, cleaning offices and-

244
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,394
and stores and-
and fancy homes like this one.

245
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,170
They can't afford to be here, but they
are, because they have to believe...

246
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,735
<i>that Eleanor Duvall isn't the
only one to be heard. [Horn Honks]</i>

247
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,271

254
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,638
[Whitaker] No, no, no. Come on.
Let's get inside. Gabriel, come on.

255
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,812
I'd really like to get you
to a doctor. Gabriel? What?

256
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:38,186
- A little farther over, that rock could've taken out your eye.
- Oh, it's not just a rock.

257
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:43,923
See, intense heat and pressure have transformed the shale into a
- a conglomeration of minerals.

258
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,930
You see how it glints?

259
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,159
Yeah. I'm- I'm gonna call a doctor.

260
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,173

263
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:40,841
I can't say that I'm surprised. What
- that Trillin imposed a gag order, or that it took him so long to do it?

264
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,513
<i>[Woman] Don't tell me to calm down.

- She's right here. What's this about?

266
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,656
Eleanor Duvall's
smear campaign.

267
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:57,293
If you're here to come forward about something Gabriel did to you
- He didn't rape me.

268
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:02,033
He raped my mother.
Julia Lonegan's my mother.

269
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,406
<i>She helps you and gets called a
money-grubbing whore on Larry King.</i>

270
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:11,143
What can we do? Stay away
from her. You've done enough.

271
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,424
<i>- [Knocking]
- Got your messages. What's up?</i>

272
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,255
I had a visit today
from Julia Lonegan's daughter.

273
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,394
Didn't know she had one.
Neither did I.

274
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:32,028
Checked her birth records.
She's gonna be 31 in May.

275
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,437
Julia didn't get married until a
year after the birth, which means...

276
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,409
there's a good chance that Meg is the product
of her mother's rape and doesn't know it.

277
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:44,973
- How can you be sure?
- Well, Julia said she was a virgin when Gabriel raped her.

278
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,541
If Meg is his daughter, I want to prove it.

279
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,282
- You're not gonna tell her.
- Oh, come on, Casey.

280
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,416
I got handed a dog here:

281
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:59,192
A murder charge that evaporated, a rape
victim with nothing more than her word,

282
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:04,224
no D.N.A., no witnesses- and to back it
all up- an alleged rape from 30 years ago?

283
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,465
You try what you have.

284
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,306
Well, without Meg's D.N.A.,
I have no chance in hell.

285
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,641
My mother already told you everything.
What more do you want?

286
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,950
We need a D.N.A. Sample. I
won't let her give you one.

287
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,422
Not from your mother,
from you.

288
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,730
Oh, my God.

289
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,895
Your mother told you
about Gabriel Duvall.

290
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:43,267
<i>When?
This morning.</i>

291
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:48,177
A cop called her asking for my work
address. She hung up on them and called me.

292
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,982
It was you who called.

293
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,719
Your mother is the only one that
had the right to tell you. I just...

294
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,759
made sure that
it happened that way.

295
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,090
I already have a father.

296
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:13,104
The man who raised you and the man who
loved you will always be your father,

297
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,833
and nothing
is ever gonna change that.

298
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:23,377
This isn't happening.
That monster raped my mother.

299
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,481
Your mother found the courage
to tell us what happened.

300
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,028
Your mother found her voice.

301
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,623
Don't be the one to silence it.

302
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,864
[Quietly]
Thank you.

303
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:32,016
The D.N.A. Is a match. In 1974,Julia
Lonegan was raped by Gabriel Duvall.

304
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,780
<i>- Allegedly.
- She'll testify to that fact.</i>

305
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,050
<i>We're talking about something
that may have happened 30 years ago.</i>

306

<i>There's no bright-line rule that determines
when Molineaux evidence is too remote.</i>

307
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:45,757
The complainant is a woman who is currently under a
doctor's care. She's taking a series of medications-

308
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:50,393
H.C.T.Z., benzos
- all of which have been proven to cause confusion in the elderly.

309
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,562
Take it up on cross.

310
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,095
- And I'd hardly call 55 " elderly.' '
- Well-

311
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:00,941
<i>I'll issue my ruling on the admissibility

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,493
Where's Gabriel?
Oh, just takin' a walk.

316
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,291
We're gonna meet back at
the courthouse after lunch.

317
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,889
Was that girl there?
No.

318
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:26,927
Neither was the mother. I suppose
she's expecting some inheritance.

319
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,940
We'll burn that bridge when
we come to it. So where are we?

320
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,273
If the judge doesn't allow Julia
Lonegan's testimony, it goes away-

321
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,609
jury never hears about it,
and your position stands.

322
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,014
In other words, it never
happened. Nina's word against his.

323
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:45,751
On the other hand, ifJulia's testimony does get in,
along with the fact that her daughter's D.N.A. Is a match,

324
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,019
a jury could believe it.

325
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,493
And if they believe that
Gabriel raped Julia, there's a-

326
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,463
there's a good chance that they'll
believe he did the same to Nina Zergin.

327
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,127
What are we going to do?
Convince them otherwise.

328
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:02,572
Gabriel was 14 at the time,
and Julia was 23.

329
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,007
I mean, who's to say
that she didn't seduce him?

330
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,480
<i>Mr. Whitaker, where, oh,
where can your client be?</i>

331
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,509
- I believe he's on his way.
- Believing and knowing are two very different things.

332
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:19,114
<i>The defendant's violating the terms
of his release. You're correct,</i>

333
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,217
and I'm issuing a bench warrant
for his arrest.

334
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,161
Now let's proceed with our
discussion while we await his arrival.

335
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,393
I've reviewed your
supplementary briefs, and...

336
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,527
I believe that the crime
was simply too remote.

337
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,367
<i>But Your Honor
- The timeline isn't all that concerns me.</i>

338
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:39,172
Even if Mr. Duvall had been tried and convicted
of rape at the time, he was a juvenile.

339
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,372
- Right.
- We're not asking for a juvenile conviction to be admitted,

340
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,915
simply the substance of the bad act.

341
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,178
And either way,
the records would have been sealed.

342
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,949
Julia Lonegan's testimony is out.

343
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:56,155
I don't know which is worse
- losing Julia's testimony or having to tell her that we did.

344
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,389
You can't second-guess it.
Why not?

345
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:02,627
Only took us a couple of days to screw up what
had took her 30 years to try to make right.

346
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:07,468
She didn't have to come forward. We would
have pushed her, and you know it. [Sighs]

347
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,337
Give me a good old-fashioned
homicide any day-

348
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,842
Then you don't have to
look your victim in the face.

349
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,936
Did you check
your pager?

350
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,346
Gabriel Duvall was just arrested.
He jumped a woman down on Varick.

351
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,544
<i>Son of a bitch did it again.
Well, not quite.</i>

352
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,555
They caught him before he got
the chance to follow through.

353
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:28,423
She fits his pattern:
23 years old, domestic.

354
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,256
Where is he now?

355
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,058
<i>[Ravell]
Lawyer still hasn't showed?</i>

356
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,430
L-I don't need Mr. Whitaker here
to explain this misunderstanding.

357
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,629
Whoa. You-you slow down. We can't discuss
this case without your lawyer present.

358
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,265
- This is a waste of time. Let me explain.
- Can't! Against the rules.

359
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:47,038
<i>L-I was agitated because of what happened in the
judge's chambers. Like we said, we can't hear you.</i>

360
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,775
Can you imagine the gasket Whitaker would blow
if he thought we were questioning his client?

361
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,477
Forget the lawyer. I'm worried
about his mother. [Ravell Chuckles]

362
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:59,013
<i>Well, I believe I can explain my own actions without
my mother. [Ravell] We've advised you of your rights.</i>

363
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,084
That girl you say I attacked wanted to
help me. That's what those people do.

364
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:09,794
When I was a child and I got excited,
my nanny took care of it.

365
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,305
She didn't want me touching it.
She said it wasn't allowed.

366
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:18,968
It's like she said: If someone doesn't
make it go down, you have to cut it off.

367
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,604
Gabriel, shut up.
You two, out.

368
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,309
Well, since he asked so nicely.

369
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,482
- [Sighs]
- I want you to take me home now.

370
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,764
Can't do that this time.
What do you mean?

371
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,925
<i>They're not taking that woman seriously?
She hit on me. She says you attacked her.</i>

372
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,491
<i>[Hits Table] That's a lie! Calm down.</i>

373
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:48,198
- Gabriel- - Is this a
trick? This must be a trick.

374
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,673
They're paying her to do this
so they can keep me here!

375
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,544
Now your sex life has caught up with you, and you're
gonna have to pay for it unless you listen to me right now.

376
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,846
[Quietly] There's one
way I see us beating this,

377
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:04,184
but I'm gonna need you
to go along with it all the way.

378
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,929
Happy? What can I say?
Christmas came early this year.

379
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,460
You know I'm getting the interrogation tossed
out. [Scoffs] It was more like an opera.

380
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:24,372
They couldn't keep your guy from
singin'. No. They crossed the line.

381
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:28,970
I don't need his words. His actions
speak for themselves. We'll see.

382
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,515
In case you forgot,
this is where we talk plea.

383
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,814
Oh, I wouldn't be serving my client
well if I recommended an admission.

384
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,354
You're nuts.
No.

385
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:42,086
My client is.
I'm filing notice of an insanity defense.

386
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,067
<i>[Dr. Olivet] How about
this one? [Gabriel] Excited?</i>

387
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,503
No, wait. That's wrong.

388
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,176
Funny.
I'm not sure.

389
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:03,874
What do you do when you can't tell what
someone's thinking just by looking at them?

390
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,746
I listen.
To their voice?

391
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,912
No. That can be misleading.
People sometimes employ sarcasm.

392
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,718
It affects their tone.
I listen to the words.

393
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,055
Do you think people
always say what they mean?

394
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,185
Why would they say it
if they didn't mean it?

395
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,596
<i>I know that one: Surprise.</i>

396
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,967
<i>That's right. How did you know?</i>

397
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,530
At home we have books on nonverbal communication
- body language.

398
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,906
You work hard at reading people.

399
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,707
<i>I try. But the books, they're limited.</i>

400
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,873
For example, your arms are crossed. That's
an aggressive stance. Are you threatened?

401
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,613
<i>No.
Well, you see?</i>

402
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,485
Human behavior isn't discernible,
because it isn't fixed.

403
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,587
You can never really know what a person
means by how they look or what they say.

404
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:56,031
Ten different people
have 10 different smiles.

405
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:01,334
<i>I know you don't want to hear it,
but I agree with the defense's evaluation.</i>

406
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:06,901
You're saying he's autistic. Asperger's Syndrome
does fall within the spectrum of autistic disorders,

407
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,811
but there is a debate as to where it fits.

408
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:14,818
It's a convenient time for a diagnosis. Well,
A.S. Was virtually unknown until a few years ago.

409
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,185
In many cases,
it went undiagnosed or ignored.

410
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,293
So they're gonna use it as some
kind of an excuse? It'll be hard.

411
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,626
There's no known connection
between A.S. And violence.

412
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:31,294
- So this isn't typical behavior for someone with this syndrome?
- Absolutely not.

413
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:36,636
As a matter of fact, most people who suffer from A.S.
Are much more likely to be the victim than the aggressor.

414
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:40,269
So you want me to feel sorry for him?
Liz, he raped and ran.

415
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:46,978
I'm here to make a psychological
assessment, Tracey, not defend his actions.

416
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:53,854
A.S. Certainly isn't the cause, but it could be
a factor in Gabriel's aggressive sexual behavior.

417
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:59,754
Or a last-ditch effort to set
a serial rapist and murderer free.

418
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,765
[Sighs]

419
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:06,497
Your calendar just opened up. I'm
not gonna be calling you to the stand.

420
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,408
<i>[Kibre]
Can you point to the man who raped you?</i>

421
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,506
<i>May the record reflect
that the witness has identified...</i>

422
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,981
the defendant, Gabriel Duvall.

423
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,986
The record shall so reflect.
Thank you, Nina.

424
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,724
Miss Zergin, you-

425
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:34,822
you said that you were coming from
the subway when you were attacked.

426
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,764
Is that correct?
Yes.

427
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,396
- Was the train crowded?
- It was 3:00 in the morning.

428
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,531
Did you happen to notice if Mr. Duvall
was riding in the same car as you?

429
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,237
I don't know.
I bring a book along with me to read.

430
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:52,079
- Are you saying that he wasn't there, or that you didn't see him?
- I didn't see him.

431
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,950
- So you didn't talk to Mr. Duvall?
- Objection. Asked and answered.

432
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,851
Mr. Whitaker,
you've made your point.

433
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,359
So when you were leaving the train,

434
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:07,797
did you, uh, happen to
ask anybody for the time?

435
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,470
[Voice Breaking]
Oh. L-

436
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,744
<i>Did you ask Mr. Duvall what time it was?</i>

437
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:30,948
[Sobbing]
Yes.

438
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,786
<i>So he was on the train with you?</i>

439
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,919
I didn't remember.

440
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,063
Did you look at him
when you asked him?

441
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:48,128
<i>I must have.
Did you smile?</i>

442
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,403
- Objection. Relevance?
- I'll allow it.

443
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,140
I don't know.

444
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,581
<i>Don't you usually smile
when you ask someone for a favor?</i>

445
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,119
- Objection!
- Sustained.

446
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:07,384
You looked at no one but my client.
You spoke to no one but my client.

447
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,359
You singled him out, and you asked
him what time it was, yes or no?

448
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,432
[Sobs]

449
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,705
Yes!

450
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,666
No further questions.

451
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,946
When in doubt, blame the victim.
They're gonna need a lot more than that.

452
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,451
It's an addendum to
the witness list. Who?

453
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,511
Dr. Elizabeth Olivet.

454
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,452
<i>When you meet someone for the first
time, you make a series ofjudgments.</i>

455
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:48,898
You take into account their expressions, the tone of
their voice. How is it different for someone with A. S?

456
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,164
They find it more difficult
to read social signals.

457
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,728
So asking someone for the time
could be confused with a come-on.

458
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,833
- Objection. Relevance.
- Sustained.

459
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,073
How does A.S. Affect
sexual development?

460
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:06,742
In the social aspect of sexual development, people
with Asperger's tend to lag behind their peers.

461
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,187
<i>- [Whitaker] Uh, can they ever catch up?
- Most people do if they receive proper care.</i>

462
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,315
In my opinion, Mr. Duvall did not.

463
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,326
Can you elaborate on that?

464
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:21,093
<i>All pubescent boys experiment:
Touch themselves, masturbate.</i>

465
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,328
Gabriel wasn't allowed
to mature through this process.

466
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:28,168
<i>- [Whitaker] What stopped him?
- [Dr. Olivet] In order to keep him from touching himself in public,</i>

467
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,731
<i>his nanny would
manually cause him to ejaculate.</i>

468
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,870
<i>Under what circumstances
did Gabriel allow this to occur?</i>

469
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,780
- Objection. Hearsay.
- Overruled.

470
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,787
<i>He told me that his nanny would
"take care ofhim"in the bathtub,</i>

471
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,085
and then wash the tub
down with bleach.

472
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,853
Are people with A.S.
Especially sensitive to odors?

473
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,622
And tastes and sounds, yes.

474
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:56,463
There's been testimony that Mr. Duvall's first
sexual experiences culminated in the smell of bleach.

475
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,664
On the night in question, Miss Zergin was coming
home from work smelling of cleaning liquids.

476
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:05,937
Doctor, can you state with a reasonable degree of psychiatric
certainty whether Mr. Duvall could have made a connection...

477
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,605
<i>between Miss Zergin and his first
sexual experiences with his nanny?</i>

478
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,113
It's possible.

479
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,742
Thank you.

480
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,691
There's no genetic marker for
A.S., is there? That's correct.

481
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:26,389
No physiological evidence one can point to
that indicates someone has it? That's right.

482
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,423
No blood test you could
run, no brain scan? No.

483
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,664
Could a person fake the symptoms of A. S?

484
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,935
<i>I'd like to think
that I can tell the difference.</i>

485
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:41,536
Well, how do you tell the difference
between a man with a genuine disorder...

486
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,740
- and a rapist looking for the perfect excuse?
- Objection.

487
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:45,942
Sustained.

488
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,419
Nothing further.

489
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,893
<i>[Whitaker]
I want you to take the stand.</i>

490
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,828
We can't always have what
we want, Mr. Whitaker.

491
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:03,663
<i>I understand your concerns, but we have
to think about what's best for Gabriel.</i>

492
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,100
You want me to say
that my son is crazy.

493
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,936
<i>Not crazy. Different.</i>

494
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,532
It's important that a jury hears
a mother's side of the story.

495
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:18,313
Gabriel, dear, why don't you see if
Mrs. Judson can make you something?

496
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,316
No, I think I'll stay.

497
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,478
If I have to, Eleanor,
I'll subpoena you.

498
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,422
You'll do no such thing.
What's more,

499
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,292
I won't have you talking
some absurd defense strategy...

500
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:35,628
in front of my son without my consent.

501
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,363
- You're fired.
- I'm afraid you're not my client.

502
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:44,033
- Gabriel, am I fired?
- No.

503
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:49,679
<i>- He doesn't decide what happens.
- He's my client. He decides everything.</i>

504
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,984
And he's still in the room.

505
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,114
Stop talking around me.

506
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:17,531
I repeat, I have been forced to be here
against my will. I'll ask the question again.

507
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,169
When did you first notice
that your son was different?

508
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:25,011
Well, I don't know what you mean.
All children are different.

509
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:28,711
<i>Isn't it a fact that Gabriel
has always had difficulties socially?</i>

510
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:32,916
Gabriel was and is a perfect son.

511
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,754
I have nothing else to say.

512
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:39,284
<i>So you never saw any signs
of abnormal behavior?</i>

513
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,231
We're all built differently.
That's what makes us unique.

514
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,265
Did you ever take Gabriel
to a specialist? Certainly.

515
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:51,104
One said it was
marginal cerebral palsy,

516
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:54,042
another thought
it might be motor issues.

517
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,636
And now you say it's this.
[Scoffs]

518
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:01,413
I mean, every few years, another German comes
along, and they name a new disorder for him.

519
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,888
[Chuckles] My son is sensitive
and highly strung, nothing more.

520
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:10,326
So you sought help, but when you didn't
hear what you wanted, you did nothing.

521
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:15,229
Well, there was nothing to do.
My son is fine.

522
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,103
Nothing further.

523
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,203
Uh, no, no. You-
You listen to me now.

524
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:28,268
<i>When Gabriel was 10,
a boy pushed him down in the dirt...</i>

525
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:32,510
and stole a book
that belonged to Gabriel.

526
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,575
Gabriel hit the boy
and broke his nose.

527
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:40,283
When he came home, he was covered
with blood. He was so upset.

528
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:45,660
He was all apologies, tears.
He's fragile.

529
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,994
He hates violence.

530
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,159
He couldn't possibly do the
things they say he's done. Hmm.

531
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,226
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Duvall.</i>

532
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,797
That's all.

533
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:07,974
When Gabriel showed up bloodied on your
doorstep, you're saying he felt remorse?

534
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:12,546
Yes. My son is a human being,
not a monster.

535
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,786
He felt regret for his actions?
Oh, deeply.

536
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,226
So he can tell the difference
between right and wrong?

537
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,355
- Objection.
- Overruled.

538
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,889
My son is not a person
who doesn't feel things.

539
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:28,234
We taught him compassion. Did you also
teach him that it was okay to rape?

540
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:33,076
Certainly not.
So when Gabriel raped Nina Zergin,

541
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:37,706
<i>he knew what he was doing
was wrong?</i>

542
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,843
No, you're twisting my words. Uh
- She's turning everything inside out.

543
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,752
If you can, please answer the question.

544
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,690
How can you expect me
to answer a question like that?

545
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:55,055
My son did not rape that woman.
He did not rape anybody.

546
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,900
My Gabriel is a good boy.

547
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,269
Why won't anybody listen to me?
Yes or no, ma'am?

548
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,841
Withdrawn.

549
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:25,494
<i>We all know that speeding
is against the law,</i>

550
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:30,364
but what do you do if you find
yourself driving without a speedometer?

551
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,562
How do you know
when you're breaking the law?

552
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:38,631
Gabriel Duvall is living his life
without a speedometer.

553
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,234
He suffers from a form of autism
that hinders his ability...

554
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,112
to see the difference
between right and wrong.

555
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:51,121
He lacks the ability to appreciate the
nature and consequences of his conduct.

556
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:57,960
Nina Zergin says she was raped.
Gabriel Duvall believes there was consent.

557
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:01,964
How do you punish a man for a crime
he didn't know he was committing?

558
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,025
By finding him not guilty
by reason of insanity.

559
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:19,372
Gabriel Duvall thought
he picked the perfect victim.

560
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,749
Nina Zergin is an immigrant.
She's here illegally.

561
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,916
She works the night shift cleaning
bathrooms in an office building.

562
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,688
An easy target-
She's an invisible woman.

563
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,162
This city is filled with them.

564
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:41,137
The defense attorney says that Mr. Duvall
raped Nina Zergin because he's insane.

565
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,003
<i>Well
- [Scoffs] If that's true,</i>

566
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:49,740
then why did Mr. Duvall travel
nine subway stops to find a victim?

567
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,773
Because he knew
what he was doing was wrong.

568
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:59,312
<i>So he chose a victim
he thought no one would notice.</i>

569
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:06,455
Don't prove him right.
Thank you.

570
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,896
Monday morning
quarterbacking?

571
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:22,344
We know Gabriel did the rape, not to mention
the murder we never got a chance to try him for.

572
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,940
He showed absolutely
no remorse.

573
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,645
You don't have to convince me, Tracey.
I didn't sleep last night either.

574
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,020
I have to remind myself that our
job is to try him, not to fix him.

575
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,754
I just want this one to be over. So
you think the jury bought the diagnosis?

576
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,525
Maybe. Doesn't mean
they buy his innocence.

577
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,035
They're back.

578
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:03,212
<i>- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- [Woman] We have, Your Honor.</i>

579
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,450
<i>[Judge Trillin] On the sole
count of rape, how do you find?</i>

580
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,288
We find the defendant guilty.

581
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,872
<i>[Howling]</i>
