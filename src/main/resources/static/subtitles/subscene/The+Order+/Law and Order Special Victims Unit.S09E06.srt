1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,787
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,787 --> 00:00:06,483
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:07,722
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:11,273
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:14,328
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:16,439
These are their stories.

7
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,895
Come on. Come on.

8
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:53,088
Sorry.

9
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:55,647
Jeez, Damien.
What are you doing here so late?

10
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:57,422
Finishing a grant. You?

11
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,419
End of the quarter financials.

12
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:01,040
I... I need some caffeine.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,582
You wanna come?
It's on me.

14
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:07,668
I'm going to bed... alone.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,983
- Oh.
- Sheila, are you okay?

16
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:12,945
I think so.

17
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:17,720
My bag fell.

18
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,948
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:28,075
Looks like she was dressed
for her dream date.

20
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:31,755
It ended when the perp strangled her
repeatedly with her own pantyhose.

21
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:34,306
By the ligature marks,
I'd say three or four times.

22
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:36,435
He choked her and let her come back?

23
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,422
- Got off on it.
- Yeah, it gets worse.

24
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:41,896
The killer sliced off her breasts.
Took him a couple tries.

25
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:43,152
Hope she wasn't awake.

26
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:45,527
No, no spatter.
She was already dead.

27
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:47,618
- We find her...
- Severed parts?

28
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:50,584
Not yet.
Killer must've walked out with them.

29
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,608
Well, here's how he got in.
The lock's been tampered with.

30
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:57,940
Check out the scratches.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,530
No blood trail.
He didn't cut her out here.

32
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,350
So he kills her, he jimmies the lock,

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,201
he grabs the body to the elevator shaft,
hacks her up.

34
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,303
Place is filthy.
Explains the dirt on her dress.

35
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:07,368
No, it doesn't.

36
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:10,004
The soil on her dress
is clay-like and crystallized.

37
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,223
Nothing like that in this place.

38
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:12,798
So he killed her somewhere else
and dumped her here.

39
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,625
No, she let herself in.

40
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,428
- How do you figure?
- These are hers.

41
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,200
Burglary tools.

42
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:26,701
Murder is a high price to pay
for breaking and entering.

43
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:19,437
Ran our victim's prints, got a hit.

44
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:22,457
Tina Snow, 21, went to Hudson University.

45
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:25,120
College student? What's her record for,
drunk and disorderly?

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,700
Trespassing, breaking and entering.

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,776
Explains the tool kit.

48
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:31,244
Rap sheet says she was pinched
at a storage unit on one charge.

49
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,303
The other an electronics warehouse.

50
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,352
Anything worth stealing
where she was found?

51
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,858
High-end art gallery
in the same building.

52
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:38,238
Maybe she's upping in the ante.

53
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:39,803
Was she busted with a partner?

54
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,553
No, both collars she was solo.

55
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,452
Maybe this time she had a partner.

56
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:44,554
Who turned on her.

57
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:46,368
Mutilating her breasts is personal.

58
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:48,942
Rape kit was negative.
But tox screen bumped.

59
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:51,631
Tina's blood alcohol was
three times the legal limit

60
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,337
and she had GHB in her system.

61
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,762
Date rape drug.

62
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:57,760
So why get her drunk,
slip her a roofie, and not rape her?

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,806
Maybe he couldn't rise
to the occasion.

64
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,358
Liv, Elliot, see if Tina
was hanging with anybody new.

65
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,991
Start with the roommate.

66
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:07,014
Apartment of Tina Snow
412 East 53rd Street
Monday, October 15

67
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,737
Oh, my God.

68
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:13,234
She was into some freaky stuff,
but I never thought she'd wind up dead.

69
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:14,631
What kind of freaky stuff?

70
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,719
She stayed out all night.

71
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:18,709
Never went to class.

72
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,980
Hudson was threatening to kick her out.

73
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:22,923
For bad grades?

74
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,114
Didn't pay her tuition.

75
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:26,796
See her stack of pinks?

76
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:36,555
12 grand or she couldn't graduate.
Her parents wouldn't help her out?

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,574
They live in Arkansas.

78
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:40,895
They didn't like their daughter
moving to sin city.

79
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:42,793
Could explain why she was heisting.

80
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,814
A lot of ash here.
What was she burning?

81
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:46,961
Got me.

82
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,579
Every week she'd get a note card
in the mail then light it up.

83
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:53,248
- Do you know who sent them?
- No.

84
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:55,665
- But it was something dirty.
- She was hooking?

85
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:58,964
No, I mean what she did was dirty.

86
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:03,639
Every time she got a card, she'd go out
and come back all covered in muck.

87
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:07,108
Found these flecks of mica
in the soil sample from the victim's dress.

88
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,633
They're from finely-ground
Manhattan schist.

89
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,315
Well that narrows it down to Manhattan.

90
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:14,593
More significant's what I didn't find.
No pollen, no plant life.

91
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:16,495
- Tunnels.
- How you figure?

92
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:19,017
Dude, plants can't live without sunlight.

93
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:21,595
Okay, well there's got to be
hundreds of miles of tunnels.

94
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:23,865
Any idea of which ones
are full of schist?

95
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,551
They're all full of schist.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,381
- Got something?
- Maybe.

97
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,812
if we can get some
writing off burnt paper.

98
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,327
That'd be a definite maybe.

99
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,597
- Chester, hit the light.
- Got it.

100
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,524
Well, the paper's definitely burned...

101
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,550
But the writing's still there.
We just can't see it with the visible light.

102
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,291
If I hit it with the right
non-visible wavelength...

103
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:55,559
Presto.

104
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,956
"Astoria platform, 10, 15, 19, 30."

105
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:02,917
Today is October 15th.
19:30's military time for 7:30pm.

106
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:06,301
- Which was an hour ago.
- There's no Astoria stop in Manhattan.

107
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:08,179
Actually there is.

108
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,217
Waldorf-Astoria Platform
New York Subway Tunnels
Monday, October 15

109
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:14,866
The Waldorf-Astoria used to have
a private subway for its guests.

110
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,544
The platform is shut down now.

111
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:20,302
Let me guess. Your people built
all the buildings and the subways too.

112
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:22,287
Hey, iron work is iron work.

113
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,035
200 feet above the ground or below.

114
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:26,489
Waldorf is a great place
to pull a high class rip off.

115
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:29,433
Get dressed up, mixed in with
a formal event,

116
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:31,789
and then escape through
the abandoned tunnels.

117
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:36,475
Yeah. Peel off your coat and sit down.
Your husband out?

118
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,647
Like it was this afternoon.

119
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:52,012
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

120
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,324
You must never think anything like that
about me, Walter

121
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:58,229
Okay. / No, it's not okay.
Not if you don't believe me.

122
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,095
What do you want me to do?

123
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:02,526
I want you to be nice to me.

124
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:04,674
Can't be like the first time.

125
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,425
Police!

126
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,291
Run!

127
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:16,061
Come here.

128
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:20,532
Hey, hey, show's over.

129
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,936
Where you going, spider?

130
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,429
I got nothing to say.

131
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:27,547
This'll do all your talking for you.

132
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:32,545
This is Agent Mayhem reporting
for the silk and cyanide corps.

133
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,962
"Agent Mayhem?"

134
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,377
Your rap sheet says your name
is Edgar Rabinowicz.

135
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,502
Also says that you've been busted
for trespassing, burglary,

136
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:47,607
and resisting arrest, Edgar.

137
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:50,839
But Agent Mayhem's got a nicer ring to it.

138
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,232
I like it.
It's much more you.

139
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,273
So you had a week's worth
of fun on that video.

140
00:07:56,273 --> 00:08:00,466
Now tell me, exactly what
is the silk and cyanide corps?

141
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,200
We're secret agents of adventure.

142
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,306
- Like James Bond.
- Exactly.

143
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:08,950
But our playground's the city.

144
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,391
Danger lurks around
every bend of the tunnels

145
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,750
and every rooftop.

146
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,988
Sounds like a death wish to me.

147
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,997
Let's see how far you went with Tina.

148
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:21,156
Slow down, Agent TNT.
I'm leading this mission.

149
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:23,366
Can't you keep up with a girl?

150
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,323
Shut up, bitch!

151
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:31,688
Good job.
You beat him again.

152
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:35,261
You got a temper, Edgar.

153
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,641
She challenged your authority.

154
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,694
She emasculated you
in front of the entire group.

155
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:40,465
Pay her back by making
her one of the boys?

156
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,360
What are you talking about?

157
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,681
You strangling her
and cutting off her breasts.

158
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:47,835
I didn't kill her.

159
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:50,316
Does that dress look familiar to you?

160
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,670
That's the dress she was murdered in.

161
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:54,794
Oh, look.

162
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:56,847
Here it is on your video.

163
00:08:58,354 --> 00:08:59,705
She was alive when we left her.

164
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,357
- Where was that?
- At a bar.

165
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,400
- After our mission.
- What bar?

166
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,048
The Mata Hari.

167
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,507
Tina got hammered.

168
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,027
Ask Cecilia.

169
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:13,184
- Who's that, one of your secret agents?
- She's the bartender.

170
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:16,747
Mata Hari Bar
187 East 47th Street
Monday, October 15

171
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,233
Yeah, they were here.

172
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,281
They're kind of hard to miss.

173
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:22,049
They're a little overdressed
for our crowd, so...

174
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,555
When did they leave?

175
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:25,476
He left around 11:30, midnight.

176
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:26,997
And what about her?

177
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:30,313
Tina. Yeah, she's, uh,
she's always here till last call.

178
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:32,116
She hook up with anyone?

179
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:36,117
Well, you know, she's a hottie.
So guys are always hitting on her.

180
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,764
Why, is... is Tina in trouble?

181
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,688
Cecilia, Tina was murdered last night.

182
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:47,615
Oh... oh my God.

183
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:57,747
There... there was this guy.
He was a total dick.

184
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:00,082
He threw his beer bottle on the ground
when I cut him off.

185
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,374
I... I thought he was gonna hit me.

186
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,904
- Well... did you get him thrown out?
- No.

187
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,060
No, she calmed him down.

188
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:08,083
He... he was really into her though.

189
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,964
- Did she leave with him?
- I tried to stop her,

190
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:13,015
but he told me to piss off, so...

191
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:14,746
Okay, can you describe him?

192
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,974
Look, look, I don't want to get involved.

193
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:18,610
Cecilia.

194
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,229
You were the last person
to see Tina alive.

195
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,747
That guy might've killed her.

196
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:29,413
What do you want from me?

197
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,768
To sit down with a sketch artist.

198
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,348
Okay.

199
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:41,149
Yes, ma'am, you think
it's a channel 10 news anchor.

200
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:43,884
Oh, well I wrote it down
and we'll check into it, thank you.

201
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:45,715
Three hours and 238 tips later.

202
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:47,482
Half of them think it's the local news guy.

203
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,153
At least we know where he was
on the night of the murder.

204
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:51,322
Special victims.
Benson.

205
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:53,676
Cecilia?

206
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,050
Who?

207
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,412
The guy... the guy from last night.
The one with Tina.

208
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:00,308
- You're at the bar?
- I'm closing.

209
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:01,915
No one else is here...

210
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,043
Cecilia.

211
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:05,668
Cecilia.

212
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:11,612
Cecilia.

213
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,704
Cecilia.

214
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:19,428
Liv, come here.

215
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:27,542
That's blood.

216
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:37,852
Well, when will you be done?
Cecilia's been missing for four hours.

217
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,220
She'll probably be dead by then.

218
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,460
CSU found thousands of prints at the bar
but none in blood.

219
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,342
- So we have no leads?
- You guys'll want to see this.

220
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:51,142
I ran your crime scene image
through symbol recognition software

221
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:54,306
and got Venus De Milo.

222
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:58,214
And that's the inspiration for these...

223
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,201
Which I got off the Internet.

224
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,978
All of these were created
by Robert Morten.

225
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:07,124
He's doing eight life terms
in Sing Sing, no parole.

226
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:08,796
Then it's a copycat.

227
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,231
Someone who's into Morten's artwork.

228
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,110
Tina Snow's arm's tied behind her.

229
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,376
She resembles the Venus De Milo.

230
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:19,253
Morten tortured his victims for 12 hours.

231
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:21,553
That means if this guy's serious
about copying Morten's work,

232
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:23,185
Cecilia's got eight hours left.

233
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:25,197
Let's go talk to the artist.

234
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:27,850
Sing Sing Correctional Facility
Ossining, New York
Tuesday, October 16

235
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,340
I'm flattered you like my work.

236
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,641
Perhaps I can help
if I know what you're looking for.

237
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,247
Your partner's name.

238
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:37,101
I worked alone.

239
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:40,445
Let me rephrase it.
Your new partner's name.

240
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,375
Does this motivate you?

241
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:55,590
Sorry about that.
He's a little careless.

242
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,494
He gets like that when women get hurt.

243
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:03,467
Women like Tina Snow,
Cecilia Strayer.

244
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:05,219
Oh, no.

245
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,423
They're sublime.

246
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:14,521
What I could do with those.
But obviously I'm innocent.

247
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:16,501
You mutilated women.

248
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,925
There's beauty in everyone.

249
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:22,889
Sometimes you have to dig deep to find it.

250
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,656
Women with no arms and no breasts
are so attractive?

251
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,476
Aren't they?

252
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:32,486
The Venus De Milo speaks to me.
It's my latest work.

253
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:35,173
Well somebody's been copying your work.

254
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:37,440
Why don't you tell us who that is?

255
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:43,230
Show me the crime scene photos
and I'll give you my critique.

256
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,487
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

257
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,148
Don't touch those.

258
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:51,435
"Breslau, Klein, and Skobin."
They're your attorneys?

259
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:55,216
Read them and you'll be violating
my attorney/client privilege.

260
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:57,214
Fan letters are fair game.

261
00:13:57,506 --> 00:14:00,586
Bet your copycat's been sending
you little love notes?

262
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,980
We got your names from this letter
you wrote Robert Morten.

263
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,330
Yeah, we purchased one of his paintings.

264
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,327
The value is gonna soar now
that it's been found at a crime scene.

265
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,977
We're huge fans of outsider art.

266
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,935
Don't you find it vital, raw?

267
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,300
It's sick.

268
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,118
Morten ever tell you about his killings?

269
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:21,049
Robert didn't kill anyone.

270
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:22,793
The new murder proves it.

271
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:27,406
Ma'am, you've written Morten every week
for the past three years

272
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:29,809
and visited him numerous times.

273
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,716
He's my fiance.

274
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:35,387
As soon as he's released,
we're going to get married.

275
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,390
He's never getting out.

276
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,764
We're working on appeals.

277
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,289
We?

278
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,998
The Free Robert Morten Committee.

279
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:46,202
Who else is on this committee?

280
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:50,695
I'm the president, and our
vice president is Jasper Grice.

281
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:51,719
I didn't do anything.

282
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:55,016
Associating with other convicts.
That's a parole violation, Jasper.

283
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:57,022
I haven't seen Robert since I got out.

284
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:00,459
Joining his fan club...
not that's just a violation of good sense.

285
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,223
He took care of me.

286
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:04,988
Three years as his cellie...
you were his bitch.

287
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:07,441
What do you want?

288
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,458
- Where's Cecilia?
- Who?

289
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:13,204
Okay, we know you killed Tina Snow.

290
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,625
What did you do with Cecilia Strayer?

291
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,081
We know about your special
relationship with Morten.

292
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,032
How do you think we got to you?

293
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:23,071
Robert told us.

294
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:27,379
- He did?
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:31,969
He told us everything.

296
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:35,156
How you killed Tina Snow
to make him look innocent.

297
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,314
Yeah.

298
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,391
Yeah.

299
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:53,421
Yeah, I killed her.

300
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:58,399
I killed her and I left her
in an elevator shaft.

301
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:02,552
Tied her hands behind her back.

302
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:06,777
Choked her with her own pantyhose.

303
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:09,698
Then I cut her.

304
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,559
Where's Cecilia?

305
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:16,125
You got a second?

306
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:22,728
- What the hell?
- It's not your guy.

307
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:25,674
- Well, he just confessed.
- His supervisor alibied him.

308
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:28,614
Grice was working off the books
loading lumber for the last two night.

309
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,282
He knew about the pantyhose.
We didn't release that to the press.

310
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,132
We got a bigger problem.

311
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:35,032
911, what's your emergency?

312
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:37,013
Detective Olivia Benson.

313
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:41,707
Better leave Robert alone
or she'll end up like that college girly.

314
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:43,776
And don't tell me...
it came from a prepaid cell phone.

315
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:45,097
Yeah, no way to trace it.

316
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:48,156
TARU said they could tell by the pitch
it's a guy but that's about all.

317
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:50,206
I don't like it.
He knew Olivia by name.

318
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:52,188
Captain, if we back off now,
Cecilia's dead.

319
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:53,354
What time did the call come in?

320
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:55,223
Right after you picked up Grice.

321
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,373
- He knows something.
- Let's find out what.

322
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,059
You gonna take me to lock-up now?

323
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,147
- You lied to us.
- No, I didn't.

324
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:08,149
Well, your boss told us that you were
loading lumber the night Tina died.

325
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:09,730
You pathetic wannabe.

326
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,661
You're a leech.

327
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,278
You suck up to guys who got the balls
to do what you can't?

328
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:18,397
You do however have the chance
to be a hero.

329
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,376
A hero? / All you have to do is
tell us where Cecilia is.

330
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,310
Goes right in your file.

331
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:33,147
Listen to me. That way you'll forever
be linked to Morten.

332
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:39,925
Where is she?

333
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,515
She's issue number 10.

334
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,178
What does that mean,
"issue number 10?"

335
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,852
Le Morte.

336
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:52,210
The graphic novel inspired by Robert.

337
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,703
These comic books depict the eight murders
that Robert Morten committed.

338
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:59,434
Each cover matches a photo
taken at the crime scene.

339
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:02,737
- That's really twisted.
- Not as twisted as this.

340
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:06,287
The series doesn't end at eight murders.
There are five more.

341
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:08,493
See, in the comic book,
Morten doesn't get caught.

342
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:09,484
He keeps on killing.

343
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:12,028
Check out issue 9.
Look familiar?

344
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:14,817
The cover matches Tina Snow's death.

345
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:17,351
That victim died in an elevator shaft
just like Tina.

346
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:19,834
Our murderer is staging crimes
to match these covers.

347
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,998
Somebody's taken up
where Morten left off.

348
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,550
Show him issue ten.

349
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,865
That's the exact same image
as the bar where Cecilia was kidnapped.

350
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:30,008
Now Morten killed his real-life victims
12 hours after he took them.

351
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,806
If our theory's right, Cecilia's got
two hours left to live.

352
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:35,061
Who's the sicko dreaming these up?

353
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:36,696
"Story and art by Harrison Thomas."

354
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:38,910
Grab him up and push him till he breaks.

355
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,346
Apartment of Harrison Thomas
580 West 44th Street
Tuesday, October 16

356
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:43,193
You can't just come in.

357
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:45,925
- You have no right.
- The warrant says we do.

358
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,420
On what grounds?

359
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,702
Tina Snow's crime scene looks
exactly like a murder in your comic book.

360
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:55,509
What.... thousands of people read
my graphic novels.

361
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,246
This one came out of your sick mind.

362
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:59,139
Where were you two night ago
around 2:00 am?

363
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,287
I was working on the next edition
with my inker.

364
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,415
Hey, get out of my stuff.

365
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:06,105
Oh, Ted Bundy Undies.

366
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:07,718
I don't know what's sicker,

367
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:10,230
you thinking this up or people
actually paying for it.

368
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,299
It's called freedom of expression.

369
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,754
Till somebody gets killed,
then it's called murder.

370
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,717
Murder is a part of our society.
It's human nature.

371
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,346
Unfortunately, that's why
I'm still employed.

372
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:22,212
Liv, come here.

373
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,643
"I take her to the only place
that feels right."

374
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,650
Where is this?

375
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:32,262
That's Robert's childhood home.

376
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:41,118
Upstairs, Morten's bedroom.

377
00:19:57,693 --> 00:19:59,571
She's alive... barely.

378
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:01,372
Manhattan SVU, we need a bus

379
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,810
- at 612 West 48th Street.
- Cecilia, stay with me.

380
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,579
You're gonna be okay.

381
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:08,911
You're gonna be okay.

382
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:14,146
How are you feeling?

383
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,092
I'm... confused.

384
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:20,985
The last think I remember was...
working with the sketch artist.

385
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:25,323
You had GHB in your system,
and that causes amnesia.

386
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:29,881
- Was... was I raped?
- No.

387
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,335
But somebody attacked you with a knife.

388
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:35,736
What? Is my um...

389
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:40,189
You have some cuts on your chest
but everything's intact.

390
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:44,036
You're going to need
some plastic surgery though.

391
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:50,589
If I would've never talked to you,

392
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:54,157
none of this would've happened to me.

393
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:59,821
Oh, my God.

394
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:01,946
My life is so messed up.
This...

395
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:05,274
Cecilia, is there anybody that I can call?
Your mother or your father?

396
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:08,200
There is... no one.

397
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:12,753
Just go away.

398
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,228
What happened with the comic book creep?

399
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:29,512
His alibi checked.

400
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:30,451
Liv.

401
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:33,441
So he keeps selling his sick fantasies
while Tina's on a slab

402
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:35,035
and Cecilia's scarred for life?

403
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:38,304
Harrison Thomas didn't kill Tina
and he didn't attack Cecilia.

404
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:41,345
- Find out who did.
- Liv, I got your pizza.

405
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:44,260
- I didn¡¯t order a pizza.
- It's got your name on it.

406
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,709
Well, I'm not hungry.
Throw it out.

407
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:51,093
Hey, you gotta recycle that box.

408
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,077
Dude, don't you care
about the environment?

409
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:55,438
It's not empty.
There's a pie in here.

410
00:21:55,438 --> 00:21:58,626
I'll eat it.
No such thing as bad pizza.

411
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:01,661
It's double pepperoni.
It's gonna kill you.

412
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:28,409
Call a bus and the bomb squad.

413
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:32,660
I'm good.
I'm just a little banged up.

414
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,499
You could have a concussion.
You're seeing the Doc.

415
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:37,388
We got five headed to mercy including Lake.

416
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:38,992
But most of them just have 
cuts and bruises.

417
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:42,107
We're lucky nobody got killed in there.
You're off the case.

418
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:43,530
Captain, that's exactly
what this guy wants.

419
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,194
That bomb had your name on it.

420
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:46,232
Right, but look around.

421
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,580
You think taking us off the case
is gonna make him stop?

422
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,867
- How's your ear?
- I got two.

423
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:54,354
Bomb squad said it was a pipe bomb
made out of PVC and black powder.

424
00:22:54,354 --> 00:22:55,587
Lightweight but deadly.

425
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:58,664
Yeah, except the dumb ass
didn't seat the blasting caps just right.

426
00:22:58,664 --> 00:23:01,095
Captain of the bomb squad's
gonna do a floor-by-floor.

427
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:03,502
- Gonna take at least an hour.
- That's great.

428
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:05,621
Where are you going?

429
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:08,767
Somebody try to bust my eardrums,
I'm gonna bust they ass.

430
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,495
- You guy's okay?
- We got lucky.

431
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:12,158
You might be luckier than you think.

432
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:16,118
Similar knife blade was used
to cut both Tina Snow and Cecilia Strayer.

433
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:19,204
But Cecilia's wounds appear to taper
as they move away from the midline.

434
00:23:19,204 --> 00:23:21,401
You're saying that the killer pulled away
as he cut Cecilia?

435
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,701
No, by the angle and depth
of these wounds

436
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,855
I'd say they were self-inflicted.

437
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:27,833
Cecilia cut herself?

438
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,453
I'd bet on it.

439
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,637
Captain, you've gotta let us find out.

440
00:23:33,427 --> 00:23:37,155
Get yourselves cleaned up while Novak
gets a search warrant for her apartment.

441
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:39,811
Apartment of Cecilia Strayer
216 East 40th Street
Tuesday, October 16

442
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:41,559
There's trash everywhere.

443
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,109
This place is a dump.

444
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,709
Beautiful girl.

445
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:46,324
This sketch is signed "R.M."

446
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,142
Robert Morten.
They knew each other.

447
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:50,467
Maybe they're pen pals.

448
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:02,567
Got an awful lot of letters here,
all with the same return address...

449
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,049
Robert Morten.

450
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,262
These go back a lot of years.

451
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,368
Son of a bitch.

452
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,807
Employee ID, Breslau, Klein, and Skobin.

453
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:18,873
Cecilia worked at Robert's law firm.

454
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:21,921
Legal visits and correspondence
aren't on inmate logs.

455
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:23,717
That's why we didn't put it together.

456
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:25,885
She played us.

457
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:30,409
Cecilia was the last person
to see Tina the night she died.

458
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:32,058
She gave Tina the GHB.

459
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:36,466
She lures her down to the basement,
gets her to pick the lock, kills her,

460
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:38,944
and then covers it up
by faking her own assault.

461
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,108
Robert told Cecilia to kill for him.

462
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:44,796
You think he told her
to commit suicide?

463
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,228
Maybe it's in the letters.

464
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:53,165
"Dear Cecilia, thank you for your letter.
Your father was a good friend.

465
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:57,021
He spoke of you often.
His little sunny girly."

466
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,684
How did Morten know your dad?

467
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:01,232
When I was 17,

468
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:04,314
I found out my father didn't die
in a car crash

469
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:06,616
like my mother told me he did.

470
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,937
He was in prison for bank robbery.

471
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:13,141
"Your daddy said you had eyes
like summer

472
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:16,874
and hair as soft as lambs' wool.

473
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:20,970
You were the best thing
he ever did in his life.

474
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,453
I'd love to see if you look like him.

475
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:26,703
Please send me a picture."

476
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,593
That was a good one.

477
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,371
You really had her going.

478
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:34,359
She wanted it.

479
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:37,609
She drank it up like punch at the prom.

480
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:44,918
"Dearest Cecilia,
your letters are my salvation.

481
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,232
I don't know if I could survive
another day in here without you."

482
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:51,364
"You're the only one who can help me."

483
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:55,072
He told you to get an internship
at his law firm.

484
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:58,545
So I could visit him
without being monitored.

485
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,511
He needed me to help him
with his appeals.

486
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:03,628
We had complete privacy.

487
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,947
Complete privilege.

488
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:07,981
Sounds cozy.

489
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:10,073
Oh, it was.

490
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,368
She was a virgin.

491
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:14,714
I plucked her.

492
00:26:14,714 --> 00:26:16,621
Robert loves me.

493
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:18,182
But he didn't want to see you anymore.

494
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:20,799
No, he was just having doubts.

495
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:27,487
I know what it's like
growing up without a father.

496
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:32,131
Wishing that you had a man
who loved you...

497
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:36,603
Unconditionally.

498
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:43,982
I used to feel like...

499
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:48,805
like there was part of me
that was missing.

500
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,856
I felt hollow.

501
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,150
And then I met Robert.

502
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,438
And he filled that hole.

503
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:08,988
Yeah.

504
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:13,083
But when he left you that hole
got much, much bigger.

505
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:15,934
"You'll never understand me.

506
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:20,317
You'll never truly know me,
my art, my soul...

507
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:25,116
the depths I can reach are far
beyond your shallow grasp.

508
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:30,608
If we were soul mates,
you'd be like me."

509
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,287
A killer.

510
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:36,363
- I never killed anyone.
- Well, I know you did.

511
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,782
But what I can't figure out is why Tina?

512
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:44,515
What made you pick her?

513
00:27:45,258 --> 00:27:48,020
You know, she looks a lot like you.

514
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:54,026
Who were you really
trying to hurt, Cecilia?

515
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:56,554
You know what I think?

516
00:27:58,963 --> 00:28:04,045
I think that you were trying to hurt yourself
when you killed Tina.

517
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:08,534
You were killing yourself.

518
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,268
I wish I would've died.

519
00:28:27,636 --> 00:28:29,883
Tina was a gift.

520
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:33,177
An artistic offering to me.

521
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,876
You think Cecilia killed for you.

522
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,691
I can prove it.

523
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:40,958
She took trophies, didn't she?

524
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,988
Tina's breasts.

525
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:51,854
I know what she did with them.

526
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,411
I got something.

527
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:09,849
I think we have enough evidence
to charge Cecilia Strayer with murder.

528
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:15,300
Elliot, I brought you this far.

529
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,555
At least give me a peek.

530
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,491
You sick son of a bitch.

531
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:22,260
Take it easy.
Don't give him what he wants... relax.

532
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,250
Relax.

533
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,310
Relax.

534
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,376
Take the garbage out of here.

535
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:29,890
Hey, tiger.
Let's do this again sometime.

536
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:39,650
Warner verified breast tissue
as a match to Tina.

537
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,853
- Where's Olivia?
- Home getting some shut-eye.

538
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,128
You get out of here too.

539
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:46,422
Don't need to tell me twice.
Good night.

540
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:51,148
You should be resting.

541
00:29:51,148 --> 00:29:53,242
Not supposed to sleep with a concussion.

542
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:56,721
Besides, I wanted to check out
the surveillance video.

543
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,253
Anything?

544
00:29:58,253 --> 00:30:02,409
Well, we got the guy on tape,
but the ball cap hides his face.

545
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,429
Hey, do me a favor. Call Liv,
give her an update. I have to go home.

546
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,657
My pregnant wife is looking
for peanut butter and tacos.

547
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:10,546
Dude, say no more.

548
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:12,932
Thanks, dude.

549
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:18,523
Benson.

550
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:22,080
It's Chester. I've gone over
the surveillance video a hundred times.

551
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,120
There's no good face shots.

552
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,146
He knew there were security cameras.

553
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:28,020
He planned for a shift change.

554
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,851
Everyone was focused on going home,
not spotting a bomber.

555
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:35,350
Yeah, nobody remembers
and ordinary pizza guy.

556
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,631
Hey, wait.

557
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:41,466
I got something.

558
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,893
There's a tattoo on the perp's neck.

559
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:46,182
It's hard to tell
but it looks like a circle...

560
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:48,245
- With a line through it?
- Yeah, you know him?

561
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:52,513
Yeah, that comic book geek
Harrison Thomas.

562
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:55,246
- He had a tat like that...
- Inside!

563
00:30:55,246 --> 00:30:57,656
Bitch, I told you to leave Morten alone.

564
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,705
10-13 I've been stabbed!

565
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:02,917
- Hand on, Olivia. We're coming.
- He's got a knife.

566
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:06,568
Get all available units
to Detective Benson's apartment.

567
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:26,683
You'll never beat Morten.
He's smarter than all of you.

568
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,684
Morten's a genius.

569
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,195
You really beat the crap out of him.

570
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:34,762
But how many others are out there
willing to kill for him?

571
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,869
What does he have over them?

572
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:39,140
Morten's a sociopathic serial killer

573
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,619
who exploited a vulnerable girl
for his own thrill.

574
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:45,404
Cecilia never would've murdered Tina
if she hadn't met Morten.

575
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,972
A bad influence isn't a defense.

576
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:51,671
People V. Rosa.
A judge found a convicted pedophile

577
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:54,820
coerced Angel Rosa
into murdering his own mother.

578
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,662
- Rosa got off with time served.
- The svengali defense?

579
00:31:57,662 --> 00:31:59,092
No, mental disease.

580
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:01,936
Like Rosa, my client
had no control of her actions.

581
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:03,821
She felt compelled to do
what Morten wanted.

582
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,381
Angel Rosa was 15 and the pedophile
had been sexually abusing him.

583
00:32:07,381 --> 00:32:12,078
Cecilia was 17 and Morten sexually
abused her while he was incarcerated.

584
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:15,522
Is this true? / Cecilia Strayer got
an internship at Morten's law firm

585
00:32:15,522 --> 00:32:17,808
so she could have booty calls
under the cloak of privilege.

586
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:20,053
- At Morten's behest.
- That's enough.

587
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:22,607
It distresses me
that attorney/client privilege

588
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,965
was flagrantly misused
to conduct sexual liaisons.

589
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,104
However, in light of case law,

590
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:33,584
I am allowing the defense of not guilty
by reason of mental disease or defect.

591
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:36,369
Trial Part 38
Tuesday, October 23

592
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:39,627
Tell us about the time
you tried to end your life.

593
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:42,772
I couldn't stop crying.

594
00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:48,735
And the world had this...
dark ring around it.

595
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:53,064
I felt like it was closing in.

596
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:55,013
And how did you try to stop it?

597
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:57,784
I drank some vodka.

598
00:32:58,422 --> 00:33:04,008
Thought it might make me feel better,
but it just made me more depressed.

599
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,939
And what did you do next?

600
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:13,071
Sometimes cutting releases the pain.

601
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:16,780
But the pain was just too much.

602
00:33:17,077 --> 00:33:19,906
So I took some GHB.

603
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:25,086
I figured I'd either bleed
to death or overdose.

604
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:26,741
Either way I'd be gone.

605
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:29,058
Why did you want to die?

606
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,638
Robert.

607
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:37,139
Did Robert Morten tell you
to kill yourself?

608
00:33:38,205 --> 00:33:40,843
He got into my head.

609
00:33:41,176 --> 00:33:45,593
I kept hearing him say
that I had to kill someone...

610
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:48,996
And then I'd be free.

611
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,905
The pain would be gone
and everything would make sense.

612
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,476
Life, beauty, love.

613
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,332
I know this is hard,

614
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,693
but please...

615
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:06,663
- Show the court where you cut yourself.
- Objection!

616
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:08,947
Goes to state of mind.

617
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,614
I'll allow it.

618
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:19,134
Please.

619
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:49,054
Statuesque with porcelain skin.

620
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:52,466
I should've brought my sketchbook.

621
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:57,234
Did you tell Cecilia Strayer
to kill Tina Snow?

622
00:34:57,234 --> 00:34:59,496
Whatever happened to foreplay?

623
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:04,001
Did you tell Cecilia to kill Tina?

624
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,496
No.

625
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:09,010
Did she ever tell you she was going
to kill someone for you?

626
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,599
No.

627
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:15,660
It's a subpoena for your testimony
as a rebuttal witness for the prosecution.

628
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,467
That's a new one.

629
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,980
- What do I get in return?
- Nothing.

630
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,185
And if I refuse?

631
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:25,819
We'll hold you in contempt of court.

632
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:30,268
I'm already serving
eight life sentences.

633
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:34,419
Contempt of court's
hardly gonna make it worse.

634
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,320
Oh...

635
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,918
You need me.

636
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:45,951
Or you wouldn't be here
at 10:00 on a Tuesday night.

637
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:47,784
What do you want?

638
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:50,490
Possibility of parole.

639
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,559
Transfer to the federal prison system.

640
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,505
They have better food,
better accommodation,

641
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:01,209
all together a better class occupant.
It's a win-win.

642
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:09,532
I bet Cecilia was very convincing.

643
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:13,587
Did the jury cry?

644
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,378
Deal.
On the gate.

645
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:28,783
We're gonna be a great team,
you and I.

646
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,087
Trial Part 38
Wednesday, October 24

647
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:34,064
The prosecution calls Robert Morten.

648
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:36,660
There he is!

649
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,243
- We love you, Robert.
- We're here for you, Robert.

650
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:48,217
Quiet. Any more outbursts
and I will clear this courtroom.

651
00:36:57,135 --> 00:36:58,963
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

652
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:01,366
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

653
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,209
Absolutely.

654
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,055
Mr. Morten, did you ever tell the defendant
to commit murder?

655
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:20,827
Yes.

656
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:24,602
That's not what you told me.

657
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:28,494
You are under oath, Mr. Morten,

658
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:32,245
and subject to the penalty of perjury
if you do not tell the truth.

659
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:35,378
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

660
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:39,389
Let me ask you again.

661
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:43,521
Did you tell Cecilia Strayer to kill?

662
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:48,172
Yes. I've told many
to express themselves.

663
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:54,857
No one had the emotional
fortitude to do it until Cecilia.

664
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:59,755
- Did you tell her to buy the GHB?
- I wouldn't do that.

665
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:01,497
Did you tell her to get the knife?

666
00:38:01,497 --> 00:38:04,594
Each artist's tools are their own.

667
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:08,840
I wouldn't want to influence
her artistic choices.

668
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,815
You think of yourself as an artist.

669
00:38:14,777 --> 00:38:18,041
I think my work speaks for itself.

670
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:22,323
People's ten, Your Honor.

671
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:25,387
This is a photo of the crime scene.

672
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,223
Would you compare this artist's
work with your own?

673
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:29,483
Objection, the witness is not an expert.

674
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:33,347
The murder scene closely resembles
crimes perpetrated by Mr. Morten.

675
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:35,040
Who better to critique them?

676
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,259
I'll give you this latitude, Ms. Novak,
but don't stray far.

677
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:41,533
You may answer the question.

678
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:04,529
At first blush, you might think
this is unique.

679
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:08,187
But it... it lacks understanding...

680
00:39:08,187 --> 00:39:10,130
Depth...

681
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,779
with the human canvas,

682
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:18,338
you have the opportunity
to do true action painting.

683
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:20,523
Where's the energy?

684
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:23,238
Where's the spatter?

685
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:28,618
This is lifeless dreck.
A cheap knock-off of my work.

686
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:36,070
Whoever did this...
is a talentless hack.

687
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,642
But I did this for you!

688
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,170
- Counselor, control your client.
- I love you.

689
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,712
- Order!
- Get your hands off him.

690
00:39:43,712 --> 00:39:46,624
He's mine!
He's mine!

691
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:48,852
- It's been fun, girly.
- Mr. Morten, please!

692
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:52,037
- You're nothing like me.
- I did everything that you wanted.

693
00:39:52,037 --> 00:39:54,668
I love you.
Please tell me that you love me!

694
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:56,954
- Order!
- I was right.

695
00:39:56,954 --> 00:39:59,499
- Order!
- You could never understand me.

696
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:01,399
Get this woman
out of my courtroom right now!

697
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,109
- I love you.
- Let's go. Move it.

698
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,879
- I love you.
- Get her out of here.

699
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:08,198
I love you, Robert! Please!

700
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:12,445
I love you.
I love you, please.

701
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,119
- Well, you were great.
- Did you like it?

702
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,386
Bet you didn't know
what was gonna happen next.

703
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,463
You put on quite a show.

704
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:36,710
You got her off.
She's going to a psych ward.

705
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,772
Is that a frown on your pretty face?

706
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:42,532
Actually I think Cecilia's going
exactly where she belongs.

707
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:44,615
So are you.

708
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:47,212
You're backing out on the deal.

709
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:50,433
No, you're being transferred
to a federal prison.

710
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,500
I thought you'd be a sore loser.

711
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,220
You're gonna love Florence Supermax.

712
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,266
23-hour lockdown.
No visitors, no mail, no phone calls.

713
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:05,506
No human contact for the rest of your life.

714
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:07,462
You can't do that to me.

715
00:41:07,462 --> 00:41:09,260
Why don't you wave bye
to all your fans?

716
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,670
- But you made a deal.
- And it's a masterpiece.

717
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,179
How do you like my work?

718
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:19,023
You used me.
You set me up.

719
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:22,055
It¡¯s not fair!
This isn't right!
