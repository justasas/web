In New York City's war on crime,

2
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,150
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,885
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,927
These are their stories.

5
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,698
What am I supposed to do with this?

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,668
That's all I can spare right now.

7
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,068
You want my kids living on Happy Meals?

8
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,333
Sandi, I shouldn't even be here.

9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,343
Why are you being this way, Danny?

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,343
You know where you wanna be.

(SIREN BLARING)

12
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:47,388
Sammy's raving about this smoked
salmon he found in Nova Scotia.

13
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,721
Lockport.

14
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,457
Okay.

15
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,730
You went there this morning.

16
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,026
Mom, she has kids.

17
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,730
They're not your kids.

18
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,841
Kelly called.

19
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,969
She needs to talk to you.

20
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,419
Yeah, hi, honey. It's Daddy. Put Mommy on.

21
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,419
It's Dad.

22
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,427
You just got in?

23
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,463
DANNY: Yes. You know, the traffic. What's up?

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,830
I won't be able to make it this afternoon.
My sister's coming in for the day.

25
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,164
Oh, no, that's not acceptable.

26
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,034
You have to call them and tell
them that we'll be there.

27
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,037
We'll talk tonight.

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,477
Don't start with me, Mom, okay?

29
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,179
ANNA: Mike's coming in from Binghamton.

30
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,521
All the cousins can be together.

31
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,187
- What date is that?
- The fourth.

32
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,224
I can't. It's the first day of Sukkoth.

33
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,724
Sukkoth, the Festival of the Booths.

34
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,961
And don't try to tell me
that sounds any weirder

35
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,733
than the Feast of the Transfiguration.

36
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,571
Mom hasn't seen your kids since,
what, just before Easter.

37
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,377
I know.

38
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,275
Maybe I'll just drive up one
Sunday with Jordie and Sharon.

39
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,416
Is everything okay with you and Danny?

40
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,512
You keep asking that. Yes.

41
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,824
The business just takes up
a lot of his time.

42
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,755
I have to run.

43
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,558
Housekeeper leaves at 4:00, and I don't want
the kids coming home to an empty house.

44
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,958
Tell Mom I'll call her tonight.

45
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,196
Kelly,

46
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,132
we can still talk.

47
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,427

(KELLY SCREAMING)

49
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,470
The lady who drove the kids home
from school found her about 5:30.

50
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,878
Where was Mr. Sussman?

51
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,041
Oh, he got home from work at 6:15.

52
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,846
We were already here.

53
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,386
He looked pretty shook-up.

54
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,785
We'll see.

55
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,426
See the hand spread across her neck?

56
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,155
It's almost a foot wide.

57
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,794
And this bruise here.

58
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,261
See? Knuckle marks.

59
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,800
Smaller hand.

60
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,403
Yeah. A second assailant.
Came from that side.

61
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,962
She didn't stand a chance.

62
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,735
Oh, but she fought back.

63
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,538
Her nails are torn.

64
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:09,353
Threads from a gauze bandage?

65
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,855
Now, that's

66
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,419
antiseptic cream.

67
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,189
One of them might have been
wearing a bandage.

68
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,929
She came over the top of the hood

69
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,441
to get away from them.

70
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,074
But why did she go back in the car?

71
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,092
The way out.

72
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,261
Instead of overwhelming her

73
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,729
as soon as she got out of the car,

74
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,460
they hesitated.

75
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,626
They gave her an opening.

76
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,428
And then when they regained control,

77
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,835
they used excessive force to kill her.

78
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,205
Amateurs.

79
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,151
(STUTTERING)
I thought that other detective I talked to,

80
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,383
he was running things.

81
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,585
Your borough president called
the police commissioner.

82
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,457
That's how the case came to us.

83
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,928
Your family's prominent in the community.

84
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,330
Well, my father was a very important man.

85
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,958
He helped a lot of people.

86
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,902
Children, come in the kitchen with Grandma.

87
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,232
Yeah, go ahead.

88
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,840
It's a terrible thing they had
to find their mother that way.

89
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,921
Sussman Kosher Foods.

90
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,088
I see your trucks around all the time.

91
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,728
Everything good between
you and your employees?

92
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,992
Yeah, we have no complaints.

93
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,863
You and Mrs. Sussman?

94
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,535
Anything we should know about?

95
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,572
(STUTTERING)
Everything was fine.

96
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,176
The kids are doing well. We had our health.

97
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,707
You have something in your eyes?

98
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,273
No. Why?

99
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,878
Blinking your eyes a lot, that usually
means you have something in your eyes.

100
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,152
Or that your stress level has gone up.

101
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,783
It's called the blink rate.

102
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,351
Well, of course, I'm under a lot of stress.

103
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,863
Of course.

104
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,371
Do you know where your wife
was earlier this afternoon?

105
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,875
Her sister Anna had come down
from Albany for the day.

106
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,740
Kelly was meeting her in the city.

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,871
Would she have been wearing any jewelry?

108
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,116
She always had her wedding ring

109
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,777
and a necklace

110
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,822
that I bought her for our 10th anniversary.

111
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:03,049
It had three diamonds,
for me and each of the kids.

112
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,929
She always told me everything was fine.

113
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,637
She was very private about her marriage.

114
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,832
But something made you ask.

115
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,105
Our mother had a stroke a few months ago.

116
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,271
I was calling Kelly late at night

117
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,905
with progress reports.

118
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,582
A lot of times, Danny wasn't there.

119
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,209
EAMES: Where did she say he was?

120
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,852
At some religious observance.

121
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,083
You know, prayers.

122
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:38,390
What religious observance takes place
late at night outside the home?

123
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,556
I wouldn't know. I'm not Jewish.

124
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,490
Oh, Kelly converted.

125
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,830
Yes.

126
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,999
So her children could be raised
in their father's faith.

127
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,103
Kelly was familiar
with the Jewish traditions?

128
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,073
She had to be.

129
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,783
The Sussmans are a very religious family.

130
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,852
Could you write down the dates and the times

131
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,187
that you called her at home?

132
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,260
There are three daily prayers
in the Jewish tradition

133
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,695
and a man might leave the home
to go pray with the minion,

134
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,130
with nine other men.

135
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,030
Sussman might have had a
legitimate reason to be out.

136
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,093
GOREN: Except that the
last prayer takes place

137
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,195
in the early evening.

138
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,569
Which Mrs. Sussman would have known,

139
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,836
being familiar with the traditions.

140
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,309
She was covering for her husband.

141
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,743
Seems to be part of her MO.

142
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,247
She didn't let on that there were problems.

143
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,839
She was better at it than he was.

144
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,442
Two months ago, Tuesday night, 11:10 p.m.,

145
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,851
he made a withdrawal for a
thousand bucks from an ATM

146
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,220
on the 600 block of Cuthpert Boulevard.

147
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,622
What's the date on that?

148
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,184
There was a call to a business on Cuthpert.

149
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,629
Here. Same day, from his cell phone,

150
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,226
at 5:00 p.m. to Stan's Show Supplies.

151
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,798
One block down from the ATM.

152
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,802
CALOS: Sussman, one of his checks bounced.

153
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,473
We were holding his order until
he came up with one grand cash.

154
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,776
What was in his order?

155
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,408
I don't remember. Show stuff.

156
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,682
You mean, like in Stan's Show stuff?
Maybe we should ask Stan.

157
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,619
There is no Stan. There's Mr. Harland,

158
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,487
and he's gonna be back here in an hour,

159
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,116
and I gotta get these orders out.

160
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,890
We'll write you a note, how you were
helping with a murder investigation.

161
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,333
Now, Sussman's in the food business.

162
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,372
What does he need lighting equipment for?

163
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,034
Sussman told me he did charity events.

164
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:35,011
Rented to Firefly Enterprises for
delivery on 10th Avenue in Manhattan.

165
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,049
Spotlights, glitter ball, smoke machine.

166
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,679
What's this abbreviation for?

167
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,711
A bubble bath setup.
It's a clear Lucite bathtub.

168
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,446
Charity events.

169
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,357
Charity must be the girl
who takes the bubble baths.

170
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,421
(LOUIE GRUNTING)

171
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,370
Hey, how long I gotta wait in the car?

172
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,733
Huh? Don't we gotta do a thing tonight?

173
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,508
Next time will be on the house, baby.

174
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,814
It's gonna take at least an hour

175
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,613
to get all the way up there.

176
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,325
Since when did you grow
a brain, huh? Come on.

177
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,223
PODELL: Sussman's got the lease
till the end of the year.

178
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,960
After that, it's available.

179
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,933
- EAMES: Why'd he close up?
- I don't know.

180
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,367
Business was good.

181
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,405
GOREN: Is there a problem with the lights?

182
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,406
Fuse box blew three weeks ago.

183
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,497
Just like that?

184
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,738
Well, two days later I got a
letter from Sussman's lawyer

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,043
wanting to break the lease on
account of the electrical problem.

186
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,151
- Do you mind if we have a look?
- No, go ahead.

187
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,121
They poured acid behind the connector.

188
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,262
That's blood.

189
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:41,437
Well, he splashed acid on his arm.

190
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,633
He would've had to reach in.

191
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,208
He came over here to wash it off,

192
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,606
and he used this to wipe his wound.

193
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,743
Gauze fibers on Kelly Sussman.

194
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,515
Yeah, from the bandages of the killer.

195
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,425
He used this to cover his burn.

196
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,394
Murderer, arsonist, jack of all trades.

197
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,158
Yeah, master of none.

198
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,836
The Arson Squad confirmed
they found traces of acid.

199
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,907
So this works for you? Sussman
risking jail time for arson

200
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,237
just to skip out on a lease?

201
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,300
- Money's money.
- Small money.

202
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,643
- And what's this guy doing
running a strip joint?
- You have to ask?

203
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,807
He wasn't running it alone.

204
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,976
He filed a change of ownership 2 months ago.

205
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,077
He used to have a partner.

206
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,616
Oh.

207
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,184
And she spells it with an “i”.

208
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,253
That's right. Sandi. Sandi Tortomassi.

209
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,228
But I'm not a partner in the club anymore.

210
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,992
I sold my share two months ago.

211
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,533
Problems with your partners?

212
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,864
No. Why would you think that?

213
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,700
Well, we just heard that the
place was packed every night.

214
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,639
The only reason you would sell is if
you had a beef with your partners.

215
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:54,235
Not to mention there was an attempted
arson there a few weeks ago.

216
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,043
By the way, is that something
burning? You're baking cookies.

217
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,042
- Peanut butter.
- For my kids.

218
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,914
And for the record, I didn't
have any beef with my partners.

219
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,455
I wanted to pursue other interests.

220
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,218
Like baking cookies?

221
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,759
Your other partners, that's Daniel Sussman?

222
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,458
- Yes. His company.
- Firefly Enterprises.

223
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,296
The same people who own this house.

224
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,963
We happened to notice Firefly put
up the money for this place.

225
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,597
That was a loan, against the
return on share of the club.

226
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,369
A loan against your return?

227
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,607
By the way, is there a Mr. Tortomassi?

228
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,582
He's a drunk, passed out
in a trailer park in Ohio.

229
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,211
GOREN: Ohio? Didn't Firefly
buy a condo in Dayton?

230
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,551
- That was for my mother.
- Another loan.

231
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,182
You are shouldering a lot of debt.

232
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,557
My share of the club went
to pay off the other loans.

233
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,562
That was the arrangement when I cashed out.

234
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,155
So, let's see, he put up the money...

235
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,594
What was your contribution again?

236
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,569
I chose the decor, the ambiance.

237
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,069
I supervised the employees.

238
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,939
Waitresses, bouncers,

239
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,339
strippers.

240
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:06,077
And that's where you have
a lot of experience, right?

241
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,243
Oh, it's the outfit.

242
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,379
Not exactly the standard issue

243
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,014
Westchester soccer mom.

244
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,919
(STUTTERING)
You're very toned and

245
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,256
flexible.

246
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,855
Sussman catch your act at a
strip club? Is that how you met?

247
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,798
You know, if you're trying to humiliate me,

248
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,392
I've heard it all before.

249
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,604
I want you to leave now, before
my kids get up from their nap.

250
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,767
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

251
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,902
How did you find out where
Sandi used to work?

252
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,378
She never told strangers
what she did for a living.

253
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,882
Even strippers have to file W-2s.

254
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,384
Your manager said you used
to share a place with her.

255
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,478
Yeah, before she got the house.

256
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:47,047
She had some help with that,
from this man, Daniel Sussman?

257
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,358
Yeah, sure, Danny.

258
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,088
He met Sandi here?

259
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,565
Danny'd come in, throw around a lot of money.

260
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,166
He really liked Sandi.

261
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,404
He told her he wanted to give her the world.

262
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,337
And she probably thought he could afford it.

263
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,807
Sandi liked him because he was a gentleman.

264
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,673
Bought her a house, set her up in a business.

265
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,040
That was all his idea.

266
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,172
Maybe her idea was to be
the next Mrs. Sussman.

267
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,613
Sandi respected his marriage.

268
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,550
That's why she broke up with him.

269
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:19,112
She didn't want him to put his family
through a divorce on account of her.

270
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,389
You keep putting your hand on your datebook.

271
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,621
Hey!

272
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,956
Hey, give me that.

273
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,728
That's what people do when they're,
you know, they're nervous.

274
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,670
They touch things to boost their confidence,

275
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,867
especially when they're
trying to remember something.

276
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,441
"Respectful to his marriage.

277
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,140
"She dumped him."

278
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,577
It's crib notes.

279
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,820
And Sandi called you to tell you
what to say in case we dropped by.

280
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,413
Let's try the truth.

281
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,558
She wanted him to leave his wife.

282
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,856
No. She broke up with him.

283
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:01,296
- After his wife found out what he was doing.
- His wife knew?

284
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,496
She called our place. She thought I was
the one having the affair with Danny.

285
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,936
She called me all kinds of
names, I don't even know.

286
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,598
You remember any of them?

287
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,340
There was one she kept repeating.

288
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,404
Kurva, or something like that.

289
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,278
I couldn't understand her half
the time. She had this accent.

290
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,648
Everybody in America knows Yiddish words.

291
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,121
Why should Kelly be any different?

292
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,081
GOREN: Kurva?

293
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,722
That's a prostitute, isn't it?

294
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,524
Where did Kelly learn a word like that?

295
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,031
She was in the family for so long.

296
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,658
Maybe she had occasion to hear it.

297
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,064
The young woman who got the call

298
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,668
said that Kelly had an accent.

299
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,936
Kelly didn't have an accent, did she?

300
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,618
Okay, I called her.

301
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,590
You found out about the affair.

302
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,693
I told Danny to stop, and he stopped.

303
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,166
Did your daughter-in-law know?

304
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,902
He told her.

305
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,169
GOREN: You made sure he did.

306
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,001
She had a right to know.

307
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,542
You don't start fresh by keeping secrets.

308
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,504
Is that what they were doing?
They were starting fresh?

309
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,345
They have children, a home,
people who know and respect them.

310
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,415
This other thing meant nothing to Danny.

311
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,284
It meant $350 grand for
the house in Westchester,

312
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,914
$200,000 for the strip club.

313
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,549
Kelly knew nothing about that.

314
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,786
GOREN: How could she not?

315
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,954
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
disappearing from their account.

316
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,097
Unless...

317
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,632
Unless Danny was taking it
from the family business.

318
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,669
My son lost his head.

319
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,712
This really is a family business, isn't it?

320
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,184
Relatives have invested their savings.

321
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,811
Some of them even work here.

322
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,379
- If they ever found out what Danny did...
- They wouldn't find out.

323
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,719
The money was paid back.

324
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,316
It's still a crime.

325
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,919
And if Kelly knew what
he'd done for this woman,

326
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,861
she might not be so forgiving.

327
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,399
One word from her, and your
son would've gone to jail.

328
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,426
No, no, no. Danny would never hurt Kelly.

329
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,031
It's that woman. She had her claws into him.

330
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:28,636
She called me here after I spoke
to her friend, and she said

331
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,080
nobody was going to come
between her and Danny.

332
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,250
She said

333
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,691
that she had friends in that world.

334
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,792
People who would hurt anyone
who got in her way.

335
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,034
LOUIE: Uh-huh.

336
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,636
Okay.

337
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,912
You want some of this?

338
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,815
What are you doing?

339
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,951
We gotta get lost for a while.

340
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,657
How about Miami?

341
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,091
Big party town, dance all night.

342
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,188
We could rent a boat and cruise the cooz.

343
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,362
Hey, we driving or...

344
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,604
SANDI: Maybe if you tell me what you're
looking for, I can save you the trouble.

345
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,901
That really didn't work out for us.

346
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,434
You should go next door with your kids.

347
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,240
This warrant says I can stay and
watch, so that's what I'm gonna do.

348
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,644
Excuse me.

349
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,044
We found this on the floor of her garage.

350
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,125
Is this yours?

351
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,662
Be careful.

352
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,221
No. It's not mine.

353
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,157
EAMES: We found it in your garage.

354
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,793
I don't know how it got in there.

355
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,303
That's okay, we do.

356
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,636
Sandi Tortomassi, you're
under arrest for murder.

357
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,676
I didn't do it. I didn't
have any reason to do it.

358
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,479
Getting rid of the wife gave
you a clear shot at Danny.

359
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,486
I don't wanna marry him.

360
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,180
Didn't your mother ever tell you?

361
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,850
"Why buy the cow when you can
get the milk for free?"

362
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,587
"Why buy the cow when you can
get the milk for..."

363
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,933
So you're saying that you can
talk Danny into anything.

364
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,697
Well, you saw the house he bought me.

365
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,260
And the strip club.

366
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,834
My idea.

367
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,035
That's just money. Guys
toss money at women every day.

368
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,736
Well, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

369
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,249
Oh? Like what?

370
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,777
Last April, his son's birthday party.

371
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,447
His bar mitzvah.

372
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,785
What, Danny invited you?

373
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,887
I brought two girls from the club.

374
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,001
Danny told his family we were
with the trucker's union.

375
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:21,211
Well, you really have this little
guy under your thumb, don't you?

376
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,878
I can see why.

377
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:30,460
Must've been some workout you gave
him in that big bedroom of yours.

378
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,055
Sure.

379
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,657
When the kids weren't around.

380
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:40,398
And where'd you go when you had
that place with your friend?

381
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,200
You and Danny go to a hotel?

382
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,568
Not so often, he'd get tired of it.

383
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:49,705
Good. Then you shouldn't have a problem
remembering the hotels and dates.

384
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,287
DANNY: I can't believe she did it.

385
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,187
She knew no matter what would have happened

386
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:03,318
(STUTTERING) I would never marry
her, or someone like her.

387
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,588
She knew that.

388
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,352
So,

389
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,590
we're looking for two men.

390
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,801
Maybe former bouncers.

391
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,298
If you can think of any names, it would help.

392
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,397
I can't think of anybody.

393
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,776
I can't think. I can't think!

394
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,311
You proved that.

395
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:24,837
Getting mixed up with some
bottle blonde boom-boom girl.

396
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,880
You don't have to tell me. I know that.

397
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,720
I shamed my family. I don't
know, what was I thinking?

398
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,555
Well, it was worth it.

399
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:46,531
Bet this girl gave you quite a ride.

400
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,567
No wonder you were still making

401
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,700
the drive up to Westchester
every other morning.

402
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,406
Did you go bareback or use a condom?

403
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,381
Condom.

404
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,423
You buy them on the way up there or
did you keep a box next to the bed?

405
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,253
She had them.

406
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,959
Really? That's funny.

407
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,791
Because we searched her room.
We didn't find anything.

408
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,194
Bathroom either.

409
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:17,530
No condom, no diaphragm, no pills.

410
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,464
There goes that blink rate again.

411
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,140
Do you remember the hotels
you stayed in with Sandi

412
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,643
before you bought her the house?

413
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,909
We've got the itemized bills from your stays.

414
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,278
GOREN: One afternoon, you
ordered two movies, rated PG.

415
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:40,048
Room service, two hamburgers, two
salads, two desserts, two massages

416
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,021
and you used the gym.

417
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,819
That's all in the space of four hours.

418
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,433
When did you find the time for sex?

419
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,905
Or was that between the
hamburger and the massage?

420
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,538
Another missed opportunity.

421
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,975
One of many, right, Danny?

422
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,046
Well, how did she wiggle out of it?

423
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,888
Did she have cramps?

424
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,656
She said the mood wasn't right?

425
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,361
She was worried about her kids?

426
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,365
She just wanted to cuddle?

427
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,663
She really kept you going, didn't she?

428
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,406
For two years, Danny.

429
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,240
Two years, and not once.

430
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,843
Right, Danny? Not a once.

431
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,554
It was okay.

432
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,751
- I didn't mind, really.
- Oh, come on.

433
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,317
What, are you made of marble?
You were dying for it.

434
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,794
And she kept upping the ante.

435
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,025
A condo for Mom, a house for the
kids, a strip club for her.

436
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,795
A dead wife for you.

437
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:58,991
No.

438
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,905
She talked you into it.

439
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,995
No.

440
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:07,742
I would never hurt Kelly. I respected her.

441
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,073
That's the truth.

442
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,940
She did so much for me,
so much to make a family.

443
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,145
Okay, Danny, that's enough.

444
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,589
It is now clear you consider him a suspect.

445
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,092
He's invoking his right to silence.

446
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,093
Him. Her.

447
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,232
Him and her. Take your pick.

448
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,498
It won't be either unless we find
the men who did the actual killing.

449
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,165
Well, I don't think that he has it in him.

450
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,970
I mean, the girl played
"keep away" for two years.

451
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,171
Ordinary man would be frustrated, angry.

452
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,737
He's not an ordinary man, he's a murderer.

453
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,374
- He's a child.
- I'm with him.

454
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,847
Four hours before Kelly was killed,

455
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,979
there were two calls from Sussman's office

456
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,819
to a no name prepaid cell phone.

457
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,449
Can we trace that cell phone to an owner?

458
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:58,120
No. But the number turned up
in a hooker's phone book

459
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,753
when she was busted three months ago.

460
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,924
Yolanda Starr Corbin.
She's a Greenpoint regular.

461
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,838
YOLANDA: All God's children need loving.

462
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,466
Which one of God's children gave you
this number a couple of months ago?

463
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,337
We'll just have to call it.

464
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,106
Tell whoever answers you gave it to us.

465
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,977
Please, don't do me like that.

466
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,982
We already have an idea who he is.

467
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,847
He's got a burn on his arm, right?

468
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,989
It's Big Louie. That's what I know him by.

469
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,782
He's armed and crazy.

470
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,054
But you have his number.

471
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,562
He made me take it. Said if
I get in trouble, call him.

472
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,394
EAMES: Guess what? You're in trouble.

473
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,562
Louie Bernoff.

474
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:43,266
Priors for drug possession, lewdness.

475
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,568
Ooh.

476
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,632
GOREN: What's wrong with your arm?

477
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,439
Car battery leaked.

478
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,676
Oh.

479
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,715
Do you know her?

480
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,783
- Nope.
- Him?

481
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,851
Nope.

482
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,255
How about her?

483
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:07,657
Nope.

484
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,096
You should.

485
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,198
Those are your hand prints around her neck.

486
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,496
You killed her.

487
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,935
We're gonna match your DNA to the
rag you left at the strip club

488
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,837
when you tried to burn it down.

489
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,970
Big trouble for Big Louie.

490
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,206
But you can help yourself by telling us

491
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,040
which one of these two here hired you.

492
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,622
I checked Big Louie backwards and forwards.

493
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:43,189
The phone calls are still the only thing

494
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,633
that connect him with Sussman and the girl.

495
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,938
- Crystal meth.
- No, thanks.

496
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,102
It belongs to Big Louie's roommate,

497
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,837
Nicky Ross.

498
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,937
Big time tweaker according to the neighbors.

499
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,709
The second killer.

500
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,950
Oh, and the neighbor saw Big Louie

501
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,887
lugging a large suitcase
down the stairs two days ago.

502
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,925
EAMES: Maybe Nicky left the
cap off the toothpaste.

503
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,458
Large pepperoni.

504
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,866
The night before Kelly Sussman was killed.

505
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,101
"Nashot Chayl"?

506
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,036
GOREN: "Nashot Chayl."

507
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,544
(STUTTERING)
Nashot, that's Hebrew.

508
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,140
Women, woman.

509
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,408
Figures you'd know that.

510
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,848
But Chayl, I don't know.

511
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,478
Valor.

512
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,084
Nashot Chayl - is women of valor.

513
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,252
Three years of Hebrew school.

514
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,087
Women of valor.

515
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,957
Sounds like a self-help group
for Jewish women.

516
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,563
SYLVIA: Kelly came to us two months ago.

517
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,431
She wanted a divorce.

518
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,229
But she wanted to make sure she did
everything right by our Jewish laws.

519
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,866
She didn't want any problems
getting custody of her kids.

520
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,103
- EAMES: Why would there be problems?
- If she wanted custody,

521
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,975
she'd have to convince
the religious authorities

522
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,914
that she'd continue raising the
children in the Jewish faith.

523
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,713
Don't family court judges decide custody?

524
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,411
Well, judges who are elected by a community
listen to their religious leaders.

525
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,925
Wouldn't be smart of them to alienate voters.

526
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,984
No, it wouldn't be smart.

527
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,655
So we help to prepare a get,
a Jewish divorce decree.

528
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,361
Then she had to present it to
her husband for him to sign.

529
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,335
Sounds pretty straightforward.

530
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,041
Except Kelly had to find
two witnesses to go with her.

531
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,973
People active in her synagogue.

532
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,374
GOREN: She couldn't find anyone.

533
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,208
No one wanted to be her witness.

534
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,045
Even her rabbi wouldn't help.

535
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,275
EAMES: The Sussman family...

536
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,409
They carry a lot of weight in the community.

537
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,714
Danny Sussman didn't want a divorce.

538
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:47,188
He wanted a reconciliation.
But Kelly had no choice.

539
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,383
If she didn't have a get, she'd risk
losing her kids in a custody fight.

540
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,761
When Kelly canceled the
mediation, did she reschedule?

541
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,855
No.

542
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,862
So the reconciliation was off?

543
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,573
She told me she had a better way
of getting what she wanted.

544
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,606
Custody of her kids.

545
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:12,211
I told her, no matter what,
Danny'd make a problem.

546
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,776
You know what, Danny's
never been the problem.

547
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:20,051
I mean, he doesn't have
the clout or the backbone

548
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,285
to bend the community to his will.

549
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,824
But his mother does.

550
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,792
She cleaned up his mess when he stole money,

551
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,767
and now she's fighting to save his marriage.

552
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,563
I can't find the invoice
for the Gellis account.

553
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,198
Do you have it?

554
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,973
- Danny?
- I can't help it, Mom.

555
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,341
She destroyed Kelly.
Now she's gonna destroy me.

556
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,147
- Stop it, stop it.
- I deserve it. I brought her into our life.

557
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,118
- Don't talk like that.
- I deserve what happens to me.

558
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,520
You deserve what you let happen.

559
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,491
We have friends, influence, respect.

560
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,426
They don't respect me.

561
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,895
They respect the name your father gave you.

562
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,659
The name you gave your son.

563
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,629
If you can't stand up for yourself,

564
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,934
at least stand up for the name.

565
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,102
I wish Dad was still here.

566
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,374
It's better he's not.

567
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,628
MRS. GERRIGAN: Kelly was working
in one of the big hotels

568
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,221
in New York City when she met Danny.

569
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,931
She told me he was very sweet.

570
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,269
A real gentleman.

571
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,774
She didn't tell me he was a Jewish gentleman.

572
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,071
And that bothered you?

573
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,372
Well,

574
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:53,505
I was wishing that Kelly would
meet a nice Catholic boy.

575
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,486
Just like I'm sure Mrs. Sussman wished

576
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,352
her son had met a nice Jewish girl.

577
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,789
Is that the impression that she gave you?

578
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:06,057
Oh, she didn't warm up to
Kelly till after the wedding.

579
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:10,394
We never even got a hug from that woman.

580
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,330
Your daughter was a devout Catholic?

581
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,962
Well, she grew up in the church.

582
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,905
She sang in the choir.

583
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,234
She loved the Virgin Mary.

584
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:30,317
Well, then, converting to Judaism

585
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:33,480
must have been a big decision for her.

586
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,821
Was that something that Danny
pressured her to do?

587
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,258
Not Danny.

588
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,357
He just wanted to be with Kelly.

589
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,226
They even talked about eloping.

590
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,765
Mrs. Sussman.

591
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,397
She made a big stink.

592
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,699
And Kelly was stubborn.

593
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,539
But then Kelly gave in.

594
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,468
All of a sudden.

595
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,511
Did she explain why?

596
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,739
No.

597
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,516
Two weeks later they were married.

598
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:11,317
No, sir, I'm not sure what
evidence they're developing

599
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,118
I know, but...

600
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,193
Yes, sir.

601
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,225
The Brooklyn DA's moving on the girl.

602
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,793
They're tangling with some
community pressure over there.

603
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,770
A community known as Ursula Sussman.

604
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,670
DEAKINS: You still haven't
sold me on that yet.

605
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,106
And what's all this?

606
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,807
Thirteen-year-old checks from her account.

607
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,847
Am I gonna kick myself for asking?

608
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:36,418
This one's for $75,000 made out to cash.

609
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,288
Just before her son's wedding 13 years ago.

610
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,121
Could've been for the dress,
for the reception hall.

611
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,957
The second check is the same amount.

612
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:51,993
$75,000 to cash three months later, in April.

613
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,338
And it's just a week after her...

614
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,172
Her grandson was born.

615
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,743
I need to see my friend, Max.

616
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,547
He's a rabbi.

617
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,817
We need to get Danny and his mother in here.

618
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,523
He knows we have this meeting?

619
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,963
He's usually back from lunch by now.

620
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:26,434
I'm sorry. There was a
long line at the bodega.

621
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:32,333
Did Detective Eames explain that
we needed some things clarified?

622
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,343
DANNY: Yes. About my marriage.

623
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,846
Yeah, right. You and your wife
were trying to make a fresh start.

624
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,882
Yes. We were trying.

625
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,383
EAMES: Your idea or hers?

626
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,852
Well, both. We both wanted
to go for counseling.

627
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,190
Sussman pickles. I've always been a big fan.

628
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,620
You made appointments
at the Nashot Chayl Center?

629
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,194
Yes. Kelly arranged it.

630
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,092
The people there told us
when she first contacted them,

631
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,658
Kelly was dead set on a divorce.

632
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,227
Oh, that's between a husband and a wife.

633
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:06,435
These people shouldn't be blabbering
about confidential information.

634
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,802
Well, I guess it really
doesn't matter now, does it?

635
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,649
I guess not.

636
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:20,379
You felt... Well, you still feel guilty.

637
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,325
I mean, you would have given
her anything she wanted

638
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,918
in the divorce.

639
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,028
Even custody of the kids?

640
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:32,262
She was a good mother and fighting
over custody would have hurt them.

641
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,465
What if Kelly went back
to the Catholic church?

642
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,165
Under Jewish law,

643
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:40,740
the kids wouldn't have been considered
Jewish anymore, would they?

644
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,107
DANNY: She wouldn't have done that.

645
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,942
What, someone who'd been hurt?

646
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,873
Who was angry, divorced, alone?

647
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,509
Who knows what she'd do?

648
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:57,420
Well, thank heaven there was someone
in the family still thinking straight.

649
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,925
Right, Mrs. Sussman?

650
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,959
I mean, if it wasn't for you,

651
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,592
Kelly might've run off
with your grandchildren

652
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,967
and turned them into who knows what.

653
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,503
Kelly just needed some time
to get over her anger.

654
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,845
Well, she got over it, all right.

655
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,814
Do you wanna know what she
told them at the center?

656
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,114
She told them that

657
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,814
she had a way of getting what she wanted.

658
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,790
Not from you, but from your mother.

659
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,527
What do you suppose she meant by that?

660
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,029
We don't know. We're not mind readers.

661
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,887
Neither are we.

662
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,925
But we're pretty good at connecting the dots.

663
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:43,336
First dot, Big Louie Bernoff.

664
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,508
You might know him as a murder suspect.

665
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,644
But six years ago, he was
also the owner of a van

666
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,614
he bought used from his
father, the mechanic.

667
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,685
GOREN: That sound familiar?

668
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:01,381
Because your dad helped Louie's father

669
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,290
immigrate from the Soviet Union,

670
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,922
I mean, just like he helped
hundreds of other refugees.

671
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:11,957
You dad even gave him the contract to
service your company's delivery vans.

672
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,965
So, that means nothing.

673
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,666
Your father helped hundreds
of people, thousands.

674
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,977
This is... It's just a... Just a...

675
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,305
Fluke?

676
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,547
It could be a fluke if Sandi Tortomassi

677
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,180
hired him to kill Kelly.

678
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,346
But she didn't.

679
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,560
Your wife wasn't a threat to her.

680
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,232
Your wife was a threat to your mother.

681
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,667
Oh, that's just ridiculous.

682
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,766
Kelly had something on her.

683
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,171
Something so shameful

684
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:59,880
that Kelly thought your mother
might give up her grand-kids

685
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,144
to keep it quiet.

686
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,685
That's not true.

687
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,186
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

688
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,589
Second dot.

689
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,092
Your pregnant Catholic fiancée.

690
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,302
Three words that made
your mother very unhappy.

691
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,495
That's okay.

692
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,803
Kelly's mother wasn't too
thrilled about it either.

693
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,243
Especially when she
converted out of the blue.

694
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:34,249
Or should I say out of the green?

695
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,717
EAMES: That summer after you were married,

696
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,847
Kelly bought her mother
a house for a $150,000?

697
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:45,952
Yes, that was a settlement that she'd
gotten for an old car accident.

698
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,762
Third dot.

699
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,663
Two $75,000 checks

700
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,500
drawn from your mother's
account 13 years ago.

701
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,842
Kelly bought the house with those checks.

702
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,051
The first one

703
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:13,780
is dated one week before Kelly converted.

704
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,855
The second one is dated two
days after your son's Bris,

705
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:22,092
after his circumcision that
welcomed him into the faith.

706
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,537
If anyone found out,

707
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,006
all the good will,

708
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,647
all the influence your father garnered

709
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,081
from his good work and his religious devotion

710
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,077
would have disappeared like

711
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,320
smoke in the wind.

712
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,823
Your family name would have been
disgraced, and the family business.

713
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,465
Kelly was gonna tell everyone.

714
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:08,508
Unless your mother let her
have custody of your kids.

715
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,636
Mom,

716
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,471
tell me you...

717
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,342
She did. She hired Big Louie
to kill your wife

718
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,945
and plant her necklace
in your girlfriend's garage.

719
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,850
GOREN: I'll bet

720
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,987
that your mother doesn't think
that she even did anything wrong.

721
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,999
I'll bet that she thinks that she was just
cleaning up another one of your messes.

722
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:39,966
Aren't you gonna get angry at her?
She killed your wife!

723
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,444
Come on, Danny.

724
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,609
When are you gonna grow up?

725
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:55,152
When are you gonna
take your balls back from her?

726
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,329
How could you, Mom?

727
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,526
How in the hell could you?

728
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,737
If you'd only listened.

729
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,211
I told you she was no good for you.

730
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,039
So I did what I had to do.

731
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:24,284
For the family. Always for the family.

732
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,479
What family? You killed the family!

733
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,484
You're under arrest,
Mrs. Sussman, for murder.

734
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,188
Please turn around.

735
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,737
Danny, do something.

736
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,734
Danny,

737
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,666
do something!

738
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:03,921
She broke the laws of her faith,

739
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,892
so what does she do about it?

740
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,691
You commit one sin,

741
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,498
the next ones come a little easier.
