was dropped down the chute,

165

00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,446
EAMES: She didn't slap you?

181
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,452
That's what it said in your
complaint, before you dropped it.

182
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,789
It was all a confusion, Ma'am. Just...

183
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,294
GOREN: Well, okay.

184
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,727
You're working for a nice family now, right?

185
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,259
It takes a special person to
raise somebody else's children.

186
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,895
Do you have your own children
back in the Philippines?

187
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,302
Yes. A boy and a girl.
They live with my sister.

188
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,843
You send them money every month?

189
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,144
So when the Davenports

190
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,114
offered you extra money
to forget about the complaint,

191
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,657
you took it. Hmm?

192
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,859
For your kids, right?

193
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,832
How did Mrs. Davenport get
along with Rick and Amanda?

194
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,637
She pretends she likes them,
and then she screams

195
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,197
when Mr. William gives them money.

196
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,106
Especially Mr. Rick.

197
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,512
She didn't let him come home anymore.

198
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,346
How do you know this?

199
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,846
All the nannies here, they talk.

200
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,487
Ma'am Tina says Rick
tried to kill little Lucy.

201
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,619
I'd never hit a servant.

202
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,559
Jinny filed that ridiculous
complaint because we fired her.

203
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,352
She was stealing.

204
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,431
My husband's diamond
cufflinks, his gold watch.

205
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,025
Sounds like you could've
filed a complaint against her.

206
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,628
Yes, well, we never actually
caught her red-handed.

207
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,603
What? You just fired her without any proof?

208
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,735
Was there something else?

209
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,073
Something that she knew?
Something that she saw?

210
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,170
Don't be sordid.

211
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,881
She tried to hold us up for a raise.

212
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,011
And if we didn't pay, she
threatened to have us arrested,

213
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,912
because she was made to sleep in Lucy's room.

214
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,656
Which could be construed as forcing
her to work around the clock.

215
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,757
A violation of labor laws.

216
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,569
Which is pretty smart for a country girl

217
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,632
from the Philippines.

218
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,871
I don't understand where
you're going with this.

219
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,535
There's a rumor going around
about your stepson.

220
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,942
You banned him from your home?

221
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,780
There was a good reason for that.

222
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,514
Rick tried to kill your daughter Lucy?

223
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,324
I never said he tried to kill her.

224
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,154
What exactly did he do?

225
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,188
I was away for the weekend.

226
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,164
Rick was staying with his father.

227
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,867
He'd left his anxiety pills
all over the guestroom

228
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,134
and Lucy got hold of them.

229
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,865
If Bill hadn't found...

230
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,445
Of course Rick denied
he even took medication.

231
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,946
Maybe you were afraid that next
time it wouldn't be an accident.

232
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,983
What are you talking about?

233
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,750
We don't think Rick committed these murders.

234
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,587
In fact, he may be a victim.

235
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,553
Now that he and Amanda are gone,

236
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,694
you don't have to be afraid for Lucy.

237
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,297
You can

238
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,134
devote all your husband's
considerable resources into

239
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,740
safeguarding her future.

240
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,410
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

241
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,452
They found the Davenport kid at a
garbage transfer station in New Jersey.

242
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,534
Cause of death was asphyxiation.

243
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,170
This mark, it's a belt buckle.

244
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,139
Yeah. I was getting to that.
It's consistent with a belt buckle.

245
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,267
The bruises overlap. The belt
was tightened more than once.

246
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,639
Erotic asphyxiation.

247
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,304
He was killed during sex.

248
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,905
Which is why there was lip
balm on his genitals.

249
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,779
Lip balm that neither of the
other victims was wearing.

250
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,845
Did you do a tox scan?

251
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,545
Yeah. Anything in particular?

252
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,682
Anti-anxiety medication. Alprazolam.

253
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,255
Negative.

254
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,355
If he'd taken it in the last month?

255
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,161
No, there'd be trace amounts in
his liver. Which there wasn't.

256
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:45,169
And there's no record it was
ever prescribed to him.

257
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,534
So who left the pills the little girl found?

258
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,798
Well, we're not the only
ones being gas lighted.

259
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,378
JINNY: I never steal anything
from Ma'am Tina. Never.

260
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,974
She just makes me so mad.

261
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,020
She made you sleep in Lucy's room

262
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,115
on top of taking care of Lucy all day.

263
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,023
Did you know that was a
violation of labor laws?

264
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,083
Yes.

265
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,184
And how did you know that?

266
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,252
EAMES: One of the nannies
at the park told you?

267
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,299
No. Mrs. Whilden's nanny.

268
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,992
The neighbor across the hall?

269
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,933
Her name is Hannah Price.
She's very nice to me.

270
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,161
She helped me learn about American things.

271
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,299
Like standing up for your rights.

272
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,432
Yes.

273
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,136
Was it her idea to tell the Davenports

274
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,271
they couldn't make you sleep in Lucy's room?

275
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,410
She told me it was not legal.

276
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,215
She didn't tell you that you might get fired

277
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,982
if you made trouble, did she?

278
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,950
No, she said Ma'am Tina would just
give me more money, no problem.

279
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,726
One more thing, did Hannah ever
talk to you about Rick Davenport?

280
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,267
She said he was handsome.

281
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,768
Of course Tina got rid of Jinny.

282
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,834
She was a thief and a troublemaker.

283
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,608
EAMES: How did your nanny react?

284
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,082
Hannah? I'm sure she didn't
care one way or the other.

285
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,512
Did she mention working for the Davenports?

286
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,114
What Hannah said was, since my
daughters were getting older,

287
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,091
she was feeling a little overwhelmed.

288
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,023
In any event, the co-op has an understanding,

289
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,362
we can't have nannies pitting
one family against another.

290
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,663
I told Hannah. That was the end of it.

291
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,705
I bet she was disappointed after
all the trouble she went to.

292
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,839
All what trouble?

293
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,773
Getting Jinny Canto fired

294
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,036
so she could be closer to Rick Davenport.

295
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,140
(LAUGHING)
Oh, come off it.

296
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,615
No, Hannah's just not that kind
of girl. She knows her place.

297
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,620
Especially when there was an opening
across the hall. She was just, you know...

298
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,656
That was Hannah's way

299
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,658
of telling me she wanted a raise.

300
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,787
And once we settled that, she even
helped Tina find a new nanny.

301
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,195
Sarah Eldon.

302
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,694

You see? She knows her place.

311
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,390
You know, I meant to ask,

312
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,427
do you or your husband
take anti-anxiety pills?

313
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,131
In the first place, I am divorced.

314
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,997
And in the second, that
is none of your business.

315
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,926

She's such a meanie.

him. None of them do.

318
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,874
Did he ask about me?

319
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,473
I don't think so. Lucy, don't
go down there, okay?

320

Never mind Lucy. Did he ask about me?

Ouch.

Every day, Hannah.

You can see how much he cares.

And what else? Tell me.

00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,732
Corn nibblets. You want
to nibble on some nibblets?

355
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,029
Yes.

356
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,299
All right. This is gonna
be an excellent lunch.

357
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,536
Mrs. Whilden told us

358
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,707
that you helped your friend Sarah
get a job with the Davenports.

359
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,343
Just lucky I knew someone.

360
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,248
And lucky there was a job opening.

361
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,854
You met Sarah at the park?

362
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,426
HANNAH: That's right.

363
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,555
Isn't that a risk, recommending
somebody you just met?

364
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,930
Sometimes you just get
a good feeling about people.

365
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,164
Well, Sarah's a very sweet girl.

366
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,466
The Davenports are very lucky to have her.

367
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,141
(STAMMERING) Especially at a
time like this, huh? Oops.

368
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,272
I'm sorry, I made a mess.

369
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,813
It's no bother.

370
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,821
EAMES: One thing about Sarah, she's very shy.

371
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,621
Yeah, she's not very sophisticated.

372
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,683
Did you notice that?

373
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:44,784
Mmm.

374
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,361
Well, she's from a small town.

375
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,723
(STAMMERING)
Oh, that's what we thought.

376
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,559
Where? Upstate?

377
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,734
I don't know.

378
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,029
She never talks about where she's from?

379
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,971
Uh...

380
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,039
Well, I just don't remember the name of it.

381
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,547
What else do you guys talk about?

382
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,517
You tell stories about your bosses?

383
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,576
No.

384
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,880
Oh, come on, I bet you have some juicy ones.

385
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,084
EAMES: Especially about Rick Davenport.

386
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,353
We have other things to talk about.

387
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,090
I saw a picture of him. He was handsome.

388
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,561
I'm sorry, I have work to get on with.

389
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,364
I have to change Abby

390
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,928
and redd up her room before Mrs.
Whilden comes home.

391
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,002
You're from Pennsylvania.

392
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,672
No, because you just said you
need to "redd up" her room.

393
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,613
That's what people say

394
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,015
in Western Pennsylvania.

395
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,811
I don't know. I'm from somewhere else.

396
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,224
I think I just heard the videotape go off.

397
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,489
Well, I better check it.

398
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,926
Our virtual tour of Western Pennsylvania

399
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,898
turned up a five-year-old arrest
for Hannah Price in Meadville.

400
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,934
It's a juvenile record, it's sealed.

401
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,869
Could be for shoplifting. It's meaningless.

402
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:37,772
The meaning is, there's a residential
treatment center for children in Meadville.

403
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,272
Where she was institutionalized?

404
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,011
Probably. Her records are sealed.

405
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,809
I can't help you unseal them.

406
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,816
All you have is peas and corn kernels.

407
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,245
You're a few lima beans short
of succotash, Detectives.

408
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,583
Succotash?

409
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,587
Your evidence is anecdotal.

410
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,420
I line up my shoes at night.

411
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,525
Why am I not surprised?

412
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:02,656
Idiosyncrasies won't sway the
Pennsylvania attorney general.

413
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,229
I can't even explain to him why these
girls committed these murders.

414
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,397
The answers are in those records.

415
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,201
You'll have to find another way.

416
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,243
The rules on privacy are pretty clear.

417
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,806
We're kind of at a dead end.

418
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,284
See, my kid brother got
engaged to this girl...

419
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,343
Her brother isn't the
best judge of character.

420
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,084
This girl had been very
sketchy about her past.

421
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,148
You know for a fact she was a resident here?

422
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,819
She had this box of letters

423
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,760
and some of them were addressed to her here.

424
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,855
We didn't read the letters, of course.

425
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,365
Why don't you just ask her?

426
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,457
No.

427
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,797
Her brother wouldn't like that.

428
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,073
We need to know why Hannah was living here.

429
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,731
Hannah.

430
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,270
Hannah Price.

431
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,842
Hannah lost her mother when she was six.

432
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,579
Her father was unable to care
for her, so she lived here.

433
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:57,643
EAMES: For how long?

434
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,018
Till she was 16.

435
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,723
Don't kids

436
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,225
go to foster homes, normally?

437
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,095
Yes, normally...

438
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,463
Look, if something's wrong with
her and somebody gets hurt...

439
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,632
All I can tell you is that
I just remember Hannah

440
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,573
as a bright little girl who
loved having her ears tickled.

441
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,936
Is that both ears together?

442
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,576
Yeah. It was something her mother used to do.

443
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,012
A family thing.

444
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,785
Didn't your brother say
that Hannah had a sister?

445
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,292
Oh...

446
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,827
Sandra. Sarah.

447
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,657
Sarah.

448
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,729
She had a different last name.

449
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,697
Eldon.

450
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,263
Now, is that because she was adopted?

451
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,768
Yes.

452
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,537
By a family in the area?

453
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,044
(LAUGHING)
Sarah just loved it.

454
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,511
And it always had to be
both ears at the same time.

455
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,848
Something her mother did
when Sarah was little.

456
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,353
What happened to the mother?

457
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,518
Lori died in prison

458
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,658
of AIDS.

459
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,922
And the father?

460
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,996
He ran out on them after Sarah was born.

461
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,093
You did say Sarah was okay.
She's not in any trouble?

462
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,934
She's fine. It's Hannah
we're interested in.

463
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,032
GOREN: You're not surprised.

464
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,976
She's had a difficult life
growing up with no family.

465
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,675
We're curious about that.
Don't they try to have

466
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,478
siblings adopted together?

467
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,249
That was our idea at first.

468
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,680
But Hannah was a handful.

469
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,651
She was always breaking things.

470
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,624
She'd lied about everything.

471
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,028
She was distant?

472
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,592
You'd try to give her
affection and she'd pull back.

473
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,398
We tried so hard.

474
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,167
But they told us she was
pretty much a done deal.

475
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,142
She probably didn't want to be adopted.

476
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,171
MR. ELDON: That's what she said.

477
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,908
She had this notion that one day her
father was gonna come back for her.

478
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:08,048
She told the caseworkers she
didn't care if they were split up.

479
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,849
She wanted Sarah to have a family.

480
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,817
She cared about her little sister.

481
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,914
Yes.

482
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,822
When Sarah told us

483
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,729
that Hannah had found her a job in New
York City, we weren't so worried.

484
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,661
Have you talked to her since?

485
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,665
Not for a while.

486
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,670
But she did send George
a card on his birthday.

487
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,805
Could we see it?

488
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:48,051
"Dear Daddy, happy birthday from the
Big Apple. I miss you both so much.

489
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,151
"Oh, Mommy, can you believe
Madelyn's baby is Lance's?"

490
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,661
Who are Madelyn and Lance?

491
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:56,459
(CHUCKLING) That's just our soap
opera. We used to watch it together.

492
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,861
"Daddy, I'm kind of on a tight budget,

493
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,531
"but I want you to have these.
They were my father's.

494
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,768
"You were there when he wasn't
and I want you to have them."

495
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,337
What did she give you?

496
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,110
Cufflinks.

497
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,475
Diamond cufflinks.

498
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,084
She won't ever go back to him,
even if he gets his memory back.

499
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,587
But when she thought he was dead,

500
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,288
(DOOR OPENING)
she said she'd always love him.

501
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,262
You are so naive.

502
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,761
Where's Lucy?

503
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,997
Hannah told me she was with you.

504
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,046
We already looked through Sarah's room.

505
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,709
MARJORIE: Well, I can assure you

506
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,515
that I look through Hannah's
room on a regular basis

507
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,147
and I have never found anything wrong.

508
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,659
EAMES: Stupid us, going to the
trouble to get search warrants.

509
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,140
In the Shadow of Tomorrow.

510
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,542
That's a soap opera that she tapes.

511
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,983
It's a little low-brow, but hardly criminal.

512
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,748
Guess you didn't look in here.

513
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,413
"W.S.D."

514
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,684
William Davenport.

515
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,324
Every night I went to sleep

516
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,096
dreaming of the day my real
father would come for me.

517
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:42,804
And the man I dreamed about
looked exactly like you.

518
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,435
What is this?

519
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:48,109
In the Shadow of Tomorrow, airdate June 5,

520
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,805
1997.

521
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,639
This lovely couple in bed over here.

522
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,308
That's Lance and Keri.

523
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,375
Keri was "Miss Shadow Valley 1996."

524
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,114
And she's wearing a scarf around her neck

525
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,748
because they're experimenting
in erotic asphyxia.

526
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,058
March 1998.

527
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:08,087
Angela's 2-year-old daughter went into a coma

528
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,896
when she accidentally
ate Angela's tranquilizers.

529
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,235
And this one.

530
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,602
November of last year.

531
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,239
It's Eden Montgomery and her
stepfather on the eve of her wedding.

532
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,444
They belonged to my father.

533
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,720
You were there for me when he wasn't,

534
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,114
and I want you to have them, Daddy.

535
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,485
Let me guess, cufflinks.

536
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,054
This soap opera for these girls,

537
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,696
this is their playbook.

538
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,893
Their whole life is a play.

539
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,000
This is real.

540
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,507
I had no idea. I mean...

541
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,009
In hindsight it makes sense. Hannah always

542
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,987
made a special effort

543
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,982
to make me notice her.

544
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,687
Rick or Amanda ever let on they
knew about this fixation on you?

545
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,226
BILL: No, of course they didn't know. They...

546
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,964
No hint your son was having
sex with Hannah that night?

547
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,598
No. I told you, he said they were going to

548
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,341
watch basketball and
play some computer games.

549
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,946
What computer games? Do you remember?

550
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,280
Because we didn't find any games.

551
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,013
He called it

552
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,921
Shadow something. Shadow...

553
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,256
Shadow Valley?

554
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,797
Yes. Shadow Valley.

555
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,760
What?

556
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,530
Shadow Valley is the place
where the soap opera was set.

557
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,799
The fact that your son knew
about the girls' fantasy

558
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,738
might have triggered the murders.

559
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:03,176
I can't believe we allowed
these monsters into our home.

560
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,706
What I'm interested in,

561
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,681
is how these monsters

562
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,547
interacted.

563
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,383
It was clear who was the boss.

564
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,553
Hannah.

565
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,760
GOREN: How could you tell?

566
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,861
Bill and I gave Sarah a cashmere
sweater for her birthday.

567
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,534
She was practically in tears,
she was so appreciative.

568
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:29,429
She wore the sweater all weekend long,
and then she never wore it again.

569
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,669
Hannah took it.

570
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,334
I saw her wearing it.

571
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,308
BILL: We took Lucy to her
grandmother's this morning,

572
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,077
after you called us.

573
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,013
We need to get back to her.

574
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,419
Mr. Davenport,

575
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,057
we may need your help later on today.

576
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,827
Who's the worst pro bono lawyer you know?

577
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,301
The worst? That's easy.

578
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,971
Stan Shatenstein.

579
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,473
You know, hypothetically, how would we get

580
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,305
Stan Shatenstein assigned to two defendants?

581
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,816
What would we do?

582
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,319
What would you do, hypothetically?

583
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,849
Since Mr. Shatenstein covers night court,

584
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:24,485
you'd make sure your defendants
were arrested after 7:00 p.m.

585
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,460
Well, murder one.

586
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,261
So the death penalty's on the table here?

587
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,134
Yes, it is, Mr. Shatenstein.

588
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,070
What's your thinking here?

589
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:44,313
We're thinking this one was taking
orders from her big sister.

590
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,041
Oh, yeah?

591
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,881
Sarah,

592
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,688
we know you and Hannah killed
those people. We know it for a fact.

593
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,117
We're offering you the chance
to save not only your own life,

594
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,126
but your sister's as well.

595
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,233
We didn't hurt anyone. We didn't.

596
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,293
There's something else

597
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,401
that we know.

598
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,099
We know why you did it.

599
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:23,016
That Rick found out something
that he wasn't supposed to.

600
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,213
Something about Hannah.

601
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,727
And then he used that knowledge to
force Hannah to have sex with him

602
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,854
and to have sex with his buddy Josh.

603
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,265
EAMES: Don't bother denying it.

604
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,628
Here's another thing we know for a fact.

605
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,634
Hannah stole these things
from the Davenports.

606
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,942
That's what Rick found out.

607
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,038
That Hannah was a thief.

608
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,881
That's what he had on her

609
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,420
and he threatened to call the police, right?

610
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,854
Sarah, we talked to
the Eldon's in Pennsylvania.

611
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,864
We know you're a good person.

612
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,763
And the Davenports,

613
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,497
they think the world of you.
They want to help you.

614
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,206
EAMES: We told them
whatever you did that night,

615
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,535
it was because Hannah made you do it.

616
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,270
GOREN: You're nothing like her at all.

617
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,280
You have people who raised you.

618
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:30,847
Who love you.

619
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,091
But Hannah...

620
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,849
I mean, she's...

621
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,225
She's like a paper cup in the breeze.

622
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,856
She's not like that. You don't even know her.

623
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,091
It's okay if you feel sorry
for her. It's okay.

624
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,199
But right now you have to think of yourself.

625
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:52,537
You have to think of yourself.

626
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,201
I don't know anything.

627
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,308
(SOBBING)
I don't know anything.

628
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,448
Well, when you're ready to talk to
us, give Mr. Shatenstein a call.

629
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,392
EAMES: The DA said he'd be sending
you the SVDF by tomorrow morning.

630
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,364
Okay. What's that?

631
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,895
It's a special form for capital cases.

632
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,096
You haven't done a lot of
capital cases, have you?

633
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,169
(STAMMERING)

634
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,011
I don't think he knows what he's doing.

635
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,624
What did you say to those cops?

636
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,727
Nothing, Hannah. I would never.

637
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,331
Do they know?

638
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,239
About that? No, they don't know about that.

639
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,238
I thought they did, but they don't.

640
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,680
They wanted me to say
that you were the bad one.

641
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,916
Because I got adopted and you didn't.

642
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,475
But I didn't say that, Hannah. I swear.

643
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,815
(SOBBING)
What's gonna happen to us?

644
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,652
What's gonna happen to us, Hannah?

645
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,568
Remember when Eden

646
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,130
was in that prison in South America?

647
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,803
How she was saved in the nick of time?

648
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,546
We don't have anything to worry about.

649
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,648
We just stick together, like always.

No, just Sarah Eldon.

00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,713
Fine. Mr. Shatenstein, you're relieved
from representing Miss Eldon.

You'll be Miss Price's attorney.

Have you anything to say about
this here, Mr. Shatenstein?

Uh, nothing right now, Judge.

668
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:44,907
All right.

People on bail?

670
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,117
No bail, Your Honor. The defendants have

671
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:52,314
no jobs, no home, no ties to the community.

by Mr. William Davenport,

the father of two of the victims.

674
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,625
It's Mr. Davenport who retained me

675
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,290
to represent her because he
believes in her innocence.

676
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,960
He's prepared to post any amount
of bail to ensure her appearance.

677

I hope be brought his checkbook.

explain to you what happened
back there in the courtroom?

are gonna be tried separately.

Maybe not.

705
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,492
What I'm trying to say
is, that at some point,

706
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:48,436
Sarah is just gonna have to do
what her lawyer tells her to do.

707
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,714
Is that what happened with the adoptions?

708
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,950
Because it never really made sense to us.

709
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,748
Adoption agencies,

710
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,050
they keep siblings together.

711
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,385
I didn't want to be adopted.

712
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,526
You stayed behind in that warehouse for kids

713
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:19,700
because you wanted

714
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,601
your little sister to have a better life.

715
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,206
Does she know what you did for her?

716
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,537
Does she know how lucky she is to
have you watching out for her?

717
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:31,672
Mmm-hmm.

718
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,846
We're lucky to have each other.

719
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,653
Well, right now she's the lucky one.

720
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,750
GOREN: With Bill Davenport.

721
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:57,565
Here.

722
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,254
Well, look at the way he behaves towards her.

723
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,421
You know, the way he tells her things.

724
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,861
He's very...

725
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,227
He's very fatherly.

726
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,540
Well, it must be fate
how their paths crossed.

727
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,806
I got her that job.

728
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:37,903
I know.

729
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,849
You know, it's really unfair.

730
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,247
Considering that you're the
one that did all the work

731
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,488
to get close to him.

732
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,694
When you first saw him, Hannah,

733
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,297
did he look like the man
that you dreamed about

734
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:06,171
when you dreamed about your
real father coming for you?

735
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,368
What did you say to me?

736
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:08,433
That's what Sarah told us.

737
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,842
No, she didn't!

738
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,175
Yes. She told us all about you...

739
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,908
You are lying!

740
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,883
There they go.

741
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,387
GOREN: She's going home.

742
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,825
Next time you see her
it'll be in the courtroom

743
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,121
when she testifies against you.

744
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,387
No!

745
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,653
That'll be the last time,
because Bill Davenport

746
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,529
won't allow her to see you in jail.

747
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,967
Sarah will take the place
of his dead daughter.

748
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,863
She's gonna become

749
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,170
Lucy's big sister.

750
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,475
It'll be like you never existed.

751
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,914
No! Sarah!

752
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:51,981
Sarah!

753
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,552
Sarah!

754
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,261
They were pigs!

755
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,132
They laughed at us!

756
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,300
HANNAH: I'll tell you everything!

757
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,237
She helped me kill Rick in the bed.

758
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,712
She helped me.

759
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,681
And Amanda, it was her idea to call Amanda.

760
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,946
She knew her number. I didn't!

761
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,544
She killed Amanda!

762
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,084
Sarah! Sarah!

763
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,662
Sarah! I want my sister!

764
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,391
I want Sarah!

765
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,274
Well,

766
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,814
our little ploy worked.
She gave up her sister.

767
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:58,853
Gave up. Yes,

768
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,020
and no.
