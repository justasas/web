1
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,044
In New York City's war on crime,

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,180
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,089
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,956
These are their stories.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,062
I don't know what you expect me to say.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,031
I want an explanation.

7
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,762
I'm getting calls from Mr. Tyler every day.

8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,431
Obviously, there's been a mix-up.

9
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,534
Obviously.

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,007
Mr. Hagman, the florist is here.

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,566
He's got a couple of questions for you.

12
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,206
Thank you, Mr. Rivera. You have
the weekend to straighten this out.

13
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,139
If I hadn't happened to check.

14
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,741
It's just a mix-up.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,288
What am I gonna tell him come Monday?

16
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,347
Part of being a successful businessman

17
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,553
is knowing when to worry and when not to.

18
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,527
- He's gonna make trouble, I know it.
- No, he's not.

19
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,826
He doesn't want the publicity.

20
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,334
Appearances count, Russell.

21
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,808
All I'm saying is, this could
be a big problem for me.

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,040
- I got to catch the ferry back.
- Russell,

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,683
problems are just solutions in work clothes.

24
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,066
What are you doing in here?

25
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,262
You know you're not supposed to be here alone.

26
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,999
Sorry, Mr. H.

27
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,631
We got Mr. Knowles on deck.

28
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,542
His chart says he died
from cirrhosis of the liver.

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,580
That's drinking, right?

30
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,248
Scotty, why don't you go home tonight?

31
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,908
Mr. H, I was...

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,347
We'll talk about it next week.

33
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,046
You just go home.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,153
Tell your mother Happy Easter.

35
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,460
(phone ringing)

36
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,134
Hi. They all asleep?

37
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,733
No, not yet.

38
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,709
I wanna finish up Mr. Knowles' body tonight.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,877
The viewing's at noon.

40
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,941
No, don't wait up.

41
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,406
Love you, too.

42
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,650
Hey, Doug.

43
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,517
Long time, no see.

44
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,380
Do I know you?

45
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,380
How's my Easter Bunny?

46
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,584
You got in late last night.

47
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,423
I know. The traffic was backed
up all the way to Melwood.

48
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,156
You work too hard.

49
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,667
Do you know what happens to
little boys who work too hard?

50
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,998
Look what the Easter Bunny brought!

51
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,561
(exclaiming)
Look at all that candy.

52
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,506
Hey, I bet there's more.

53
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,407
Who wants to go on an Easter egg hunt?

54
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,446
Both: Me! Me!

55
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,040
Start looking.

56
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,013
(growling)

57
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,223
Douglas, are you back here?

58
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,027
Oh, God.

59
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,521
Oh, my God.

60
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,846
Crucifixion pose.

61
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,353
No characteristic mutilation.

62
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,723
No nail holes. No crown of thorns.

63
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,254
Just these.

64
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,024
His wife said he didn't
have a medical condition.

65
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,698
You must've been so much
fun in biology class.

66
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,632
(COPS CHATTERING)

67
00:04:56,196 --> 00:05:00,338
Actually, my biology teacher, Mr. Dixon,
didn't think I was much fun at all.

68
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,041
There was no sign of forced entry.

69
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:08,143
There's only one employee
with a key, Mr. Rivera.

70
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,321
He's been with Hagman for 11 years.

71
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:19,653
There's something floating
in the embalming fluid.

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,077
It's a marijuana seed.

73
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,715
Hagman had this kid working
for him. Scotty Calderon.

74
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,155
Yeah, my mom was a cosmetician for Mr. H.

75
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,784
She got sick, so he lets me work part-time,

76
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,124
you know, showing me the ropes.

77
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,496
I'm sure you could show him
a few ropes yourself.

78
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,395
Like the many profitable uses

79
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,960
for embalming fluid.

80
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,503
I don't know about that, man.

81
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:07,136
You don't know about fry
sticks, clickums, wet daddies?

82
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,308
Damn.

83
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,144
Damn is right, Scotty.

84
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,740
Joints soaked in embalming fluid

85
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,047
sell for $20 bucks a pop on the street.

86
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,579
Mr. H found out what you were doing?

87
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,489
He didn't know about that, I swear.

88
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,020
I just...

89
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,960
He knew I was getting high.

90
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,759
That's why he sent me home early last night.

91
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,097
Early? His wife told us you
quit work every day at 6:00.

92
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,430
Not the last couple of weeks.

93
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,402
He had me stay late till he locks up.

94
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,666
Why?

95
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,838
I don't know, man.

96
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,475
Well, anything unusual happen two weeks ago?

97
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,017
Anything that had Mr. H worried?

98
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,977
Well, there was that message
on the answering machine.

99
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,216
Some guy was reading from the Bible.

100
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,690
Well, do you remember what he said?

101
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,285
Something about

102
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,891
eating the bread, going back
in the ground, like that.

103
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,326
(SCOTT LAUGHING)

104
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,561
Okay, Scott.

105
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,001
Just follow the officer out.

106
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,574
So that's what a brain looks
like on embalming fluid.

107
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,112
Hagman was getting harassing phone calls.

108
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,675
"In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread,

109
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,210
"till thou return unto the ground

110
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,619
"for out of it wast thou taken."

111
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,088
DEAKINS: Genesis.

112
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,225
I need to use my most
important investigative tool.

113
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,784
My library card.

114
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,561
The ME analyzed the bumps on Hagman.

115
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,129
They were filled with a
blend of mineral spirit,

116
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,434
propylene glycol, surfactant, lanolin, aloe.

117
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,236
You think that's some kind of soap?

118
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,604
The lab's not sure.

119
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,543
The bumps were made
post-mortem using a syringe.

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,343
The skin was red from being
burned with a lighter or a torch.

121
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,747
The Sixth Plague.

122
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,884
Boils were the Sixth Plague
sent by God to the Egyptians.

123
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,794
Each plague was meant to discredit

124
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,765
a different Egyptian god.

125
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,427
Boils were aimed at Imhotep,
the god of medicine.

126
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,731
Hagman was killed by a religious fanatic?

127
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,931
Yeah, who opposes embalming.

128
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,037
Well, he's probably not the only
undertaker in town who was targeted.

129
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,548
FRITZ: Ryan took the call.

130
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,347
The person asked for me by my first name.

131
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,580
Fritz.

132
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,479
Was this someone you knew?

133
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,623
I didn't recognize the voice.

134
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,354
He had a whole spiel.

135
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,954
Mostly about embalming
being against God's plan.

136
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,867
How every time I insert a trocar
into a corpse, I desecrate the body.

137
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,301
What's a trocar?

138
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,804
Tool of the trade.

139
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,738
It's inserted near the navel

140
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:53,835
and used to puncture the stomach,
bladder, large intestines and lungs.

141
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,744
Then... Let's leave it at tool of the trade.

142
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,476
That was the term the caller used? Trocar?

143
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:01,877
Yes.

144
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,920
Mr. Vaughn, where did you
study for your license?

145
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,749
Queens College of Mortuary Sciences.

146
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,493
I was just about to go home.

147
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,999
I just wanted to see how you were.

148
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,831
Did you ever hear from that man, Hagman?

149
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,962
- No. He was...
- I told you.

150
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,299
Things have a way of working themselves out.

151
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,774
Harry, he got killed over the weekend.

152
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,469
Right in the funeral home.

153
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,412
God has a very peculiar sense of humor.

154
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:34,107
"Careers in advertising." What is all this?

155
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,279
I got this idea on how to sell advertising.

156
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,617
You know when you call up a
business and they put you on hold?

157
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,889
What if instead of playing
music they played commercials?

158
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,954
See, this is where companies get into trouble.

159
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,096
They squander all their capital
by extending themselves

160
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,797
into areas where they have no
track record, no expertise.

161
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,338
Stop dreaming and start reaping.

162
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,511
I'm going to take a look out back.

163
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:04,344
Out back? Well, why? Is there a problem?

164
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,679
No problem yet, Russell.

165
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,344
I wanted to offer comfort
to the grief-stricken.

166
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,481
The mortuary college was teaching us

167
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,582
to shake every dime loose from them.

168
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,183
- That's why you dropped out?
- Yes.

169
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,320
And why you made threatening phone calls

170
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,194
to your classmate Fritz
Vaughn and to Doug Hagman?

171
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,326
I don't threaten. I call to open a dialogue.

172
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,897
To rant against what your literature calls,

173
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,999
"The ritual desecration of the human body."

174
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,706
Do you have any idea what
embalming actually entails?

175
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,715
Do you want your anus stuffed with cotton,

176
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,544
your mouth glued shut,

177
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,150
all to preserve the illusion that
death doesn't change anything?

178
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,623
GOREN: Well, there's always cremation.

179
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,853
No. Don't you understand?

180
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,752
Death and decay

181
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,725
are eternal truths of man's existence.

182
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,764
Any interference, any desecration

183
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,394
is a stain in God's plan.

184
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,144
Any desecration at all of humans remains?

185
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,077
Yes.

186
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,055
He's a true believer.

187
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,357
He wouldn't have desecrated Hagman's body.

188
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,796
- Not even to make a point?
- You heard him.

189
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,889
It would put a stain on God's plan.

190
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,663
The fake boils, the crucifixion pose,

191
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,294
it was all just to throw us off.

192
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,532
- It's impressive.
- It's demented.

193
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,869
It worked.

194
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,001
Whoever it is killed Hagman,

195
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,067
I can't wait to meet them.

196
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,918
Mr. Hagman didn't mention any
problems with other funeral homes.

197
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,924
What about your customers, Mr. Rivera.
You ever get any complaints from them?

198
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,085
No. People are always grateful.

199
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,787
Mr. Hagman did good work.

200
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,162
There's a Mr. Tyler here who
doesn't sound very grateful.

201
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,763
He's threatening a lawsuit.
Do you remember him?

202
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,931
He brought in his wife and his mother
a couple of weeks ago for cremation,

203
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,997
but I don't know of any trouble.

204
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,876
GOREN: "if as you told me the ashes aren't
lost, then where the hell are they?

205
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,744
"You have no idea what agony
you've put my family through.

206
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,751
"if you don't return the ashes
by the end of this week,

207
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,981
"you'll get a taste of
what we've had to endure."

208
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,024
It's dated Tuesday, last week.

209
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,227
Did you get him his ashes back?

210
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,660
Well, I don't remember any paperwork about it.

211
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,428
You do the cremations here?

212
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,130
No, we send the remains to the Fox
Hills Crematory on Staten Island.

213
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,136
Right. Tyler, poor guy
lost his wife and mother.

214
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,433
He called here.

215
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,571
I told him I sent the ashes back to Hagman's.

216
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,206
You got any paperwork on that?

217
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,375
Sure.

218
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,755
"Problems are just solutions in work clothes."

219
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,222
I like that.

220
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,949
You had the business long?

221
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,690
Couple of years, since my dad died.

222
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,232
Family business. Interesting work?

223
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,697
You get used to it.

224
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,334
Burning bodies?

225
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,232
Really? You know, I heard they
don't burn all the way through.

226
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,440
You have to, you know, roll them
over like a log in a fireplace

227
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,774
and shove them back in.

228
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,043
It's called repositioning.

229
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,879
And you get used to that?

230
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,519
Yeah. You get used to anything.

231
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,586
Here.

232
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:42,896
Hagman's signature accepting receipt for
the urns containing the Tyler ashes.

233
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:47,199
Can you think of any reason why Mr.
Hagman didn't return the ashes to Tyler?

234
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,364
No.

235
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,469
But, look, I don't mean to sound callous,

236
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,135
I mean, the guy just lost his family,

237
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,739
but on the phone, he was
ranting like some crazy man.

238
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,589
He promised I'd get the ashes
back within three days.

239
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,421
- He promised.
- So you threatened him.

240
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,461
I told him I was gonna sue.

241
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,224
To make sure he never did
business in this state again.

242
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,558
Your mother lived with you?

243
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,864
Yes, she wasn't in good health.

244
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,774
She had a heart problem?

245
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,168
She had an arrhythmia. It was
partially controlled by medication.

246
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,208
Partially. She had a pacemaker?

247
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,749
Yes, she did.

248
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,786
Do you know if it was removed at the hospital

249
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,881
before they sent her to the funeral home?

250
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,482
I have no idea.

251
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,786
What difference does it make?

252
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,629
GOREN: The hospital didn't remove it

253
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,165
before sending the body to the funeral home.

254
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,100
Hagman's inventory of everything
he removed from Mrs. Tyler's body

255
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,727
doesn't mention the pacemaker.

256
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,533
And this is a big deal because?

257
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,665
Pacemakers have to be
removed before cremation

258
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,402
otherwise, the lithium batteries explode.

259
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:02,276
Gives off a toxic fume and could
damage the cremation chamber.

260
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,373
Yeah, I heard silicon
implants had to be removed.

261
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,918
My buddy Martinelli in the
3-7 married a stripper.

262
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,386
Did Mr. Matthews mention any
problems with Mrs. Tyler?

263
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,615
No. You'd think he'd remember

264
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,213
if she exploded in his furnace.

265
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,488
Maybe the pacemaker popped out
in the accident or the hospital.

266
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,522
Do we have a list of Hagman's clients

267
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,825
who were cremated at Fox Hills?

268
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,067
I ironed your gray shirt.

269
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,377
I worry about you driving at night.

270
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,804
Don't.

271
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,745
I'm careful.

272
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,210
I'll call you from the motel
as soon as I get there. Okay.

273
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,178
My clients need to see me.

274
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,417
They like the personal contact.

275
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,454
I know you do, too.

276
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,830
Oh, I almost forgot. Molly made
you some cookies for the road.

277
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,198
I found only one family who would let
me examine their relative's ashes.

278
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,400
Their Aunt Edith.

279
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,377
She was cremated six months ago at Fox Hills.

280
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,912
I ran the test twice, just to be sure.

281
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,006
These so-called ashes are nothing but debris.

282
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,311
Debris?

283
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:17,283
Cement dust, dried clay, bits of
charcoal briquettes, wood chips.

284
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,617
Nothing human?

285
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,055
Not a spec.

286
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,284
Just an urn filled with three pounds of dirt.

287
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,962
So, where's Aunt Edith?

288
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,831
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

289
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,995
Detectives, I didn't expect to see you back.

290
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,336
Couple of things came up in
connection with Damon Tyler.

291
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,376
Did you run into any problems
when you cremated his mother?

292
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,207
No. Why?

293
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,838
It came to our attention she had a pacemaker.

294
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:47,009
Oh, well, that would've been
removed before we got the remains.

295
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,781
That's the problem. See, there's no record

296
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,879
that it was removed by anybody.

297
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,948
Well, if it hadn't been removed,

298
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,759
I would've found out the hard way.

299
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,353
It's a slow day.

300
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,692
Excuse me?

301
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,427
There's no smoke coming from the chimney.

302
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:08,234
Oh, well, we only run the cremation
chamber at specific times.

303
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,032
When was the last time?

304
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,440
Yesterday.

305
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,742
- Are you sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

306
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,548
Because there's birds nesting
directly downwind from the chimney.

307
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,682
- Well, I don't know much about birds.
- Yeah.

308
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:28,556
But you'd think with the smoke
they'd keep from nesting there.

309
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,296
Well, like you said, you don't
know much about birds, so...

310
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,629
But I like fresh air.

311
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,998
Doesn't smell so fresh here.
What do you think?

312
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,265
It's a little ripe.

313
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,206
Well, Fresh Kills Landfill is not far.

314
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,270
What's back there?

315
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,445
It's just some land my dad
bought with the crematory.

316
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,709
Hey, you think we could take a walk?

317
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,350
You know, I'm real busy,

318
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,549
and my insurance won't allow anybody
back there without me, so...

319
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,818
So that's a no on the nature walk?

320
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,358
Yeah. Sorry. It's...

321
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,862
This is Goren. We're
at the Fox Hills Crematory.

322
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,325
Right.

323
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,736
The DA's will be faxing you a search warrant.

324
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,335
MAN: We got two over by those rocks.

325
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,875
Four, could be five down in that little gully.

326
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,808
Some are buried deep.

327
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,870
Some are just covered with branches.

328
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,483
Some look a few weeks old, some...

329
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,883
Who knows?

330
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,222
Rough count so far is north of 30.

331
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,796
I've never seen anything like this.

332
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,988
You and me both, brother.

333
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,633
Dad left a lot of debt.

334
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,539
Like when he got the furnace fixed.

335
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,872
So you saved on your gas bill

336
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,106
by dumping bodies in your backyard?

337
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,647
Is that where the $70,000

338
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,842
we found in your bank account came from?

339
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,310
It's just a mistake, I swear.
I never wanted this.

340
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,550
You never wanted what?

341
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,423
The crematory? Your dad's business?

342
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,590
You had other plans for your life?

343
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,367
You wanted to be what,

344
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,666
an advertising executive?

345
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,601
A webpage designer?

346
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:28,406
Oh, and look at this, an alpaca rancher.

347
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,775
Anything but a guy who repositions

348
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,614
half-burnt corpses on the grill.

349
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,624
This is what you buried back there.

350
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,759
Your dreams. Your frustrated ambitions.

351
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,730
That's why you defrauded these families.

352
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,200
- That's what Hagman found out.
- No, no.

353
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,998
I didn't... I didn't defraud anybody.

354
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,199
Come on, Russell, take
some pride in your work.

355
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,971
Look at the books that you kept.

356
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,980
Every decimal in its place.
Every penny accounted for.

357
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,513
You covered yourself like a pro.

358
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,814
Where did you learn to do this?

359
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,750
Nowhere.

360
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,723
You went to business school?

361
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,814
No.

362
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,550
You had someone help you keep the books?

363
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,328
No. No one.

364
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,865
I don't need to do this
anymore. I want a lawyer.

365
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,733
I want a lawyer, now.

366
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,707
DEAKINS: I just got the
latest tally from the ME.

367
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,904
They broke 100 about an hour ago.

368
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,004
That's 100 counts of larceny.

369
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,141
Not to mention, an innumerable
violations of the public health laws.

370
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:43,585
But I'd trade it all for a
single count of murder.

371
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,854
Matthews isn't sophisticated
enough to have pulled off

372
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,051
Hagman's murder or this scam.

373
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,088
He's a pie-in-the-sky dreamer

374
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,393
with no practical experience in business.

375
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,703
But his books and his records
would stand up to a tax audit.

376
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,030
Does he have a bookkeeper?

377
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,265
None we could find.

378
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,568
GOREN: And it's not just that.

379
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,542
It's marketing techniques,
the ads and the journals.

380
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,045
It speaks to a professionalism

381
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,875
that's well beyond his grasp.

382
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,090
This kind of professionalism.

383
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,854
"Problems are just solutions in work clothes"

384
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:28,493
"Enthusiasm is the rocket fuel that
propels you up the ladder of success."

385
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,363
"If you think you can, you can."

386
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,699
Matthew's silent partner
is a motivational speaker?

387
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,906
"Don't get what you want. Want what you get."

388
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,307
It's M & H Consulting, Queens, New York.

389
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:50,210
Russell is my cousin on my mother's side.

390
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:55,084
He asked for my advice when he
took over Uncle Leon's business.

391
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,656
So I instructed him

392
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:02,425
on the basics, you know, a
little bookkeeping, marketing.

393
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,899
He took your lessons to heart.

394
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,563
He runs his business in a
very professional manner.

395
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,942
Except in the one respect.

396
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,805
Right. I don't know what got into him.

397
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,642
Greed, for one thing.

398
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,306
That's probably it.

399
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,214
Well, greed only gets you so far.

400
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:26,545
It takes a special kind of
callousness to do what Russell did.

401
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,928
Russell never struck me as especially callous.

402
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,198
You should see what it looks
like behind his crematory.

403
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,337
Half-buried, bloated corpses,

404
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,668
crawling with vermin,
rotting entrails seeping out,

405
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,973
bodies piled one on top of the other,

406
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,915
flesh decaying into each other like a...

407
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,920
Like a putrid soup.

408
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,566
Of course,

409
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,296
those people were dead to begin with.

410
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,803
Like I said, I don't know what got into him.

411
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:23,244
Harry, lunch is ready.

412
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,949
They're detectives.
They're asking about Russell.

413
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,543
Be right there.

414
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,521
That's my wife.

415
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,153
You didn't need her, did you?

416
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,820
- No.
- I didn't think so.

417
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,599
This is a terrific little
workshop you have here.

418
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,406
It's the one thing I miss
about being in the city.

419
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,376
No room for a workshop.

420
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:01,146
No room to, I don't know,
get away from the family.

421
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,981
Well, I don't look to get
away from the family.

422
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,350
Oh, jeez.

423
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,584
Do you mind?

424
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,522
Well,

425
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,993
we'll let you get back to your family.

426
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,968
Thanks for giving us your time, Mr. Rowan.

427
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,371
You okay?

428
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,845
I need to get my hands to the lab.

429
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,038
The lab sent me their analysis

430
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,051
of the clean-up goop from your hands.

431
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,214
It has the same chemical composition

432
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,654
as the fluid found in the boils on Hagman.

433
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,056
Not a conclusive match but
well within the hash marks.

434
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,391
How about that. Not only does Mr.
Harry Rowan have a green thumb,

435
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,397
he has an aptitude for murder.

436
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,460
I think he does it for a living.

437
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,867
His lifestyle, his personality,

438
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,941
his obsessive concentration
on the task at hand.

439
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,480
It fits the profile.

440
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:07,176
So why is a professional hitman
interested in a crematory?

441
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,276
Well, I'd like to say
he was cremating his victims,

442
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,446
but there's no cremation going on.

443
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:18,258
You're cataloging the DNA from the crematory?

444
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,328
Of course.

445
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:26,896
Could you start running it
through the national database?

446
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,073
EAMES: Albert Lundy.

447
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,340
His remains were found buried behind the
crematory and identified through DNA.

448
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,745
He died in October last year.

449
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,840
Which is odd because his DNA

450
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:43,443
matched the DNA found at a murder
scene in Brooklyn three months ago,

451
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,511
under the fingernails of the victim.

452
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:49,286
Lyle Curicelli. He was
found strangled in an alley.

453
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:52,727
Curicelli was in debt to the Masucci family.

454
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,765
His murder was a suspected hit.

455
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,357
The skin samples and the DNA
found under his fingernails

456
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,164
were thought to belong to his assailant.

457
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,897
The DNA belonging to Grandpa Lundy?

458
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,131
GOREN: Right.

459
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,764
Next we have Kenneth Hemmerick.

460
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,105
Mr. Hemmerick died in June, 1999.

461
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:09,009
His DNA turned up in a
blood sample from Newark,

462
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,072
on the body of a bookie James Hurly.

463
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,516
Mr. Hurly was stabbed to
death in January, 2000.

464
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,451
Another suspected Masucci hit.

465
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,614
We found 4 more bodies behind the crematory

466
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,783
whose DNA turned up at Masucci hits.

467
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:26,318
The DNA from the crematory was
harvested from those remains

468
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,763
and then planted on these victims

469
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,301
to mislead the murder investigators

470
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,963
and create reasonable doubt
in the event of a trial.

471
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,904
Harvested and planted by Harry Rowan.

472
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,005
That's our theory.

473
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,613
In the past, the Masuccis
have used two known hitmen.

474
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,081
Frank Curtis,

475
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,947
he's been in federal custody
for a year and a half

476
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,315
and Eddie Ferguson.

477
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,321
He's been missing for the last 6 months,

478
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,620
presumed to be in hiding or to
have fled the jurisdiction.

479
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,883
So Harry picked up the slack.

480
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,659
Well, we don't think he works
exclusively for the Masuccis.

481
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,893
There's a lot of blood on his hands.

482
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,739
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Hi.

483
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,045
What are you doing out here?

484
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,279
Mommy said we need more ice cream.

485
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,255
Ice cream? What do we got in here?

486
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,654
Chocolate!

487
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,327
Or there's Rocky Road.

488
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,454
(GIGGLING)

489
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,554
What do you think?

490
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,963
Chocolate.

491
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:39,069
Chocolate it is.

492
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,133
(GROWLING)

493
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,731
NUNEZ: We got an anonymous phone call
from a concerned jogger.

494
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,132
He said he saw two guys last week

495
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,727
arguing on the Roosevelt Boardwalk.

496
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,898
A couple of days ago, he recognized one
of them from his picture in the papers.

497
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,442
Russell Matthews. He said
the other guy had a goatee.

498
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,704
So we took a look.

499
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,370
Guess what we found caught between the rocks?

500
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,777
Eddie Ferguson.

501
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,314
NUNEZ: Fingerprints confirmed it.

502
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,680
Dead of blunt force trauma to the head.

503
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:28,941
That's not all.

504
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,647
There were hairs caught
under his fingernails.

505
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,213
Same coloration as Russell Matthews.

506
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,259
I obtained a hair sample from Mr. Matthews.

507
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,317
- The hairs matched?
- Yes.

508
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,956
Well, he looks well-preserved.
How long's he been dead?

509
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,398
Without a full autopsy, it's hard to tell.

510
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,129
I'd say a week or two.

511
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,364
I heard Major Case was
looking for a Masucci hitman

512
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,374
that was doing business with
Russell Matthews. Here's your guy.

513
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,967
Nice of him to drop out of the sky like that.

514
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,145
What's this?

515
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,249
Could be a number of things.

516
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,711
Looks like a freezer burn to me.

517
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,648
The hitman who came in from the cold.

518
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,393
RUSSELL: (ON INTERCOM) I'm telling you,
I've never seen this guy before.

519
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,265
I don't know what my hair
is doing on his hands.

520
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,894
Maybe you were in business with Ferguson,

521
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,235
maybe you let him take DNA
from your backyard,

522
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,968
maybe you got in an argument with him.

523
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,771
No, no.

524
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,846
We like this story, Russell.

525
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,513
I mean, unless you have one we like better

526
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:38,752
about your cousin Harry using your
backyard as his own petri dish.

527
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,784
I am not saying anything against Harry.

528
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,159
Who do you think

529
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,925
put your hair under Eddie
Ferguson's fingernails?

530
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,192
Let me get this straight.

531
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,564
You think this whole Ferguson
thing was set up by Harry Rowan?

532
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,433
I don't care. I'm not going against Harry.

533
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:58,274
I've seen Harry go after his own kid brother.

534
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,343
Harry'd kill you and wash his
hands in your own blood.

535
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,579
We'll never get anything out of this mutt.

536
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,549
Did the autopsy on Mr. Ferguson prove

537
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,518
he'd been frozen then thawed?

538
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,577
The autopsy proved when it
comes to medical science,

539
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,453
you're better off asking the Magic 8 Ball.

540
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,993
Any luck on a search
warrant for Rowan's place?

541
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,826
Since the hairs connect the late Mr.
Ferguson to Russell Matthews,

542
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,924
Judge Whitman feels there's
already a viable murder suspect

543
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,993
lying in the morgue on Staten Island.

544
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,595
So Rowan's little ruse paid off.

545
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,662
The guy doesn't leave anything to chance.

546
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,505
Well, chance is probably
what keeps him up at night.

547
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,705
There's no such thing as a margin
of error in his line of work.

548
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,044
Not unless he wants to stay out of jail.

549
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,979
The fear of making a mistake,

550
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:46,813
for him must be overwhelming. Consuming.

551
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,720
Like an itch he can't scratch.

552
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,960
Hi, Ms. Rowan. Let me give you a hand.

553
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,261
You're the detectives
my husband was talking to?

554
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,166
That's right. We need to ask you
about his consulting business.

555
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,570
Well, I'm sure my husband will be happy
to answer all of your questions.

556
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,199
Oh, I'm not sure that he'd want to.

557
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,473
Does he ever talk about his
business travels, his clients?

558
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,638
We have two kids,

559
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,683
so we have plenty to talk
about besides his business.

560
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,776
You ever met his clients?

561
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,683
We have some photos to help you remember.

562
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,223
Eddie Ferguson.

563
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,226
Actually, last time your husband saw him,

564
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,593
this is how he looked.

565
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,598
And then there's James Hurly.

566
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,700
This is Mr. Hurly the last
time he had a business meeting

567
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,432
with your husband.

568
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,742
And this job, Tommy Dunne.

569
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,478
Shotgun blast to the head
while waiting at a stoplight.

570
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,707
Why are you showing me this?

571
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,681
This is what your husband does for a living.

572
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,342
He kills people.

573
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,715
This is how he paid for this car,

574
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,787
for your house, for the Florida condo.

575
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,350
It's not true.

576
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,394
Okay, you ask your husband.

577
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,464
You show him these and then ask him.

578
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,466
That day that we came over,

579
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:17,377
did you notice that he didn't want you around

580
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,473
when he was talking to us?

581
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,752
You ask him. If he's got nothing to hide,

582
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,321
then why is he afraid
to talk to us in front of you?

583
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,672
We got your message. But I bet my partner...

584
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,834
We came here to return these.

585
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,874
Stop harassing my family.

586
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,875
Do we understand each other?

587
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:59,412
You're not gonna stay and
talk, clear the air?

588
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,424
What did I tell you, Ms. Rowan?

589
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,821
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

590
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,200
We can go in there.

591
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,671
You can wait right here and see everything.

592
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,648
After you.

593
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,198
Let's start with a softball.

594
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,570
The Saturday night before
Easter, where were you?

595
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,476
I was stuck on the Taconic.

596
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,239
Where had you been?

597
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,338
Scouting an industrial park in Ossining.

598
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:02,278
We'll want a list of your clients.
Your consulting clients.

599
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,957
Do you read the Bible, Mr. Rowan?

600
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,090
Not much.

601
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,230
Exodus 9:8. The Sixth Plague.

602
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,829
This

603
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,673
Was very...

604
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,241
It was a very elegant

605
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,244
and inspired staging.

606
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,919
I'm looking at this as a professional.

607
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:42,557
What's most impressive
is the attention to detail.

608
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,460
The posing of the body,

609
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,691
the reddening of the skin with a torch,

610
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,428
the injection of mineral spirit,

611
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,401
propylene glycol, lanolin.

612
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:59,169
It's the same composition as your
hand cleaner in your little workshop.

613
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,910
The same careful planning
went into these crimes.

614
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,347
The timing,

615
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,382
lack of forensic evidence,

616
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,348
except of course,

617
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,192
for what the perpetrator
chose to leave behind.

618
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,464
And this is where I step back in awe.

619
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,362
The planting of the DNA

620
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:27,062
and the harvesting from human remains.

621
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,599
You know, as a pre-emptive measure.

622
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,933
It's a...

623
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,535
It's a stroke of genius.

624
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,646
I mean, watching the police fumbling around

625
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:44,553
must've been tremendous fun

626
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,979
for the perpetrator, don't you think?

627
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,057
Speaking as a concerned citizen,

628
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,530
I wish the police were half as capable

629
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,761
as this fellow seems to be.

630
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,205
(STUTTERING)
Oh, everyone

631
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,872
wants us to think that Eddie
Ferguson is this fellow,

632
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:11,444
but we think that Eddie was
killed by, you know, this fellow.

633
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,946
Killed 6 months ago and kept in a freezer.

634
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,483
The reality is in this fellow's line of work,

635
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:22,054
you live with the knowledge
that the smallest thing

636
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,555
can give you away.

637
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,865
Things like this freezer burn
right here on Eddie's shoulder.

638
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,898
I mean, that tells us that

639
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,345
whatever Eddie was wrapped in

640
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,047
got loose

641
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:52,955
or torn.

642
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:57,756
Just a small mistake to remind
us that no one's perfect.

643
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,209
Not that most of us need reminding.

644
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,485
Excuse me.

645
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,405
Why is he talking to my wife?

646
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,945
I don't know.

647
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,670
- Porcelain cap?
- Yeah.

648
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,183
Like from a tooth.

649
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,184
You don't remember seeing it in the garage?

650
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,160
Mr. Rowan,

651
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,796
thank you so much for coming in.

652
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,960
The officers will show you downstairs.

653
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,549
He said a porcelain cap, like for a tooth.

654
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,141
Why would he ask me that, Harry?

655
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,743
- What else did he say?
- Harry.

656
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,015
What else, Susan?

657
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,522
He wanted to know if the kids
would be home tomorrow morning.

658
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,820
I told him they'd be at school.
Harry, what is going on?

659
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,121
Just get in the car.

660
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,795
One search warrant. Limited to the garage.

661
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,861
Give me a chance to call
home, and I'll go with you.

662
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,067
We're not executing the warrant tonight.

663
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,577
We want to make sure that Harry
Rowan gets a good night's rest.

664
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,150
What did you find out?

665
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,080
Can we fight it?

666
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,685
You are my lawyer, you tell me.

667
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:11,886
Okay.

668
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,488
Okay.

669
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,990
Yes, I have an idea when they'll be here.

670
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,945
(GRUNTING)

671
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,636
Harry.

672
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,340
It's late.

673
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,043
What're you doing?

674
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,542
Go to bed, Susan.

675
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,145
Go to bed!

676
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,541
You didn't find it, did you?

677
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,245
The porcelain cap.

678
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:53,086
You told him I asked you about it?

679
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,013
Yes, but...

680
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,188
I don't understand.

681
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,055
The porcelain cap

682
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,225
that fell out of Eddie Ferguson's mouth

683
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,032
through the tear in the plastic
that you wrapped him in

684
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:14,301
before stuffing him

685
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,305
into the freezer six months ago

686
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:24,015
right next to the leg of lamb
and the Rocky Road ice cream.

687
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,652
Oh, my God.

688
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,652
Oh, my God, Harry. What did you do?

689
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,855
How long do you think it'll
take us to find it, Harry?

690
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,888
It's not here.

691
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,591
It can't be here. I looked.

692
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,494
I didn't make a mistake.

693
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,532
Sounds like an admission of guilt to me.

694
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,976
Harry Rowan, you're under arrest for murder.

695
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,784
A costly mistake.

696
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,328
Harry didn't make a mistake.

697
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,729
Eddie Ferguson doesn't wear caps.
