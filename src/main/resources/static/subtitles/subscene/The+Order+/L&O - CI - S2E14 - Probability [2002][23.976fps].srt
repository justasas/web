1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,320
I quit years ago.

2
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,990
Watching my old man die
of lung cancer cured me.

3
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll see what shows up on the blood tests.

4
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,901
Thank you, Mr. Gergis.

5
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,216
I did okay, huh?

6
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,415
Sure.

7
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:50,251
You remember, you call me
every couple of weeks.

8
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,695
You let me know how you're doing.

9
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,894
Not here.

10
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,160
Wait till you get outside.

11
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,775
Tell Elaine it's for her.

12
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,117
Leo, where did you get this?

13
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,091
I earned it from medical research.

14
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,192
They took my blood.

15
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,890
Hey, they paid me $1,000.

16
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,834
Ben, I got my ring out of hock.

17
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,877
Hey, tell Elaine all I want is a chance, huh?

18
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,909
I gotta tap a kidney. You wait for me?

19
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,993
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,492
I wanted to see you, Ricky.

21
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,962
I don't have your number.

22
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,499
It's a nice cologne, Dad.
Look, if you're looking for money...

23
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:05,503
No, no, Ricky, no. Here.

24
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,729
It's not much.

25
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,639
I'm gonna make things up to you.

26
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,412
Okay, look,

27
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,118
catch up with your friends,
treat them to a slice,

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,653
and get yourself a CD or something.

29
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,161
Another chance with $300?

30
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,923
Do you know that he showed up
at Rick's campus today?

31
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,160
What happens if he decides
to visit Emmy at her school?

32
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,669
He's my brother. I'll tell him to back off.

33
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,865
You tell him that if he
comes near the kids again,

34
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,340
I'm gonna have him thrown in jail.

35
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,335
What should I do?

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,971
I wanna come home, Ben.
I wanna take care of her.

37
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,676
Well, you got nothing to offer, Leo.

38
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,513
Why don't you hit up those researchers?

39
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,523
Well, if they can afford one grand,
they can afford 10, it's...

40
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,751
I'll see you around, Leo.

41
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,494
Oh, hi.

42
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,161
I thought I got the address wrong.

43
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,035
Sorry I had to bother you.

44
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,599
Hey, well, that makes two of us, buddy.

45
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,459
Morning shift found him crushed in here.

46
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,020
He tried to slip through
and then the gate opened.

47
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,300
Well, didn't anyone hear him scream?

48
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,269
The gate's pretty loud.

49
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,748
Hey, one of you guys got the time?

50
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,346
8:30.

51
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,314
They heard you just fine.

52
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,983
Maybe, they didn't hear him
scream because he didn't scream,

53
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,120
'cause he was already dead.

54
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,892
Latent ID'd him as Leo Gergis, 48.

55
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,201
He has a record of panhandling and vagrancy.

56
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,597
There's a preliminary
finding of accidental death.

57
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,041
The gate caught him on the
right side of the head,

58
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,636
but most of the trauma is on the left.

59
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,272
Look at this. St. Victor's.

60
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,748
The homeless shelter in Brooklyn.

61
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,286
It's a long way from Hunts Point.

62
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,844
He was married.

63
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,929
There's... There's no tan line on his finger.

64
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,830
Maybe he just started wearing it.

65
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,934
The gold is tarnished.

66
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,530
There's a thin line across the band.

67
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,300
Someone tied a string around it.

68
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,176
Maybe a pawnbroker's tag.

69
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,684
Somehow he had the money
to get it out of hock.

70
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,617
You know, when you live in a shelter,

71
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,524
you learn not to hide things

72
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,825
in your socks, your pockets, your pants.

73
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,643
You know, I've always wanted a jacket like that.

74
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,410
Well, maybe we can find out
where Leo got his.

75
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,147
How did it happen?

76
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,345
We're not sure. Had you seen him recently?

77
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,682
No, no, well, not since he crashed

78
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,054
my son's high school graduation.

79
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,421
When they found him, he was wearing this.

80
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,293
Do you recognize it?

81
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,262
Yeah. He was wearing this?

82
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,173
Did he have any reason to think
you were getting back together?

83
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,641
No, I didn't give him any.

84
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,002
How about you, Mr. Gergis?

85
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,774
Did your brother say anything to you?

86
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,976
Well, a couple of weeks ago,
he gave me $300 for Elaine,

87
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,144
and he gave my nephew $100.

88
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,586
He thought he could buy his
way back into the family.

89
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,624
We found another $500 on him.

90
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,716
You have any idea where he got that money?

91
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,091
He said something about giving blood.

92
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,555
Well, you don't make that
kind of money selling blood.

93
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,360
Well, then I don't know!

94
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,061
He... Maybe he had some scam going.

95
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,730
He used to be marketing
director for a cruise line.

96
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,966
He... He was no idiot.

97
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,633
He couldn't take care of his family,

98
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,610
but he damn well took care of his own needs.

99
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,346
We hold their stuff for 3 months

100
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,546
and then it goes to Goodwill.

101
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:27,058
Here's Leo's stuff. Oh, sorry, here.

102
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,055
Oh, no, that's okay. I'm better without.

103
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,863
Leo knew his mustard.

104
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,698
These look like they're from a hotel.

105
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,871
Well, he bought these.

106
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,068
Tax stamps are still on them.

107
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,378
Maybe he bought them for a friend.

108
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:53,146
I mean, there was no nicotine
on Leo's fingers or his teeth.

109
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,646
He doesn't smoke.

110
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,259
Leo's buddies, any of them smoke this brand?

111
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:06,229
Filtered, yeah. There's Johnny,
Johnny Dikins.

112
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,997
I haven't seen him here in a month.

113
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,093
He left his stuff behind.

114
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,171
John Dikins, age 45.

115
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,870
DOA a month ago. Finding of accidental death.

116
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,412
Next time, call first.

117
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,072
I'm supposed to be on my lunch break.

118
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,706
You get a lunch break?

119
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,879
All right, he fell through the
floor of an abandoned building.

120
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,421
Autopsy found blunt force
trauma to the second

121
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,854
and third vertebrae.

122
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,289
Broken neck. Do it to you every time.

123
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,917
Apparently, so does being homeless.

124
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,586
Two deaths by blunt force trauma

125
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,652
consistent with freak accident.

126
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,462
Yeah, and two victims in their
late 40s, both in good health.

127
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,834
How many cases with this
profile in the last 12 months,

128
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,434
in all five boroughs, men and women?

129
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,943
Here's another.

130
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,314
Death from accidental overdose, pass.

131
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,153
Death from exposure, pass.

132
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,329
Here we go. Lisa Fitterman,
female, Caucasian,

133
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,922
slip and fall down the stairs
at 59th Street station.

134
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,730
Head injuries, 46-year-old vagrant.

135
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,799
That's 14.

136
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,404
Right. Yeah.

137
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,510
Fourteen homeless people.

138
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,381
Male, female, all Caucasian,

139
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,383
all between the ages of 45 and 55.

140
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,552
All in, you know, reasonably good health.

141
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,821
All of them dead

142
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,663
from injuries that include
a massive blow to the head.

143
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,439
Someone's killing the great bums of New York.

144
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,911
There's a call on your direct line.

145
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,970
He said it's about a
client, someone named Leo.

146
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,917
Jack Bernard. How can I help you?

147
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,324
I'm not sure I can do that.

148
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,485
I have associates. I'll talk to them.

149
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,291
I... No, you give me a number.

150
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,265
I... Just... Hello?

151
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,137
I'll be back in 10.

152
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,915
Nothing's jumping out.

153
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,818
The deaths were already factored
into the Compstat mortality report.

154
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,824
If there was a pattern, the
computer would've picked it up.

155
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,620
Well, maybe not. These deaths
are scattered across precincts.

156
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,255
Sometimes 2 weeks apart, sometimes 2 months.

157
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,059
Different times, different days of the week.

158
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,124
I don't see a motive here.

159
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,003
If it's random, maybe
it's because it is random.

160
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:07,901
If these were random, the law of
averages says there'd be coincidences

161
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,280
with the times or the locations.

162
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,715
The fact there are no coincidences
means somebody's working very hard

163
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,117
at not setting off alarm bells.

164
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,846
Leo is your freshest trail. Start with him.

165
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:18,912
In the works.

166
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,924
We're tracking the lot
numbers on the mustard jars

167
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,391
in his knapsack.

168
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,297
Sophia, these detectives wanna talk to you

169
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,526
about the needle you found
in Mr. Gergis' trash.

170
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,697
It was very small,

171
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,703
with a little rubber tube on it.

172
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,299
Sounds like the kind
used to take blood samples.

173
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,804
Did you find anything else in the trash?

174
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,371
There was these sticky square things

175
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,516
and little strips of paper.

176
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,686
Electrocardiogram.

177
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,687
Leo had a physical.

178
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,894
Now why would somebody get a
physical in a hotel room?

179
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,764
Now, we ran all 14 victims

180
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,535
through the insurance
Medical Information Bureau.

181
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,770
They were all insured for a million bucks

182
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,709
under "keyman" policies.

183
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,979
The Atlantic Union Insurance
Company, they thought

184
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,881
that they were insuring the
vice president of finances

185
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,784
for Compagnie Fiduciaire Elysée of France.

186
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,151
Trans-State Insurance thinks Johnny
was the director of marketing

187
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,719
for Compagnie Immobiliére Concorde in Paris.

188
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,095
Somebody passed them off
as corporate honchos.

189
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,692
Working for French companies that are
the beneficiaries of the policies.

190
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,238
Let me guess. The companies were bogus.

191
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,706
Yeah, someone is recruiting these people,

192
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,436
cleaning them up,

193
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,771
and getting them a checkup.

194
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,370
And then when the policy is enforced,

195
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,778
they kill them to look like an accident.

196
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:55,149
At a million bucks a pop, why
didn't the insurers notice a trend?

197
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,323
Well, the scheme was designed
to avoid detection by using

198
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,292
different underwriters and
actuaries, submitting policies

199
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,350
under brokers' names without their knowledge.

200
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,556
Yeah, I wonder how many
homeless are walking around

201
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,155
with a price on their head.

202
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,167
Find out while you can still
do something about it.

203
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,759
This perp must have left tracks.

204
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,533
We don't know enough about
insurance companies,

205
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,235
so they're sending us an expert.

206
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,593
You play the piano, Mr. Stevens?

207
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,963
Your fingers...

208
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,500
I taught myself.

209
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,735
Moving my fingers like this relaxes me.

210
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,110
Your work makes you tense?

211
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,808
It stimulates me, looking for fraud,

212
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,781
looking for falsehoods.

213
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,079
They always betray themselves.

214
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,887
The man you're looking for got
his training at Hartford State.

215
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,660
You figured that out just by
glancing at this material?

216
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,428
So he learned something at Hartford State

217
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,697
that he used to commit the crimes.

218
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,667
Maybe he took classes in statistics.

219
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,543
Colonial New England sponsors
a course in actuarial studies

220
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,138
at Hartford State.

221
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:35,084
The instructor uses an idiosyncratic
approach to probability analysis.

222
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,611
Your man used that approach to
manipulate the variables of each crime

223
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,419
to avoid detection.

224
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,191
These four, what's the common thread?

225
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,036
Well, he's familiar with
industrial insurance.

226
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,541
These cases, Dikins and Sher,

227
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,943
displayed proprietary knowledge
specific to two insurers,

228
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,447
Ohio Mutual and National Colonial.

229
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,313
Our man worked for one of them.

230
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,249
Or it's a coincidence.

231
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,513
Well, no such thing. No.

232
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,284
The more intricate the apparent pattern,

233
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,121
the simpler the underlying reality.

234
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,922
Chaos Theory.

235
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,631
What else can you see?

236
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,068
He did a stint with an international firm.

237
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,368
Because he knew how

238
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,101
to file incorporation papers for
the phony French companies.

239
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,340
Yes.

240
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,117
This is really great.

241
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,753
That completes his skill set.
Other than that,

242
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,817
I can't help you.

243
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,562
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

244
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,504
I didn't know you had
an older, geekier brother.

245
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,813
How was your flight?

246
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,617
Turbulent. Everything connected
with this business is turbulent.

247
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,214
It's dishwater.

248
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,295
Will you tell me why you need this?

249
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,164
We're not involved in each other's
private business anymore.

250
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,270
You made the rules, remember?

251
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,286
This guy worked for Ohio
Mutual from '88 to '93.

252
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,686
Specialized in employee benefits.

253
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,281
He interned at Lloyd's of London in the '70s.

254
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,384
Now, that's two markers.

255
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,359
That's it. Two out of five markers.

256
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,865
Maybe there are no perfect matches.

257
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:07,830
Maybe there are two people who
together have the required skill set.

258
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,300
Maybe I'm starting to sound
like your little buddy.

259
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,371
There is one marker
that Wally Stevens forgot.

260
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,115
That not only did our guy
recruit homeless people,

261
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,677
he had to find them again
when it was time to kill them.

262
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,520
Now,

263
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,452
that wouldn't be easy unless
you worked with the homeless.

264
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,495
Insurance guys love
to give each other awards,

265
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,054
especially for their humanitarian work.

266
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,000
Their trade association newsletter
might have something about it.

267
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,601
The Dominion Award for Civic Action.

268
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,732
Looks like there are 3
people in the last 10 years

269
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,275
who won for their work with the homeless.

270
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,744
This guy looks old enough to be
Wally's grandfather. But this guy,

271
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,973
he looks in good shape.

272
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:53,210
He might know his way around
a blunt instrument.

273
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,616
Jack Bernard.

274
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,778
Now, he sounds familiar.

275
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,345
He got the award five years ago,

276
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,756
"For tireless efforts
on behalf of the homeless."

277
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,123
Back then, he worked for National Colonial.

278
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,992
That's one of the companies Wally mentioned.

279
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,156
That's two markers.

280
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,357
Three.

281
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,401
He grew up in Hartford,
went to Hartford State.

282
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,493
He's gonna wish he stayed.

283
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,168
Mr. Bernard, it's the police.

284
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,109
There's a light on around back.

285
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,053
Gas.

286
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,192
There's somebody on the floor in there.

287
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,719
He's dead.

288
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,635
According to his passport, he
hasn't been out of the country

289
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,466
in 3 years. I don't see how he picked up

290
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,528
those insurance checks in Paris.

291
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,235
Yeah, this room doesn't fit.

292
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,008
He's got this expensive furniture

293
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,810
and then these cheap posters on the wall.

294
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,284
I mean, look at this stereo.
What's that worth? Maybe $150.

295
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,879
And then this dining room set is worth

296
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,988
about $10,000.

297
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,187
Maybe he has a friend
in the furniture business.

298
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,293
Well, all this stuff is from
Faubourg Saint-Louis showroom.

299
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:55,069
Maybe his friend in the
furniture business is French.

300
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,701
I haven't worked for that
furniture company in 2 years.

301
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,713
Why are you bothering me
with this ancient history?

302
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,545
You were personnel director
until they fired you.

303
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,209
I was not fired.

304
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,381
No, see, the company said
they fired you two years ago

305
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,824
for taking kickbacks from an
insurance broker, Jack Bernard.

306
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,122
All these ridiculous accusations.

307
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:22,189
Have you ever heard of the
Compagnie Fiduciaire Elysee?

308
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,827
No, must be your pronunciation.

309
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,426
Yeah, it must be,

310
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,597
because the Interpol found your fingerprints

311
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,663
on incorporation papers

312
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,036
from that company.

313
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,546
Your client and Mr. Bernard
took their initial scam

314
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,708
and kicked it up a couple notches.

315
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:43,982
They insured homeless people as key
executives of bogus French companies

316
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,286
and then they killed them
for the insurance money.

317
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,666
My client denies any
complicity in this scheme.

318
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,137
But she may know of other victims

319
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,903
that Mr. Bernard has insured and is
planning on killing in the future.

320
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,410
How many? Un? Deux? Trois?

321
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,913
Deux.

322
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:23,888
Well, we certainly don't want Mr.
Bernard killing any more people.

323
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,130
Let's hear her story.

324
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,789
Off the record.

325
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,097
I didn't know Jack was going
to kill anyone, okay?

326
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,333
He didn't explain it to me until
after the first person died,

327
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,466
and then I was afraid. I had to go along.

328
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,805
Yeah, I can imagine.

329
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,276
It's true. He picked the victims.

330
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,710
He decided when to kill them.

331
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,112
And what, you just held his coat?

332
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,276
I just set up the companies.

333
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,617
I collected the checks, and I kept the
policies in a deposit box. That's it.

334
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,593
$14,000,000. $14,000,000!

335
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,493
Where is it?

336
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,291
Supposed to be in a bank in the Caymans,

337
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,333
but Jack emptied all the accounts.

338
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,463
He ripped me off.

339
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,801
So why is it that you think he
is the one who took the money?

340
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,537
Of course he's the one.

341
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,636
Last man he killed, he
rushed me to go to Paris

342
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,009
to pick up the insurance checks.

343
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,412
The $1,000,000 for Leo Gergis?

344
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,349
That's right. Jack wanted an
accountant's check straight away.

345
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,886
He wouldn't tell me why.

346
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,354
I should've known then
he was going to betray me.

347
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,252
The other names of the homeless.

348
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,565
She didn't kill him. She
doesn't even know he was dead.

349
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,536
Not to mention, the missing $14,000,000.

350
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,074
It's not anywhere Bernard had access to.

351
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,267
What about mademoiselle?

352
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,208
Same story. We had her safe
deposit box opened.

353
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,939
It was just insurance policies.

354
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,378
So there's a third musketeer,

355
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,416
who killed Bernard and took the money.

356
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,849
What sunny part of the world do
you wanna start looking for him?

357
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,511
Look who's here.

358
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,512
The insurance companies sent him
to help us recoup their money.

359
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,224
- Hello, Mr. Stevens.
- You arrested someone.

360
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,025
- That's right.
- Did you find the money?

361
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,692
- Not yet.
- Haven't they told you where it is?

362
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,790
Apparently, they don't know.

363
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:11,891
Well, how is that possible?

364
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,193
We'll find out.

365
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,533
How are you going to find out?

366
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,539
My partner would love to explain it to you.

367
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,599
I've got work to do.

368
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,840
Mr. Stevens, why don't we just go in here.

369
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,711
Right in there.

370
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,320
I offended her.

371
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,380
Well, she was uncomfortable.

372
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,222
She thought that you were staring at her.

373
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,093
I gave her too much eye contact.

374
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:43,166
I try to watch myself,
but sometimes I forget.

375
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,332
Well, you were preoccupied with the money.

376
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:49,464
My employers are very
concerned about the money.

377
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,236
Well, there's no trace of it.

378
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,337
The man who engineered the plan

379
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,972
and did the killings is dead.

380
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,913
We arrested his girlfriend.

381
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,884
Well, she probably has the money.

382
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,580
Women like money.

383
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,988
So do men.

384
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,356
That's because women like men with money.

385
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,571
This is everything we have on the case.

386
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:26,599
They were planning on killing
2 more people, 16 total.

387
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,574
I haven't figured out the pattern yet.

388
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,913
Just because things are in
physical or temporal proximity

389
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,478
doesn't mean they're connected.

390
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,819
What, now you're saying
that there are coincidences?

391
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,351
No. A coincidence is two unrelated events

392
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,024
that appear alike,
happening at the same time.

393
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,967
Two brothers dying in two car
accidents on the same day.

394
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,403
Yes, but if you look
at those two events carefully,

395
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,437
there are more differences between
them than there are similarities.

396
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,340
They're not really alike.

397
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,847
Excuse me.

398
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,413
If I look at someone when I talk to them

399
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,980
for more than two thirds of
the time, I seem aggressive.

400
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:20,130
But if I look at them for less
than one third of the time,

401
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,823
I seem dishonest.

402
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,359
I'm still practicing this.

403
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,777
You 2 looked like you
were having so much fun.

404
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,749
Oh, he's an interesting man.

405
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,480
These are the insurance policies

406
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,522
from the French girl's safe deposit box.

407
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,057
Leo Gergis' policy had a letter attached.

408
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,491
It's from the insurance company.

409
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,728
"The medical exam revealed the
presence of a heart murmur.

410
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,735
"Mr. Gergis contacted us by phone

411
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,501
"and informed us he had
a congenital heart condition.

412
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,706
"As a result, we attached
a rider to the policy

413
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,005
"to cover this preexisting condition."

414
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,069
Gergis called them by phone, out of the blue?

415
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,580
This homeless guy?

416
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,514
Doesn't make sense.

417
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,012
Or someone else pretending to be Gergis.

418
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,716
Jack Bernard or the guy who killed him?

419
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,553
Well, I mean, Jack wouldn't
know his full medical history.

420
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,363
But you know who would?

421
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,371
Did you know your brother
had a heart condition?

422
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,431
Yes. He was born with it. What
does that have to do with anything?

423
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,909
Did you ever talk to an
insurance company about it?

424
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,173
About his heart condition?
No.

425
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,144
Why? What happened?

426
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,151
Someone took out insurance
on your ex-husband,

427
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,081
a million dollars' worth,
and then they killed him.

428
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:55,148
You see, it was an opportunity
that they couldn't resist.

429
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,996
But his death wasn't a total
waste, was it, Mr. Gergis?

430
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,728
Of course it was. His death, his life,

431
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,599
it was just a waste.

432
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,433
His kids wouldn't agree.

433
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,338
Thanks to the insurance, they
both have a college fund.

434
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,904
Oh, your brother-in-law didn't tell you?

435
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,711
He set up a trust fund for a
million dollars in their names.

436
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:28,552
It didn't take a lot of detective
work to figure that out.

437
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,886
Ben, what are they saying?

438
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,122
You took insurance out on Leo?

439
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:36,132
No. No, but he found out who did.

440
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,665
And after Leo was killed,

441
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,930
he blackmailed them
into giving him the money.

442
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,835
How did you figure it out, Mr. Gergis?

443
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,608
You got a hold of the guys
who did the medical exam?

444
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,377
Is that how you found Jack Bernard?

445
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,941
I never thought they would kill him.

446
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:59,615
I thought they had some
other kind of scam going.

447
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,421
But once Leo was dead, you thought
you'd do something for your family.

448
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,860
He never took responsibility.

449
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,898
When did Jack give you the money?

450
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,492
Friday, a week ago.

451
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,368
Was he alone?

452
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,440
Yes.

453
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:28,016
He seemed pretty jumpy. He kept asking me

454
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,049
who I had talked to about Leo.

455
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,349
Meaning the police?

456
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:35,949
No. He wanted to know about other people.

457
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,721
Other people?

458
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,326
Other people connected to the scheme?

459
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,458
What, he didn't want them
to find out about Leo?

460
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,662
That's the impression I got.

461
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,002
That he was trying to pull
a fast one on them.

462
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,140
The girl already knew about Leo.

463
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,447
Jack had another partner.
That's who he was worried about.

464
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,125
Leo wasn't part of the original plan.

465
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,488
The plan wasn't to kill
16 people. It was to kill 15.

466
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,861
Leo was Jack's pet project.

467
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,529
Jack got greedy.

468
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,702
And Jack got himself killed.

469
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:30,842
Progress?

470
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,547
Looking for the third musketeer.

471
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:47,156
Leo Gergis, he skews the whole design.

472
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,893
Look, he was the only one
that was killed within a month

473
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,332
of the policies being issued.

474
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,735
And he was the only one that was
found dead in an industrial zone.

475
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,330
You take him out and...

476
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,638
Well, patterns become clear.

477
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,742
The days that the bodies were
found, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

478
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,876
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. And the blocks

479
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,820
that the bodies were left on.

480
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:18,327
The 500 block, the 400 block, the
600, the 300, the 700 block.

481
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:22,559
Minus one, plus two,
minus three, plus four.

482
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,168
Dozens of small patterns.

483
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,862
I'm finding dozens of small patterns.

484
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,873
Jack Bernard thought of this?

485
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,203
No.

486
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:35,541
The one time that he tried
to set up a kill on his own,

487
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,013
he botched it and Jack doesn't
have the skill set to do this.

488
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,675
Maybe his computer did.

489
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,565
I'd hate to see what the assistant
chief adjuster's office looks like.

490
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,803
This is how Wally likes it.

491
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,346
- It's out of the way, huh?
- That's right.

492
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,177
Wally's not much of a people person,

493
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,581
but set him loose on a claim...

494
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:16,953
He has kids.

495
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,919
Hope springs eternal.

496
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,389
You notice the windows?

497
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,824
Mmm-hmm, different windows.

498
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,355
Different houses.

499
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,292
And that shadow there,

500
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,562
that one was taken from a car.

501
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,664
Did Wally move recently?

502
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,264
I don't think so.

503
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,332
He's still with his wife and kids?

504
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,108
If he wasn't, I think he
would've mentioned something.

505
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,136
Our hunch was right. Wally's divorced,

506
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:20,581
as of 2 years ago. His wife
remarried 6 months later.

507
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,884
Remarried well, judging by
the house in the photo.

508
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:28,984
She's a paralegal. She married
one of the partners at her firm.

509
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,391
She got a restraining order against Wally.

510
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,021
He was showing up at her house
every week with flowers,

511
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,996
asking when she was coming home.

512
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,897
Mr. Stevens was humiliated.

513
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,095
No wonder he didn't tell his coworkers.

514
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,405
It wouldn't have occurred to him to tell them.

515
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:46,375
Has it occurred to you, you're looking
for something that's not there?

516
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:57,812
"Symptoms include the need to
create and duplicate patterns.

517
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,114
"impairment of nonverbal behavior,
such as eye-to-eye gaze.

518
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,989
"inflexible adherence to routines,

519
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,029
"often coupled with high intelligence

520
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:09,725
"and a tendency to become preoccupied
with a particular subject."

521
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,734
What are you describing?

522
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,565
Asperger's syndrome.

523
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:18,305
It's a high functioning form of autism.

524
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,276
It's why Wally Stevens can't empathize.

525
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,404
It's why he can't connect.

526
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,972
It's why this pattern is in there.

527
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,686
Time

528
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,329
and space.

529
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,300
These are the first five people

530
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,777
who were insured in sequence.

531
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,622
There, this is the pattern.

532
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,399
And the same pattern for the next five.

533
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,269
And the next five.

534
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,009
That leaves one pattern unfinished.

535
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,911
It's very visual.

536
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,440
Juries like visuals. I wish we could
show them the missing millions

537
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,647
in Mr. Stevens' possession
or anything, for that matter,

538
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,281
beyond these abstractions.

539
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,625
Does Weehawken sound abstract to you?

540
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,354
Hey. Sorry to barge in on you so late.

541
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,420
Something came up. We
wanted to run it by you.

542
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,894
Have you had dinner yet?

543
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,400
I was going to heat something up.

544
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,993
Hope you like Chinese food.

545
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,867
Yes. Yes, I do.

546
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,405
We'll need plates.

547
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,434
We would've come by earlier, but
my partner had to look at houses.

548
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,673
Yeah, I'm gonna buy.

549
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,708
I like this place.

550
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,444
Looks like you got a lot of rooms.

551
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,645
Aren't you gonna ask me where I'm looking?

552
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,745
- Where are you looking?
- Whitestone.

553
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,949
It's where my parents grew up.

554
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,856
My partner's very sentimental.

555
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,155
Well, it's what I can afford.

556
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,895
What made you pick this house?

557
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:57,934
I don't know. My wife picked it.

558
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:02,236
I noticed that there's a
grocery store around the corner.

559
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,966
Yes, it's very convenient.

560
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,566
That's what I need, you know, a deli.

561
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,405
Something like that. Yeah,
just in walking distance.

562
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,913
I like the one you looked at today.

563
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,149
Off Francis Louis Boulevard.

564
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,116
It's near Beachhurst.

565
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,785
I'm not sure if I saw any
delis around there though.

566
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,415
There's a deli on 154th Street.

567
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,491
Hey, can I write that down?

568
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,935
Could you show me where? Sorry.

569
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,072
One egg roll or two?

570
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,198
One.

571
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,637
Please. Thank you.

572
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,789
Bach-ing it tonight, huh?

573
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,084
Wife out with the kids?

574
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,920
Yes, they're out.

575
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:01,063
You know what, you should...
You should ask him.

576
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,530
I bet he knows.

577
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,866
My brother moved into a
new house two months ago,

578
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:11,840
and I'm sure I'm gonna
get lost getting there.

579
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,376
It's off 495, Exit 2.

580
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,502
Weehawken.

581
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,804
Yes, Palisade Avenue.

582
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,613
He says I take a right turn
and go under a bridge and...

583
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:24,950
The bridge is to the left. Palisade
Avenue is three miles to the left.

584
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,853
Oh, I better mark this down before I forget.

585
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,627
I have no sense of direction.

586
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,492
Do you mind?

587
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,997
Well, I wonder where that
wife of yours is, huh?

588
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:45,370
It's getting late.

589
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,773
She's out.

590
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,070
She's not out. She's gone.

591
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,369
She'll be back.

592
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,008
Sure, soon as she divorces
that rich lawyer she married.

593
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,010
But that's not gonna happen,

594
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,858
'cause women like money.

595
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,261
Isn't that what you said?
"Women like men with money."

596
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,886
And you don't have any money.

597
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,555
No. No, I don't.

598
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,632
Not even, let's say, $15,000,000?

599
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,032
I don't have $15,000,000.

600
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,331
How about $13,000,000?

601
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,497
I don't have $15,000,000.
I don't have that money.

602
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,006
Yes, you do.

603
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,936
Because it's the only way you
know how to get your wife back.

604
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:28,707
Because you could never offer
her what she really wanted,

605
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,480
offer her a real relationship.

606
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,716
No. I'm a good husband.
I'm loyal. I pay the bills.

607
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,086
Obviously it wasn't enough,

608
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,126
so you hooked up with Jack Bernard.

609
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,389
I'm a good husband. I did not kill anybody.

610
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,023
He had the inside track on the
homeless, the French girlfriend.

611
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,567
And all you had was

612
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,532
sheer analytical genius.

613
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,631
I didn't kill anybody. Not me.

614
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,936
Yes, you did, Wally.

615
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,671
You left your mark all over the scheme.

616
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:01,017
The piece of music that
you play, over and over.

617
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,982
Five bars, each with five notes.

618
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,251
You like the number five.

619
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,390
Five toes, five fingers, five photos.

620
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,664
And the pattern that you make with them.

621
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,335
And these dishes...

622
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,803
But you're not aware of it.

623
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,748
But can you see it now?

624
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:38,953
No matter how hard you strive for chaos, it

625
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,092
always comes out like this.

626
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,302
I didn't kill anybody.

627
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,245
You can't connect me to this.

628
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,943
I'm not a killer. You can't connect me.

629
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,563
You connected yourself.

630
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,630
You're very thorough.

631
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,395
You scouted each place

632
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,339
where you would dump the bodies.

633
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,040
That's why you know Whitestone so well.

634
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,306
And Weehawken. They're where you
planned to dump the other two victims

635
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,574
you never got around to killing.

636
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,451
Don't you remember? You told
us when you met us.

637
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,481
"They always betray themselves."

638
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,400
Why would I do that?

639
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,808
Why would I keep making this
pattern? I wouldn't do that.

640
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,173
Because you can't help yourself.

641
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,248
Because you don't know.

642
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,913
I wouldn't do that.

643
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,245
Look, I...

644
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,155
I photocopied this for you.

645
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:32,324
They only started diagnosing
Asperger's in 1994.

646
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,768
You would have been too old by then.

647
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,664
It's why you make patterns.

648
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,610
It's why you're not very good with people

649
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,281
and your wife left you.

650
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,653
Oh. Oh.

651
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,655
It's me. That's me.

652
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,767
Why didn't somebody tell me?

653
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:09,168
Why... Why didn't they...
Why didn't they tell me?

654
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:17,839
Nothing is the same since they left.

655
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,506
Nothing is the same since they left.

656
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,413
I want everything to be the same.

657
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,782
I want everything to be the same.

658
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:33,828
The house is so empty.
This house is so empty.

659
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:41,934
Nothing's the same. Nothing's the same.

660
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,708
As soon as his lawyer gets here,

661
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,305
he wants to make a full statement.

662
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,476
To think his murders almost went undetected.

663
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,541
Well, his murders did.

664
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,348
It was Jack Bernard's that didn't.

665
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,116
Criminal mastermind.

666
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,283
They don't make them like they used to.

667
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,526
I'm sure he'd like a pen pal.
