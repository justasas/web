1
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,955
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,325
It's freezing in here.
They didn't fix the heat?

3
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,921
Mmm-mmm. Called the super this morning.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,326
Calling doesn't do any good.
I'll go down and talk to him.

5
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,298
Hey, where's Sami?

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,265
Did you let him go out?

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,366
He doesn't do what I tell him.

8
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,340
You let him bring that in here?

9
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,648
Rico, don't make trouble, please!

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,801
If he comes in here, I'll
send him straight home.

11
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,158
Okay.

12
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,699
Hey, hey!

13
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,130
Where's Sami, huh?

14
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,642
- I don't know anything.
- You don't anything!. Then why
you running, huh?

15
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:06,700
- I don't know!
- Where you going off in a rush?

16
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,837
You don't know? Listen,

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,006
you tell your friends Sami's out of this.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,481
If he isn't home in una hora,

19
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,745
I'm gonna call the cops and let
them know what you're up to.

20
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,845
- Listen, I don't know...
- Listen, you tell your friends what I said!

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,461
Hey. Hey, get away from me! Help, help!

22
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,942
We heard you were looking for Sami.

23
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,186
You got your pops to
thank for this, little man.

24
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,291
Look at him, little man.

25
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,522
Look at the love in his eyes.

26
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,990
He loves you so much.

27
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,942
Welcome death, little man.

28
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,345
Look, the senator's bill's never
gonna make it out of committee.

29
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,153
No, it's dead, gone, forget it.

30
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,819
Oh, my God!

31
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,218
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

32
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,718
I didn't see him.

33
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,791
I didn't see him. He came out of nowhere.

34
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,765
I didn't even see him. Oh, my God.

35
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,650
Witnesses confirm the initial report.

36
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,708
This guy ran out into traffic.

37
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,685
This accident finished something
someone else started.

38
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,591
His throat's been cut. It's not very deep.

39
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,528
Didn't go through the carotid artery.

40
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,858
There's dirt in the wound, in his mouth.

41
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,793
He's even aspirated some up his nose.

42
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,098
And there's dirt under the nails.

43
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,038
This man was buried alive.

44
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,242
He... He dug himself out.

45
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,473
This blood spatter on his pants,

46
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,681
you see how it moves across both legs?

47
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,612
It didn't come from his neck.

48
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,324
I didn't see any other wounds.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,123
There's another injured out there.

50
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,719
Out there, somewhere in Prospect Park.

51
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,758
Guys, we're gonna have to
check this whole perimeter.

52
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,670
Oh, damn.

53
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,236
This is Detective Eames. We have a body.

54
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,804
Male, juvenile,

55
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,447
about 50 yards in from the playground.

56
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,682
He was cut right through the carotid.

57
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,655
The boy died instantly.

58
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,096
And there's no mistake this time.

59
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,101
We ran the prints. We got a
pop on the adult victim.

60
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,034
Enrique Iberra.

61
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,868
According to the blood tests,
the kid's probably his.

62
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,965
I'm guessing Iberra's priors were for dope.

63
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,601
This MO's got dope written all over it.

64
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,373
Iberra's last conviction was 12 years ago.

65
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,009
He finished his GED while he was inside.

66
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,143
His parole reviews are stellar.

67
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,285
He had car grease on his
jacket, calluses on his hand.

68
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,052
He was a mechanic. He was
working for a living.

69
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,561
He and his kid were what, witnesses?
Wrong place, wrong time?

70
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,755
Or it's punitive.

71
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,129
Someone was being taught a lesson.

72
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,358
The father?

73
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,961
Not necessarily.

74
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,865
Iberra had his son's blood on his pants.

75
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,838
His son was buried on top of him.

76
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,177
Which means Iberra was likely killed first.

77
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,071
Right in front of his son.

78
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,019
Was your husband in any kind of trouble?

79
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,146
Did he owe someone money or...

80
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,122
No. There was no trouble.

81
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,626
Not about Sami?

82
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,195
No. No.

83
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,661
When Sami didn't come home last night,

84
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,833
you weren't worried?

85
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,044
I thought he was with Rico.

86
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,309
And Rico came home after work,

87
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,375
he left his toolbox there

88
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,416
and then he left again. Why?

89
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,225
To have a beer.

90
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,931
But Sami was 12 years old. He
didn't take Sami to have a beer.

91
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,156
No.

92
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:35,402
Sami, he was with his friends,

93
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,441
kids from the neighborhood.

94
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,844
Maybe your husband went out looking for him.

95
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,510
No. He just went out... That's all, he...

96
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,981
I'm just so upset. I'm sorry.

97
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,952
We're gonna have to look in Sami's room.

98
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,635
Sami was a fan.

99
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,199
Him and his friends,

100
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,262
they all wanna be basketball players.

101
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,468
Your husband took him to the games?

102
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,408
No, we can't afford that.

103
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,505
These are ticket stubs from 3 different games.

104
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,550
The last one was a month ago.

105
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,645
Someone from Rico's work got him those.

106
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,157
A rich guy. Rico worked on his car.

107
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,056
I don't remember his name.

108
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,193
These protein bars,

109
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,258
did you buy them?

110
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,069
Sure, I did.

111
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,465
How much did they cost?

112
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,142
I... A dollar something. I don't remember.

113
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,407
These are worth about $5, right?

114
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,509
I mean, these are about $5 bucks.

115
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,746
Did someone give them to Sami?

116
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,348
Maybe the same person who
gave him the game tickets.

117
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,152
No, I told you.

118
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,395
I can't help you. Please.

119
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,564
We think you need our help.

120
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,201
Promise you'll give us a call, okay?

121
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,636
Did Sami work on cars with his Dad?

122
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,938
I'm wondering if this
stuff's grease or oil here.

123
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,873
See?

124
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,550
Rico's work. Grease everywhere in the house.

125
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,954
It's okay, I'll clean it up. It's no big deal.

126
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,157
You should really listen to
what my partner is telling you.

127
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,102
You're not alone.

128
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:57,275
Protein bars, Knicks tickets,
this kid had expensive tastes.

129
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,381
Yeah, and the money to indulge them.

130
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,489
Move it over to the right, okay, because
that's where the drum kit goes.

131
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,089
Where you been?

132
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,858
We got a booking in 20 minutes.

133
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,398
Yeah, sorry, Jojo.

134
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,898
- You know I count on you, right?
- Yeah.

135
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,904
And after, Tomas needs help with his homework.

136
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,572
What? You know the rules.

137
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,912
You wanna hang out, eat
my food, learn the board,

138
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,848
then you gotta get the homework done.

139
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,685
Frankie.

140
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,130
You create a problem,
solve it on your own time.

141
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,927
Let's go.

142
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,971
Dead? Both of them? I didn't know.

143
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,001
Enrique's wife said you saw him last night.

144
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,969
Why would she say that?

145
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,743
Maybe because he said he
was having a beer with you.

146
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,880
No way he told her that.

147
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,211
I was still here, right here,
working ‘til 9:00.

148
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,957
How do you know it was before
9:00 when he went out?

149
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,156
Well, you just said that...

150
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,629
She didn't tell you what
time it was, Mr. Ramirez.

151
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,259
Now you know because you saw him, right?

152
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,393
Maybe somebody told me they saw him.

153
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,800
Somebody who?

154
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,405
Somebody from where Enrique was
having the beer, like Louisa said.

155
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,636
Where would that be, you being
Enrique's drinking buddy?

156
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,477
Try La Taverna around the corner.

157
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,508
Hey, I wasn't that close to him.

158
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,616
He'd been in jail, you know?

159
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,886
See that bodega down there on the right?

160
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,357
I think the guy there,
Ramirez, was friends with him.

161
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,449
Maybe he saw him.

162
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,190
But you're sure Mr. Iberra didn't
come in for a beer last night?

163
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,959
Yeah. He hardly ever came in.

164
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,693
I don't know, maybe once, I don't know.

165
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,894
I never noticed him. Sorry.

166
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,940
Honest people, every last one of them.

167
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,533
You can tell 'cause they're such bad liars.

168
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,409
Hey, guys. Hey, no, no, wait up, wait up.

169
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,847
Listen, me and my partner, we need your help.

170
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,414
Did you know that a friend of
yours from the neighborhood,

171
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,893
Sami Iberra, you know that he got
killed last night with his...

172
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,123
We don't know him. We
don't know what happened.

173
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,166
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not finished.

174
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,601
Who put the word out not to talk to us?

175
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,534
Who's everyone afraid of?

176
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,435
Come on, Sami grew up here

177
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,670
all his life with his Mom and his Dad.

178
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,806
Huh? You guys grew up with him.

179
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,779
You probably went to the same school, right?

180
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,817
You played video games, you shoot hoops.

181
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,145
You don't think you should stand up for him?

182
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,050
In this neighborhood, the
Neighborhood Watch watches the cops.

183
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,293
It just breaks my heart.

184
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,435
Sami was one of our small victories.

185
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,468
He worked so hard to better his grades.

186
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,769
This year it all just clicked in for him.

187
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,173
How was he outside of class?

188
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,234
Any problems with the other kids? Fights?

189
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,214
No. He stuck mostly with kids
from his own neighborhood.

190
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,409
They're all good kids.

191
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,712
That's the picture we're getting.

192
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,243
The local precinct said it's a low
crime area, very little drug activity.

193
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,048
Protein bars seem to be the drug of choice.

194
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,185
All of Sami's friends eat those.

195
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,557
If you had to name Sami's best
friend, who would that be?

196
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,364
It was Jamal Dupuis,

197
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,265
but Jamal moved out of state a few
months ago to live with his father.

198
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,769
How did Sami take that?

199
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,602
He started acting out, but he
got himself under control.

200
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,438
CD player. Noise reduction headphones.

201
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,304
It's got to be at least
a couple hundred bucks.

202
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,977
That's Rap. Rap.

203
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,851
Well, this is interesting.

204
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,526
What is that, a mambo?

205
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,156
No, it's Son. It's music from Cuba.

206
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:13,196
Which is odd 'cause his family's Dominican.

207
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,263
These kids are usually ferocious about,

208
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,539
you know, embracing their ethnic background.

209
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,108
It's homemade. Sami's Mix.

210
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,173
And he didn't have a computer
or a CD burner at home.

211
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,214
Sixteen-One Studios.

212
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,888
Yeah, I showed Sami how to download
tracks and use the CD burner.

213
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,588
- You a friend of the family?
- A friend of the community.

214
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,658
The local kids, they like
to stop by after school,

215
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,565
I let them hang out till their
parents come home from work.

216
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,433
But that can't be good for business.

217
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,405
Hey, don't worry. When J. Lo comes
in, I make sure the kids behave.

218
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,301
Let me help you with that.

219
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,203
We'll move it around this way.

220
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,508
All right.

221
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,847
You know, Sami's...

222
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,484
he had a very eclectic selection on his CD.

223
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:07,721
Yeah, rap, hip-hop, you'd expect
that. But Son music?

224
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,653
Is that your influence, Mr. Rios?

225
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,718
He heard me play it. He liked it.

226
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,855
Kids are like, you know, sponges.

227
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,229
He see you eat these?

228
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,930
He had some in his locker at school.

229
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,967
Well, I can't help it if they get
hungry, and I don't feed them junk.

230
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,872
I mean, you eat junk, you become junk.

231
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:28,071
Yeah, respect your body, respect
yourself. That's a good philosophy.

232
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,906
I'm sorry, this thing is just so...

233
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,915
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Baby!

234
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,310
Oh, I like that.

235
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:41,190
It records a word or a phrase so you
can play it like a note, you know.

236
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,124
You let the kids use this stuff?

237
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,355
I teach them how to use the equipment,

238
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,022
after they do their homework.

239
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,690
Jojo's clubhouse.

240
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,995
All due respect, ma'am,

241
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,694
where would you like these boys to be?

242
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,534
Here, doing their schoolwork,
maybe learning a skill,

243
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,137
or out in your neighborhood
boosting car stereos?

244
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,834
No, here, definitely.

245
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,842
Hey, Frankie, Ruthie's Jerk
Palace is coming in at 4:00, huh?

246
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,472
You want to set up the board?

247
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,014
I got a restaurant commercial to do.

248
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,979
You must do a lot of these commercials
to pay for all this gear.

249
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:16,390
Oh, commercials, demos. I even got a
couple of clients get on the Latin charts.

250
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,697
Is Frankie one of your success stories?

251
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,258
Frankie's like an apprentice, you know?

252
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,268
Another couple of years, he'll know
enough to open his own studio.

253
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,601
So he gets his own studio,
and then there's Sami.

254
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,207
What happened with him?

255
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,875
He was a victim of his father's impulses.

256
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,876
The man was an ex-convict.
That was his nature.

257
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,183
He was probably mixed up
with some bad people,

258
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,550
and the poor kid paid the price.

259
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,184
You know, one last thing,

260
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,023
before we let you get on with
your, you know, commercial.

261
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,090
Jamal Dupuis,

262
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,197
did he hang out here with Sami?

263
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:01,068
Yeah, for a while. But I think the
kid moved out of the neighborhood.

264
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,138
That's what we heard.

265
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,044
Well, thanks.

266
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,771
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Baby!

267
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,748
I really like... I really like that.

268
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,783
Jamal moved down to the barrier islands,

269
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,790
to live with his father in South Carolina.

270
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,850
Why? Was he having problems here?

271
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,058
He wanted to work, and they don't
let 13-year-olds work up here.

272
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,360
So, they say you can make good
money crabbing down there.

273
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,129
Have you talked to him lately?

274
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,936
He calls from time to time from pay phones.

275
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,411
His father doesn't have a phone now.

276
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,310
Have you told him what
happened to his friend Sami?

277
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,571
No.

278
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,413
Well, they were best friends.

279
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,353
They hung out together at the
sound studio on Bergen Street.

280
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,782
We have nothing to say against Mr. Rios.

281
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,526
Your daughter is very cute.

282
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,465
You're happy Jamal's out of the house.

283
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,105
Why would you say that?

284
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,137
Well, you don't have any photos of him.

285
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,442
What's the town where Jamal's
staying with his father?

286
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,076
It's not just one town.

287
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:26,189
Well, his father's got family on
a lot of the islands down there,

288
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,222
so Jamal stays with them, too.

289
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,762
My favorite place down there
is Gullah Gullah Island.

290
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,628
I bet Jamal probably goes crabbing there.

291
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,497
Oh, yes. I remember him telling me that.

292
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,333
Telling you that he went crabbing
on Gullah Gullah Island?

293
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:49,077
You know, Mrs. Dupuis, there
is no island with that name.

294
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,641
Well, I'm sure I heard of it.

295
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,916
That's because

296
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,785
there's a children's television
show called Gullah, Gullah Island,

297
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,295
and you probably watched it with
him when he was growing up.

298
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,905
Where is he?

299
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,603
What happened to him?

300
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,807
He's with his father, and you have to go now.

301
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,509
Mr. Dupuis, we can protect your family.

302
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,680
Just go.

303
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,861
Slowly, now. You don't
need that much, just half.

304
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,798
Easy, easy.

305
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,033
You see, Ramon?

306
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,663
One drop at a time, not all at
once like you did last week.

307
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,798
No, I didn't.

308
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,398
Don't contradict!

309
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,013
A man who sees his own
shortcomings and corrects them

310
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,879
is on his way to meet God.

311
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,844
Frankie, come help teach these boys.

312
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,825
Your mind isn't here.

313
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,388
You wanna be strong, you stay focused.

314
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,126
You watch Bennie. He's focused.

315
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,065
That's how he gets the job done.

316
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,831
I got the job done, Jojo.

317
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,203
Half done. Now I told you, watch Bennie.

318
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,448
You see, Frankie? That's focus.

319
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,121
Jamal's parents were supposed to contact us

320
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,891
to tell us where to send his school records,

321
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,329
but we never heard from them.

322
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,993
Jamal ever talk about working
in South Carolina?

323
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,593
No, I never heard that.

324
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,729
Could we see other files from students

325
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,240
who moved away in the last year or so?

326
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,242
Sure. We keep them over here.

327
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,306
There's a notation in Jamal's
records from the school nurse.

328
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,746
Two weeks before he moved,

329
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,843
he showed up with a black eye
and a broken collar bone.

330
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,015
Here you go.

331
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,890
This one moved to Fresno, California.

332
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,298
The school board confirms he's enrolled there.

333
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,598
Here, Christopher White,
broken arm six months ago.

334
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,267
3 weeks later, his parents
say he moved to Oklahoma

335
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,200
to live with relatives.

336
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,777
There's no confirmation in the file.

337
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,308
We try to stay on top of things.

338
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,380
Marco Reyes.

339
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,250
His parents say they sent him to
Mexico to live with his grandmother.

340
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,256
That was a week after he showed up for class

341
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,314
with eight stitches in his face.

342
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,094
These kids were all getting a
beating as a going-away present.

343
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,864
Well, they have something else in common.

344
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,870
They were all from the same 12-block radius.

345
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,939
The same 12 scared blocks.

346
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,046
Some kids were trolling
for scrap metal last October

347
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,481
along I-95 near exit 43.

348
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,644
Their dog started digging.

349
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,318
John Doe, 12 to 13 years old.

350
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,421
He matches one of the set of
dental records you sent around.

351
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,217
Christopher White.

352
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,656
The throat was cut.

353
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,665
The laceration was deep, all
the way back to the vertebra.

354
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,723
Almost took his head clean off.

355
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,568
The way the body was posed in the grave,

356
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:39,235
stretched out, hands crossed
over the front, feet together.

357
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,171
A proper burial.

358
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,207
A sign of respect?

359
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,749
I'm looking at Christopher
White's birth certificate.

360
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,050
His body was dumped less than a
mile from where he was born.

361
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,855
And these spots on the
shoe, anyone test them?

362
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,033
Other than coloring and tanning agents,

363
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,731
all you got here is shoe leather.

364
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,605
No trace of anything that would cause
it to crack and discolor like that.

365
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:17,171
Yeah. You know, when I was a
kid, I had leather mitts,

366
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,147
all right, and then they would get cracked,

367
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,685
you know, when they were wet and cold.

368
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,243
Well, that's how leather
reacts when it's frozen.

369
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,756
What about flash frozen?

370
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,415
Sure, with dry ice.

371
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,017
But that leaves a residue.

372
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,895
Liquid nitrogen?

373
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,289
Sure.

374
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,329
It evaporates, leaves no residue.

375
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,376
Look, I

376
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,607
was wondering if you could run
this through your machine.

377
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,377
I wiped it off the floor of a kid's bedroom.

378
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,610
Is that grease?

379
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,952
You tell me.

380
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,218
Submicron Teflon chips. Graphite.

381
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,261
Rare polymers. Friction modifiers.

382
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,323
I'm afraid to ask you where
you put this kind of grease.

383
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,662
It's Italian racing bicycle grease.

384
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,633
It's $30 a tube.

385
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,561
I can imagine what the bicycles cost.

386
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,099
Up to $15,000.

387
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,544
If the Iberra kid had a bike
like this in his bedroom,

388
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,541
it had to be stolen. That's what he was into.

389
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,643
Yeah, that's what they're all into.

390
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:34,248
The kid in New Jersey, he dripped
liquid nitrogen on his shoe.

391
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,455
Liquid nitrogen is used
to break bicycle locks.

392
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,393
I pulled some figures from Compstat.

393
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,727
There are $3 million worth of bicycles stolen

394
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,460
in all five boroughs every year.

395
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,729
Most of it involves adult perps,

396
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,170
but there are reports of one gang
of kids operating in Manhattan.

397
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,366
They're quick, they use different MO's

398
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,034
and they've never been caught.

399
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,769
And they're all well-trained.

400
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,439
Like Jojo said, kids are like sponges.

401
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,414
And I assume the ones that
don't make the grade

402
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,041
or make trouble get their throats cut.

403
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,813
We matched up 3 of the missing boys,

404
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,549
including Jamal Dupuis, with John Doe remains.

405
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,615
Their parents have been contacted,
but they're still not talking.

406
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,957
Let's be careful how much we lean on them.

407
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,486
According to the direction
of the marks on the vertebrae,

408
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:18,626
these kids had their throats slit from behind

409
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,228
from left to right.

410
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,967
The killer was right-handed.

411
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,737
But Sami Iberra and his father

412
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,645
had their throat cut from right to left.

413
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,206
Their killer was left-handed.

414
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,721
Jojo was breaking in someone new?

415
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,360
Somebody who didn't quite do the job right.

416
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,759
That's a Cielo with a set of record
10 shifters. Bennie got that.

417
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,735
Good work, Bennie. Real good work.

418
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:56,068
You know what? You guys go home, okay?

419
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,801
Frankie and I can take it from here.

420
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,274
They could help unload.

421
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,868
You don't look good. You eat lunch?

422
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,445
I just haven't been sleeping
so good, that's all.

423
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,846
I heard what the cops found.

424
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,045
I know. But you're standing up good.

425
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,385
Your loyalty, that's what's appreciated.

426
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,055
Thanks, Jojo.

427
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,753
"The power within stays safe
and free from assault,

428
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,352
"superior to pleasure and pain,
doing nothing randomly."

429
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,159
- You remember that?
- I do.

430
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,426
I know you do.

431
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,128
And I know you're gonna
continue standing by everyone.

432
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,669
Your fellow warriors.

433
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,365
Any sacrifice that's needed.

434
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,571
That's what I know you can do.

435
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,102
Well, what do you mean?

436
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,537
If it's necessary,

437
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,816
we know you'll do what a man would do.

438
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,590
"Don't act as if you're
going to live 10,000 years.

439
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,955
"Death hangs over you.

440
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:55,762
"While you live, while it's
in your power, be good."

441
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,162
Frankie's not home a lot of the time.

442
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,574
Look, is there a reward
for information or what?

443
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,570
- A reward?
- Hmm.

444
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:11,171
Maybe we can scrounge something
up. What do you think?

445
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,217
$20 bucks. We can handle $20 bucks.

446
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,547
$20 bucks?

447
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,022
Well, it's not like he's on
the FBI's top 10 list.

448
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:28,091
Well, I can see Frankie's Mom
has kept her youthful looks.

449
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,869
Don't run, Frankie. It won't
be good for you if you run.

450
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,175
I'm not running.

451
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,479
What you go and do, you little jerk?

452
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,917
Bringing the cops into my house

453
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,318
after all I've done for you.

454
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,048
I hope they fry you.

455
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,281
That's a good attitude, Frank.

456
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,461
And so it begins.

457
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,161
Your Dad's quite a ladies man, huh?

458
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,901
When my Dad came home at night,

459
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,938
I could smell them on him.

460
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,151
I was ashamed.

461
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,386
Right? I mean, like your Dad.

462
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,129
I can see why you look up to Jojo.

463
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,164
I really can.

464
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,496
"Everything has always been the same."

465
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,796
How do you mean?

466
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,371
"You can't lose another life
than the one you're living now,

467
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,307
"or live another one
than the one you're losing.

468
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,976
"The longest life is
the same as the shortest."

469
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,138
What's he talking about?

470
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,046
"The longest life is
the same as the shortest."

471
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,852
I know this.

472
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,161
"Some things are rushing into
existence. Others out of it."

473
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,127
Did you read this, Frankie?

474
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:17,140
"Time is a river, a violent
current of events, glimpsed...

475
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,135
"Glimpsed..."

476
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,908
"Glimpsed once, already
carried past us and is gone."

477
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,838
Yeah.

478
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,477
That's Marcus Aurelius.

479
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,277
The dictates of a warrior.

480
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,255
Okay.

481
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,166
Call EMS. He's taken something.
He's trying to kill himself.

482
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,763
This is unit 229. We have
an attempted suicide.

483
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,932
What did you take, Frankie?

484
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:54,239
I am a warrior. I welcome death.

485
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,247
Yes, and warriors try to live.
They fight and they... And they live.

486
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,449
The son of a bitch!

487
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,577
He told him to do it! He told him to!

488
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,782
He's on a respirator. It's touch and go.

489
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,021
He took some kind of cyanide. He must
have been carrying it around with him.

490
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,392
In case of capture?

491
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,659
What, did this boy step out
of, an old war movie?

492
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,462
An old Roman war movie.

493
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,399
Before he went into convulsions,

494
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,529
he was quoting Marcus Aurelius.

495
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,368
Marcus Aurelius? The Meditations.

496
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,875
He was a Roman emperor... and a
follower of the Roman Stoic philosophy.

497
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,707
But I wasn't aware that Marcus Aurelius

498
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,769
was an advocate of suicide.

499
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,042
Well, he wasn't.

500
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,812
But like any belief system in the wrong hands,

501
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,877
Stoicism can be twisted
to mean whatever you want.

502
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,219
The wrong hands being Jojo Rios.

503
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,316
His idea of self-control.

504
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,421
The way that the bodies
were laid out for the burial,

505
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,525
where they were buried,

506
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,729
he's following the playbook.

507
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:59,001
Even the name of his sound
studio, Sixteen-One.

508
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,437
The year 161 AD,

509
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,081
the year Marcus Aurelius was made emperor.

510
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,545
Mr. Rios sees himself as a general?

511
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,845
Leading 12-year-olds in
a criminal enterprise

512
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,720
with the help of a second century philosophy?

513
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,490
Stoicism inspired the Roman legions

514
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,426
to march across Europe and Africa.

515
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,327
I mean, if you're gonna start a gang,

516
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,763
you could pick a worse model.

517
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,496
Detectives, I'm sorry. The
Marino boy didn't make it.

518
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,662
The doctor will be out to talk to you.

519
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,230
I need to notify the next of kin. The father.

520
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,338
Nurse,

521
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,516
his father, he's not gonna care.

522
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,217
We need a gag order.

523
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,916
I mean, the hospital can put out

524
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,754
that we brought Frank Marino in,

525
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,955
but we don't want them to
tell anyone that he's dead.

526
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,019
We don't?

527
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,765
No. If Frank Marino talked,

528
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,894
we'd have a case against Jojo Rios.

529
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,537
We need him to have talked.

530
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,235
Excuse me, but I really
do need to notify the parents.

531
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,142
Nurse, I'm Ronald Carver,

532
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,908
Assistant District Attorney.

533
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,846
I need to explain something to you.

534
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,684
It's time to round up some legionnaires.

535
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,304
Bennie, come on.

536
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,039
I'm moving. I'm moving.

537
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,375
Not anymore.

538
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,437
Uh-oh.

539
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,515
Jojo takes care of us.

540
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,145
No, see, that money he's
making off the bicycles,

541
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,588
he's not putting that in your college fund.

542
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,725
He's gonna spend it while you sit in Spofford.

543
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,990
Ramon, don't be a sucker!

544
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,697
Your mom's all alone with
your two little brothers.

545
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,136
What are they gonna think if you go to jail?

546
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,073
They'll see I'm a man. To stay true.

547
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:15,338
That's what it means to be a man.

548
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:20,410
Christopher White, Marcos Reyes,

549
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:25,082
Jamal Dupuis and Sami Iberra.

550
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,287
What happened to them, Bennie?

551
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,320
And why did Jojo have them killed?

552
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,352
Listen, I do not know anything about that.

553
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,192
What about Christopher White?
He was in your class.

554
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,258
He must have done something
pretty bad to end up like this.

555
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,271
What, was he weak? Disloyal?

556
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,238
Did he steal from the others?

557
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,866
Listen, he was a good person.

558
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:47,805
He was a good person?

559
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,239
Yeah.

560
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,113
That's right.

561
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,311
I forgot.

562
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,488
You don't speak ill of the dead.

563
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,692
You don't speak ill of a fellow warrior.

564
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,498
Chris White was a fellow warrior.

565
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,699
He's buried in New Jersey,

566
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,167
the land of his birth

567
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,085
because that's what Marcus
Aurelius told you to do.

568
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,461
You see, we know all
about Jojo and Mr. Aurelius.

569
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,825
Frankie told us.

570
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,358
Did you know that he was arrested earlier?

571
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,899
If that had happened, he'd know what to do.

572
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,435
He wouldn't just nark on Jojo.

573
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,494
Oh, no.

574
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,500
No, he told us how him and
Jojo laid Chris in his grave.

575
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,775
No. Frankie's a hero, just like Jojo.

576
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,673
He would never turn his back on us.

577
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,845
Jojo's a hero? How do you figure
that? He's a sound engineer.

578
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,752
No, no. I know his story.

579
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,585
Jojo came from Cuba.

580
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,523
His boat sank, and it was night.

581
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,628
Everybody drowned except for Jojo.

582
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,691
He made it because he's strong.

583
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,525
He taught us how to be strong.

584
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,069
- To be true?
- Yes.

585
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,032
He showed you by example.

586
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,765
You would never betray him

587
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,833
because he would never betray you.

588
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,176
- Yes.
- The way of the warrior.

589
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,724
Well, it's nice to see kids
studying the classics.

590
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,784
And learning all the wrong lessons.

591
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,423
Well, should we pick up a few
more of Mr. Rios' disciples?

592
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,095
Well, there's no point.

593
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,534
I mean, we can't threaten them
with anything more potent

594
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,230
than what they're already afraid of.

595
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,631
Afraid of falling short, as warriors, as men,

596
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,677
in the eyes of their hero.

597
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,077
All that's missing is
war paint and a bonfire.

598
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,843
The wild place inside every boy's heart.

599
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,017
You know, Jojo knows that...

600
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,755
Well, he knows that every
good hero needs a good story.

601
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,127
I need to call the INS.

602
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,226
I was going out to see
a client about a booking.

603
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,328
- You're lucky you caught me.
- We're lucky that way.

604
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,964
Well, we won't be long.
It's about Frank Marino.

605
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,509
- What did you call him? Your apprentice?
- Yeah.

606
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,602
Frankie's a good kid. I
hope he's not in trouble.

607
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,702
Afraid so.

608
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,476
We think he's mixed up with
a ring of bicycle thieves.

609
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,811
That's hard to believe.

610
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,852
Well, what's worse is that

611
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,213
when we were questioning
him, he did something,

612
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,418
well, inexplicable.

613
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,058
He took cyanide.

614
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,057
My God, that's...

615
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,489
He killed himself?

616
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,630
Well, no.

617
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,359
He botched it.

618
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,168
He's still alive.

619
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,866
He's at Methodist Hospital.

620
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,375
We should be able to talk to him by tomorrow.

621
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,005
That's good. I'm glad he's gonna make it.

622
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,579
He might not be so glad.

623
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,380
He's facing a couple murder charges

624
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,921
for Sami Iberra and his father, Enrique.

625
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,354
Yeah, he botched that, too.

626
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,292
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he wasn't
planning on Sami's father,

627
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,796
you know, running out of the
park with his throat slit.

628
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,098
Look, I'd be surprised if Frankie
had anything to do with that.

629
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,664
But then again, I don't really
know what he does on his own time.

630
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:39,174
Well, what he does is, I mean,
you know, besides heisting bikes

631
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,271
and killing people...

632
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,040
On his own time.

633
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,546
- Do you mind?
- Sorry.

634
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,082
That's expensive equipment.

635
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,947
Sure, sure. So sorry.

636
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,949
What he does is he fills his mind

637
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:57,354
with some kind of, you
know, martial philosophy

638
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,330
about warriors and loyalty, accepting death.

639
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,898
That's what he talked about
on the way to the hospital.

640
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,935
You don't know anything about that?

641
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:10,496
No.

642
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,736
That's funny because we thought
that it came from you,

643
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,335
you know, along with the protein bars.

644
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,272
I mean, even if I did believe all that stuff,

645
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,076
these are hard-core street kids, you know?

646
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,553
I mean, they wouldn't listen to a guy like me.

647
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,989
Come on, you're being too modest.

648
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,253
These kids look up to you.

649
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,453
Where did you hear that from?

650
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,554
Bennie Renato. He thinks you're a hero.

651
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,461
That's crazy. You know, these are street kids.

652
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,060
They're running a con on you.

653
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,939
Well, no, I mean, Bennie,
he seemed very sincere.

654
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:51,446
Hey, he told us about your
perilous crossing from Cuba.

655
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,382
You know, your boat sank at
night. Everyone drowned.

656
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,086
I mean, except you.

657
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,557
That's right. I told him that. So what?

658
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,286
Why, because it's true, right?

659
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,620
Of course.

660
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,423
It was the Mariel boat lift.

661
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,227
It was when Castro emptied his jails.

662
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,891
You came over with your father.

663
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,294
Your father is a convicted rapist.

664
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,634
That's a lie.

665
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,641
Hey, not according to your INS file.

666
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,406
Your boat, well, it didn't sink.

667
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:31,114
And those people, nobody was lost at sea or...

668
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,182
The INS put your father
in a detention center.

669
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,818
They put you in a foster home

670
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,989
and then in a group home until you were 17.

671
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,793
Okay. Okay.

672
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,899
Sol made up a story.

673
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,905
Well, not just any story.

674
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,769
Well, it was, you know, a hero's story.

675
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,471
I mean, you know, the child
being plucked from the water.

676
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,104
That's Moses with a little
Jonah thrown in there.

677
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,848
And then the orphan who grows
up to be a great leader.

678
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:05,081
That's Marcus Aurelius.

679
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:07,886
You know what?

680
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

681
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,929
No? Marcus Aurelius. That warrior's creed?

682
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,168
That loyalty unto death stuff?

683
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,066
You taught them that.

684
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,130
No.

685
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,136
Look, I was new in the neighborhood.

686
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,736
I had to make nice with the locals,

687
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,509
so I let their kids hang out here. That's all.

688
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,244
Oh, that's good for PR, I guess.

689
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,307
I swear to God.

690
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,753
And if I told them stories, Boy
Scout crap, it was just talk.

691
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,757
All that stuff about loyalty was just talk?

692
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,520
Loyalty's fine as far as it goes,

693
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,721
but if Frankie and Bennie did something
illegal, that's not my responsibility.

694
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,697
And if they're telling you something
different, they're liars.

695
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:55,362
So, you gave them some attention

696
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,202
and a little advice and
sent them on their way.

697
00:39:58,263 --> 00:39:59,435
That's all I did.

698
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:04,207
And if they got into trouble, you know,
themselves, they were on their own.

699
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,748
I don't owe them a thing.

700
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,678
Not even loyalty?

701
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,510
Nothing.

702
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,120
All right, Mr. Rios, I think
we've wasted enough of your time

703
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,627
talking about these punks.

704
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,694
What are you doing?

705
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,203
Did you take that CD out of there?

706
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,569
- Hey man, the thing just popped out.
- Yeah, the hell it did.

707
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,172
You recorded me.

708
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,604
You son of a bitch recorded me.

709
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,705
What's the big deal? It's not like...

710
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,011
Now, you can't take that!

711
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,985
That's my property, now you give it to me.

712
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,086
What did you think you were
gonna do with this, huh?

713
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,887
I was gonna use it

714
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,458
to see if any of the kids had illusions
about how you felt about them.

715
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,004
I told you, those dumb kids

716
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,165
have got nothing to do with me.

717
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,674
I'm surprised at you, Jojo.

718
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,175
About what?

719
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:22,016
Well, I mean, a guy like you on the cutting
edge of sound recording technology,

720
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,684
you know, thinking that we would
resort to using a synthesizer

721
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,361
to bug your sound studio.

722
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,956
Especially when we have neat stuff like this.

723
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:34,526
An omni-directional microphone
and transmitter all in one.

724
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,869
You know, that broadcasts
theater-quality sound

725
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:41,206
through brick and soundproofing

726
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,712
up to 100 yards away.

727
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,486
You know, I can't believe you, Jojo.

728
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,587
You know, I'm so stupid.

729
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,092
What you think you heard,

730
00:41:58,483 --> 00:41:59,689
it was a trick.

731
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,560
Listen, I heard, all right?

732
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,058
So tell me, Jojo,

733
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,598
what do we do now?

734
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,370
To be true. What, do we be like Frankie?

735
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,705
Tell me, what do we do to stay true?

736
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:20,713
Yeah. I just want to tell them everything.

737
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:21,773
Don't you dare!

738
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,115
Jojo Rios, you're under arrest for murder.

739
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,587
No, no, no. Bennie, Bennie,
Bennie! Listen to me.

740
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,885
Listen to me! Listen.

741
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,453
Listen, you're not stupid, Bennie.

742
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,386
You're not stupid.

743
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,925
You're a strong kid. You're a true kid.

744
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,434
That book that you read about being a warrior,

745
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,329
that was good.

746
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:47,874
It's Jojo, man, he sent you
on a battle that wasn't good.

747
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,845
But you, you're true.

748
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,483
And you're strong.

749
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,081
You hear me?

750
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,200
I hope they find a better
role model for their kids.

751
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,163
They could do worse than Sami's father.
