1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,326
Jimmy, the flowers were a bad idea.

2
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,126
I shouldn't even be here.

3
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,100
Don't be like that. There he is.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,140
Ten hours on a bus from Montreal,

5
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,733
my roids are screaming blue murder.

6
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,138
Well, welcome home, Mickey.

7
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,815
We need to talk. Where's your car?

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,521
In the lot, down by 9th.

9
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,452
Look, you're gonna have to take a cab.

10
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,326
Roseanne, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,662
What about the USB account?

12
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,897
Empty.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,871
They're all, except Trust
House and Citibank.

14
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,738
Those I managed to close
before he got to them.

15
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,504
I put the money in a safety deposit box.

16
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,102
Son of a bitch!

17
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,410
And Dougie did all this by himself?

18
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,347
Just don't hurt him.

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,155
Mickey, I didn't know it was yours.

20
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,452
Who did you think it belonged to,

21
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,588
you worthless twit, Santa Claus?

22
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,259
You don't understand. This is the
most important thing in my life.

23
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,360
That money is my life!

24
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,171
And I want it back,

25
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,729
every penny, or I swear to God,

26
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,072
I'll take it out of your hide.

27
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,102
Mmm?

28
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,214
You've worked too hard for this.

29
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,753
Maybe I should just give it back.

30
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,449
Baby, you're slipping.

31
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,855
Let me call them.

32
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,421
Look, Doug, we need their help.

33
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,106
Doug's apartment is empty.

34
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,300
Nobody's seen him since yesterday.

35
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,707
His mother'll know where he is.

36
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,645
He called her.

37
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,553
I promised her he wouldn't get hurt.

38
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,119
Seabreeze Motel in Montauk, Room 114.

39
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,371
Excuse me.

40
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,699
You're excused.

41
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,541
Stand up, you son of a bitch!

42
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,875
The old man, Mickey Connelly,
owns this place.

43
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,469
His son Jimmy used it as an office

44
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,774
when he was out of the country.

45
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,611
The old man was ducking a RICO indictment

46
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,150
for bookmaking on the internet.

47
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,119
Yeah, well, his legal troubles are over now.

48
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,578
Got a murder here,

49
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,419
suicide there. He ate the gun.

50
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,551
Cleaning service found them this morning.

51
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,993
Time of death sometime last night.

52
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,889
- Thanks.
- All right.

53
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,828
Can I get a pair of tweezers please?

54
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:18,927
This must be some of that father-son
bonding I've heard so much about.

55
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,569
These cuts were made before he died,

56
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,337
but for some reason they were untreated.

57
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,606
I'll be over here while you do that.

58
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,687
It's frosted glass.

59
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,793
He has

60
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,735
abrasions delicately around
the sides of his mouth.

61
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,911
Well, he was gagged.

62
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,446
Explains why he didn't answer his phone.

63
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,742
He's got voice-mail.

64
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,250
The lab can retrieve the messages.

65
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,382
Mickey's passport.

66
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,083
Irish customs entry stamp
dated November last year.

67
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,090
Exit stamp dated two weeks ago.

68
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,194
Having fun?

69
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,962
I'm listening. He left Ireland two weeks ago.

70
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,062
Canadian customs stamp,
also from two weeks ago.

71
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,538
No US stamp.

72
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,833
Make a note to the ME
to check for ocular fluids.

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,476
His eyes are dry and irritated.

74
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,310
The mucus is thick.

75
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,743
Could be from sleep deprivation.

76
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,213
And he's dehydrated.

77
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,781
His cuticles have shrunk.

78
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,587
Maybe Junior kept him on ice
before killing him.

79
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,792
Except that Junior

80
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,900
shows the same signs.

81
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,333
Mickey had to have a damn good reason

82
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,672
to come back and risk getting
pinched on a fugitive warrant.

83
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,904
How's $2 million bucks?

84
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,607
That's what the DA's always figured
he had stashed away somewhere.

85
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,943
Works for me.

86
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,041
The old man found out the
kid was skimming from him,

87
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,017
they got their Irish up.

88
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,248
I don't think that they got anything up.

89
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,654
The ME found elevated levels of sodium,

90
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,057
urea, nitrogen in the eye mucus,

91
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,289
kidney and liver enzymes
outside the normal range.

92
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,759
Stomach and the bowels empty.

93
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,764
Now, the Connellys, they were starved,

94
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,271
sleep deprived, dehydrated.

95
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,704
They sound like POWs.

96
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,673
The ME also found minute traces of duct tape

97
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,177
around the ankles and wrists of both men.

98
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,204
The tech's got the code for Mickey's
voice-mail. His son's birth date.

99
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,485
“It's Roseanne again, calling for Jimmy.

100
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,613
“It's been a week. I need to hear from you.

101
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,679
“Just call me.”

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,082
Roseanne would be Jimmy's wife.

103
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,753
Last Wednesday.

104
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,158
It's a week since she's heard from him.

105
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,768
You think she would've filed
a missing persons report.

106
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,341
I thought he was away on business.

107
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,207
I didn't even know he was with his father.

108
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,141
You've been camping out in here?

109
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,746
Andy fell asleep watching a video.

110
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,216
I didn't wanna move him.

111
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,550
I noticed that your bedrooms,
they face the street.

112
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,295
Is it safer back here?

113
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,658
You're terrified.

114
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,703
Anybody that has the front to
kill Mickey Connelly and his son

115
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,999
might just come after you, too.

116
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,543
You knew Jimmy was in trouble.

117
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,779
Maybe you had something to do with it?

118
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,783
He called Thursday.

119
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,555
He tried to pretend everything
was okay, but I knew better.

120
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,894
Where was he?

121
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,402
He was with Mickey. He said he'd be home soon.

122
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,531
There was some problem,
some money was missing.

123
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,839
He called you just to check in?

124
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,845
No, he wanted Andy's Social Security
number. He didn't say why.

125
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,279
Your son have a bank account?

126
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,117
They opened an account
for the kid when he was born.

127
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,060
Last month Jimmy got a safe
deposit box under the account.

128
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,826
The bank says he emptied the box 2 days ago.

129
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,390
2 days ago he was dead. So
who emptied the box?

130
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,595
We're checking the bank security tapes.

131
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,766
That's him.

132
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,437
We know this guy?

133
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,478
These are the left ears of both men.

134
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,078
Same shape.

135
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,079
Similar lobes.

136
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,247
Ear structure patterns run in families.

137
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,753
Especially siblings.

138
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,930
Want some?

139
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,663
He'll meet you tomorrow
when they break for lunch.

140
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,471
Doug, it's almost over now.

141
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,535
No one can ever tell you what to do again.

142
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,748
His name is Douglas Morgan.

143
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,752
He's Mickey's son by his second ex-wife.

144
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:35,809
Jimmy's half-brother.

145
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,013
How come we never heard of him?

146
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,819
Well, there's no record he's ever been
involved in his father's business.

147
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,790
Just a couple of misdemeanor forgeries.

148
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,691
He's been a pipsqueak up until now.

149
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,922
You like this guy.

150
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,396
Well, a nobody who scammed the scam artist?

151
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,694
I'd buy him a drink.

152
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,063
First, you have to find him.

153
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:54,037
He moved out of his last known 3 years
ago. No job since last winter.

154
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:58,236
Credit report says he got 5 credit
cards in the last 4 months.

155
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,805
They never learn. If you
don't want to be found, pay cash.

156
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,616
Mr. Morgan, he checked out last Monday.

157
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,086
He was here for a couple of weeks.

158
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,315
By himself?

159
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,981
He had visitors.

160
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,217
No, I didn't notice those two.

161
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,318
Who did you notice?

162
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,696
Well, this one young man
with blond hair, goatee.

163
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,998
He spent a lot of time parked
out here in a chair, reading.

164
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,039
Well, you'd think he'd be warmer inside.

165
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,735
I figured Mr. Morgan had company

166
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,506
and this fellow was giving him his privacy.

167
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,513
Well, that's one way to look at it.

168
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,280
This room is very clean.

169
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,715
There's no marks.

170
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,818
No fingerprints.

171
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,728
Same story here.

172
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,491
We keep things tidy.

173
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,133
Anybody stay here since Mr. Morgan left?

174
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,725
Nah.

175
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,271
We don't get a lot of traffic
out here after Labor Day.

176
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,637
When did they replace the shower door?

177
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,508
We didn't.

178
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,785
There's lime encrustation

179
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,618
and soap residue on this door.

180
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,182
And there's none on this one

181
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,889
and the caulking is still soft.

182
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,493
This shower door was broken,
and they replaced it.

183
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,400
The frosted glass in Jimmy's arm.

184
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,028
They were here.

185
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,607
They were kept here for two weeks.

186
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,174
Two men in a tub.

187
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,415
Last year, when Mickey went on the lam,

188
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:52,115
a dozen bank accounts were opened using
Doug Morgan's Social Security number.

189
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,455
Within two months, there was nearly
$2 million dollars in those accounts.

190
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,223
Mickey hid the money under Doug's
name without telling Doug,

191
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,093
figuring no one would look there.

192
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,223
Somehow Dougie found out.

193
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,291
Starting 4 months ago, he emptied
all but 2 of the accounts.

194
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:08,134
Those 2 accounts were closed the same
day Jimmy opened the safe deposit box.

195
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,107
We think that Jimmy got wind
of what was going on

196
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,110
and got the money out before Doug did.

197
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,271
And put it in the safe deposit box.

198
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,770
So Dougie tortured his father and his brother

199
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,817
just to squeeze the last dollar out of them?

200
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,909
Well, the last $200,000.

201
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,454
What the hell is wrong with this kid?

202
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,546
Didn't daddy spend enough
time playing catch with him?

203
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,387
Or he got too much attention from his mother.

204
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,860
His last parole report says he was
living with her as of 3 years ago.

205
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,294
How sweet.

206
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,828
Dougie thought he had a God-given right

207
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,962
to freeload off his mother.

208
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,440
Uh-uh.

209
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,499
Don't walk there.

210
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,876
- You're gonna make dirt on my carpet here.
- Yeah.

211
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,279
Put these on. I got them at the hospital.

212
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,685
Put them over your feet.

213
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,679
There's only 3 of them.

214
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,247
Well, someone could sit on a chair.

215
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,394
This is a one bedroom, right?

216
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,830
Mmm-hmm.

217
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,460
Where did Doug sleep?

218
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,266
Where do you think? On the couch.

219
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,341
I used to have a bigger place,

220
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,276
but after I got out of the hospital

221
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,280
cleaning a big place didn't appeal to me.

222
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,116
What about his father, Mickey?
You been in touch with him?

223
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,414
What do I want with that louse?

224
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,255
A louse who knows his way to your heart.

225
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,027
Thank you.

226
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,567
That's $73.

227
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,105
It's a bit expensive.

228
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,011
I mean, unless it's Canadian dollars.

229
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,979
Did Mickey drop it off?

230
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,082
I wouldn't set foot in the
same room with that man,

231
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:06,116
unless it was to go to his wake.

232
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,116
Just your luck.

233
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,227
He was found dead 4 days ago.

234
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,825
Oh...

235
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,100
Dear Mary. Oh.

236
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,039
What about his boy, Jimmy?

237
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,748
Why, you like Jimmy?

238
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,884
He was decent enough.

239
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,221
Hadn't been for Jimmy,

240
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,886
Dougie wouldn't have even
known he had a father.

241
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,256
Jimmy brought this to you?

242
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,193
Came over looking for Doug?

243
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:57,771
And you knew where he was, because
Doug keeps in touch with his mother.

244
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,001
Yeah.

245
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,177
He told me if Jimmy comes asking for him,

246
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,013
to say where he is.

247
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,044
And when Jimmy left here,

248
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,983
you called Doug and told him
that Jimmy was on the way?

249
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,923
Dougie wouldn't hurt Jimmy. He loved him!

250
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,389
We still need to find him.

251
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,832
Mickey left a lot of money behind.

252
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,431
Really?

253
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,767
You mean, like clean money
that could go to Dougie?

254
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,004
If we can find him.

255
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,272
I don't have his address.

256
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,652
It's in Brooklyn. It's a sublet.

257
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,626
He said over on Ovington.
A nice, bright place.

258
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,287
You been?

259
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,193
He sent the picture.

260
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,127
No return address.

261
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,598
Bird seed.

262
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,669
We just ask the neighborhood
bird seed store.

263
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,108
Look, through the window,
across the street, on the roof.

264
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,303
A pigeon coop.

265
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,978
You've come a long way, Doug.

266
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,480
No more self-doubt, no more negativity.

267
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,214
Thank you, sir.

268
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,070
This isn't just a gift to the program, Doug,

269
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,565
this is a gift to yourself.

270
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,306
I'm proud of you.

271
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,819
I'm sure Lena is, too.

272
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,864
You go home. I'll catch up later.

273
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,352
There, second floor.

274
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,257
It's the same color curtains.

275
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,869
All these show is a man resembling my
client entering and leaving a room.

276
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,434
What he did in there is anyone's guess.

277
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,104
We guess he stole the contents

278
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,511
of his brother's safe deposit box.

279
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,640
Right, Doug?

280
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,344
My guess, you got nothing
and we're not adding to it.

281
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,246
I think your client has something to say.

282
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,594
Am I right? You have something to tell us?

283
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,932
You think I'm responsible for what
happened to my father and Jimmy.

284
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,102
Well, are you?

285
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,264
Now, wait a minute.

286
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,207
No, wait. You gotta say it out
loud, so we all understand.

287
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,504
Don't say a word.

288
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,842
When you see things clearly,
you make them happen.

289
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,316
I did what I had to do. I killed them.

290
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,013
Okay, he did that against
the advice of his counsel.

291
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,921
I need to speak to him in a room, right now.

292
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,496
Well, that was smooth.

293
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,531
You better get Carver down here.

294
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,036
Do you have the letter
that he sent his mother?

295
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,982
This spontaneous statement might not
take the place of a confession,

296
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,645
but I can't see how his
lawyer can step away from it.

297
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,710
He's using an interesting vocabulary.

298
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,553
Is this something I should be concerned with?

299
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,524
Here's another one.
"Without your encouragement,

300
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:13,029
"I'd still be someone without a future,
sleeping on his mother's couch."

301
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,258
He thanks her for kicking him out.

302
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,732
This about Doug Morgan?

303
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,326
It's the letter that he wrote his mother.

304
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,064
The first part, he apologizes for
the hurt that he caused her.

305
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:25,007
Second part, he thanks her for
everything that she's done for him.

306
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,341
Last part, he lays out
his plan for his future.

307
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,476
"I now understand I need to develop
a new strategy for my life,

308
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:36,645
"a new program for the
software of my conceptions."

309
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,781
It's gobbledygook.

310
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,619
It's high-level gobbledygook.

311
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,253
This is from a guy who didn't
even finish the 10th grade.

312
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,796
These are not his ideas.

313
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,459
You saw the way he glanced up
every time before he spoke?

314
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,802
Manson's women

315
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,300
did the same thing during
their murder trials.

316
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,672
He's visualizing.

317
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,637
Visualizing what?

318
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,649
No, not what. Who.

319
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,281
What's he looking at?

320
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,657
He's looking for support, for direction.

321
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,762
He's looking for her.

322
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,705
No, no, no.

323
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,671
I don't know these people.

324
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,114
Mr. Morgan, if someone influenced you,

325
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,378
it would mitigate your responsibility.

326
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,423
I am responsible.

327
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,519
Nobody told me what to do.

328
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,925
You did it to transform yourself?

329
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,153
That's what it says
in the letter to your mother.

330
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,492
Your "Negative self-programming"

331
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:01,003
was leading you to "a
counter-effective life strategy."

332
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,297
Yes.

333
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,200
You wanted to transform your context.

334
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,869
Yes. That's what I did.

335
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,936
What's a "context", Doug?

336
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,763
You know, Doug, it's in your letter.

337
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,200
You don't you know what it means?

338
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,206
It's hard to say.

339
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,474
Because someone told you to write it?

340
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,918
This girl?

341
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,984
Is that who you picture when you look up?

342
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,184
No.

343
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,066
I am the author of my life
and I make the choices.

344
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,770
And I choose, I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

345
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,939
I took another look at Doug's credit cards.

346
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,140
Every couple of weeks,

347
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:20,115
there's a $400 to $500 charge

348
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,152
to one of two out-of-state companies.

349
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,745
It'll take a few days to chase them down.

350
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,856
Every couple of weeks.

351
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,288
All right, try a keyword search.

352
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,762
Use "Context transformation."

353
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,895
Nearly a thousand results.

354
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,098
Now refine it. Add "Tuition".

355
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,936
Maybe "Four hundred bucks,"

356
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,499
the going rate for self-improvement.

357
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,037
Here we go.

358
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,841
"Optimize your psychic drive.

359
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,439
"Learn the principles
of context transformation.

360
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,508
"Tuition for the 2-day seminar is $450.

361
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,011
"GraceNote Powerful Living."

362
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,484
What else is on their website?

363
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,028
Testimonials, seminar photos.

364
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,226
Who do we have here?

365
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,961
At the head of the class.

366
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,258
The teacher's pet.

367
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,997
Bet she took her lessons to heart.

368
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,605
"introductory seminars every week-night."

369
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,277
Want to go for a little psychic drive?

370
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,751
I, you know, I don't see her.

371
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,483
Give her a little time, honey.

372
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,546
It's going to start.

373
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,594
We're supposed to wait for the
person who told us about GraceNote.

374
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,630
Just register and go in.
I'm sure she'll show up.

375
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,131
Well, I would, except Mr. Skeptic here...

376
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,791
We only knew what she told us,

377
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,335
we don't even know her name.

378
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,964
Maybe you know her. She said
her picture was on your webpage.

379
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,133
Could you look it up on your laptop?

380
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,505
Hey. Nice to see you.

381
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,481
That's her. There, in the front.

382
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,016
I don't know her.

383
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:03,315
Well, maybe someone in charge
does. What about him?

384
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,786
Bye, see you then.

385
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,255
That's Randall Fuller. He founded GraceNote.

386
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,986
Well, even better.

387
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,060
Mr. Fuller,

388
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,899
we were invited here by
someone who works for you.

389
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,491
We don't know that, honey.

390
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,694
Well...

391
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,268
You can see she's helping
with the seminar, right there.

392
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,740
Anyway, nobody seems to know her...

393
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,506
Nobody seems to know her...

394
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,216
You made us, didn't you?

395
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,513
What gave us away?

396
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,985
Her sensible shoes.

397
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,148
And her sleeve, it's shiny from
rubbing against your holster.

398
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,318
Oh, and your belt is scratched
where you clip your badge.

399
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,383
He's good.

400
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,726
Yeah, well, reading people
is part of what I do.

401
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,696
And to answer your question, Detectives,

402
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,132
she's probably a student volunteer.

403
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,069
Since everyone who attends our
seminars signs a photo release,

404
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,367
we'd have no way of identifying her.

405
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,440
What about Doug Morgan?

406
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,171
He attended your seminars.

407
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,977
Thousands of people have.

408
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,646
And right now, some of those people
are in there waiting for me.

409
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,782
You're welcome to join us. Peggy'll
give you some forms to fill out.

410
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,029
4 hours without a bathroom break.

411
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,622
I thought I was gonna pop a valve.

412
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,637
4 hours of constant promises of a
better life or a more confident self.

413
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,798
It was a sales pitch
for their weekend seminar,

414
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,705
which is a warm-up for their insight series,

415
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,176
the mentors program, the destiny workshops.

416
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,214
You could spend $30 grand
on the whole nine yards.

417
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,805
Is it a cult, mind control?

418
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,111
- No.
- Yes.

419
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,543
How reassuring.

420
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,611
They use the same psychological
coercion as cults.

421
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,212
So did the guy who sold me my car.

422
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,554
No one forced those people
to stay last night,

423
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:49,820
they were enjoying themselves.

424
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:54,388
They stayed because of peer-group
pressure, manufactured peer-group.

425
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,161
They pay to sit in a room for hours on end.

426
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,828
They submit to group hypnosis,

427
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,530
deep breathing, guided imagery...

428
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,370
That's a relaxation technique. Those people
did not look like zombies when they came out.

429
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:08,071
No, they were euphoric.
They got a shot of optimism.

430
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,841
It's very powerful. They can't
wait to repeat the experience.

431
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,439
So they sign up for another seminar.

432
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,006
If it helps them, what's the harm?

433
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:18,146
Is it possible it had a more
profound effect on Doug Morgan?

434
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:24,420
What, someone susceptible, unhappy,
with no clear sense of himself?

435
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,660
Look,

436
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,496
strip down all the double-talk,

437
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,009
what is it that Randall Fuller
really said to those people?

438
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,004
Everything that you've done is wrong.

439
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,274
Everything you are is false.

440
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,044
But it's not your fault,
you were programmed that way.

441
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,947
Leave it to GraceNote
to give you back your life.

442
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,287
It's very seductive.

443
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,723
And they just happened to pick
Doug to work their magic on?

444
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,954
Every participant signs a release form.

445
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,690
The small print gives them the
right to run a credit check.

446
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,891
They found the bank accounts under his name.

447
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,957
They knew before he did
how much money he was worth.

448
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,161
And they played him.

449
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,229
He can't be the first one.
Check with consumer affairs.

450
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,137
If we can establish a criminal pattern,

451
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,540
we can bring GraceNote to a crashing halt.

452
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:19,310
We went to one of their weekend seminars.

453
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,544
I used to feel so isolated, but…

454
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,987
after that weekend, I never felt so...

455
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,646
So alive?

456
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,953
And the 2 of you signed up for more classes.

457
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,727
No. Just me.

458
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,460
I had seminars every night,
every other weekend.

459
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,326
There were cruises.

460
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,064
What kept you going back?

461
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,697
Being in that room, being told that

462
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,866
my life had limitless possibilities.

463
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,305
I needed to keep hearing it.

464
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,713
Tell me how they got your money.

465
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,710
I was encouraged to make large gifts.

466
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,817
Encouraged you, specifically,
who encouraged you?

467
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:04,257
Well, at first, the higher-ups
in the organization.

468
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,318
And eventually, they
brought in Randall Fuller.

469
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,557
He was the closer.

470
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,599
Yeah, and he was very good at it.

471
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:12,397
By that point I wasn't thinking very clearly.

472
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,767
Why did you drop your complaint?

473
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,472
Was there a woman involved?

474
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,307
Yes.

475
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:33,616
I thought she was another student like me.

476
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,590
I see now I was being handled.

477
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,055
Yes.

478
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,933
That's her. That's her.

479
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,938
Lena Caruso.

480
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,138
He needs to see you.

481
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,213
I know. I'm meeting him tomorrow.

482
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,118
He's going out of town for the
day. It has to be tonight.

483
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,614
He's sorry.

484
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,452
That isn't a problem, is it?

485
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:25,266
A maid found her in a bathtub
in a motel room in Long Island City.

486
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,604
She'd opened her veins.

487
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,906
Yeah, I have hesitation cuts on this one.

488
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,446
Yeah. Same here.

489
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,544
She probably did it to herself.

490
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,414
Lips are cracked, gums are drawn back.

491
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,545
Cuticles are cracked pre-mortem.

492
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,957
Dehydration, starvation.

493
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,719
The GraceNote suicide diet.

494
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,231
Her family in Cleveland got
a letter from her 3 years ago.

495
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,735
Same format as Doug's.

496
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,135
I'm sorry, I'm grateful, I'm movin’ on.

497
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,501
That's the last they heard from her.

498
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,097
- And the Connelly's money?
- Gone.

499
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,642
Into GraceNote's coffers.

500
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:00,768
That hasn't been proven yet.

501
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,834
That's who she worked for.
That's why she's dead.

502
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,507
Even your dentist thought she was
just a student at GraceNote.

503
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,709
He also said that Fuller's the
one who closed the deals.

504
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:11,585
Look, Doug Morgan, he loved his
brother, he feared his father.

505
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,852
Fuller's the only one that could've
convinced him to kill both of them.

506
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,756
You believe it. I'm happy to prosecute it.

507
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,261
Just get Doug Morgan to confirm it.

508
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:24,224
Four hundred, five hundred, twelve hundred.

509
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,236
It goes on and on, Doug. All
the money you paid to GraceNote.

510
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,330
I took their classes because I wanted to.

511
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,872
They helped me a lot.

512
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,206
Well, tell us what you learned, Doug.

513
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,370
Well,

514
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,905
I learned that

515
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,382
I wasn't living a real life.

516
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,585
I was making decisions because of
things that happened to me in my past.

517
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,887
Right, you started questioning
everything you did.

518
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,224
Am I really making a free choice

519
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:55,527
or am I being controlled
by the bad programming in...

520
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,435
What is it GraceNote calls it,
my psychic drive?

521
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,662
Yes, because you can't trust the past.

522
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:06,676
There's what happened, and what
you tell yourself happened.

523
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,543
It was holding me back.

524
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,079
Holding you back from what?

525
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,341
From...

526
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,439
From being extraordinary.

527
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,882
It's hard to explain if you
haven't been through GraceNote.

528
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:23,449
Yes. They don't get it.

529
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:27,361
It was worth a lot to you, and you
showed your appreciation with gifts.

530
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,660
The money that you took from
your father, it wasn't for you,

531
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,826
you gave it to GraceNote.

532
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,267
As a gift.

533
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,329
Did Mr. Fuller know
where the money came from?

534
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,508
I told him my family gave it to me.

535
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,711
Doug, you remember the girl from the bank?

536
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,475
Her name was Lena. You met
her at GraceNote, right?

537
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,477
She was taking classes with me.

538
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,986
She helped you decide to make
those gifts to Randall Fuller.

539
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,283
We talked about it, but I decided.

540
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,986
Randall Fuller used Lena to convince
you to give that money to GraceNote.

541
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,154
He manipulated you into killing
your father and brother.

542
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,222
No, no, Lena is in love with me.

543
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,599
She decided to be with me.
She made that decision.

544
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,803
Fuller makes the decisions.

545
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,170
That's not true.

546
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,739
Doug, listen to me.

547
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:23,315
Lena is dead. She committed
suicide last weekend.

548
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,088
You see how her lips are chapped?

549
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,384
The cracked cuticles on her fingers?

550
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:39,769
Those are the same things we found
on your dad and your brother.

551
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,594
Lena was denied sleep,

552
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,230
food, water.

553
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,469
Doug, he broke her.

554
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,569
It's not true.

555
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,137
He drove her to suicide.

556
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,185
It's bad programming. It's
just a story from your past.

557
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,310
Doug, it's what happened.

558
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,717
No! You...

559
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:01,083
It's how you see it.

560
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,183
It's the story you tell.

561
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,989
It's how you see it.

562
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,929
It's not the way it is.

563
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,365
You can't differentiate one
thing from another, you...

564
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,767
I know how it is.

565
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,272
I get it.

566
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,578
You don't. You're not clear.

567
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,779
I'm getting a sense my client
might be amending his plea.

568
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,792
Not guilty by reason of mental disease?

569
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,360
I don't know about an insanity defense,

570
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,163
but his credibility as a witness
against Fuller is doubtful.

571
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,932
Assuming he'd even testify against Fuller.

572
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:53,136
Must be frustrating,
a mind even you can't unlock.

573
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,972
Well, let's get someone who can.

574
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,877
The person who locked it in the first place.

575
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,413
On mike: your life, your day. Thank you.

576
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,248
- Mr. Fuller...
- I have a car waiting.

577
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,555
We'll take you wherever you like.

578
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,721
We asked you if you knew
a man named Doug Morgan.

579
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,026
He attended your seminars,
but you didn't remember him.

580
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,566
Right, I was in a hurry.

581
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,828
You mean, you remember him now?

582
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,131
Oh, yes, of course. He made
a large donation to GraceNote.

583
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,967
He told us a little over $2,000,000.

584
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:25,599
Yeah, somewhere in that neighborhood.
Why, is there a problem?

585
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:29,168
Yes, see, Doug Morgan stole that money
from his father's bookmaking operation.

586
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,577
I had no idea.

587
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,208
The girl we asked about, that student
volunteer, Lena Caruso, she helped him.

588
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,809
"Helped," that's a bit of an
understatement. She manipulated him.

589
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,183
I'm really sorry to hear it.

590
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,722
You don't know how sorry.

591
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,314
Because the money is proceeds
from an illegal enterprise.

592
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,381
The bookmaking.

593
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,553
The DA is moving to seize it
under the RICO act.

594
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,790
We're here to serve you with the papers.

595
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,198
This money was a gift.
You can ask Mr. Morgan.

596
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:56,597
Well, between us, Mr. Morgan isn't
making a lot of sense right now.

597
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:00,234
I'm sure your lawyer can work out
a repayment schedule with the DA.

598
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,077
But this money has been committed.

599
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,977
Look, we're innocent victims here.

600
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,572
You know what, to tell you the truth,

601
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,949
I don't care if you keep the money or not.

602
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,885
Right now, we have a problem with Mr. Morgan.

603
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,823
He confessed to the killing.

604
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,484
He confessed to stealing the money.

605
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,825
But right now, his present mental state,

606
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,057
I don't think his confession's gonna hold up.

607
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,301
Mr. Morgan was pretty unstable to start with.

608
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:31,172
Well, I mean, if you just have
a look at him for yourself,

609
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,438
maybe you'll be able to
straighten him out for us.

610
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,938
And if I straighten him out?

611
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,910
I'm sure the DA wouldn't
have a problem with

612
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,645
taking a look at your money problem.

613
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,653
You can't promise that!

614
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:49,420
I don't want him skipping out
on an insanity plea.

615
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,196
I'll fix it with the DA.

616
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,561
Just think about it.

617
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,833
The DA said that if you
help them with Morgan,

618
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,899
they won't push for restitution.

619
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,636
What if we just gave them the money outright?

620
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,978
They'll still insist on an audit.

621
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,951
If I'm unsuccessful,

622
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,014
if Morgan ends up more unstable than before,

623
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,119
do I still get to keep the money?

624
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,591
According to the DA, all
you have to do is try.

625
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,244
Mr. Fuller.

626
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,677
Hello, Doug.

627
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,846
Why don't you sit here.

628
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,687
You've been going through
a challenging time, Doug.

629
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,921
I'd like to assist you.

630
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,919
Mr. Cooper, you've explained to your client

631
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,123
that we're prepared to accept his claim

632
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:04,565
of sole responsibility for the two murders?

633
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,602
Yes, Mr. Carver, I did.

634
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:10,470
Before we proceed, we need precise details

635
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,771
of how you committed the crimes.

636
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,105
Do you understand?

637
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,412
Go ahead.

638
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,647
Well,

639
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,955
I took my father's money and he found out.

640
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,150
Hold on. We said precise details.

641
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,956
The money, how did you find out about it?

642
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,428
What's the hidden context, Doug?

643
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,224
I'm not a competent person.

644
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,167
I can't handle money.

645
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:46,642
I was getting my finances in order.

646
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,676
I sent away for my credit report.

647
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,009
The bank accounts were listed on the report.

648
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,549
Weren't you afraid your
father'd come after you?

649
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,185
I'm still a child, I let fear control me.

650
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,913
Yes, that's the context.

651
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,325
I wanted to use the money for a good purpose.

652
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,125
Something that I'm passionate about.

653
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:11,792
I wasn't afraid.

654
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,363
So, when your father came after you...

655
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:21,168
I took his gun, I made Jimmy tie
up Dad and I tied up Jimmy.

656
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,037
And then you kept them in that
motel room for 12 days?

657
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,582
Just you, alone, and those two guys?

658
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,751
I know this one.

659
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,611
I'm not strong.

660
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,717
I'm not powerful.

661
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,059
No one listens to me.

662
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,160
Yes, just me alone.

663
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:46,561
I made them give up the rest of the money.

664
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,831
I drove them to Dad's office.

665
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:56,404
And that's when you overcame
your biggest fear.

666
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,586
You changed your way of being.

667
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,015
Yes.

668
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,215
You killed your dad and
transformed your life.

669
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,095
Yes, I did.

670
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,893
And you killed your brother
for the same reason.

671
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,059
Yes.

672
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,270
The brother who loved you,
who watched out for you.

673
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,870
It wasn't real love.

674
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,910
The context wasn't authentic.

675
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,412
He watched out for me out of guilt.

676
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,205
It's old stuff.

677
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:34,976
It's in the past.

678
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,216
You killed your dad and you let it go.

679
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,345
Yes.

680
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,025
Well,

681
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,591
so then you became everything
that GraceNote promised you.

682
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,968
I mean, like it says right
here in the brochure.

683
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,976
Look, you became the creator
of your own destiny.

684
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,340
That's right. That's right.

685
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:10,152
Wow, look at you, you're a success story.

686
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,822
Doug's a success story.

687
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,750
Well, Detective...

688
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,455
Well, look at him. He's
the master of his own fate.

689
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,327
Put the past in the past.

690
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:24,867
He transformed his way of life.

691
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,994
He created his own destiny.

692
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,766
I think he hit the GraceNote trifecta.

693
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,534
Yes, Mr. Fuller?

694
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,871
In a manner of speaking, sure.

695
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,074
So, aren't you gonna use him
as a shining example

696
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,848
of what can be accomplished
with GraceNote's help?

697
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,728
I don't know about that.

698
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:56,364
But don't you want your
students to follow his example?

699
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,992
I would hope they would find another path.

700
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,598
Oh?

701
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,839
What do you mean?

702
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,611
You mean murder is not the right path?

703
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:21,182
I would have to say no, Detective.

704
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,084
So, he failed.

705
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:28,063
Wasn't killing his father a way
to free him from the past?

706
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,393
Of course not.

707
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,865
Do you hear that, Doug?

708
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,359
You failed the course.

709
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,869
You're the same scared loser you were,

710
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,770
when you joined GraceNote.

711
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,003
You... You told me if I killed him,

712
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,571
if I killed him, I'd make the break.

713
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,170
That's not true, Doug.

714
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,806
That's a myth you constructed.

715
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,646
You told me! You...

716
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,046
I did everything you told me, Mr. Fuller.

717
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,111
Everything?

718
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,181
To get the money, all the
money, and to kill them.

719
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,626
He said it would be the last
step to power, to excellence.

720
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,822
That's what you said.

721
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,660
That was a lie, Doug.

722
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,631
That was a big lie.

723
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,297
And that's why you killed Lena.

724
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,373
Did you? Did you do it?

725
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:17,140
Of course not. She slashed her
wrists, she committed suicide.

726
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,738
How do you know that, Mr. Fuller?

727
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,679
Well, I can't say exactly.

728
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,347
She knew someone at GraceNote.
They must've told me there.

729
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:32,122
The only people we informed
of her death were her parents,

730
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,629
but they weren't told how she died.

731
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:39,296
Randall Fuller, you are
under arrest for murder.

732
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,844
What did you do to my life?

733
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,274
It wasn't much of a life to begin with.

734
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,749
And I'm not sure the rest of yours
will be something to write home about.

735
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,359
At least Doug learned one
of GraceNote's lessons.

736
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,418
Taking responsibility for his actions.

737
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:09,431
Something even Randall Fuller couldn't do.

738
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,593
Well, he'll have plenty of opportunity
to learn where he's going.
