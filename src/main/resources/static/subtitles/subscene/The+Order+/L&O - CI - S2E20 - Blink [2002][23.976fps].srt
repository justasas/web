1
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,992
House takes it with 21.

2
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,295
Pretty ladies bring me luck.

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,398
What's the limit?

4
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,701
$1,000.

5
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,874
25. The gentleman wins.

6
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:14,180
Gracias very much, pretty lady.

7
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,593
Penny, where were you last night?

8
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,127
I was home, finishing this for you.

9
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,394
You weren't home.

10
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,060
Are you still following me?

11
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,161
Penny, please, I just want
a chance to explain...

12
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,571
It's impossible, Gregg. Try to understand.

13
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,135
Penny.

14
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,850
Penny. Penny!

15
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,918
Here's your share.

16
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,420
We can go again on Thursday.

17
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,721
Okay.

18
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,789
Oh, and the chip down my dress?

19
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,392
Just playing the part.

20
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,162
Next time, leave the acting
to the drama majors.

21
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,667
Who helped you with this?
Your little Korean hot pot?

22
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,072
Don't call her that.

23
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,337
She worked out the algorithm,
but I did the rest.

24
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,437
Neediness is not an attractive
quality in a man, Gregg.

25
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,083
Neither is the inability to keep a secret.

26
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,319
Now, we agreed, no outside contractors.

27
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,945
I can handle Penny.

28
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,622
Then handle her.

29
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,125
The hair is different, but it's the same girl.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,245
You should double down.

31
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,907
Or Bart and Homer over there
will get the wrong idea

32
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,348
or the right one.

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,814
You're busted.

34
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,614
You and your friend better get out of here.

35
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:26,910
Penny?

36
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,521
Penny!

37
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,247
This is a dog park, Sir. 3 people
walking their dogs found her.

38
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,915
The way she's dressed, she could be working

39
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,960
any of the fine establishments
in the vicinity.

40
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,926
Working them hard, apparently.

41
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,559
There's almost $2,000 there.

42
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,032
Penelope Chai, math major at Hudson.

43
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,196
This bar code, is that the Department
of Defense security clearance?

44
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:57,731
Yeah. Once we saw that, we figured she
might actually be a rocket scientist.

45
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,177
Maybe somebody was after the state
secrets in her pretty head.

46
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,573
Fingers broken post-mortem.

47
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,686
It's like a signal or a warning or...

48
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:14,919
Yeah, she's got calluses
here and on her thumb.

49
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,761
Whatever she was doing here, this
was the wrong place to do it.

50
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,130
So the killer was standing in plain sight,

51
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,498
yet, he still took the time to...

52
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,202
to snap every one of her fingers. I...

53
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,236
He left the money, he didn't bother
to make it look like a robbery.

54
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,177
He's either stupid or cocky.

55
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,746
Yeah, or he didn't think we'd be fooled.

56
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,312
Paid us a compliment?

57
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,153
National security?

58
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,886
Penny's work didn't have
anything to do with that.

59
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:52,829
She designed predictive systems
for pattern recognition software.

60
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:53,988
To predict what?

61
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,864
Food procurement for the Quartermaster Corps.

62
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,394
And mess hall supplies.

63
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,997
Yes, we have a grant to
virtualize their procedures.

64
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,567
A grant. Does that mean Miss
Chai was paid for her work?

65
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,113
Oh, a very modest salary.

66
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,315
In fact, she asked me for a raise last month.

67
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,546
She said she needed to get an apartment.

68
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,179
But I had to tell her no.

69
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,053
She got the money somewhere.

70
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,215
She moved out of her dorm,

71
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,988
didn't leave a forwarding address.

72
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,119
Hmm.

73
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,495
Did she always keep her desk

74
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,501
this impersonal?

75
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,197
Just her style. Very guarded.

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,273
Was there anybody she let her guard down with?

77
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,066
She seemed to get along well with Amy.

78
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,839
Amy Wittlin. That's her desk
over there, with the palm tree.

79
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,077
Party Island.

80
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,709
Yeah.

81
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,848
Wow. Okay, uh, who's who?

82
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,488
That's Amy in the green bikini.

83
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,027
Rosalie, she's a junior
in the math department,

84
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,761
and Tomas Ramone, also a math major.

85
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,669
Freeport, Bahamas. The place
to be for math majors.

86
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,367
For what, duty-free calculators?

87
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,905
Predictive analysis.

88
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,805
Oh, my God. She was so nice.

89
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,572
What happened to her?

90
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,248
We're still sorting that out.

91
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,678
She was found in Chelsea,
over by the West Side highway.

92
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,381
She was pretty beat up.

93
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,886
Any of you know what she might
have been doing over there?

94
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,060
I'll give you a hint.

95
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,395
A card shoe. We're just fooling around.

96
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,960
Fooling around with cards?

97
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,838
For example, at the casinos at Freeport, hmm?

98
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,445
Play cards, hours on end,

99
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,915
you get calluses on your
forefinger, your thumb.

100
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,316
Like you and Penny.

101
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,516
Do you mind if I deal?

102
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,828
I heard that a blackjack deck

103
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,033
has a memory.

104
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:13,463
Keep track of the cards that are played,

105
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,268
you know the cards that are left.

106
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,835
If you're a math Wiz,
you can work out the odds

107
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,313
of, well... for every hand.

108
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,113
It's a predictive system
of pattern recognition.

109
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,017
That's what they'd call it.

110
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,817
I call it counting cards.

111
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,224
Is that what you were doing
last night? And she got caught?

112
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,189
- They wouldn't...
- Her fingers were broken.

113
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,894
You think somebody was trying to make a point?

114
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,309
It was this place on West 22nd. This...

115
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,942
This private club.

116
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,971
They came after us.

117
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,479
We got split up.

118
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,383
I thought she'd show up in the morning.

119
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,421
I swear to God, I just thought
they were trying to scare us.

120
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,084
Well, it worked.

121
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,428
We'll be in touch.

122
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:23,532
87, 213, 15, 9, 10, and 13. That's it.

123
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,602
Beautiful.

124
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,611
Just Beautiful.

125
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,879
Gregg, your program is so sweet.

126
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,075
Penny's dead.

127
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,147
The police found her
near the clubs last night.

128
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,278
Okay, take it easy.

129
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,618
Ken, look, I don't wanna be a
part of this anymore, okay?

130
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,316
I was doing it for her. But now...

131
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,586
For her?

132
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,559
If I thought that you were doing this
just to get back into her pants,

133
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,655
I wouldn't have brought you
into it in the first place.

134
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,790
I told you...

135
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,859
You and Penny wasn't in the cards.

136
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,706
You'll get other women. Believe me.

137
00:09:56,396 --> 00:10:00,708
Just don't wimp out on us.
Because it's not what you do,

138
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,304
it's what you get done.

139
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,311
4 weeks and she was still living out of boxes.

140
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,522
Eames, sounds like the hard drive is running.

141
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,927
It could be defragmenting the drive.

142
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,955
Or erasing it.

143
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,536
It's password protected.

144
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,901
Security software's overriding the off switch.

145
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,079
It's locked in. Can't pull
the battery. Shall we hack?

146
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,209
Password programs usually give
you a hint after three tries.

147
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,092
San-nakji. That's some hint.

148
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,761
It's octopus stew.

149
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,190
I did a 6-month tour in South Korea.

150
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,462
They use live octopus. The
tentacles get up your nose.

151
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,834
It's hilarious.

152
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,168
A riot. Trying "octopus".

153
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,310
Bingo.

154
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,349
The erase program's been running
almost 16 and a half hours.

155
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,281
It started after Penny was already dead.

156
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,684
They killed her, then came here.

157
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,024
And the program was set to
overwrite the data 33 times.

158
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:33,064
Whatever was on her computer, they
wanted it erased beyond recovery.

159
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,499
Probably because it leads back to them.

160
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,702
Too bad for them. They did
a better job erasing her.

161
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,312
Our computer nerds recovered
the last file deleted

162
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,544
before the erase program was activated.

163
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,554
It looks like software
to generate random numbers.

164
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,352
Her professor said it wasn't
part of her defense work.

165
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:57,088
A random number generator doesn't sound
like something a card counter would use.

166
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,629
She wouldn't.

167
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,995
It's a predictive system, it's her specialty.

168
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,331
It's the kind of software that
she'd write for someone else.

169
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,935
Maybe the same person that she's hiding from.

170
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,530
She's moved out of her dorm into a sublet.

171
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,803
She's been living out of her suitcases.

172
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,242
Lots of photos of her family in Raleigh,

173
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,937
of her at her prom, with her
Korean-American boyfriend.

174
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,084
So this nice hometown girl was being stalked

175
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,951
and none of her friends knew?

176
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,618
Well, maybe she didn't talk the
talk, but she was walking the walk.

177
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,487
She dropped 3 classes the
week before she moved.

178
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,829
One of them, multi-variable calculus,

179
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,129
was a requirement for her major.

180
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,728
If she drops it, she doesn't graduate.

181
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,933
Yeah, but she did drop it.

182
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,171
Penny Chai? I don't know, I might have
been in some of her classes. So what?

183
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:55,447
No, see, Gregg, you were the
only guy in all 3 classes.

184
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,818
The 3 classes she dropped.

185
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,649
Her super at the sublet
recognized you from a photo.

186
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,418
She saw you in front of the building.

187
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,460
What were you doing outside her building?

188
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,528
I was...

189
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,302
I was doing a project with her.

190
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,133
I was waiting for her to get home.

191
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,197
Random number generator.
We found it on her computer.

192
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,174
Yeah. Right.

193
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,919
It generates lottery numbers.

194
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,748
It's legal. It just...

195
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,786
it just increases the odds of winning.

196
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,381
Well, we like that.

197
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,152
How does it work?

198
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,161
This equation here, what's "X"?

199
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,696
It's anything you want, it's a variable.

200
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,159
Oh, okay, um...

201
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,031
"X" times 4 over 12. What's 4?

202
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,708
It's a constant. It's just
a unit of measurement.

203
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,107
- 4 is a unit?
- Yes.

204
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,646
- What does it measure?
- Nothing.

205
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,147
It doesn't measure anything.

206
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,513
Look, it's not even finished yet. Okay?

207
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,644
It's not even gonna be finished,
so just leave me alone.

208
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,986
A unit of measurement.

209
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,052
4 of something is a unit.

210
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,862
4 of what?

211
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,434
"X" times 4 divided by 12.

212
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,870
12, what do you think, inches?

213
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,907
A unit of measurement that's 4 inches long.

214
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,981
Of course.

215
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,320
He's usually at Milligan's after 7:00.

216
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,723
Somebody I know?

217
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,988
Somebody my Dad knew.

218
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,758
It could be hands, if this
is what you think it is.

219
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,800
The only unit of measurement
4 inches long is a hand.

220
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,999
Hands are how you measure
horses from hoofs to Withers.

221
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,503
This is about horses.

222
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,381
And this measurement here...

223
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,007
Ah! Eighth of a mile. Furlongs.

224
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,244
The length of the track.

225
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,376
Yes.

226
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,284
And these equations here,

227
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,323
win-loss,

228
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,015
one for the beast, one for the jockey.

229
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,561
Are you the girl he brought to the funeral?

230
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:21,861
'Cause if I didn't say it
then, you are very lovely.

231
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,628
I didn't bring anyone to the funeral.

232
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,897
This program is for handicapping horse races.

233
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,502
Does it work?

234
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,066
About as well as the system his father used.

235
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,504
He used to check the horses out

236
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,672
in their stalls before the race,

237
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,343
see if their ears were up or
down and bet accordingly.

238
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,587
Well, maybe that's the point of all this.

239
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,987
A gimmick to sell to gamblers?

240
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,855
It has the veneer of logic, doesn't it?

241
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,891
And it factors in every variable.

242
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,862
And does so very elegantly.

243
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,333
If you could use this
for credible justification

244
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,529
of any long shot bet,

245
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,834
even suspicious ones, it would, right, Ferdie?

246
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,934
Yes, it would. It would at that.

247
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,713
No playing with Daddy's stuff, Captain.

248
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,752
Come over here with
Uncle Gregg and Uncle Phil.

249
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,117
Ken, please, we need you to focus.

250
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,951
On what? You girls need to cowboy up.

251
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,048
Those cops are shooting in the dark.

252
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,751
You don't know what they know.

253
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,021
So I'll find out.

254
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,825
Guys, it's just a hiccup. Go home.

255
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,123
Okay?

256
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,326
Go to the gym, do something.

257
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,493
And just relax.

258
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,144
I have to go out later, just for an hour.

259
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,150
I have to cool these guys down.

260
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,882
Maybe they're right. Maybe
this time it's pushing it.

261
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,340
They ran a full schedule at Del Mar.

262
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,176
You know, we could run the winners
and the losers through the program.

263
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,993
Anything missing from your desk?

264
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,764
No, but I don't remember
leaving these files like this.

265
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:40,127
Well, my notepad's missing the top sheet.

266
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,433
This Post-it was on my
phone, not on my blotter.

267
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,109
You see anyone at my desk?

268
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,207
Yeah. Plain clothes from the 58.

269
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,778
He had a visitor's clip. He was here
when I came on shift an hour ago.

270
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,151
He said you told him to wait for you.

271
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,523
Well, what did he look like?

272
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,562
Caucasian, average height,

273
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:08,064
hat, puffy coat, tinted glasses and a scarf.

274
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,800
He skimmed these folders but he
read the one on Penelope Chai.

275
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,668
I clipped the autopsy report
to my notes on Tomas Ramone.

276
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,240
He moved the clip.

277
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,377
He wanted to know what we have.

278
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,746
Yeah, he entered the lion's den.

279
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,574
Bold.

280
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,176
He's out of his mind.

281
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,413
No, it's worse. He doesn't know fear.

282
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,127
He signed in using ID stolen from a messenger.

283
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,032
He came in during the shift change.

284
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,197
So nobody paid any attention.
These are useless.

285
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,570
Either his head's down or he's turned away.

286
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,236
He came in with the vaguest of
plans and then he winged it.

287
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,609
He's smart, he adapts.

288
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,045
He's dancing on a high wire.

289
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,546
If there's a leader in this scam, he's it.

290
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,519
So now, everything we know
about the scam, he knows.

291
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,021
Well, he doesn't know we know this.

292
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,852
You fix a race, one way to get caught

293
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,619
is to put a heavy bet on a long shot winner.

294
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,287
And the racing board will want to
know why you bet on that horse.

295
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,988
This program will give him an answer.

296
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,292
I fix a race,

297
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,300
I put every variable about
my horse in the program.

298
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,768
I do the same thing with
every horse in every race.

299
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,035
The program uses a combination
of my winning horse's variables

300
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,239
to pick horses in other races
for me to bet on.

301
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,074
If anybody questions your winning bet,

302
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,877
you can point to your other bets
and your handicapping system.

303
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,349
It turns my long shot winner

304
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,354
into some lucky pick by
a sucker with a system.

305
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,951
It's a smoke screen.

306
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,051
Now we just need to pick out the
sucker who's been using this system.

307
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,388
This program was created two weeks ago,

308
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,228
which means running two weeks'
worth of racing results

309
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,790
through the program.

310
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,364
Can't be too tough for the State Racing Board.

311
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,706
That's right. I made the
bet last Saturday afternoon

312
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,574
at the OTB on Queens Boulevard.

313
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,240
We're investigating muggings
of OTB customers there.

314
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,782
Well, if I'd seen anyone get mugged,

315
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,512
you're the first people I
would've called. How did you...

316
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:12,044
Through the tax form you filled out
when you collected your winnings.

317
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,614
That was a real red-letter day for you, huh?

318
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,094
Winning $10,000 on that long shot bet.

319
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,092
I got lucky.

320
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,161
You know, I heard

321
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:27,403
that people that play the ponies a
lot, they develop their own system.

322
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,207
I don't play a lot.

323
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,300
- Sorry. You need a hand?
- I don't.

324
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,941
Thanks.

325
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,674
My partner's the mountain goat.

326
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,842
I have a little problem with heights.

327
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,975
How about you?

328
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,179
My mother's father was Mohawk.

329
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,722
He used to tell stories about working
high steel. It sounded like fun.

330
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,156
So you became an engineer?

331
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,454
Where'd you get your degree?

332
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,119
Hudson. Two years ago.

333
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,728
What's that frat for engineers?
Engineers, mathematicians?

334
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,497
Alpha Beta Pi.

335
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,501
That's the one. You a brother?

336
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,298
I joined for the keggers.

337
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,370
Watch your step.

338
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,509
- Just don't look down.
- Yeah, easy for you to say.

339
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,980
You know, I can't...

340
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:14,847
I just can't stop thinking
about that long shot bet, Ken.

341
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,049
Walking in off the street,

342
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,758
hitting a 16-to-one long shot.

343
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,293
Yeah, you're right.

344
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,597
Last week, I heard one of the subs
talking, he knew a guy who knew a guy,

345
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,222
so I bet the horse.

346
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,833
Is there something wrong with
your jaw? I saw you working it.

347
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,338
I popped an eardrum, cave
diving off Maui last year.

348
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,602
Cave diving. Not in a million years.

349
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,540
One wrong move and you're fish bait.

350
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,807
That's the attraction, isn't it, Ken?

351
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,472
You just have to keep your cool.

352
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,385
Testing yourself.

353
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,351
And that's why you're...

354
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,389
you're up here instead of in the
office, with the real engineers.

355
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,855
I like being in the arena,
making things happen.

356
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,165
Yeah, thinking on your feet. Otherwise, what?

357
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,930
You get restless?

358
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,710
You see, I see now.

359
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,049
You have a reduced startle response.

360
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,983
I mean, most people, when they

361
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,487
almost take a header off a
building, you know, they...

362
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,560
For me, example.

363
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,891
They get scared.

364
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,063
Their eyes open wide, they blink big.

365
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,635
It's called an increase in blink
magnitude. But you, not you, you know.

366
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,374
No, it didn't bother you a bit.

367
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,906
You panic, you die.

368
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,842
Yeah.

369
00:22:56,642 --> 00:23:00,215
Harris has no known association
with gambling syndicates.

370
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,686
Closest he's been to horses is taking
his son for a pony ride to the zoo.

371
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,127
He went to the same school as
Gregg Monroe and Penny Chai.

372
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:12,499
He was in the same frat. His bets
conformed to the computer program.

373
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:16,300
Can't Harris just be a young
engineer who made a lucky bet?

374
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,708
A young engineer with
no discernible fear response.

375
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:27,382
People like him, they become
firefighters, race car drivers,

376
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:31,245
or tweak the upbringing another way,

377
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,655
they become psychopaths.

378
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,157
Which way did Harris get tweaked?

379
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,387
At Hudson, he was a member
of the skydiving club,

380
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,951
he's been a volunteer firefighter...

381
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,292
Definitely a miscreant.

382
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,162
On the other hand, his DMV records

383
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,265
show 3 speeding tickets from high school.

384
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:51,197
Two of which he was going 80 miles
an hour in a 35-mile-an-hour zone.

385
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,279
Look, he has what it took

386
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,647
to sneak into this building.

387
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,685
It's very thin, people.

388
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:06,917
Let me know when you have something
that sticks to the spoon.

389
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,152
A couple of clowns.

390
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,528
Especially the big guy. I can't
believe they rattled you.

391
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,431
They're not clowns. They
found you, didn't they?

392
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,664
Time to bail. We made $10,000, that's cool.

393
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:25,504
That's cool? Remind me again how deep
you are in the hole, Mr. Dotcom.

394
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,043
$250,000?

395
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,276
How're you gonna make the
bets? The cops know you.

396
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,747
They don't know you. That's what matters.

397
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,408
Let me worry about putting the bets down.

398
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,543
You never worry. You don't worry about us,

399
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:39,020
you don't worry about Penny getting
killed. Why is that, Ken?

400
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,452
You got something to say, Gregg?

401
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,929
Say it to those cops. Right
there in that building there.

402
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,625
Eleventh floor. Goren and Eames. Go ahead.

403
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,328
Nobody's going to the police, Kenny.

404
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,735
If you do, have the freaking
decency to give me a head start.

405
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,031
Talk to you tomorrow.

406
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,674
I'm scared too, Kenny.

407
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,848
Sometimes I wish you could
feel what it's like.

408
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,848
But I don't.

409
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,893
The only way I can do this
is if you believe in me.

410
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:22,891
Now, just let me get through this one thing,

411
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,526
then I'll hang it up. Okay?

412
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,466
The racing board reeled him in this morning.

413
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,304
He made a series of bets on
his credit card two days ago

414
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,177
that lined him up with the computer program.

415
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,148
This is Mr. Cooley of the State Board.

416
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,282
- Hey.
- Hi.

417
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,888
And that's Bannerman?

418
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,619
He was in promotions
at Aqueduct until last year,

419
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,595
when a security check showed he'd run
up over $300,000 in gambling debts.

420
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,756
He knows jockeys, trainers.

421
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,300
He's ready to talk.

422
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,499
I fixed a race at Belmont

423
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,675
and I used this computer
program to make it look legit.

424
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,468
That's it.

425
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,807
How'd you fix the race?

426
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,144
No, no, no. That comes later
after we hammer out a deal.

427
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,810
Well, can he at least tell us where
he found the computer program?

428
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,853
From this Oriental chick
I met in Atlantic City.

429
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,287
I noticed her counting cards in a casino.

430
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,688
I threatened to turn her in

431
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,892
unless she would, you
know, come up to my room.

432
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,790
I told her about my
association with racing

433
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,565
and she told me she was working
on this betting program.

434
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,469
We decided to work together.

435
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:40,642
But as soon as I got the program
from her, I didn't need her.

436
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:49,947
Penny,

437
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,356
she had a very thick Korean accent and...

438
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,892
Did you have trouble understanding her?

439
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,259
Yeah, at first, but I got used to it.

440
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:10,633
We'll discuss your offer and
we'll get back to you next week.

441
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,538
Next week? We can resolve this today.

442
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,640
No, I'm going to the islands
tomorrow. I'll be back Tuesday.

443
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,410
We'll let you know then.

444
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,280
Bannerman's a diversion.
He never met Penny Chai.

445
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,754
They threw him at us to buy time.

446
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,485
Harris and Monroe? Awfully
sophisticated for a couple of frat boys.

447
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,651
Got him.

448
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,820
A list of Kastner's past clients.

449
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,363
All members of the Israeli mob.

450
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,730
Bannerman's probably in hock to them.

451
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,562
Playing patsy to... that's his
way of paying off his debt.

452
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,168
The Israeli mob's behind this scam?

453
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,774
They are now.

454
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,110
Ken Harris felt us closing in on him.

455
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,914
The normal man would quit.

456
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,515
Not him.

457
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,253
No, instead he partners up with the
most vicious criminals he can find,

458
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,156
raising the stakes because...

459
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,723
Well, it's his nature.

460
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,263
Bannerman charged his bets
on his credit card, right?

461
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:16,295
Using a dial-up account at an OTB office.

462
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,769
Now, how did Harris make his bets?

463
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,867
Credit card, doesn't say which one.

464
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,571
Well, we need the actual charge.

465
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,547
Check his credit card report to find the card.

466
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:32,419
His credit's good, just the usual
credit inquiries from a car dealership,

467
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,287
department stores, an
insurance company last week.

468
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,619
Here, 3 credit cards. I'll try
the one with the higher limit.

469
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,495
- What?
- Here we go.

470
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,265
$500 at the OTB last week.

471
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,862
This charge is credited to Totalizer Inc.

472
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,476
That's the same as Bannerman's charge.

473
00:28:56,535 --> 00:29:00,950
It must be a company for processing
dial-up betting accounts.

474
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,711
Well, you have two bites at fixing a race.

475
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,589
Before it's run and you know, right after.

476
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:13,289
You can't change the results, but
maybe you can change the bets.

477
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:20,594
And I'll bet that we'll find
a frat brother at Totalizer.

478
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,940
Where is he? I got a text-message
to meet him here.

479
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:29,069
He's probably putting his kid to sleep.

480
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,943
So, big day tomorrow.

481
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,716
How you doing, huh? You
mind if I take a load off?

482
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,946
Hey, what're you frat boys drinking?

483
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,288
That's okay, Detective Goren,
we were just leaving.

484
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,384
This seat taken? How you
doing, Phil? Alex Eames.

485
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,587
Hi.

486
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,894
Oh, and don't worry about Ken.
We sent you those messages.

487
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,024
Yeah.

488
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,398
We wanted to meet the real
brains behind the operation.

489
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,834
Especially you, Phil.

490
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:58,363
The man who found the flaw in the way
Totalizer processes dial-up bets.

491
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,070
They told us they don't
process the dial-up bets

492
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,773
until the first 4 races of the day are run.

493
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:08,306
Which means that someone working
in data security at Totalizer

494
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,876
could change the bets of those 4 races.

495
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:14,517
You know, change losing
bets into winning bets.

496
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,419
Kind of like waving a wand.

497
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:21,291
I'm not the only person in
data security, okay?

498
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,299
You can't put this on me.

499
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,459
You covered yourself really good, Phil.

500
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,068
You really did. You have
nothing to worry about.

501
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,033
Especially from us. I mean, nothing at all.

502
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,276
You wanna know Ken's secret?

503
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,115
He's incapable of experiencing fear

504
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,678
and well, that means...

505
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,581
It means he's a menace.

506
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,127
Especially with people that
he gets into business with,

507
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,891
you know, people like you two.

508
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,932
Have you met Ken's new partners?

509
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,496
This is Ralph Bannerman.

510
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,563
Bannerman's lawyer, Frank Kastner,

511
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:07,273
a few of Mr. Kastner's regular clients.

512
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,012
Bookmaker, bookmaker,

513
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,541
leg-breaker,

514
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,617
murderer, another leg-breaker,

515
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,509
and they're all members of the Israeli mob.

516
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,856
They're Ken's new partners. Which
means, they're your new partners, too.

517
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,195
He didn't tell you?

518
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,961
Boy, that Ken. He's just
full of surprises, isn't he?

519
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,557
You know, there's another surprise
that he kept from you, Gregg?

520
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,537
Somebody tried to erase the random
numbers program from Penny's computer.

521
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,738
After she was killed.

522
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:42,541
Who else, besides you, knew that
Penny helped you write that program?

523
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,349
Ken killed her.

524
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:58,394
And now he's on the way to
getting the both of you killed.

525
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,056
It's up to you, if he'll succeed.

526
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,195
Right.

527
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:14,142
That's 10 groups of 8 picks,
6 tickets on the Orlando Derby.

528
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,701
Total, $160,000.

529
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,975
No, thank you.

530
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:24,149
Now we send my buddy the confirmation
numbers, we let him do the rest.

531
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,449
Trust me.

532
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,251
We can't lose if we tried.

533
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,542
3 winners across the board.

534
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,378
I'm not showing a win
on these confirmation codes.

535
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,278
That can't be right.

536
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,879
We got 8 picks, 6 winners in each group.

537
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,084
I'm looking at your bets right here.

538
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,285
No winners.

539
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,718
Sorry, son.

540
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,490
Let's talk outside.

541
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,234
Let me get in touch with my guy.
We can figure this out.

542
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,966
I figured out you just cost me $160,000...

543
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,132
Excuse me.

544
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,736
We need to borrow your friend here.

545
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,106
Hey, come on, guys.

546
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,249
It's only for a couple of hours.

547
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,717
You can catch up to him later, all right?

548
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,117
My wife and kid. If those
guys think I cheated them...

549
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,719
There's no "if", Ken.

550
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,733
Mrs. Harris, we're with the police.

551
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,701
Oh, my God, Ken. Has something happened?

552
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,033
He's been arrested.

553
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,665
You need to come down to the station with us.

554
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,010
I'll get my son.

555
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,777
It figures. Those two wusses
would make me the fall guy.

556
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,014
I thought I was making legitimate bets.

557
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,955
I had no idea Phil and Gregg
had rigged the system.

558
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,288
And your little scam
with your Israeli friends?

559
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,295
They didn't look happy you ripped them off.

560
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,059
All I have to say about that
is, you people set me up.

561
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:19,261
Really hung my ass in the
breeze. But that's okay.

562
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,326
I'm in here with you. They're out there.

563
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,896
Well, that's good short-term thinking, Ken.

564
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,936
You're charged with one
count of betting fraud.

565
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,307
A "D" felony.

566
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,276
I can have you arraigned by 2:00.

567
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,476
I can agree to your release
by your own recognizance

568
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,919
and have you on the street lickety-split.

569
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:42,356
With no chance of making it to
the subway station in one piece.

570
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,452
Or you can plead guilty to
the murder of Penelope Chai

571
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,428
and serve your time in isolation,

572
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,399
under the protection of the
Department of Correction.

573
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,163
I like Plan A better.

574
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,400
Plan A is a death sentence.

575
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,603
I'm not afraid of the Israelis.

576
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,404
Believe me, I've been in hairier situations.

577
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,206
Cave off of Maui.

578
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:07,012
That's a walk in the park. I once had a
parachute pack refuse to open at 15,000 feet.

579
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:10,417
I opened it with a pen
knife, 3,000 feet to spare.

580
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,379
Don't you get scared?

581
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,315
You know, like most people?

582
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:17,886
You know...

583
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,057
I mean, you don't get scared at all?

584
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,124
I wonder why?

585
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,862
It's a gift.

586
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,170
It allows me to push myself
harder than other people.

587
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:35,302
You can always trick yourself into
believing that you're invincible.

588
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,178
If somebody tags me with a laser
sight, I'm gonna keep going.

589
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,046
Your wife, Kerry,

590
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,018
is that why she's attracted to you?

591
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,686
Because of your self-confidence?

592
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,423
You'll have to ask her.

593
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,289
I'll tell you this,

594
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,298
she's the reason I get
out of bed in the morning.

595
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,405
She's my prayer warrior.

596
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,645
She believes in you. It's important.

597
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,444
She knows I'll never let her down.

598
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,757
You wanna know how she's doing?

599
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,652
Cause we can...

600
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,724
Come on.

601
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,365
Your son's watching cartoons
with a social worker.

602
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,133
Why is Kerry in that room? She doesn't
have anything to do with anything.

603
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,231
I wanna talk to her.

604
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,437
Since you're under arrest,
Mr. Harris, I can't allow it.

605
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,579
But I can see her. I'm allowed to talk to her.

606
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,750
If there's anything that
you need to say to her,

607
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,685
you know, give her your love or...

608
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,496
How's my husband? When can I see him?

609
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,092
It shouldn't be much longer.

610
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,535
Your son's really liking those cartoons.

611
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,199
He's a very active child.

612
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,402
Just like his Dad, huh?
With all that scuba diving,

613
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,073
jumping out of planes.

614
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,275
It's a thrill a minute.

615
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,880
He trained hard to do those things.

616
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,351
Kid stays with you. That's smart.

617
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,888
Anything happens to Kenny,

618
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,496
his parachute doesn't open
or he runs out of...

619
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,361
He can take care of himself.

620
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,331
How long have you been together?

621
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,373
Since high school.

622
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,639
Those must've been exciting years for you.

623
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,781
We had a lot of fun.

624
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:57,718
Were you with him when he
got those speeding tickets

625
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:02,458
going 80 miles an hour
in a 35-mile-an-hour zone?

626
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,961
Was that fun?

627
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,695
You told him to slow down, didn't you?

628
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,963
But he didn't.

629
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,700
He wasn't scared?

630
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,932
He never gets scared?

631
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,040
Do you ever wonder why he can't sit still,

632
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:27,174
why he's always looking for stimulation?

633
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,115
He's not always like that.

634
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:34,154
According to his boss, he's
disruptive, he plays people.

635
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,256
Do you ever see him do that?

636
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,954
- No. People like Ken.
- He's manipulative.

637
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,496
He has a high tolerance for fear stimuli.

638
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,864
Do you understand what that means?

639
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:56,276
He has all the traits of
a certain personality type.

640
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,517
It's this type.

641
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:06,749
Here.

642
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,960
Psychopathic personality.

643
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,231
- This isn't Ken.
- No?

644
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,431
He knows he has to change.

645
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,669
Well, there's knowing, and there's doing.

646
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:29,973
He can do it.

647
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,642
She knows it.

648
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,707
You don't believe that.

649
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,217
Yeah, I do.

650
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,378
Kerry.

651
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,786
You know what kind of man
you hitched your wagon to.

652
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,620
You know that he's not gonna change.

653
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,718
His fearlessness, this gift, it's a curse.

654
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,753
You know it's gonna get him killed.

655
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,127
No, it's...

656
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,360
Look, when you opened the door this afternoon,

657
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,333
I saw what you were thinking.

658
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,969
- Kenny's dead.
- No, I didn't think that.

659
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,096
Kenny's not gonna die.

660
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,415
Well, maybe you can explain this.

661
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:14,984
We saw this inquiry on Kenny's credit
reports from Colonial Trust Insurance.

662
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,490
They own Kenny's insurance policy, right?

663
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:25,667
Last week, you increased the benefit
from $200,000 to $2,000,000,

664
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,297
and Kenny doesn't know, does he?

665
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,911
You want to grow old with him.

666
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,872
You want your son to have a father.

667
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,222
But you looked at the odds,

668
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,255
and you're betting that
he ain't gonna make it.

669
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,759
What am I supposed to do?

670
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,938
He thinks he can't get hurt!

671
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,372
And he won't stop!

672
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,643
He just won't stop!

673
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,296
Well, there's your prayer warrior.

674
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:40,342
The woman who loved me, who had faith in me.

675
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,207
As far as she's concerned, your race is run.

676
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,652
Now, if you can't even
make her believe you anymore...

677
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,551
What chance do I really have?

678
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,890
You're...

679
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,557
You're feeling it now.

680
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,495
It's searching you out.

681
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,400
Laser sight.

682
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,066
I gotta run the odds.

683
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:15,910
I gotta be quick about it.

684
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:18,038
How much time do I have?

685
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,679
How much time before it hits the...

686
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,460
Now do we have your attention?

687
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,433
I'll take the deal.

688
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,430
You'll plead to Miss Chai's murder?

689
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:46,834
Yes.

690
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,411
I want protection.

691
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,977
For your wife and child?

692
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,948
For me.

693
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,392
Wow. Will wonders never cease? He blinked.

694
