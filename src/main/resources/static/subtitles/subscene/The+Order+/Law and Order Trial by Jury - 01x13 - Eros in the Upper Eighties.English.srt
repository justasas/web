00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,694
<i>[Man Narrating]
In the criminal justice system...</i>

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,137
<i>all defendants are innocent
until proven guilty,</i>

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:11,576
<i>either by confession,
plea bargain or trial byjury.</i>

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,874
<i>This is one of those trials.</i>

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:19,084
She had such great taste.

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:23,953
Simple, elegant, but edgy.

7
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,790
<i>I was on my way to yoga
this morning,</i>

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,523
and I saw her door was ajar,

9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,260
so l-I opened it.

10
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,497
And there she was on the floor,
covered in blood.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,970
Her face was-

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,974
[Sniffles]
It was awful.

13
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,611
We can talk later.

14
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,088
So-
[Clears Throat]

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,419
Steak knife was right about here,

16
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,827
five feet from the body.

17
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,833
How old?
Turned 18 a week ago.

18
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,427
Hell of a birthday present.

19
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,166
<i>Pretty.
Yeah.</i>

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,572
Especially for a guy.

21
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,176
Name's Carlos Martinez.

22
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,982
<i>Rumor has it Carlos Martinez
got his ass kicked...</i>

23
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,145
three nights ago
in a bar on 158th Street.

24
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,018
<i>By whom?
A kid named Luis Ramirez.</i>

25
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,084
Hey, you Luis?

26
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,152
Detective Ravell, N.Y.P.D.

27
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,630
We need to talk to you
about Carlos Martinez.

28
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,826
Okay.
He got killed last night.

29
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,200
Yeah.
Oh. I didn't know that.

30
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,434
- What happened to your eye?
- Basketball. I caught an elbow.

31
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,976
<i>Aw, same thing happened
to me last year. Broke my nose.</i>

32
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,639
Where do you play, the gym on
166th? No, the "Y" on 155th.

33
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,648
They play fours or fives
up there? Um, fours.

34
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,946
See, that's a better game. The
lanes don't get so crowded, right?

35
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,283
Yeah. We were hoping to
go down to the station,

36
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:06,849
clear up a few things. Yeah,
it won't take long, 10 minutes.

37
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,755
We can get a warrant if you
want. Uh, no, no, no, that's okay.

38
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,765
Ten minutes, right?
Not even. Come on.

39
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,860
<i>[Luis] I met her at a club two
weeks ago. She had a black dress on.</i>

40
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,871
She looked hot.

41
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,136
I saw the pictures.
Exactly.

42
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,667
So you know what I'm sayin'.
Hell, yeah. So, what happened?

43
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,906
So we smoked a- a-

44
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,078
Come on.
I'm Homicide, not Narcotics.

45
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:41,092
We got high, and then, um,
you know, we fooled around.

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,358
But I thought she was a woman
named Angelina.

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,364
I mean, she had-

48
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,230
Breasts.
Right.

49
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,566
But then my friend
tells me she's a guy.

50
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,301
And I'm like, " No way.
She's a chick and hot.' '

51
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,935
But he kept saying that I was wrong,
that I got played.

52
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,741
So, the other night we went
down to Club 186 lookin' for her.

53
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,338
Mm-hmm.
And then what?

54
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,442
And then we took her into the bathroom,
and we pulled down her skirt.

55
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,114
And you saw she wasn't a woman.
Right, and I flipped out.

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,591
<i>So I started yelling, and she
slapped me. She slapped me.</i>

57
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,886
So, I hit her back, and she ran
out the door. You go after her?

58
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,727
No.

59
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,332
Come on, Luis.
Don't lie to me.

60
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,874
I've been straight
with you, right?

61
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,776
Maybe I should talk
to a lawyer.

62
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:39,215
Sure, if you want.

63
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,845
You just give me the word,
and I'll stop.

64
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,583
But I gotta tell ya,
once lawyers get involved,

65
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,387
things get very complicated.

66
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,452
I mean, I can't talk to you.
You can't talk to me.

67
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,828
Which means I can't hear
your side of the story.

68
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,625
He's so damn cocky.

69
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,510
Luis, we know you did it.

70
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,907
[Scoffs]
What?

71
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:14,420
A guy saw you walking out of Carlos's
building with blood on your pants.

72
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:19,254
And on top of that, we found your hairs
in the apartment. D.N.A. Doesn't lie.

73
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,789
This is your last chance to come clean, Luis.
Otherwise I gotta call the D.A.' s office.

74
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,767
I didn't mean to kill her.
[Sobbing]

75
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,498
Of course you didn't.

76
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:37,236
She had a knife and I knocked it
away, and we just started fighting.

77
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,109
I didn't mean to kill her though.

78
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:48,517
I swear to God. It just-
It just kinda happened, you know?

79
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,423
<i>[Sobbing] I didn't mean to
kill her. I swear to God.</i>

80
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,484
You believe him?
Do I ever?

81
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,911
His prints are all over the apartment.

82
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,971
What about the knife?
Still waiting on lab results.

83
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,643
Well, either way, it supports
his self-defense claim.

84
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,177
Except he wasn't cut.
And he didn't call 911.

85
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,088
Well, charge him with murder,
but be careful.

86
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:03,458
I know. Men in tight dresses
make lousy victims. Exactly.

87
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,933
<i>In light of the violent nature
and the gravity of the crime,</i>

88
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,300
we request that Luis Ramirez
be held on remand.

89
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,205
<i>[Judge] Ms. Mendez? Mr.
Ramirez has no criminal record,</i>

90
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,868
works part-time
and is a student at City College.

91
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,879
<i>His father owns a successful
plumbing business, employs 23 people-</i>

92
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:25,577
- Keep moving, counselor. - Mr. Ramirez
has deep-rooted ties to this city,

93
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,585
in particular, Washington Heights.

94
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,587
<i>My point, Your Honor, is-
Let me guess.</i>

95
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,886
- He's not a flight risk.
- Correct.

96
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,360
In the audience today are his parents,
sister, friends and a priest.

97
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,660
<i>Thanks for coming. Please be seated.
The defendant shall be remanded.</i>

98
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,666
<i>[Gavel Raps]</i>

99
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,063
You couldn't cut this kid
some slack? He killed someone.

100
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,771
In self-defense.
Nice to see you again, Ana.

101
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,747
Yeah, nice to see you too.
I'd shake your hand, but protocol.

102
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,182
I understand.

103
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,186
<i>Let's discuss this.
Who's she?</i>

104
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,916
She used to work here.
She was a prosecutor?

105
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,720
Yeah, good.
One flaw-

106
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,024
Sometimes she thought
the defendants were telling the truth.

107
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:16,835
<i>Angelina Martinez is the 26th
transgendered person assassinated this year,</i>

108
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,270
yet no one cares
because she was transsexual.

109
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,967
Killing a tranny
isn't like killing a regular person.

110
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,704
It's less evil.
Almost acceptable.

111
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,939
<i>[Continues, Indistinct] If the
self-defense theory falls apart,</i>

112
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,643
she'll turn Carlos into a promiscuous
freak who liked to trick straight boys.

113
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,517
Yeah, and then hide behind some gay
panic theory. It's worked before.

114
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,149
How dare you accuse my son
of murder! And for what?

115
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,284
<i>Because he got into a fight
with some joto? My son is-</i>

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,193
<i>- Hey, don't touch me!
- [Officer] Hey, hey!</i>

117
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:48,461
Is everything okay here?
Yeah, it's fine.

118
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,567
Okay, let's go.

119
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:57,234
He left school when he was 15
'cause of the abuse.

120
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,212
<i>Kids picking on him, beating
him up, calling him marica.</i>

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,308
[Sighs] But he was always a good kid.

122
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,376
Were you close?

123
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,892
But... we lost touch last year.

124
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:20,087
He was upset at me, because
I refused to call him Angelina.

125
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,101
I just-just couldn't do it.

126
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,596
I tried, but it never felt right.

127
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,200
Even when he was dressed like that,
he was still my boy Carlos.

128
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,338
Did he ever mention somebody
called Luis Ramirez?

129
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,011
Not to me. But like I said,
we haven't talked in a while.

130
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,524
<i>I met her two years ago
when she moved into my building.</i>

131
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,961
Became best friends right away.

132
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,795
We just... connected.

133
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,700
Well, would Carlos ever lie
about his identity?

134
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,896
You mean with men?
With straight men.

135
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,009
She liked to flirt.
I know that.

136
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:09,537
It made her feel good to pass.
It was like the ultimate compliment.

137
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:13,051
Would she ever have sex with someone
without letting him in on the secret?

138
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,418
I hope not. Say she's at a bar
and some guy's chatting her up.

139
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,823
Does Carlos say, "Don't get too
excited, big boy, I'm a guy,"

140
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,384
or does she sit there, smiling,
pretending she's J. Lo?

141
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,831
I'd like to think
she'd be honest, but-

142
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,028
But what?

143
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:35,563
Last few months, she'd wait for
them to ask. It was like a game.

144
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,242
- What if they didn't ask?
- She wouldn't tell.

145
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,144
<i>Did Carlos ever mention
a guy named Luis?</i>

146
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,514
Only man she talked about, last few
months anyway, was some hottie named Julio.

147
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,856
Lived in Chelsea. Said he
was the man of her dreams.

148
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,260
<i>It's hard to imagine having sex
with someone and not noticing-</i>

149
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,424
It wasn't that kind of sex.

150
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,626
And you had no idea he-

151
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,160
No. And if I did,
I would've stopped.

152
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,172
Why did you go to Carlos's
apartment that night?

153
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,467
To tell her to stop lying about me.

154
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,275
So the two of you
weren't a couple?

155
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,282
A couple?

156
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,649
I'm not gay.
We did it once, like I told you.

157
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,450
Right.

158
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,457
So what happened when you went
to Carlos's apartment?

159
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,494
She started-
He started.

160
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,496
Carlos is a man.

161
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:36,024
We need a jury to look at this as a fight
between two men, not a man and a woman.

162
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,934
When I got to his apartment,

163
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:45,501
I wanted to go tell him to stop
lying about me, and he flipped out.

164
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,547
He grabbed a knife.
I slapped it away.

165
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,674
And we started fighting. You thought he
was going to kill you, so you beat him up.

166
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,685
Right.

167
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,985
How many times
did you punch him?

168
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,422
The victim was struck
15 times in the head and face.

169
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,360
Fractured nose,
cheekbone, jaw.

170
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:10,068
And we got significant contusions and
edema in and around the cerebellum.

171
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,300
Any offensive wounds?
Nothing substantial.

172
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,342
So it wasn't really a fight.
Oh, it was a massacre.

173
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,537
Victim may have been knocked
unconscious after the first punch.

174
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,513
<i>[Gaffney] So the next 14 were
- Meant to kill.</i>

175
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,549
It was ugly.
No doubt.

176
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,085
Can you testify
to the first-punch theory?

177
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,589
Not yet,
but I'll keep diggin'.

178
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,057
Man two, four to 12,
sounds reasonable to me.

179
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:38,119
Are you kidding? Why don't we just send
him to bed without supper and call it a day?

180
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,190
- He's a good kid. - Who punched a
110-pound girl 15 times in the face.

181
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:46,364
- After he pulled a knife.
- You want a deal, go to Bloomingdale's.

182
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,431
<i>Their winter sale started
this morning. Just so you know,</i>

183
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,306
we already have two witnesses
prepared to testify...

184
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,539
they hooked up with Carlos
under false pretenses.

185
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,639
- So? - So he was playing
a dangerous game and-

186
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,550
And what?
Got what was coming to him?

187
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,395
File a motion to exclude all testimony
relating to Carlos's sex life.

188
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,988
What the hell
is he doing here?

189
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,727
<i>Help you, gentlemen?
We need to talk.</i>

190
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:22,633
One of my employees told me that
my son got in a fight with some-

191
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,937
with... a transsexual...

192
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,278
at Club 186.

193
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,285
<i>So I asked Luis about it,
and, uh,</i>

194
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,584
he told me
he and this person...

195
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,114
met a few weeks back,
had a drink, and-

196
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,688
But he thought that
this person was a girl.

197
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,791
[Speaking Spanish]

198
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:54,970
So I asked Luis how many people knew
about this person, and he said a lot.

199
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,875
That Carlos was spreading lies about
him, telling people that they were dating.

200
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:04,939
So I told Luis we must speak
to this man right away.

201
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,111
I mean, this is a young man's
reputation we're talking about.

202
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,121
An honorable Latino man.

203
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,123
I understand.

204
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,423
We went to Carlos's apartment,

205
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,964
and I told him to stop lying.

206
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,694
"My son made a mistake.
He thought you were a girl.

207
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:27,034
<i>I mean, déjalo ahí, you know,
leave it at that.' '</i>

208
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,438
But he started yelling,

209
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:34,571
this little-
this little tulip.

210
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,581
Calling me a bastard.

211
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,085
<i>"Chi chi cabrón," he kept saying.
"Chi chi cabrón.' '</i>

212
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,986
So, I told him to calm down.
You know, I just wanted to talk.

213
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,118
But he grabbed a knife,
and before I knew it, he cut me.

214
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,859
So l- I grabbed his wrist...

215
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,404
and I slammed it against the wall.

216
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,871
<i>And we fought.</i>

217
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,968
And when it was over,
he was dead.

218
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,379
Luis never touched that boy.

219
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:15,284
He confessed
because he's a good man.

220
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,345
A loyal son.

221
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,220
<i>Siéntese.</i>

222
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,807
Two confessions
for the same crime?

223
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,811
It's better than none.

224
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,747
Well, maybe not.
The jury could eat it up.

225
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,376
A father and son so loyal
that they both confess...

226
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,613
<i>to the same crime
to protect the other.</i>

227
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,713
Well, loyal, maybe, but it
doesn't mean they're not guilty.

228
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,420
<i>Well, since when does being guilty
guarantee a conviction?</i>

229
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,329
Hold off on indicting the father
until you corroborate his story.

230
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,267
We need to make sure he's telling
the truth and not playing hero.

231
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,732
<i>I was watching TVin bed when I
heard Orlando screaming at Luis.</i>

232
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,107
Screaming?

233
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,442
[Speaking Spanish]

234
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,813
Right. Talking.

235
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:24,288
<i>So I went to see what was going on, and
they were walking out the door. [Door Closes]</i>

236
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,690
Go upstairs, sweetie.

237
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,162
Are you okay, Mama?

238
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,256
Yes, of course.

239
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:43,304
Did Orlando say anything to you before
he and Luis left for Carlos's apartment?

240
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,977
I'm an attorney. Anything
you say is 100% confidential,

241
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,211
so, please, speak freely.

242
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,787
He walked out
and slammed the door.

243
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,291
<i>That is not what happened.
[Speaking Spanish]</i>

244
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,487
I came to you, I told you that Luis
and I were going out for a little while.

245
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,326
And then I kissed your cheek.

246
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,390
And then I asked if you wanted anything
from the store, and then we left.

247
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,402
Remember?

248
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,162
<i>Right.
Good.</i>

249
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,173
I knew Luis didn't kill that boy.

250
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,007
- Luis couldn't kill a flower.
- Then why is he in jail?

251
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,172
<i>He'll be out soon.
And my husband?</i>

252
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,807
He'll be arrested in a few days,
charged with murder.

253
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,917
<i>Then what? Then we convince
a jury he's innocent.</i>

254
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,889
<i>Now, we may need
to call you as a witness.</i>

255
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:35,393
<i>If so, all you need to do
is tell the truth.</i>

256
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,395
You're all right with that, right?

257
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:42,195
If telling the truth
will get my son out of jail.

258
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,936
<i>Hey, so I spoke to the lab.</i>

259
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,344
Blood on the knife, D.N.A. Under
the fingernails match Orlando's.

260
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,212
Son of a bitch,
he was telling the truth.

261
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,514
Sure. About pounding Carlos to the ground
anyway. You don't believe the knife story?

262
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,785
A guy needs a story to tell, right?
He grabs a knife, he cuts himself.

263
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,021
All of a sudden it's
self-defense. You got proof?

264
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,722
I don't have proof
the Easter bunny doesn't exist,

265
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,766
but I'm pretty
sure I'm right there too.

266
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,667
<i>The father's the real bad guy.
Except he's got a decent defense.</i>

267
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,501
Yeah, his blood's on the knife,
but his prints aren't.

268
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,939
His self-defense story could fly.

269
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,739
If Luis changes his story
to jibe with his father's.

270
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,714
We'd impeach his testimony
based on his original confession, but-

271
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,717
Who knows
what the jury will believe?

272
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,947
[Sighs]
Flip the son against the father.

273
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,788
<i>But do it soon, before defense
lawyers rewrite history on us.</i>

274
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,091
Scare that kid so he serves up
papa on a Tiffany platter.

275
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,991
<i>Only two people know what
happened in that apartment.</i>

276
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,264
I represent one,
you represent the other.

277
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,635
<i>[Latin]
Your point is?</i>

278
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,676
There's no need to panic
or try to cut a deal.

279
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,144
[Sniffles] If we work together,
both of them will walk.

280
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,239
Work together?

281
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:08,252
Make sure that their testimony is consistent.
Especially with respect to the knife.

282
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:14,755
I represent Luis. I'll do whatever
I think is best for him. Understand?

283
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,125
[Laughs]

284
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,654
Is that what they taught you up there in
New Haven, how to act like a WASP bitch?

285
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,061
Thanks for the coffee, Pedro.

286
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,272
Life in prison is a long time
when you're 20 years old.

287
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,611
I get it. You're prepared to make him
a generous offer for his cooperation.

288
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,776
A fair offer.

289
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,945
Fine, fair.

290
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,955
Will he talk? Well, I
hope so. He's innocent.

291
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,082
Well, he's not that innocent.

292
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,289
If he hadn't taken dear old dad to the
apartment, Carlos might still be alive.

293
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,854
It's my problem. It's up to me to tell them
- To what?

294
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:58,369
To go to jail for 30 years for smoking
pot and having sex with a transsexual?

295
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,837
[Sighs]

296
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,436
You know, she was so-

297
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,448
Beautiful.

298
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:18,018
I mean, she looked like a model.
You saw her. You know.

299
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,183
<i>She made me laugh.</i>

300
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,723
I still hate her though,
for lying and tricking me.

301
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,002
But she didn't deserve to die.

302
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:38,633
And you don't deserve
to celebrate your 50th birthday...

303
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,644
in prison.

304
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,609
[Sighs] I wish I didn't tell
my father where she lived.

305
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,382
Just tell the prosecutor
what happened.

306
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,025
You're a good kid, Luis,
and a good son,

307
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,527
but you're an idiot
if you don't take this deal.

308
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:05,829
<i>He came into my bedroom
and punched me in the face.</i>

309
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,202
Started calling me a faggot.

310
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,007
I said I didn't know
she was a man.

311
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,105
But he kept saying
I was a disgrace.

312
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,650
Then he-Then he pulled me
out of bed and said, " Get dressed.

313
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,350
We're gonna find your girlfriend
and set things straight.' '

314
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,485
<i>[Kibre]
You knew where Carlos lived?</i>

315
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,029
Well,

316
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,292
the night that-
the night when we-

317
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,392
Okay.
When we got there,

318
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,664
I rang the buzzer.

319
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,606
She let us in. I apologized
for hitting her before.

320
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,644
<i>So that she would let you in?</i>

321
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,742
Yes.

322
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,911
Keep going.

323
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,979
When we got inside,
my-my father just-

324
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:04,352
He just pushed her, started
screaming at her, calling her a liar.

325
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,265
And then Angelina
just spit at him.

326
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,496
- And he-
- Did you try to stop it?

327
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,267
No, but I wanted to.

328
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,543
Okay.
What about the knife?

329
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,673
When he stopped hitting her,

330
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,481
he was afraid
she might be dead.

331
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:33,320
So he grabbed a knife, cut himself
and he threw it on the floor.

332
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,860
And wiped his prints off it?

333
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,452
Yes.

334
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,900
So your father punched Carlos
in the face 15 times...

335
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,903
because he spit at him?

336
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,906
Yes.

337
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,807
Are you prepared to tell a jury
what you've just told us?

338
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,845
<i>Yes.
Are you telling the truth?</i>

339
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,846
Yes.

340
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,681
Man two, three to nine.
One to three.

341
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,688
<i>Forget it. There's no intent
here, Tracey. You know that.</i>

342
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:08,157
[Clears Throat]
You always open high.

343
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,821
Three to nine, best and last.

344
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,266
And in case you forgot,
when I say "best and last," I mean it.

345
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,673
Three to nine it is.
Luis?

346
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,908
Is that a yes?

347
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,784
Yes.

348
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,490
<i>Before I put my client's liberty
in your hands,</i>

349
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,926
I need to know
that each of you is prepared...

350
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:48,557
to acquit Mr. Ramirez if the People
do not meet their burden of proof.

351
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,228
If you cannot promise me that,
raise your hands.

352
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,441
Thank you.
Counsel, approach the bench.

353
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,215
<i>Peremptories, Ms. Kibre?</i>

354
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,217
<i>Jurors Six and Eleven,
Your Honor.</i>

355
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:11,381
<i>Both Hispanic? Your Honor,
Batson clearly states that-</i>

356
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:15,324
<i>I know what it states. Ms. Kibre?
This has nothing to do with race.</i>

357
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,954
<i>In Hernandez v. New York,
the U.S. Supreme Court...</i>

358
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,693
held that a prosecutor has the right
to dismiss bilingual Latino jurors...

359
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:27,296
based on a concern that such jurors
might not disregard Spanish testimony.

360
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:31,570
<i>It's an excuse to create a jury with no Latinos
in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</i>

361
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,612
<i>We have several witnesses
who will testify in Spanish.</i>

362
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,307
Jurors Six and Eleven
have stated...

363
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:41,011
<i>that they might disregard the English
translation of the court interpreter.</i>

364
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,250
<i>With all due respect,
this is racist. Maybe.</i>

365
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,050
But I'm not in the mood to overrule
Justice Kennedy this morning.

366
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,995
Jurors Six and Eleven
may be excused.

367
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,999
I gotta tell you,
I don't like it.

368
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:00,094
I'm just trying to put the bad guy
away, not win the Nobel Peace Prize.

369
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,032
You excused those jurors
because you thought they'd sympathize.

370
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,671
Look, when you're first chair, you
can have whoever you want on your jury-

371
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:12,649
Latinos, lawyers, convicted felons
- go crazy.

372
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,153
But right now, you support my choices
whether or not you think they're aggressive.

373
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,850
Or cheap. I was being polite
when I said aggressive.

374
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:23,326
I'm sorry, but I think it's out of line
to hide behind Hernandez like that.

375
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,853
Well, I don't care what you think. Oh.

376
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,196
And neither does
Angelina Martinez.

377
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:33,203
- Angelina?
- Yeah, Angelina.

378
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:37,037
- What, so it worked?
- Yeah, we changed her gender.

379
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,702
Well, I guess
I'll be drafting a motion.

380
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,906
<i>Miss Kibre filed a motion
to amend the indictment.</i>

381
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:47,008
- In what respect?
- To change the victim's name from Carlos to Angelina.

382
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,248
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Mrs. Martinez changed her son's name...

383
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,223
- to Angelina last week.
- You're kidding?

384
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:57,352
She felt it was important to honor
her daughter's identity posthumously.

385
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,728
You're not suggesting we refer to
the victim as Angelina in court?

386
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,360
Well, as of last week,
that is her legal name.

387
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:08,099
He was born Carlos
and died Carlos.

388
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,573
<i>- But today she's Angelina.
- [Judge] I agree.</i>

389
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,507
Your Honor
- You saw the certificate, Mr. Moreno.

390
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:16,206
In light of the name change, Your
Honor, I think it's appropriate...

391
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,614
that we refer to Angelina as a woman
and use all feminine pronouns.

392
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:24,053
This is ridiculous. You could slap a
Prada dress on a bull and call him Sally-

393
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,454
that does not make
the damn thing a she.

394
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,153
Carlos Martinez was a man,
anatomically.

395
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,957
To refer to him as a woman
is absurd.

396
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,933
Sure is.

397
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,297
The victim's name
is Angelina Martinez,

398
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:44,434
<i>and he, or she, shall be referred to
as such at all times in my courtroom.</i>

399
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:49,242
After that, you can call him or her
whatever you want. The jury will do the math.

400
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,818
Ms. Kibre.

401
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,912
You just used up
your "creative argument" quota, okay?

402
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:06,662
<i>The defendant brutally beat
to death Angelina Martinez...</i>

403
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,165
for one reason-

404
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,395
Because she had the audacity...

405
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:16,463
to tell a few neighborhood friends
that she was dating his son.

406
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,077
As the trial progresses,

407
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,079
<i>you will hear testimony
from a witness...</i>

408
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,514
<i>who was in Angelina's apartment
the night that she was murdered,</i>

409
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,178
who saw with his own eyes
what happened.

410
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,814
<i>When he's finished,
you will have no doubt...</i>

411
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,849
<i>that Orlando Ramirez
is guilty of murder.</i>

412
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:40,955
The name of the witness
is Luis Ramirez-

413
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,762
the son of the defendant.

414
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:50,038
<i>[Kibre] What happened when your
father came home that night?</i>

415
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,544
He said he heard about what
happened with Angelina at Club 186.

416
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,479
Then what?

417
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,642
I told him that I thought
that Angelina was a woman...

418
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,518
and that I freaked out
when I found out that she wasn't.

419
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,015
Anything else happen?

420
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,797
He said we need to speak
to Carlos about the situation.

421
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,836
Is that it?

422
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,242
Yes.

423
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,378
Did your father
punch you, Luis?

424
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:32,576
<i>- Objection. Leading.
- Sustained.</i>

425
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:39,614
What happened when you and your
father went to Angelina's apartment?

426
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,069
What happened when
you were inside the apartment, Luis?

427
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,535
May we take a break,
Your Honor?

428
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:03,513
Do you need a few minutes,
Mr. Ramirez?

429
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,278
- No.
- Continue, Ms. Kibre.

430
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,051
What happened
once you and your father...

431
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,821
were inside Angelina's
apartment?

432
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,558
Um, they started arguing
and Angelina pulled a knife.

433
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,862
<i>- Excuse me?
- Angelina pulled a knife.</i>

434
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:27,530
Angelina pulled a knife? In a sworn statement,
you said your father stabbed himself after he-

435
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:31,063
<i>[Moreno] Your Honor. Please. Permission
to treat the witness as hostile.</i>

436
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,076
May I please be heard,
Your Honor?

437
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,375
- Who the hell are you?
- Ana Mendez, counsel for the witness.

438
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,815
May I please have five minutes
alone with my client?

439
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,546
<i>- I wasn't raised that way.
- What way? To tell the truth?</i>

440
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,783
No, to testify against my father.
Yes, it's tough. I know.

441
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:50,191
But the truth is, we ran out of easy choices
the night you watched your old man kill Carlos.

442
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,957
You tell the truth,
you spend three years in jail,

443
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,228
or take the Fifth
and be tried for murder.

444
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,236
Your call.

445
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,933
I'm not testifying.

446
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,943
You're sure?

447
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,447
You're a fool.

448
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,944
<i>Witnesses lie, Tracey.
Jurors know that.</i>

449
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,953
They're not blind.
Thank you.

450
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,353
I know.
Just should have seen it coming.

451
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,517
He's been protecting his father
since day one,

452
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,927
telling anybody who'd listen
that he's some kind of Latino saint.

453
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,125
And then in return,
his father kicks the hell out of him.

454
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,226
It's not easy to be objective
about your father.

455
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,272
- Takes a lot of strength.
- Or in my case, therapy.

456
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:41,145
Now what?
We get ready for more lies.

457
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,943
- Orlando's testifying?
- First thing tomorrow.

458
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,780
<i>Tell me again.
Whose genius idea was this...</i>

459
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,618
to flip a young Dominican boy
against his father?

460
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,556
If he's good, he walks.

461
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,789
Then be sure he's not good.

462
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:06,398
<i>When Mr. Martinez
grabbed the knife,</i>

463
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,235
did you believe you were
in danger of your life?

464
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,332
Yes. Absolutely.

465
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,003
And I, of course,
was worried about Luis too.

466
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:19,915
So, how come you didn't just run out
of the room? There was nowhere to go.

467
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,316
The apartment was small.
The door was shut.

468
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,049
<i>If I had turned to open it,
he would have stabbed me.</i>

469
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,250
<i>And, like I said,
I was worried about Luis.</i>

470
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,260
I mean,
I couldn't leave my son in there.

471
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,694
I'd rather die than have
something happen to him.

472
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,363
<i>Thank you.</i>

473
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:42,998
<i>The knife that Angelina grabbed was on
the table, in the living room, right?</i>

474
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,541
Yes.

475
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,602
Strange place for a steak knife.
Objection.

476
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,582
- Sustained.
- When Angelina grabbed the knife,

477
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,016
you were seven feet
from the door, right?

478
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,021
Yes.
It's a small apartment.

479
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,617
But you chose not to run out the door because
you were afraid she might stab you or your son?

480
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,630
- Right.
- But Luis was even closer to the door than you were.

481
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,566
I mean, he could've been out the
door in one second. And you in two.

482
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,535
Is there a question, Your Honor?

483
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,834
There is.

484
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:22,242
Angelina didn't really grab a knife off
the table in the living room, did she?

485
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:26,113
- What?
- You're making that up, aren't you?

486
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,277
<i>Objection.
Sustained.</i>

487
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:35,122
<i>[Kibre]
After Angelina grabbed the knife,</i>

488
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,718
you claim she stabbed you?

489
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:41,629
- Yes.
- Did you need stitches?

490
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,968
No.

491
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:50,440
After she "cut" you,

492
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:54,672
you slammed her wrist
into the wall, the knife fell...

493
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,943
<i>and you started fighting?
Yes.</i>

494
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:03,454
So you forced the knife out of her
hand before you threw the first punch?

495
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:07,013
- Yes.
- How much do you weigh?

496
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,992
155 pounds.

497
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,996
<i>[Kibre] And you were
afraid for your life...</i>

498
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:17,000
<i>even though Angelina- who
weighed no more than 110 pounds-</i>

499
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,866
was no longer
in possession of a knife?

500
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,872
She might pull another knife.
Or maybe a gun.

501
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,875
Oh, well, that must be
why you punched her-

502
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,468
all 110 pounds of her-

503
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:31,606
<i>15 times in the face and head,</i>

504
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,447
because you were afraid for your life.

505
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,044
Yes.

506
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:42,951
[Scoffs]
Nothing further.

507
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,569
Jury's back.

508
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,699
That's way too fast.

509
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:02,576
<i>On the sole count of the indictment,
murder in the second degree,</i>

510
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,138
we find the defendant
not guilty.

511
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,555
Thank you.

512
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,713
<i>Sorry about the verdict. What are
you gonna do? The kid screwed you.</i>

513
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,278
<i>Screwed himself.
How's that?</i>

514
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,984
- I'm gonna try him for murder.
- Good.

515
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,425
I want you to find out
everything you can about this kid-

516
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,055
where he hangs out,
who his friends are.

517
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,430
Right now, he's looking
a little too clean. Sure.

518
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,959
I'm not a mind reader.
How did I know he was-

519
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,974
Apologize? What are you,
crazy? To that ass-kissing-

520
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,876
Yeah, well, that's okay by me. I like
Staten Island. The grass is greener.

521
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,812
Yeah, well, screw you too.
You all right?

522
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:16,218
Yeah, sure. Politics at the
precinct. You know how it is.

523
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,950
Yeah, we got more work to do.
Kibre's gonna try Luis for murder.

524
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,994
Even though the old man got a pass?
It's because the old man got a pass.

525
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,826
Oh, I knew that chick had balls.

526
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,128
Speaking of chicks with balls,

527
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,600
Kibre wants us to go uptown,
check out the tranny scene.

528
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,137
See if anyone knows
our buddy, Luis.

529
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,904
<i>What do you mean they're trying
Luis for murder? Technically-</i>

530
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:44,573
I don't care about technically! All I know is
my kid is in jail for something he didn't do,

531
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,708
and I'm paying you
400 bucks an hour.

532
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,843
To represent Luis
to the best of my ability.

533
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,081
<i>Ay mujer! Just tell me how
I get my kid out of jail.</i>

534
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,089
Are you willing to testify?
And say what?

535
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:57,150
That you killed Carlos Martinez all
by yourself, that Luis wasn't involved.

536
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,495
<i>I'm not going back to jail. You
won't have to. Doublejeopardy.</i>

537
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,061
You've been tried and acquitted. That
means you can say whatever you want...

538
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,266
and there's nothing Kibre
or anyone else can do about it.

539
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,311
<i>[Latin]</i>

540
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,473
Mm, never seen him.

541
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,883
Too bad. He's cute.
Don't you think?

542
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:28,023
- Not my type.
- Name Luis Ramirez ring a bell?

543
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,853
You know any other places around
here that, uh, cater to men,

544
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,558
who might prefer
a certain type of female?

545
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,261
<i>I'll get on the stand,
I'll smile at thejury,</i>

546
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,964
<i>and I'll explain how I beat
the hell out of that mariposa.</i>

547
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:45,031
Say Luis had nothing to do with it. That
he tried to stop me, that he was crying.

548
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:49,136
Hard to convict someone of murder when you have
a witness raising his hand, saying, " I did it.' '

549
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,979
Luis still brought his father to the
apartment knowing he was gonna kill that girl.

550
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,680
<i>Luis watched a fight between two men. A fight
a jury has already decided wasn't a crime.</i>

551
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:02,522
- He's still guilty of murder.
- Fine. You'll lose again.

552
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:06,757
Before you go, I should probably
tell you about some of my witnesses.

553
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,694
They're really tall.
Attractive.

554
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,601
<i>Very feminine.</i>

555
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,072
Great boobs. Penises.

556
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,872
<i>I've got five men
who seem to know Luis-</i>

557
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,243
or should I sayJulio-
very well.

558
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,181
Apparently he uses a different
name when he's in that world.

559
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,548
<i>So what?
So Luis wasn't tricked.</i>

560
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:34,182
He was dating Angelina for months.
But you already knew that.

561
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:37,227
So he was dating a tranny.
Doesn't mean he's guilty of murder.

562
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,458
Gives us great motive though. Man
leads a double life and gets outed,

563
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,934
so he and his father kill the "outer"
to ensure that his secret stays safe.

564
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,130
- Sounds pretty compelling to me.
- You're threatening my witness.

565
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:53,337
No. I'm just sharing information,
just like you.

566
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:59,109
Looks like your friends are finally gonna find
out just what kind of a man Luis really is.

567
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,949
The whole city is about
to find out that my son is a-

568
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:10,220
a faggot.

569
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,388
You're a disgrace to me.
To your mother.

570
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,932
To your sister.
To God.

571
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:21,493
It's not like I wanna be this way.

572
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,631
I just am.

573
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,733
<i>You make me sick.
I can change.</i>

574
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,836
- It's too late.
- What do you mean?

575
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,905
I'm done with you... forever.

576
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,850
You killed Angelina
because I loved her.

577
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,853
Don't do this to him.
I'm not gonna testify for that-

578
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,219
<i>Orlando, please.
Let that joto rot in jail!</i>

579
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,495
[Sobbing]

580
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,896
<i>He loved Angelina.
I mean, really loved her.</i>

581
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,434
He didn't know
his father was going to kill her.

582
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,994
But he did. And he lied on the
stand. He has to answer for that too.

583
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,667
He lied to protect the father who beat the
hell out of him and killed the person he loved.

584
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,805
Look, either way,
Angelina's dead.

585
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,441
And Orlando is sipping beer and
eating sancocho at his favorite café.

586
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,481
Man two, one to three.
Best and last.

587
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,120
I'll speak to Luis.

588
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,959
Talk fast. Offer's good
till 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

589
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,294
It's a good thing we know each other-
someone else might think you'd gone soft.

590
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,976
Whatever.

591
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,211
<i>[Judge] Is there an
agreed-upon recommendation?</i>

592
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,684
<i>[Man] Yes, Your Honor, five years'probation
- [Mouthing Words]</i>

593
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:46,189
<i>With a condition of drug treatment
and counseling as deemed necessary.</i>

594
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,987
<i>[Judge] Mr. Timmins, I will
accept your guilty plea...</i>

595
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,258
<i>and hereby impose the sentence as described
by the assistant district attorney.</i>

596
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,960
<i>[Whispering, Indistinct] Please see the
probation officer before you leave. Thank you.</i>

[Whispering, Indistinct]

599
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,890
My wife made me come.

600
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,892
L-

601
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,431
Your son hanged himself
three hours ago.

602
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,201
I'm sorry for your loss.

603
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,410
He always was weak.

604
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,041
Yeah, well,
he wasn't tough like you.

605
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,382
<i>Not everybody's got the guts
to kill a 110-pound girl,</i>

606
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,751
or sacrifice their only son...

607
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,815
on the altar
of their own pathetic pride.

608
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,361
L- I am a good father.

609
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,113
Ana!

610
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:22,284
[Sighs] I just want to say
I'm really sorry about Luis.

611
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,822
Thank you.

612
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:35,423
I never told that kid to lie.
You know that, right?

613
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,026
Yeah, I know.
