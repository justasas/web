00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,694
<i>[Man Narrating]
In the criminal justice system...</i>

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,137
<i>all defendants are innocent
until proven guilty,</i>

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:11,576
<i>either by confession,
plea bargain or trial byjury.</i>

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,874
<i>This is one of those trials.</i>

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,946
Tracey, this is Jack Miller.
He's a columnist with-

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,112
<i>The Ledger. I know.
I read your stuff.</i>

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,212
Well, you're not gonna like this.

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,553
Jack got an anonymous call
this morning...

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,423
from somebody claiming to be
an officer at the 8th Precinct.

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:32,261
He said that an NYU freshman
named Lucas Rice...

11
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,994
was beaten and raped
by two police officers...

12
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,195
with a nightstick.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,397
[Groans]

14
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:44,102
This guy's telling the truth?
I talked to him for 20 minutes.

15
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,578
I asked a bunch of questions.
Everything checked out.

16
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:52,312
Why'd he call you? He said he wanted
to go public with what happened...

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,615
without sellin' out the department.

18
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,621
You know, the blue wall crap.

19
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,955
- What do you think? - I think the
you-know-what's about to hit the fan.

20
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,920
So I get here, and before
I know what's going on,

21
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,797
the doctor comes up
and he's telling me,

22
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:13,134
"I'm sorry. Your son just passed away.' '

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,197
Like that. Just-

24
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,404
No emotion. Just-

25
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,843
If you'd like to speak with a counselor
- About what?

26
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,014
About what it's like to lose
an 18-year-old son for no reason?

27
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,720
Hold it a second.

28
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,455
Sir, you're not supposed
to do that. This is my son.

29
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,463
Sorry.

30
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,964
[Crying]

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,107
<i>- [Man] All we know is he was in custody.
- Custody?</i>

32
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,743
They were holding him at the 8th
Precinct on an assault charge.

33
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,152
He came back from the bathroom,
started moaning, passed out.

34
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,191
Somebody called an ambulance
and here we are.

35
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,192
What happened to him?

36
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,162
A blunt instrument was inserted-
shoved, really- into the rectum.

37
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,723
The colon was perforated
and the mesenteric artery ruptured,

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,929
causing severe internal bleeding,
a decrease in blood pressure,

39
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,165
ultimately leading
to cardiac arrest.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,175
<i>Something pierced his rectum,
caused internal bleeding and he died?</i>

41
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:27,543
- Something like that.
- Any other cuts or marks on the body?

42
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:32,984
The lip was cut, the eye was bruised,
but most of the damage was done internally.

43
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:36,249
<i>Well, there was this fight
in a gay bar in the West Village.</i>

44
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,189
It got crazy. The kids hopped-up
on X or meth or somethin'-

45
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,696
<i>- And you arrested Rice for assault?
- [Officer] No. We did some crowd control.</i>

46
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,596
Mike Bressler and Scott Davis
made the arrest.

47
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,899
So Bressler and Davis brought him in,
booked him. Then what?

48
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,906
Don't know. I heard the kid
moaning in the holding cell.

49
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,910
I asked if he's okay, and he just
kept moaning, so I called an ambulance.

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,779
- What happened to your eye?
- Got scratched outside of a club. No big deal.

51
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,421
- Is the kid okay?
- Not really. He died two hours ago.

52
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,565
<i>Now that this is all over the media,
the public has a right to know...</i>

53
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,734
that the federal, state and local governments
are working in concert to uncover the truth.

54
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,903
And to the extent that a crime
has been committed,

55
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,915
to bring those responsible to justice,
whether they're wearing uniforms or not.

56
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:41,579
<i>And as deputy police chief, I'll do
what I can to make sure that happens.</i>

57
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:45,522
<i>However, if an officer really
raped and killed this kid,</i>

58
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,254
it may be better for the U.S.
Attorney's office to take control.

59
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,923
<i>I don't think it's appropriate. This case
is loaded with federal issues, Arthur,</i>

60
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,262
not to mention
the obvious conflict of interest.

61
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,464
- Conflict of what?
- You work with police officers every day. We don't.

62
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,472
And when they commit crimes,
we prosecute them.

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,974
<i>Why not avoid the appearance
of favoritism altogether?</i>

64
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,840
Besides, we have better judges,
better jury pools.

65
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,403
Better lawyers.
I've heard that speech before.

66
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:12,417
<i>I was hoping that we could resolve
this amicably. Well, you thought wrong.</i>

67
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:18,082
This is a Manhattan homicide and the Manhattan
District Attorney's office is in charge.

68
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:23,094
So the, uh, speech
about working together...

69
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,096
is a bunch of crap?

70
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,325
You're damn right it is.

71
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,839
You heard about
that NYU kid- Rice?

72
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,184
- Sure.
- Sickening, if what they say is true.

73
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,817
<i>It's hard imagine two cops doing-
It's your case.</i>

74
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,827
Well, I thought the feds
would handle it.

75
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,353
It's ours, for now anyway.

76
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:37,495
- For now?
- The longer it takes, the less control we'll have.

77
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,166
We need to resolve this before every
damn son of a bitch with an agenda...

78
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,369
starts screaming about
what a mess the N.Y.P.D. Is.

79
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:49,472
With all due respect,
I'd rather not get involved.

80
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,279
I know some of these guys at the 8th.
It's not a comfortable-

81
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,786
<i>Comfortable? You think I give a damn
if you're comfortable?</i>

82
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,788
This isn't a request.

83
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,689
<i>You might work for the D.A.,
but you're still a cop,</i>

84
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,697
and you still report to me.

85
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,471
<i>[Ravell] You guys arrested
Rice, right? Yeah, for assault.</i>

86
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,905
He sucker punched Petro in the face
and took off into the crowd.

87
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,138
Me and Mikey found him outside
a little later, so we busted him.

88
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,146
<i>So you saw Rice throw the punch? Yeah.</i>

89
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,479
Yeah, not bad for a fag either.
Hit him pretty good.

90
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,285
Well, nothin' worse than
gettin' drilled by a queen, right?

91
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,323
<i>But if you're gonna get hit,
better it'd be a wise guy, a gangbanger.</i>

92
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,123
Guys who won't bust your balls
so much, you know?

93
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,629
Nobody was busting
anybody's balls, okay?

94
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,632
So don't be puttin' words
into my mouth.

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,931
- I was just-
- I know what you were just doing.

96
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,439
<i>You guys see anything else that might
help? No. We didn't see anything else.</i>

97
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,135
We're done. Come on.

98
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,005
Look, I'll meet you back at the office.
I've got some stuff I gotta do.

99
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,746
Right.

100
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,187
Chris, if you wanna work this
on your own, just give me the word.

101
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,748
Oh, it's nothin' personal, Hector.

102
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,919
All right. All right.

103
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,002
I read your statement this
morning. What statement?

104
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,062
The one you gave to the A.D.A.
That wasn't a statement.

105
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,267
We were just talkin'.
Just talkin'.

106
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,142
A kid dies of a punctured colon
three hours after being in police custody?

107
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,147
Come on, Danny.
You're not that naive, are you?

108
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,479
<i>You got a question or what?
Yeah, I do.</i>

109
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,815
Why didn't you tell anyone
Rice sucker punched you?

110
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,013
Didn't think it was relevant.
Really?

111
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,852
Not relevant?

112
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,457
[Sighs]
Look, Dan.

113
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,623
- I'm just trying to-
- Take down a cop.

114
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,633
I know.

115
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,103
Come on. Off the record.

116
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,140
Did you get a little payback
on that kid or what?

117
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,301
Talk to my lawyer.

118
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,368
[Sighs]

119
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,380
Any of you guys working that night?

120
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:08,882
<i>Well, you can talk now, or you can wait until
the D.A. Drags your ass in front of a grandjury.</i>

121
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,023
I guess they didn't see anything either.

122
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,962
You're probably right.

123
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,966
'Cause if they did, they probably
wouldn't be stupid enough...

124
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,366
to cover for a punk like you.

125
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,996
<i>See you soon.</i>

126
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,575
<i>I'm sipping my coffee,
minding my own business...</i>

127
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,877
when I see Petro comin' out
of the bathroom.

128
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,917
He looks at me and he says,

129
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,079
"I broke that punk like a little bitch.' '

130
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,749
And then he, you know,
starts doing this with his hand.

131
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,225
Did he say anything else?
No.

132
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,731
Was anyone else involved,
Officer Lemay?

133
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,733
Don't know.

134
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,701
What about Tolbert?

135
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,404
Like I said, I don't know.

136
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,939
What Petro did to that kid
- They can call me a rat all they want. I don't care.

137
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,107
But Petro's as far as I go.

138
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,847
<i>When you talked to the reporter
from The Ledger,</i>

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
why did you tell him that
there were two cops involved?

140
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,053
I got no comment on that.

141
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,062
We're done, Tracey.

142
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,168
There was another guy
in the holding cell with Rice.

143
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,273
<i>You two were in the
same cell, right? Yes.</i>

144
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,175
Did you happen to see which officer
took him to the bathroom?

145
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,646
This is a pretty uncomfortable situation for
me. Nobody around here knows I was arrested.

146
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,513
We'll be as discreet as possible.
I appreciate that.

147
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,146
My lawyer says I'll be able to plead out
to a misdemeanor possession charge,

148
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,246
go to some counseling
and be done with it.

149
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,316
- But if I have to testify and this
becomes public- - Maybe we can help.

150
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:58,420
<i>Even if you drop the charge, the defense
lawyer will know I had coke on me.</i>

151
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,330
I mean, look around.
This isn't exactly a hotbed of liberalism.

152
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,868
Like I said,
we're gonna try to help you.

153
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,927
You just gotta stop playing games.

154
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,303
Did you see who took Rice
to the bathroom or not?

155
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,112
<i>[Dog Barking]
Chris.</i>

156
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,375
Hey, Billy. How you doing?
What can I do for you?

157
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,612
We need to talk about Lucas Rice.

158
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,884
You fellas want anything to drink?
No, thank you.

159
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,788
<i>No, thanks. If you change your mind,
give me a holler. I'll be in the kitchen.</i>

160
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,486
Thanks, sweetie.
[Baby Coos]

161
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,894
How old's your baby?
Three months.

162
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,024
Her name's Serena.
Lucky guy.

163
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,228
Beautiful wife, baby.

164
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,999
<i>What can I do for you, Chris?
So, Tolbert,</i>

165
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,131
why don't we talk about
what happened the other night?

166
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,868
The more you tell me,
the more I could help.

167
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:51,042
As a friend, I'm telling you,
get on the record in a hurry.

168
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,745
The longer you play super cop,
the worse it's gonna get.

169
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,548
The truth is gonna come out
sooner or later.

170
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,385
I got nothing to say, boys. Sorry.

171
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,153
Then tell us about Petro.

172
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,425
He's a good guy.
[Scoffs]

173
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,934
And a good partner. Who'd sell you out for
three cents if it could save his Italian ass.

174
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,370
And why is that?
I know how these guys think, Billy.

175
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,430
What they say
when you're not around.

176
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,103
They make you think
you're friends, one of the boys.

177
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,442
- But the second you turn your back, you're anotherJew.
- Or spic.

178
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,675
It's not like that.

179
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:30,654
Besides, like I said,
I got nothing to hide.

180
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:37,092
So you bringing Rice to the bathroom and then
taking him back out 10 minutes later, all banged up-

181
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,097
that's just coincidence?

182
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,599
Thanks for stopping by, boys.

183
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,836
Talk to your lawyer, Billy.
Maybe we can work something out.

184
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,902
But don't wait too long.

185
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,650
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

186
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,653
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

187
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:06,158
<i>So Tolbert brought Rice to the bathroom
and helped Petro get his revenge.</i>

188
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,159
Maybe.
Why maybe?

189
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,525
Tolbert's a good kid.

190
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,656
I worked with him for a while at the 31.
I mean, he's not the kind of guy-

191
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,201
He's a down-the-middle family man.

192
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,829
Just talked to a kid named Crawford.
Claims he punched Petro that night.

193
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,738
<i>So Rice-
Didn't do a damn thing.</i>

194
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,439
I only want good news, Hector.

195
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,844
Fine. Blood in the holding cell's a match.

196
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,475
- What about the bathroom?
- Luminol destroyed the sample.

197
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,213
<i>[Sighs]</i>

198
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,517
- Nightsticks?
- Clean.

199
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,424
- Petro's clothing?
- Found blood on his belt.

200
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,122
Match?

201
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,130
Tolbert.

202
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,134
Tolbert?

203
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,969
Well, he-he got cut at the club, right?

204
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,499
Probably wiped it off
and touched Petro or somethin'.

205
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,844
Or Lucas scratched him in the bathroom while
he was fighting desperately to save his life.

206
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,181
Well, they're partners. There's a million
ways something like this could happen.

207
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,983
As far as I'm concerned,
there's only one.

208
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,226
Bressler and the others
were busting Petro's chops...

209
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,459
for getting his ass kicked
by a gay kid.

210
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,866
Petro laughs along,
while planning his revenge.

211
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,870
They get back to the station,

212
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,430
Tolbert takes Rice to the bathroom,
holds him down.

213
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:34,673
Rice fights for his life, scratches
Tolbert's eye, while Petro does his thing.

214
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,473
- Can you prove it?
- In a perfect world-

215
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,521
I'd be a two handicap
and have a full head of hair.

216
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,954
We only have two witnesses so far.

217
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,551
<i>Credible?
Solid, not perfect.</i>

218
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,598
Indict 'em.

219
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,203
- Indict? We don't have enough-
- We have plenty.

220
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,271
Arthur, I'm all for beating
the feds to the courthouse,

221
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,538
but I don't wanna get my pants pulled
down in front of a hundred million people.

222
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,741
Then buy a new belt, 'cause I want
an indictment by the end of the week.

223
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,378
- For first-degree murder.
- First degree?

224
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,653
Death in the course of
a criminal sexual assault.

225
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,762
Both defendants shall be remanded.

226
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,630
Your Honor, these men are
respected members of the N.Y.P.D.,

227
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,934
<i>have strong ties to the New York area,
are fathers to small children.</i>

228
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:38,909
To separate them from their families based on
nothing more than innuendo is reprehensible.

229
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,539
<i>- I know the press is here, Mr. Grace, but enough already.
- These men are the victims...</i>

230
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,981
<i>- of a politically motivated witch hunt.
- [Judge Alverio] Next case.</i>

231
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,213
- I'm not finished, Your Honor.
- I'm warning you, Mr. Grace.

232
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,552
- I can't sit here with my mouth shut while
you send two decorated police- - [Raps]

233
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,717
You're now in contempt.
That's a thousand dollars.

234
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:57,057
Contempt? Because I won't
let my client be sent to jail?

235
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,960
[Raps]
That's another thousand.

236
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,900
- A small cost to pay for a man's freedom.
- One more word and I throw you in jail, so help me God.

237
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,665
Come on. Let's go, all right?
Let's go.

238
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,673
You did what you had to do.

239
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,732
Hang tough.

240
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,342
You wanted to get fined? We
need to get our story out there.

241
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,781
<i>Level the playing field.
[Buzzer Buzzes]</i>

242
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,183
When can I get out of here?

243
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,847
If you're willing to testify
against Petro, tomorrow.

244
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,086
He's my partner.
Doesn't mean you can't.

245
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,320
Sure it does.
I'm not flippin'.

246
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,321
We're talking about
first-degree murder, Billy.

247
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,199
But I'm innocent. So is Danny.

248
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,603
A guy hits you,
you get a little payback.

249
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,608
That's how it works.

250
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,942
So you beat him up?
I hit him a few times.

251
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,505
That's it. I didn't rape him.

252
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,676
You know, I'm not a-

253
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,621
I'll never do something like that.

254
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,353
So you have no idea who, um-

255
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,555
No.
Mmm.

256
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,225
<i>[Buzzer Buzzes]
I mean,</i>

257
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,497
you know what those drugged-up gay boys
do to each other at those clubs.

258
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,301
So who knows
what happened that night?

259
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,865
Who put what where?

260
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,877
Exactly.

261
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,409
<i>You know,
given this kid's lifestyle,</i>

262
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,214
those internal injuries could've been
the result of rough gay sex,

263
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,755
not police brutality.
But they have two witnesses.

264
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,816
- Yeah. Neither of whom saw a damn thing.
- Could offend the jury.

265
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,260
- So what's the alternative?
- For your client or mine?

266
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,094
Look, Tim,

267
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,897
<i>if we present a joint defense,
we'll win this thing.</i>

268
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,961
Take a look at this.

269
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,845
"I'm a handsome,
18-year-old paradox.

270
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,906
Outgoing, yet introspective.
Shy, but adventurous.' '

271
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,886
- "Prudish and freaky"?
- I know. It-

272
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:08,393
They're going to allege that Lucas's injuries
were the result of rough sex.

273
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,794
This isn't about Lucas.
This isn't about Lucas's love life.

274
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,733
This is about two sadistic cops.
I agree. Absolutely.

275
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,533
But I still need to talk to Lucas's boyfriends
so I can contradict the defense,

276
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:25,270
just in case they decide to go forward
with this ridiculous assertion.

277
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,421
Um-

278
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,787
I knew he was gay.

279
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,691
I don't know any of his-

280
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,059
I mean, I never really paid attention.

281
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,694
I never really got into that.

282
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,344
The best part?

283
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,042
We're gonna go through
all of this... stuff,

284
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,612
get humiliated, and it's not
gonna mean a damn thing.

285
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:14,455
- Oh, that's not true. - Not a damn
thing. Those- Those cops are gonna walk.

286
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,926
Code of silence and all that.

287
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,166
<i>Mike, I'm no psychic,</i>

288
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,761
but I'm sensing you saw more than what you
told the grand jury. I didn't see anything.

289
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,333
You're really willing to ruin your career
over some mutt like Petro?

290
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,209
You know, maybe when this is over, you should
go to Internal Affairs and do this for real.

291
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,248
First off, watch your tongue.

292
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,376
Second, if you don't, we might have a problem
- you and me off the clock.

293
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,444
Petro could rot in hell, as far as I'm
concerned. But Billy Tolbert, he's a good kid.

294
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,717
I agree.
About what?

295
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,191
Petro's a punk and Tolbert's a good kid.

296
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,696
Well, you see anything that
might support that position? No.

297
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,164
You see Petro carrying a nightstick near
the bathroom? Doesn't matter what I saw.

298
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,168
I'm not yappin'.

299
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,478
<i>What can I do for you,
Detective? That obvious, huh?</i>

300
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,843
I only sell to cops.
Oh, and actors too,

301
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,905
if they have one of those
SAG cards.

302
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,350
I need you to look at a few photos.

303
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:20,591
For what? It doesn't
matter for what. Just look.

304
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,857
Any of these guys been in here recently?
Aw, come on, buddy.

305
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,162
I work with cops every day, huh?
Give me a break.

306
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,100
You want we should talk about this
in front of a grand jury?

307
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,035
Okay, okay. Fine.

308
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,479
Him. Black cop.
Came in last week.

309
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,382
You remember what he bought?
A nightstick.

310
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,558
So?
Nothin'.

311
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,458
Nothin'?
At least on the record.

312
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,792
What does that mean?
No one's willing to testify.

313
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,391
But the consensus is, Petro's a bad guy
and Tolbert's getting the shaft.

314
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,401
Anything else?
No, nothin'.

315
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,940
So your cop friends won't talk?
Well, you could subpoena them, but-

316
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,635
Officer Lemay was suspended
three years ago...

317
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,974
<i>for getting into a fight
with Petro over a woman.</i>

318
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,980
Great. There goes
our key police witness.

319
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,885
Lemay is our primary witness.

320
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,821
But even if he's telling the truth,
the jury's not gonna believe him.

321
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,552
They'll think he's just trying
to get back at some guy...

322
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,151
who used to date his ex-girlfriend.

323
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,687
So he's useless?
What about Tolbert?

324
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,097
Supposed to be a good kid.

325
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,762
Except for the fact that he helped
rape and murder Rice,

326
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,771
he's a perfect gentlemen.

327
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,070
We'll flip him.

328
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,110
But he's gotta do hard time.

329
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,978
Nobody walks away from this
without some pain.

330
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,345
<i>[Ravell]
You all know why we're here?</i>

331
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,083
<i>I'm supposed to say you're
a dead man if we go to trial.</i>

332
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,524
But since we all know each other,
I'm not gonna play that game.

333
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,961
- I appreciate that.
- I'm not gonna lie either.

334
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,864
- We have a good case.
- But I'm innocent, Chris.

335
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,769
[Sighs] Is that why you bought
a nightstick the day Rice died?

336
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,436
- What?
- You bought a new nightstick at the store on 23rd Street.

337
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,106
Clerk picked you out of a photo array.
So don't tell me you're innocent.

338
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:28,046
The good news is
I didn't tell anyone yet.

339
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,647
<i>- What do you mean?
- I was waiting for Billy to come clean.</i>

340
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,214
<i>So no one knows
about the nightstick?</i>

341
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,160
You think I'd be here right now
if Kibre knew about that?

342
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,722
But my generosity ends
in two minutes.

343
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,229
<i>What do you mean
you've been hearing rumors?</i>

344
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,241
Well, you know, it might be
a load of crap. But if it isn't-

345
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,642
Well, it's like I told you before,
Tolbert's old school.

346
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,943
He might as well be a paisan.
Only he's not.

347
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,178
Look, if he flips, it's over.

348
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,186
And if it's over, well-

349
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,848
We're talking about
your life here, Dan.

350
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,017
<i>[Ravell] I know you didn't
want this kid to die.</i>

351
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,561
<i>I know that.</i>

352
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,029
<i>You werejust doing yourjob,
trying to be a stand-up partner.</i>

353
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,828
<i>Talk to him, Billy.
Tell him what happened.</i>

354
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,872
<i>[Ravell]
I get this.</i>

355
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,600
You're just trying to prove
you're a real cop.

356
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,204
As real as the Irish and the Italians.

357
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,217
<i>But that's stupid.</i>

358
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,686
<i>Come on. You know how these people are.
How much can you really trust them?</i>

359
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,815
<i>The melanzane.
You know what they're like.</i>

360
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:45,057
<i>Look, you have a wife and kid at home.</i>

361
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,121
Who cares about
all this blue wall crap?

362
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,567
In or out?

363
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,319
Good news.
Tolbert's on board.

364
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,220
[Stammers]
Oh.

365
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,385
- What's the matter?
- Petro plead guilty this afternoon.

366
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,521
<i>He what? We took first-degree
murder off the table, so-</i>

367
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,466
<i>So you don't need Tolbert anymore? No.</i>

368
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:26,026
- I tried to call you, but-
- You should've tried harder.

369
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,572
Now Tolbert's hanging in the wind
with nothing to offer.

370
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,440
Well, sorry, but I had a few things on my
plate, as you can imagine. So just deal with it.

371
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,776
- Deal with it?
- What-What'd Tolbert say?

372
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,016
What difference does it make?

373
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,018
What did he say?

374
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,379
Nothin' much.

375
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,684
Jerk.

376
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,963
My only wish is that some day,
when his life has ended,

377
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:01,597
that he be forced to account for his
misdeeds in a more powerful court,

378
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:05,370
<i>and that the suffering
he encounters then...</i>

379
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:10,006
<i>will approach the suffering
my son Lucas endured...</i>

380
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:15,018
in that windowless bathroom
in the 8th Precinct.

381
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,213
Mr. Petro?

382
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,363
[Clears Throat]

383
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:33,961
I betrayed my family,
my fellow officers...

384
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,166
and importantly, Lucas Rice.

385
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:41,235
<i>I can't begin to express
the sorrow and shame I feel.</i>

386
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:46,376
<i>I know the pain I have caused his family
and friends will never disappear.</i>

387
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:53,249
As such, I am prepared to accept
whatever punishment this court deems just.

388
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:01,459
Finally, I would like to say
that my partner, Billy Tolbert,

389
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,899
was not involved in this crime.

390
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,427
<i>He's a great police officer
and a great man,</i>

391
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,875
and he should not
be held accountable for my actions.

392
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,872
Thank you.

393
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,214
This admissible?
Better not be.

394
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,277
I'll draft a motion.

395
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,822
I told you. Tolbert
wasn't involved. What?

396
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,989
Petro just admitted that he wasn't
involved. Petro's a sadistic sociopath.

397
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,795
Who cares what he said?
Who cares?

398
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,537
You really get off on this,
don't you?

399
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,699
What? Sending guys to jail
who torture and kill college kids?

400
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:48,144
Yeah. I get off on that. No, no.
Tracey, he tried to break it up.

401
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,410
That's why his blood was on Petro's
belt. He was just trying to help.

402
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,576
Help?

403
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,643
Did you really just say that?

404
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,986
[Sighs] We are talking about a 24-year-old
guy here with a wife and a baby.

405
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,185
No! We're talking about
an 18-year-old freshman...

406
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,525
with a mother and a father
and two sisters.

407
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,573
- You lost the motion.
- Judge said it was hearsay. Can you believe that?

408
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:21,009
Petro stands up in open court,
says Tolbert had nothing to do with it,

409
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,014
and the judge says it's inadmissible.

410
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,176
<i>What a country.
So you want Petro to testify?</i>

411
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,585
- I need him to testify.
- Can't do it.

412
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,852
He's doing 25 years to life. There's
not much more they can do to him.

413
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,086
Sure there is.
What the hell is this?

414
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,095
It's a federal indictment.
What?

415
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,291
Civil rights offense resulting in death.

416
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,301
The U.S. Attorney got
D.O.J. Approval on this?

417
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,860
Yeah. Apparently the folks
in Washington...

418
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,964
think that killing our clients
will advance some federal interest.

419
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,412
I was 48 out of a hundred yesterday.

420
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,646
Pretty good.

421
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:06,418
It's all in the concentration. If I
focus on the front of the rim, I make 'em.

422
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,119
If I don't-

423
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,652
Like putting-
All about routine.

424
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,559
Danny's not gonna be able
to help, is he?

425
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:24,568
Can't. The feds just indicted him.

426
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,634
But he's already doing 25 to life.

427
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,702
They wanna kill him.

428
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,217
They indicted you too.

429
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,220
So even if I win this trial-

430
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,484
We have another one right behind it.

431
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,829
Can't catch a break.

432
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,459
Every time l-

433
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,469
There's more bad news.

434
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:56,268
You mean good news.
Good news?

435
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,908
Another chance to be useful, which
means another chance to cut a deal.

436
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,540
<i>Ten years. He'll do six.</i>

437
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,607
In exchange,
Tolbert will testify against Petro.

438
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,744
If we agree to drop the charges?

439
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,186
<i>His lawyer isn't stupid.</i>

440
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,623
Six years for helping rape and kill
an 18-year-old kid?

441
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,253
Whatever it takes to put
a needle in Petro's arm.

442
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,729
<i>[Chuckles]
I can hear the campaign speech now.</i>

443
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,502
I'm asking for a favor, Arthur.

444
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,971
I'm sorry I can't accommodate you, Curtis.

445
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,532
- Arthur.
- Say hello toJoanne for me.

446
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,413

any extra motivation.

[Clears Throat]

449
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,961
What's on your mind?

450
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,970
Billy Tolbert.

451
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,640
I know him.

452
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,541
He's no Sunday school teacher, but-

453
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:11,344
Look, he took that kid
into the bathroom. I know.

454
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,941
But that is not murder.
It is when the kid dies.

455
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,754
I was wondering if you might
pull a few strings, help him out.

456
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,383
Help him? We need to take him down.
Him walking makes things worse.

457
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,623
Look, he's a cop.

458
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,756
<i>Thermostat's turned up way too high.</i>

459
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,201
So you're just gonna throw him
under the bus?

460
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,172
Don't have a choice.

461
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,750
Oh. Oh. Are you drunk?

462
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:52,482
Tolbert bought a nightstick
the day Rice died.

463
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,082
What?

464
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,859
He went to the supply store on
23rd Street and bought a nightstick.

465
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,832
The clerk picked him out
of a photo array.

466
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,837
When did you find this out?

467
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,139
Today.

468
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,370
Today?

469
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,404
Right. Today.

<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]
[Door Opens]</i>

471
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,294
Not only did the defendant
instigate the attack,

472
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,025
he covered it up as well,

473
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:40,162
by disposing of the murder weapon.

474
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:43,537
Rather than protect
Lucas Rice from harm,

475
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:48,409
he tortured him, he raped him
and he murdered him.

476
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:53,075
It's- It's inconceivable.

477
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,381
It's unimaginable.

478
00:30:55,453 --> 00:31:00,015
And yet it is real.
It's too real.

479
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:05,757
Just ask Paul Rice, his father.

480
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,561
<i>When he came back, his lip was cut,
and he was moaning.</i>

481
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,569
I asked if he was okay,
but he was disoriented.

482
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,571
Then he passed out.

483
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:20,578
Is the police officer who took Lucas from the cell
and then brought him back 10 minutes later here today?

484
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,910
Yes. He's sitting right there.

Thank you.

486
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:36,217
The night in question, you had been arrested
for disorderly conduct and possession of cocaine?

487
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,228
Yes.

488
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,390
It was dark in the
holding cell, right? Yes.

489
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:47,268
So it's impossible to say for certain that
Officer Tolbert was the man who entered that cell?

490
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,738
<i>No, I'm certain. Like I said,</i>

491
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,241
he had arrested me
earlier that night.

492
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,301
So I remembered what he looked like.

493
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,847
<i>Plus I saw the name Tolbert
on his shirt pocket,</i>

494
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,179
and I started laughing to myself.

495
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,616
Laughing?

496
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,211
My criminal law professor's name
was Kevin Tolbert.

497
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,655
I thought it was, you know, ironic.

498
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,353
<i>[Grace] Know what else is ironic,
or perhaps just coincidental?</i>

499
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,192
The drug charge was dismissed
in exchange for your testimony?

500
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,630
Yes.

501
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,168
Nothing further.

502
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,605
<i>Were you fired from yourjob recently?</i>

503
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
<i>Yes.
Why?</i>

504
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:28,178
<i>I told the managing partner
I had to testify at this trial.</i>

505
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,773
When I explained why, he fired me.

506
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:36,115
And if you had pled guilty to the drug charge
and not testified, what would have happened?

507
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:40,556
Nothing. He never would
have known I'd been arrested.

508
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,220
Thank you.
The People rest, Your Honor.

509
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,858
The defense calls Martin Addas.

510
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,663
<i>My club caters to gay men
into rough trade.</i>

511
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,727
We don't market ourselves
as such, but we-

512
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,638
What does, uh, rough trade mean?

513
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:01,077
<i>[Addas] It's a term for men who enjoy having
rough sex with tough, blue-collar guys.</i>

514
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:05,514
It's not exactly S&M,
but it's, uh, still rough.

515
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,986
Have you ever seen any of your patrons
engaged in this type of sex? Sure,

516
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,284
in the private rooms.

517
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,552
Have you seen patrons
using sex toys?

518
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,752
Sometimes.

519
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:21,162
What's the largest male sex toy
you've ever seen at your club?

520
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,326
Pretty big.

521
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,168
<i>- [Grace] As big as a nightstick?
- Yes.</i>

522
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,843
Thank you.

523
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:46,517
Did you ever see Lucas Rice
engaged in a sex act in your club?

524
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,025
No.

525
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,285
Nothing further.

526
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,765
<i>You think thejury's gonna buy
that gay sex bit?</i>

527
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:03,671
<i>[Grace] We don't have a
lot of options. Sure we do.</i>

528
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,136
What are you talking about?

529
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,949
I wanna tell the jury
what happened.

530
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,485
That's not a good idea.

531
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,147
Why?

532
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,782
I didn't know Petro
was gonna rape that kid.

533
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,194
He asked me to take him
to the bathroom. That's it.

534
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:31,497
I thought he was gonna make him apologize
or smack him around a little bit.

535
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,333
I had no idea he was-

536
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,674
He went crazy that night.

537
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:50,747
He kept saying, "You like it,
don't you, you little bitch?"

538
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,623
So I opened the door
to see what was going on.

539
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,184
I couldn't believe-

540
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,299
I pulled him off
and he just started swinging.

541
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,897
He hit me in the eye.

542
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,806
But I didn't-

543
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,572
I just grabbed his arms,

544
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,205
and I just looked at him.

545
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:22,047
But he didn't-
he didn't even see me.

546
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,988
It's a good story, but it's murder.

547
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:34,593
You should've sold him out when
you had the chance, but you wanted to-

548
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,395
[Sighs]
You needed to be part of something.

549
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,302
I was a part of something.
Not like you think.

550
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:46,105
This-your color-
never goes away.

551
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,668
Not with these guys.

552
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,312
You got one shot to get out of here.

553
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,819
And the truth ain't it.

554
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,991
Did you see anyone
attack Lucas Rice?

555
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,122
<i>No.</i>

556
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,566
<i>Did you attack Lucas Rice?
Of course not.</i>

557
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:23,570
It's highly unusual to escort
an inmate to a private bathroom.

558
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,276
Not if someone's sick.

559
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,549
It's also highly unusual to leave an inmate
unattended in a private bathroom.

560
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,591
I was at a desk 15 feet away,
so he wasn't unattended.

561
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,026
<i>I wasn't that worried about him.
Yeah, well, obviously.</i>

562
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,029
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have helped rape him.

563
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:43,191
<i>[Grace] Objection. Sustained.
Watch it, Miss Kibre.</i>

564
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,127
Mr. Tolbert,

565
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,571
why did you purchase a nightstick
the morning Lucas died?

566
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:55,976
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

567
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,880
I didn't.

568
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:05,546
<i>Well, a store clerk, Mr. Whitney,
who has nothing to gain by this,</i>

569
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,750
picked you out of a photo array.

570
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,090
I didn't buy a nightstick that morning.

571
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,995
I swear to God.

572
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,795
On my daughter Serena's life.

573
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,960
All I ever wanted to be
was a police officer.

574
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,356
Tolbert's lyin'.

575
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:48,296
Tolbert brought Lucas into the bathroom knowing
Petro was gonna beat the hell out of him.

576
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,164
He told me everything
the day we talked about a deal.

577
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:55,501
And you're telling me this now,
the day before the trial's supposed to end?

578
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,303
I tried to call you. But I got a
lot on my plate, as you can imagine.

579
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:02,335
I'm calling you as a witness first thing
tomorrow morning. A witness? I can't testify.

580
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,472
Oh, the hell you can't.

581
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,948
LfTolbert lies, I can impeach.

582
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:16,154
<i>He said that he brought Lucas
into the bathroom,</i>

583
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,060
handcuffed him to the sink,
so his partner could get some payback.

584
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,429
- Payback?
- Petro thought Lucas punched him,

585
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,991
so he wanted revenge.

586
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,333
And where was the defendant
during the attack?

587
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,873
Outside the door...

588
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,932
<i>to make sure
no one else went in.</i>

589
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,810
<i>- And after it was over?
- He brought Lucas back to the cell,</i>

590
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,315
cleaned up the bathroom.

591
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,181
<i>[Kibre]
Cleaned up the bathroom?</i>

592
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:46,656
There was blood.
Petro's nightstick was on the floor.

593
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,057
What did he do with the nightstick?

594
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:55,090
He threw it in a Dumpster
on 10th Street,

595
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,657
<i>and then he bought
a new one the next morning.</i>

<i>[Kibre]
Thank you.</i>

You worked with Officer
Tolbert for five years? Yes.

598
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:14,911
Within the N.Y.P.D., he has
a reputation for honesty, doesn't he?

599
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,044
I suppose.

- No.

he's a good cop.

A good cop?
Are you trying to get fired?

608
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,771
He asked a question, I gave an answer. You
practically told the jury to acquit him.

I was telling the truth.
The truth?
