10
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:13,657
At this moment our state
extends its reach to the stars!

11
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,536
I tremble at the honour
of announcing...

12
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:22,833
...the culmination of humanity's
long history of intellect and science.

13
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:29,173
Our power spans the earth.
Now it will illuminate the stars!

14
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:34,011
May it stand forever!
Our Ziggurat!

15
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,992
Those robots are getting big ideas.
They don't know their place!

16
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,496
But our economy is unthinkable
without robot labour.

17
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,542
Yes, but they cause friction
with human workers.

18
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,004
The enemy is developing new weapons.

19
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:37,509
What Metropolis needs is a leader
who will be a powerful symbol!

20
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,030
Duke Red, with the Ziggurat complete,
will you be entering politics?

21
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,740
Don't be silly!

22
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:05,871
As long as President Boone governs,
our state is secure.

23
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,499
Politics has no need of me.

24
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,044
Mr President, would you like to see
Duke Red in politics?

25
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:18,425
Don't encourage him! How could I
compete with anyone so popular?

26
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:26,684
Is it true there are
military facilities in the Ziggurat?

27
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,687
Would the Mayor care to comment?

28
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,275
Ask Minister of State Skunk
about that.

29
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,861
Hurray for the Ziggurat!
Long live Metropolis!

30
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,197
Hurray for the Ziggurat!
Long live Metropolis!

31
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,163
Uncle Shunsaku... what does
'ziggurat' mean?

32
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,081
Who knows?

33
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,044
Hey! Look up there!

34
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,421
What's that?

35
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,140
Malduk! It's the Malduks!

36
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,573
There he is!

37
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,844
You said she'd be ready tonight,
Dr Laughton.

38
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,471
Er, well...

39
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:32,684
What is the meaning of this?
I've given you the best facilities...

40
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,395
...money can buy!

41
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,690
If you could wait a little longer.
I'm almost done.

42
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,984
I'm tired of hearing that.

43
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,946
I'll be at your lab tomorrow night.

44
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:48,659
But it's not the kind of place
you'd go to!

45
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,286
And the place is a mess!

46
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,372
Get back to work!

47
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,471
It's me.

48
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,474
I hear there was trouble, Rock.

49
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,562
Yes. A robot agitator in the plaza.

50
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,023
You were supposed to have
that under control!

51
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,525
Yes, Father.

52
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:26,196
Fool! I am not your father!

53
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:31,535
I merely found you during
the last war and took you in.

54
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:32,786
Yes, sir.

55
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,607
I'm Shunsaku Ban,
a private investigator from Japan.

56
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:06,737
I have a letter of introduction
to Superintendent Notarlin.

57
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,497
I see.

58
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,792
So you're saying this 'Dr Laughton'...

59
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,253
...is hiding out...

60
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,257
...here in Metropolis?

61
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:41,355
Yes. This is a reliable tip from
an organ smuggler he dealt with.

62
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,734
The International Human Rights
Committee and other organisations...

63
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,945
...have issued warrants against him...

64
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,741
...for vivisection experiments
and dealing in human organs.

65
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:57,454
To which end I ask
for your cooperation...

66
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:03,377
...seeing I've never been in this city
and I don't know east from west here.

67
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:10,133
I'd like to help, but with
the celebrations for the Ziggurat...

68
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,302
...going on all this week...

69
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,973
...it's taking every single person
I have...

70
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,475
...to keep things under control.

71
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,728
I don't have anybody...

72
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:26,108
Well, I could give you a robot
if that's OK with you.

73
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,359
A robot?!

74
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,030
Yes. He's very good.

75
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:36,535
He's not authorised
to arrest people...

76
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,998
...but he can certainly assist you
in your investigation.

77
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,839
Do I have to return him
with a full tank?

78
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,177
He only needs refuelling
every five years.

79
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,562
Soon they won't need us any more.

80
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,940
I'm Ken-ichi. How do you do?

81
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:12,070
I am Model 803-D-RP-DM...

82
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,615
...497-3-C.

83
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,869
Uh, how do you do?

84
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,592
<i>The completion of the Ziggurat...</i>

85
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:37,763
<i>...establishes our Metropolis
as the world leader...</i>

86
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,974
<i>...in industry, economics
and culture.</i>

87
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:47,564
<i>Thus is born a State that will
last a thousand years!</i>

88
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,735
<i>I tremble at the honour
of announcing...</i>

89
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:56,948
<i>...the culmination of humanity's
long history of intellect and science.</i>

90
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:02,663
<i>Our power spans the earth.
Now it will illuminate the stars!</i>

91
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,501
<i>May it stand forever! Our Ziggurat!</i>

92
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,842
Well, where do we start, uh...

93
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,889
...803, uh...

94
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,935
'D-RP-DM497-3-C'.

95
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,772
Don't you have an easier name?

96
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:34,444
We are not allowed human names,
as it may infringe...

97
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,279
...upon human rights.

98
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:45,122
I know! As of now,
your name is 'Pero'.

99
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,332
That's a dog's name!

100
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,753
That's right.
I used to have a dog named 'Pero'.

101
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,046
He was a great dog.

102
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,385
In my opinion, a criminal
could not hide...

103
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,638
...up here in Metropolis.

104
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:05,475
I have reliable sources
that say he's here!

105
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,063
Dr Laughton would not hide up here.
He would go to Zone 1.

106
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,857
'Zone 1'?

107
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,150
Underground.

108
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,069
Hey! You are a detective!

109
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:21,324
It is simply a calculation
of probabilities.

110
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,101
Robots are strictly forbidden...

111
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,730
...to operate outside
their assigned area.

112
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,356
That robot...

113
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,694
...was not authorised
to operate at surface level.

114
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:11,541
OK, but who are those guys?
They look like fascists.

115
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:16,588
The Malduk Party, vigilantes
who started as a political group.

116
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:21,218
Movement between levels is restricted.

117
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,890
No one who carries the mark
may pass through this gate.

118
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,392
So that robot had the mark?

119
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,227
Yes.

120
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,146
Each block has a gate like this.

121
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,983
There are, of course, hidden ways
and people...

122
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,985
...who work as guides to them.

123
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,279
Damn right! The system's wrong!

124
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:51,331
Hmm... it takes light
to create shadow, I guess...

125
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:55,085
This level is not
particularly dangerous...

126
00:13:55,293 --> 00:14:00,298
...but there are places in which
police writ does not run.

127
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:01,758
Avoid them.

128
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:06,513
We can't do that.
We're not here as tourists.

129
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,533
Duke Red...

130
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,244
Let's see it.

131
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,640
Very good.

132
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,851
Isn't she finished?

133
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:40,607
Her final-stage energy processor
isn't stable yet.

134
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,903
Are you using real organs?

135
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,032
Dear me, no! That's illegal!

136
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:54,079
Real organs are quicker,
but they don't last very long.

137
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,123
Hers are mechanical. I made them.

138
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:02,045
She will be my masterpiece!

139
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,592
When will you finish?

140
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,972
Within the week.
If I start her too early...

141
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,977
...she'll build up too much energy,
catch fire and explode.

142
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,816
My Tima...

143
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,818
I'm not giving you to anyone!

144
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,904
I'll put on the finishing touches...

145
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,075
...and together we will flee!

146
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,429
Rock? What are you doing here?

147
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,308
Protecting my father is
my most important task.

148
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,350
'Father'?

149
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,563
But Duke Red has no children.

150
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,441
And the child who died was a girl.

151
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,819
Quiet! I know what you're up to.

152
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,866
No mad scientist is going to
deceive my father.

153
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:01,289
And no mannequin like this
will steal his heart.

154
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,334
Stop!

155
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:09,130
It is at Duke Red's request
I've made Tima.

156
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,550
Tima is the super-being
who is to sit...

157
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,554
...on the Throne of Power
atop the Ziggurat.

158
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,098
You lie!

159
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,560
He would never give
the Ziggurat to a robot!

160
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,773
Perhaps you should ask
Duke Red about that.

161
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,149
Will you destroy...

162
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,904
...the super-being for whom
the one you call 'Father' waits?

163
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,955
No robot will steal my father!

164
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,339
No! Don't!

165
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,101
<i>O ye Gods, give me courage...</i>

166
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,898
<i>...and strength to guard
my father from machines!</i>

167
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,668
Fire!

168
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:11,836
Fire!

169
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,578
A Malduk set that fire!

170
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,914
I saw him!

171
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,543
The ones up there want to kill us!

172
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,714
Atlas is right!

173
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,093
They think we're nothing but garbage!

174
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,680
To arms! Now we have to fight!

175
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:09,602
Please remain calm. Fire-fighting
operations are commencing.

176
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,523
Everyone please step back.

177
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,609
Robots out!

178
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:23,408
First you take our jobs,
and now you're trying to kill us!

179
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,077
This is no time to be fighting!

180
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,583
What the...?!

181
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:23,301
But why did he set fire
to that old factory?

182
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,512
Well, that strange old man
was around...

183
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,725
An old man? This one?

184
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:32,769
Yes.

185
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,395
Thanks a lot!

186
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,616
There's someone in there!

187
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,286
Uh-oh...

188
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,663
Ken-ichi, go round the back.

189
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:53,790
Hurry!

190
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,308
Come on, Laughton!

191
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,935
N-n-notebook...

192
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,940
That notebook?

193
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,651
Laughton!

194
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,485
Laughton's lab burned down?!

195
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:51,240
I guess he was doing an experiment.
The fire just ripped right through it.

196
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,117
What happened to him?

197
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,119
His body was found.

198
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,957
Whatever he was doing...

199
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,045
...considering there are
warrants for his arrest...

200
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:07,048
...it must have been
something dangerous.

201
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,887
What's wrong, Father?
What did Dr Laughton mean to you?

202
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,138
Get out!

203
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,641
Leave me alone.

204
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,788
Where am I?

205
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,720
That was sure some fire!

206
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,182
Well, it was just an old factory.

207
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,310
Saves the trouble of tearing it down.

208
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,106
<i>This is strange.</i>

209
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:33,486
<i>She was the most advanced
robot there is.</i>

210
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,905
<i>There should be something left...</i>

211
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,035
Pero, who's that?

212
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,787
Rock of the Malduks.

213
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,291
He's young, but he's one of
their main men.

214
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,461
They say he does
Duke Red's dirty work.

215
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:51,796
Duke Red?

216
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,633
Is he connected with the Malduks?

217
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,302
He's the party founder.

218
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:04,308
Now there's no official connection,
but he funds their activities.

219
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:10,481
It's a public secret.

220
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,149
Everyone knows.

221
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,990
Where does this sewer come out?

222
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:24,161
It merges up ahead with
the sewage from Zone 2...

223
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:27,248
...and goes to the processing plant
in Zone 3.

224
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:32,837
If she's down there she'll have been
chopped up with the other garbage.

225
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,338
Anyone else, yes.

226
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,175
The criminal always returns
to the scene.

227
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,971
An old saying, but a good one.

228
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,224
We should continue searching
for Ken-ichi.

229
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,121
Who are you?

230
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,623
'Who are you.'

231
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:14,712
No, no, no... you call yourself 'I'.

232
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,048
'I' am who?

233
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,260
'I am'...

234
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,387
You are I.

235
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,723
No... listen...

236
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,810
'You' are 'I'. 'I' am 'you'...

237
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,395
Huh?

238
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,898
I am who.

239
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,735
Yeah, that's right.
And I'm Ken-ichi.

240
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:39,862
'Ken-ichi'.

241
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,906
'Ken-ichi'...

242
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:43,199
Yeah.

243
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:48,162
Anyway, it'll all come to you
after a while.

244
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:53,959
Your name, your family,
your father, your mother...

245
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,420
'Family'... 'father'...

246
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,477
Uh, thanks, I guess.

247
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:16,106
I know this is food,
but it's all rotten.

248
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:17,942
'Food'...

249
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:23,823
Yeah. You put it in your mouth
like this... and eat it.

250
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:28,786
No, don't eat that!
It'll make you sick!

251
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,789
'No, don't eat... make you sick'...

252
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:43,968
<i>Attention Control: cloud cover 1.1.

258
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,486
<i>Control authorisation.

260
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,158

262
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,352

<i>Radiation equipment in position.</i>

266
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,580
We'll radiate for three minutes.

267
00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:02,004
Citizens won't be affected,
but above-ground robots will.

268
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,549
I'm having everything recorded.

269
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,885
The data will be valuable.

270
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,764
Begin at Level 3.

271
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,265
Yes, Doctor.

272
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,235
Commencing radiation!

273
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,172
<i>Terminate Level-B radiation

<i>Control disengaged.</i>

284
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,538
Success!

285
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,336
This will set the whole world
on its ear!

286
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:52,257
You now hold the power
of the gods themselves.

287
00:34:55,594 --> 00:35:01,266
If only Dr Laughton had finished
building our guardian deity...

288
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,442
He's caused anomalies in sunspots...

289
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,238
...and bathed Earth
in harmful magnetic radiation.

290
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:18,492
It's an outrage that he would
endanger national security...

291
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,661
...by developing such a thing!

292
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,872
The Malduk robot hunters...

293
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:27,084
...are using this as an excuse...

294
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:31,672
...to cry 'human rights' and press
for changes in the Robot Law.

295
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,967
The pro-robot citizens' groups...

296
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:38,971
...say that's reactionary nonsense.
They're organising protests.

297
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,640
There's fighting breaking out.

298
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,061
This is our chance, Mr President!

299
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:50,315
We could make a case
for treason here.

300
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,322
Will the military support us?

301
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:02,786
Some units are under Duke Red's
influence, but I can handle that.

302
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,044
We'll stir up the public
with a few leaks.

303
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:16,884
Once sentiment is against Duke Red,
we'll arrest him for treason.

304
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:22,097
Should military action be needed,
you have...

305
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,682
...my approval.

306
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:36,528
I suspect he was the guy
who did in Laughton.

307
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,782
What I don't understand is
how they were connected.

308
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:45,329
Just what was Laughton
working on, anyway?

309
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,874
What will you do?

310
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:54,463
Laughton's already dead.
I want at least to know why.

311
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,132
My client deserves that.

312
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,362
Where's he going now?

313
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,113
Zone 2, I think.

314
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:25,160
There's another level below this?
How far down does this place go?

315
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:30,499
Zone 2 is the Metropolis
power-plant area.

316
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:35,170
Zone 3 below that
is the sewage-handling facility.

317
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,339
The sewage facility...

318
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:42,761
You know, he was looking at
a drain behind that factory...

319
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,685
I'll report back and get
permission to go below.

320
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,855
I'll file a missing-persons
report on Ken-ichi, too.

321
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,859
Hey! You're kind of old
for a petty thief!

322
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:58,777
Sorry!

323
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:04,992
If anyone was wandering around
down there...

324
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,744
...they'd notice him right away.

325
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,207
How often are you down here?

326
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,711
Twice a week,
for maintenance on the robots.

327
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:31,810
These are Albert II types.
It's their last check this week.

328
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,749
Is anyone here?

329
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:06,178
You never get used to the stink
down here, though.

330
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,807
No human could last a day
at this work.

331
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,447
What is it?

332
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,323
Someone's there.

333
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,991
Impossible!

334
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,620
Hey! What are you doing there?!

335
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,956
This is a restricted area!

336
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,625
So she survived...

337
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,127
Help!

338
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,672
What are you doing?!

339
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,966
It's all right. They're criminals.

340
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:48,136
How do we get out of here?

341
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:55,644
Stop that, please!
You'll hit the equipment!

342
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:05,987
Are you OK?

343
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,383
That guy's trying to kill us!

344
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,423
Move! Move! Out of the way!

345
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:09,050
You piece of junk!

346
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:12,262
Move!

347
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,755
Is it safe?

348
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,323
It looks OK.

349
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,129
What's wrong?

350
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,512
Oh, I get it...

351
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:38,807
Fifi can't go through that gate.

352
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:43,144
Thanks for everything, Fifi.
We'll see you again.

353
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:44,312
Ow!

354
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,022
Move!

355
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:50,652
It's him!

356
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,385
Fifi!

357
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:26,896
No weapons through here.
May I see your ID?

358
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,399
I'm Rock of the Malduks!

359
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,281
<i>Demonstrations are forbidden
during Celebration Week.</i>

360
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,909
<i>Please disperse immediately.</i>

361
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,371
Ken-ichi?

362
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,459
Ken-ichi?

363
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,376
Hey!

364
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,796
Pay up!

365
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,060
They're not here!

366
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,688
They have to be! Keep looking!

367
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,599
Look over that way!

368
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,549
What's the matter, Atlas?
We're waiting for your signal!

369
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:27,345
Not today. There are Malduks
all over the place.

370
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,972
Was there a leak?

371
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,474
They're the reason.

372
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,019
Rock's after them.

373
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:36,813
Come on!

374
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:41,109
He was at that factory...

375
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,500
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

376
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:01,880
I'm Ken-ichi. I'm from Japan.
My uncle's a private...

377
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,298
A private what?

378
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:08,469
Uh... a journalist!
I'm his assistant.

379
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,973
Why is Rock after you?

380
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,183
I don't know.

381
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,811
He just started shooting at us.

382
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,479
I don't trust them.

383
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,064
Let's kill them.

384
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:22,150
Cool it!

385
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,652
We're not a gang.

386
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,530
He says he's a journalist.

387
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:35,163
If he can tell the world about
Metropolis, that helps us!

388
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:41,544
We can't waste time on nice uniforms
and our pictures in the paper.

389
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,590
The uniform I die in...

390
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,345
...will be the uniform
of the revolution!

391
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:31,970
Look at that!

392
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,263
She looks like an angel!

393
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:36,975
Yeah! An angel!

394
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:49,112
Around here there's two
or three families to a room.

395
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:53,282
There's no schools,
hardly any jobs for people...

396
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:59,247
They survive on food handouts,
but with the Ziggurat celebrations...

397
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,124
...that's all been stopped.

398
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,169
What does 'ziggurat' mean?

399
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,341
It's an ancient Babylonian tower.

400
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:15,805
'The Tower of Babel' was one.
You know what happened to that.

401
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:20,143
The king's pride brought down
the wrath of God on him.

402
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:25,982
History repeats itself. The same thing
will happen to Duke Red.

403
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:29,777
But it won't be God this time.
It'll be us.

404
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,638
Is that wrong?

405
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,063
No, it's fine.

406
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:09,400
I was just thinking your hair's grown.

407
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:13,821
What kind of hair do you like?

408
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:15,073
Huh?

409
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,325
Yours is fine right now.

410
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,455
Let's get back to your writing.

411
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,790
Next comes...

412
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:24,499
'Tima'.

413
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:25,833
Huh? What?

414
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,878
'Tima'. My name.

415
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,343
So you remember!

416
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:40,473
That's great! Now you'll start
remembering more and more.

417
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,019
Thank you, Ken-ichi.

418
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:57,448
Oh, I forgot... I borrowed this
from Atlas.

419
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:04,622
Ken-ichi...

420
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:16,217
So the Army's with us?
That helps a lot.

421
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:19,387
The underground residents
support us...

422
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:24,142
...but they're not sure if we've got
the strength to win or not.

423
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:29,063
The Malduks are to move
when the Ziggurat celebrations end.

424
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:34,735
We want you to crush them
and storm the Ziggurat.

425
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:41,617
The President will announce the arrest
of Duke Red for treason.

426
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,579
He will invoke his powers...

427
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:48,082
...to take control of
the police and military.

428
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:54,672
Then Metropolis will be governed
by the rule of law.

429
00:52:55,339 --> 00:53:00,678
And we will participate
as a proper political party.

430
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,106
Of course, Atlas. The President
will welcome you with open arms.

431
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:16,068
The things I get myself into!

432
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:19,572
I finally find that kid,
and look what happens!

433
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:24,035
I'm sorry I could not have been
of more assistance.

434
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,204
What are you talking about?

435
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:31,459
You've been lots of help!
I don't know east from west here.

436
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:36,214
Don't worry about Ken-ichi.
He's tougher than he...

437
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,636
Cut that out!

438
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,019
Just look at this, will you?

439
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:37,608
'Watch out. Hide, robots.
Coup d'état.'

440
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,069
What?! A coup d'état?!

441
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,725
Oh, man!

442
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,915
Take a good look, Ken-ichi.

443
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:39,128
Tell the whole world
how angry we are.

444
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:00,441
I'm all out of breath!

445
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:11,660
We'd better get out of here, Pero.
We can't do anything.

446
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,497
Ask headquarters for back-up.

447
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:17,541
I'm not leaving you here!

448
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:23,089
It's robots they're going to
attack first!

449
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:26,550
I will be fine.

450
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:27,468
What?!

451
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,848
It is also my duty to ensure
the safety of all visitors...

452
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,558
...to our city.

453
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:35,476
All right.

454
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:40,773
Just don't stir anything up
till I get back!

455
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:00,167
Are you going to hold this gate
all by yourself?

456
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:04,463
Demonstrations are forbidden
during Celebration Week.

457
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,881
Please disperse immediately.

458
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:09,260
Sorry, we can't do that.
Our time has come.

459
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:14,807
Why must humanity settle matters
by resorting to violence?

460
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:21,856
Yes, we all know that.
I agree it is a problem.

461
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:25,818
It's our emotions. They vibrate,
and all we can do...

462
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,571
...is move forward
within that amplitude.

463
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,658
But without affirming them,
we can't survive.

464
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:59,768
It's time for the uprising to begin.

465
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:03,105
When should we release a statement?

466
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:07,151
Things should be clear
by about 1 p.m...

467
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,112
...so I suggest 3 or 3:30.

468
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,245
What is it, Minister?

469
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,249
Hard to relax, eh?

470
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:27,129
Yes, Mr President.
I have an unpleasant duty to perform.

471
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,178
What the...?!

472
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,890
You've gone over to Duke Red!

473
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,104
I am merely history's agent.

474
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:51,820
Wait! We can discuss this!

475
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:46,208
Why?

476
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:53,549
Why do humans just go
and destroy robots?

477
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,224
'Revolution'!

478
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,066
<i>The coup d'état has failed.</i>

479
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:15,988
<i>Martial law is in effect,
under the command of Duke Red.</i>

480
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:20,826
<i>Abandon your weapons and surrender.</i>

481
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:22,536
<i>I repeat...</i>

482
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,872
<i>...the coup d'état has failed.</i>

483
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:29,627
<i>Martial law is in effect,
under the command of Duke Red.</i>

484
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:34,173
<i>Abandon your weapons and surrender.</i>

485
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,137
Ken-ichi!

486
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:44,016
Hey! Ken-ichi!

487
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:50,773
Uncle!

488
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,572
You're safe! That's great!

489
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,866
Are you all right?

490
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,118
This? It's nothing!

491
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,538
Who's this?

492
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:11,669
Her name's Tima.

493
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,547
We escaped from that fire together.

494
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:19,385
Tima, this is my uncle.

495
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:21,887
'Uncle'...

496
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,818
Atlas!

497
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:42,533
It... was... a...trap!

498
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,835
We meet at last.

499
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:55,462
Don't move!

500
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,722
No trouble.

501
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:10,436
Give me the girl,
and you might get back home alive.

502
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,398
Don't make promises
you won't keep, Rock!

503
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,413
Don't play games with me!

504
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,790
Tima! Pick up the gun!

505
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:58,734
I'll have that back, please.

506
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,779
Don't give it to him!

507
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:18,253
You going to shoot?

508
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,465
I'm human, you know.

509
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:26,720
Rock!

510
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,907
So it's these people
you've neglected your duties...

511
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,993
...to go chasing after...

512
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,801
Tima!

513
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:07,970
It's you!

514
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:10,639
Rock!

515
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,267
What's going on here?!

516
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:20,774
You told me no one survived
the fire in Dr Laughton's lab!

517
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:25,320
And how did you know about Tima?
Answer me!

518
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,663
I will.

519
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:39,626
You are the one who must sit
on the Throne of Power.

520
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,462
No robot must ever rule...

521
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,299
...the Ziggurat, and Metropolis!

522
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:46,466
Fool!

523
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:49,219
'Robot'?

524
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:55,851
Do you think you fool me?
You're out of line, boy!

525
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,603
Get up!

526
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:13,702
I never want to see you again!

527
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:15,871
Ken-ichi!

528
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,752
So it was you who hired Laughton!

529
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:23,712
What if I did?

530
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:27,674
I've come from Japan
to arrest Laughton.

531
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:31,219
My name is Shunsaku Ban...

532
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,192
Get in.

533
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,361
And Ken-ichi?

534
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:49,363
You'll see him later.

535
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:27,234
I'm here to see
Superintendent Notarlin.

536
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:31,571
He's been transferred.
His successor hasn't been named.

537
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:38,578
There's been a mistake. The Malduks
have taken my nephew away...

538
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:41,707
Handle it through your embassy!

539
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:10,652
<i>At this moment our state
extends its reach to the stars!</i>

540
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:14,197
<i>I tremble at the honour
of announcing...</i>

541
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:20,245
<i>...the culmination of humanity's
long history of intellect and science.</i>

542
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:31,631
Saké.

543
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,593
Make it hot.

544
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:40,015
Hot whisky or gin I can do,
for a Japanese detective.

545
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,893
Hot whisky, then.

546
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:48,648
Who gives a damn about the Ziggurat?!

547
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:53,070
And those Malduks can eat dogshit!

548
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:54,029
Here.

549
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:01,703
Hey! That was Rock!

550
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:06,333
I heard he quit the party.
What's he doing here?

551
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:08,043
Thanks.

552
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,294
Take care.

553
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:19,930
Whoops!

554
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,793
Um...

555
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,800
...a man earlier tonight
asked me to give you this.

556
01:08:57,092 --> 01:08:58,510
I said 'no'.

557
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:03,723
He wanted it kept secret
from Duke Red, and of course...

558
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:08,603
...I said I couldn't possibly, but...
his name was 'Ken-ichi'.

559
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:17,571
'I can't move at the moment,
so I can't...

560
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,656
'...come to you.

561
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:24,077
'I'm leaving the country soon.

562
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:27,789
'I want to see you again.'

563
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:44,014
Ken-ichi!

564
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,032
What's going on here?

565
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:06,286
You will bring her back soon,
won't you?

566
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:10,498
I'll be in real trouble
if they ever find out.

567
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,835
Don't worry. This won't take long.

568
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,215
This wasn't my idea.

569
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,508
I have to get back.

570
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,387
You tricked me.

571
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,310
How else could I talk to you?

572
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:35,190
Where's Ken-ichi?
If you know, take me to him.

573
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,904
Well, well, well...

574
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:47,035
To talk to you, you'd never guess
you were a robot.

575
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:59,506
I guess Father chose
his mad scientist very well.

576
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,175
What are you talking about?

577
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,552
You being a robot.

578
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:08,223
That's not true. I'm not a robot.

579
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:11,851
So what are you? Human?

580
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,858
So who's your father? Where is he?

581
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,527
My father...

582
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,363
...is Ken-ichi.

583
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:45,427
The super-being?
A mannequin like you?!

584
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:57,063
If you can't take me to Ken-ichi,
I'm going.

585
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,619
Tima's gone?!

586
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:24,132
Watch where you're going!

587
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:19,896
Let's see inside this super-being
Father wants so much.

588
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:55,014
<i>Come on, Laughton!</i>

589
01:13:55,557 --> 01:13:57,684
<i>N-n-notebook...</i>

590
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:01,938
<i>That notebook?</i>

591
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,104
Don't be alarmed.

592
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:29,108
I taught Rock a lesson
he won't forget.

593
01:15:29,651 --> 01:15:31,027
Where's Ken-ichi?

594
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:33,780
I'm looking for him, too.

595
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,616
I need your help for that.

596
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:38,034
You do?

597
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:42,789
I think they've got him somewhere
in the Ziggurat.

598
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:45,625
I need to look for him...

599
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:49,462
...on the Ziggurat's data network.

600
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:51,464
Can you do that?

601
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:15,029
Hold out your hand.

602
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,378
Ken-ichi!

603
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,266
Well?

604
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:27,060
Ken-ichi's in...

605
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,479
...that building!

606
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:33,066
You did it! I knew he was there!

607
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:37,487
What happened to me?

608
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:42,659
I see... you don't know
who you are, do you?

609
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:44,619
What do you mean?

610
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,796
I'll report the instant
we find anything, sir.

611
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:56,422
Duke Red?

612
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:57,423
Yeah.

613
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:00,134
Anything?

614
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,095
We can track the signal...

615
01:18:02,804 --> 01:18:06,099
...by where it burned out the splitters.

616
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:11,521
Got it!

617
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:12,480
Where?

618
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:16,609
Zone 1, South Block 17.
The Hotel Coconut.

619
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:25,493
Tell me, please! Am I human,
or am I...

620
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,621
Well, you're different...

621
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:32,125
...from normal robots.

622
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,293
I'm human.

623
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,547
Just like Ken-ichi!

624
01:18:37,964 --> 01:18:41,134
Uh, yes... of course you are!

625
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,805
Anyway, now we've got to
rescue Ken-ichi.

626
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,672
Tima! I've been looking for you!

627
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:38,691
Tell me what's going on,
or I'll charge you with kidnapping!

628
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,735
I'm not your man.

629
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:44,739
It's your son you want to talk to.

630
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,741
Huh? Rock?

631
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,702
I don't know what the plan is...

632
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:55,750
...but I suspect Dr Laughton
was involved in it somehow.

633
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:59,754
And I suspect
you had him killed...

634
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,256
...to keep her a secret.

635
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:10,223
Take him away.

636
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:14,560
Come on!

637
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:46,843
That is a special throne made
especially for you.

638
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:50,972
One day from here
you will rule the entire world!

639
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:52,390
Me?

640
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,267
Why?

641
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,353
That is your destiny.

642
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,438
I'll show you.

643
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:12,493
Ken-ichi!

644
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:13,744
Ken-ichi!

645
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,289
Ken-ichi!

646
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:22,628
Wake up, Ken-ichi!

647
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:26,007
It's me! Can you hear me?

648
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:30,177
Ken-ichi... Ken-ichi?

649
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:33,973
What have you done to him?!

650
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:40,104
He's in no danger. We just had to
quiet him down a little.

651
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,066
Ken-ichi? Ken-ichi?

652
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:50,281
I'll file a protest with my embassy!
It'll be an international incident!

653
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:56,203
Oh? I didn't realise you were
so politically important.

654
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,080
My apologies.

655
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:05,004
But soon every nation in the world
will bow down before Tima.

656
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:09,050
Make Ken-ichi the way he was.

657
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:14,347
What's one or two young kids, Tima?

658
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:18,684
You have the power to rule the world!

659
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:22,521
What power is that?

660
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:24,690
Am I human?

661
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:30,029
Or am I one of those poor robots?

662
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:33,282
Oh, don't be silly!

663
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:36,702
You're nothing like those piles of junk!

664
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:40,665
Then am I human, like Ken-ichi?

665
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:46,337
What are you saying?!
You're no mere human being...

666
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:52,051
...ruled by emotion and feeling,
torn between morality and love!

667
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,640
You are the super-being!

668
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,227
So then I am a...

669
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:05,189
I've brought you new clothes,
Miss Tima.

670
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,567
Yes, you are a robot...

671
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:13,072
...but you stand at the pinnacle
of all existence!

672
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:24,041
No. I have the emotions and love
that you hate.

673
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:29,714
That's because your full capacities
haven't yet taken form.

674
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:32,049
As your abilities evolve...

675
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:36,012
...they're simply taking
the form of emotion and love.

676
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,096
In time...

677
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:43,936
You will become one with that throne,
a computer weapon meant for conquest!

678
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:49,525
Your memories and emotions
will all be erased!

679
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:53,154
How did you know that?!

680
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:56,073
I fancy myself a detective.

681
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:06,250
Come, Miss Tima.
You should change.

682
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:11,589
Father... open your eyes!

683
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:17,928
Rock!

684
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:20,473
What on earth?!

685
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,934
What are you doing?!

686
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:31,942
It is you who must sit
on that throne.

687
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:36,947
You are the leader we must bow to!

688
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:42,161
No!

689
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:11,524
Tima!

690
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:25,371
You're awake?

691
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:57,278
I am a humanoid... a machine
made to destroy the world...

692
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,366
Not 'destroy'! 'Make again'!

693
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:03,534
Stop!

694
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:09,165
Ken-ichi...

695
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:09,767
Hey!

696
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,143
Who threw that switch?!

697
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:12,937
It just started up!

698
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,813
Cut the power!

699
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:16,106
It won't respond!

700
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:18,275
It's going into the red!

701
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,710
Dr Ponkotz!

702
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,630
What's that alarm?!

703
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,967
The omotanium generator's going wild!

704
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:44,510
What's going on!?

705
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:45,719
I'm not sure...

706
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:32,141
Stop, Tima!
You'll destroy the Ziggurat!

707
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:38,063
This comes of trifling with robots.

708
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:48,115
Her memory's merging with
the data network! She'll go mad!

709
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:52,202
Thus God destroyed
the Tower of Babel...

710
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,621
Tima!

711
01:28:55,706 --> 01:28:59,126
No! She's no longer
the Tima you knew!

712
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,097
All right.

713
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:17,978
The omotanium generator will explode
if we don't shut it down!

714
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:26,236
The chance of human survival...

715
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,740
...will fall to 30 per cent
within one hour.

716
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:33,494
My entire world-wide network
of forces...

717
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:37,081
...will be completely activated
within 30 minutes.

718
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:41,960
Their targets are
the world's major cities...

719
01:29:42,086 --> 01:29:44,755
...and 7,586 other facilities.

720
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:50,177
Estimated time period...

721
01:29:50,386 --> 01:29:54,681
...for eradication of humanity
by biological warfare:

722
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:57,017
17 hours, 27 minutes.

723
01:29:59,228 --> 01:30:00,854
Hear that, Duke Red?

724
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:08,028
Your super-being says
she doesn't need us!

725
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:09,530
Tima!

726
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:12,116
Come back!

727
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:16,120
Ken-ichi!

728
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,093
Ken-ichi!

729
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,055
Ken-ichi!

730
01:30:36,432 --> 01:30:38,725
Ken-ichi!

731
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:56,410
Tima!

732
01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:19,326
Tima!

733
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,709
Tima!

734
01:32:46,937 --> 01:32:50,482
<i>Doctor! We've lost control of
the underground power pl...</i>

735
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:53,443
What's happening?!

736
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:18,468
Get out! You robots
are not supposed to be here!

737
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:25,851
Tima! It's me!

738
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:37,487
Ken-ichi!

739
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,865
It's Ken-ichi!

740
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:18,236
Stop!

741
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:23,241
The likes of you...

742
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:27,245
...will never kill...

743
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:29,748
...my father!

744
01:34:33,085 --> 01:34:34,419
Rock!

745
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:33,163
Tima!

746
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:48,178
Tima!

747
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,513
Tima! Grab my hand!

748
01:37:33,265 --> 01:37:34,432
<i>I'm Ken-ichi.</i>

749
01:37:34,808 --> 01:37:36,351
<i>Who are you?</i>

750
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:37,936
<i>'Who are you.'</i>

751
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:42,774
<i>No, no, no... you call yourself 'I'.</i>

752
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:44,442
Ken-ichi!

753
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:47,445
Grab on!

754
01:37:48,572 --> 01:37:50,699
I am... who?

755
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:01,418
Tima!!!

756
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,903
Where did you find this?

757
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:08,545
Fifi?

758
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,757
Fifi!

759
01:40:51,588 --> 01:40:53,965
Ken-ichi!

760
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:58,094
Uncle!

761
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:16,905
Uncle...

762
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:21,951
...I think I'd like to
stay here a bit longer.

763
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:37,694
<i>I am... who?</i>
