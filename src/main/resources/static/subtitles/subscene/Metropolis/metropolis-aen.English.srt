10
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,686
At this moment our state
extends its reach to the stars!

11
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:32,556
I tremble at the honor
of announcing...

12
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,854
...the culmination of humanity's
long history of intellect and science.

13
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:44,198
Our power spans the earth.
Now it will illuminate the stars!

14
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:49,038
May it stand forever!
Our Ziggurat!

15
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:35,005
Those robots are getting big ideas.
They don't know their place!

16
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:39,519
But our economy is unthinkable
without robot labor.

17
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,587
Yes, but they cause friction
with human workers.

18
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:47,027
The enemy is developing new weapons.

19
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:52,527
What Metropolis needs is a leader
who will be a powerful symbol!

20
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,048
Duke Red, with the Ziggurat complete,
will you be entering politics?

21
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,779
Don't be silly!

22
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:20,919
As long as President Boone governs,
our state is secure.

23
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:23,519
Politics has no need of me.

24
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:27,063
Mr President, would you like to see
Duke Red in politics?

25
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:33,471
Don't encourage him! How could I
compete with anyone so popular?

26
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,712
It is true there are
military facilities in the Ziggurat?

27
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,709
Would the Mayor care to comment?

28
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:49,314
Ask Minister of State Skunk
about that.

29
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:52,860
Hurray for the Ziggurat!
Long live Metropolis!

30
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,226
Hurray for the Ziggurat!
Long live Metropolis!

31
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:03,198
Uncle Shunsaku... what does
'ziggurat' mean?

32
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:04,134
Who knows?

33
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:09,068
Hey! Look up there!

34
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:10,473
What's that?

35
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,184
Malduk! It's the Malduks!

36
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,595
There he is!

37
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:40,895
You said she'd be ready tonight,
Dr Laughton.

38
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,492
Er, well...

39
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,733
What is the meaning of this?
I've given you the best facilities...

40
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:49,333
...money can buy!

41
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:53,743
If you could wait a little longer.
I'm almost done.

42
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,006
I'm tired of hearing that.

43
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:58,985
I'll be at your lab tomorrow night.

44
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:03,682
But it's not the kind of place
you'd go to!

45
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,316
And the place is a mess!

46
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,418
Get back to work!

47
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:24,507
It's me.

48
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:27,505
I hear there was trouble, Rock.

49
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:31,614
Yes. A robot agitator in the plaza.

50
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,052
You were supposed to have
that under control!

51
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:36,555
Yes, Father.

52
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,217
Fool! I am not your father!

53
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:46,555
I merely found you during
the last war and took you in.

54
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:47,831
Yes, sir.

55
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,658
I'm Shunsaku Ban,
a private investigator from Japan.

56
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:21,758
I have a letter of introduction
to Superintendent Notarlin.

57
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,542
I see.

58
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,810
So you're saying this 'Dr Laughton'...

59
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,281
...is hiding out...

60
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,286
...here in Metropolis?

61
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:56,369
Yes. This is a reliable tip from
an organ smuggler he dealt with.

62
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,770
The International Human Rights
Committee and other organizations...

63
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,973
...have issued warrants against him...

64
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:07,776
...for vivisection experiments
and dealing in human organs.

65
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,483
To which end I ask
for your cooperation...

66
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:18,421
...seeing I've never been in this city
and I don't know east from west here.

67
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:25,160
I'd like to help, but with
the celebrations for the Ziggurat...

68
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:27,323
...going on all this week...

69
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:30,995
...it's taking every single person
I have...

70
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,504
...to keep things under control.

71
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,766
I don't have anybody...

72
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:41,143
Well, I could give you a robot
if that's OKwith you.

73
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:42,404
A robot?!

74
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:47,051
Yes. He's very good.

75
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:51,582
He's not authorized
to arrest people...

76
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:56,025
...but he can certainly assist you
in your investigation.

77
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,859
Do I have to return him
with a full tank?

78
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:09,206
He only needs refueling
every five years.

79
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:18,581
Soon they won't need us any more.

80
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:21,985
I'm Ken-ichi. How do you do.

81
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:27,121
I am Model 803-D-RP-DM...

82
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,662
...497-3-C.

83
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,894
Uh, how do you do.

84
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:48,642
<i>The completion of the Ziggurat...</i>

85
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,810
<i>...establishes our Metropolis</i>
<i>as the world leader...</i>

86
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,014
<i>...in industry, economics</i>
<i>and culture.</i>

87
00:11:56,357 --> 00:12:02,592
<i>Thus is born a State that will</i>
<i>last a thousand years!</i>

88
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,763
<i>I tremble at the honor</i>
<i>of announcing...</i>

89
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:11,970
<i>...the culmination of humanity's</i>
<i>long history of intellect and science.</i>

90
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:17,703
<i>Our power spans the earth.</i>
<i>Now it will illuminate the stars!</i>

91
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:22,539
<i>May it stand forever! Our Ziggurat!</i>

92
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:30,889
Well, where do we start, uh...

93
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:35,928
...803, uh...

94
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,989
'D-RP-DM497-3-C'.

95
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:43,795
Don't you have an easier name?

96
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:49,473
We are not allowed human names,
as it may infringe...

97
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:51,305
...upon human rights.

98
00:12:55,416 --> 00:13:00,149
I know! As of now,
your name is 'Pero'.

99
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:02,355
That's a dog's name!

100
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,782
That's right.
I used to have a dog named 'Pero'.

101
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:08,088
He was a great dog.

102
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:13,429
In my opinion, a criminal
could not hide...

103
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:16,662
...up here in Metropolis.

104
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,501
I have reliable sources
that say he's here!

105
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:25,102
Dr Laughton would not hide up here.
He would go to Zone 1.

106
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,907
'Zone 1'?

107
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,174
Underground.

108
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,113
Hey! You are a detective!

109
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:36,347
It is simply a calculation
of probabilities.

110
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,140
Robots are strictly forbidden...

111
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:06,782
...to operate outside
their assigned area.

112
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,377
That robot...

113
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:12,718
...was not authorized
to operate at surface level.

114
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:26,568
OK, but who are those guys?
They look like fascists.

115
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:31,633
The Malduk Party, vigilantes
who started as a political group.

116
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,239
Movement between levels is restricted.

117
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:41,915
No one who carries the mark
may pass through this gate.

118
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:44,456
So that robot had the mark?

119
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,253
Yes.

120
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:48,188
Each block has a gate like this.

121
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:52,026
There are, of course, hidden ways
and people...

122
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:54,032
...who work as guides to them.

123
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,331
Damn right! The system's wrong!

124
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:06,345
Hmm... it takes light
to create shadow, I guess...

125
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,138
This level is not
particularly dangerous...

126
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:15,345
...but there are places in which
police writ does not run.

127
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:16,784
Avoid them.

128
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,554
We can't do that.
We're not here as tourists.

129
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:23,549
Duke Red...

130
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,291
Let's see it.

131
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:46,670
Very good.

132
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:49,873
Isn't she finished?

133
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:55,649
Her final-stage energy processor
isn't stable yet.

134
00:16:56,957 --> 00:16:59,949
Are you using real organs?

135
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:04,086
Dear me, no! That's illegal!

136
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:09,134
Real organs are quicker,
but they don't last very long.

137
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:12,137
Hers are mechanical. I made them.

138
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:17,068
She will be my masterpiece!

139
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:22,643
When will you finish?

140
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:27,015
Within the week.
If I start her too early...

141
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:31,990
<i>...</i>she'll build up too much energy,
catch fire and explode.

142
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,830
My Tima...

143
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,871
I'm not giving you to anyone!

144
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,944
I'll put on the finishing touches...

145
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:29,111
...and together we will flee!

146
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,462
Rock? What are you doing here?

147
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:53,328
Protecting my father is
my most important task.

148
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:54,396
'Father'?

149
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:58,577
But Duke Red has no children.

150
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,479
And the child who died was a girl.

151
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,846
Quiet! I know what you're up to.

152
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:09,916
No mad scientist is going to
deceive my father.

153
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:16,326
And no mannequin like this
will steal his heart.

154
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:19,357
Stop!

155
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:24,164
It is at Duke Red's request
I've made Tima.

156
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,602
Tima is the super-being
who is to sit...

157
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:31,608
...on the Throne of Power
atop the Ziggurat.

158
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,138
You lie!

159
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:37,614
He would never give
the Ziggurat to a robot!

160
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:41,818
Perhaps you should ask
Duke Red about that.

161
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:43,179
Will you destroy...

162
00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:48,117
...the super-being for whom
the one you call 'Father' waits?

163
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,968
No robot will steal my father!

164
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,370
No! Don't!

165
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:18,151
<i>O ye Gods, give me courage...</i>

166
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,062
<i>...and strength to guard</i>
<i>my father from machines!</i>

167
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:25,688
Fire!

168
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:26,881
Fire!

169
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:00,592
A Malduk set that fire!

170
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:02,955
I saw him!

171
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,596
The ones up there want to kill us!

172
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:11,764
Atlas is right!

173
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:15,131
They think we're nothing but garbage!

174
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:18,710
To arms! Now we have to fight!

175
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,647
Please remain calm. Fire-fighting
operations are commencing.

176
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,551
Everyone please step back.

177
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,623
Robots out!

178
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:38,460
First you take our jobs,
and now you're trying to kill us!

179
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:41,123
This is no time to be fighting!

180
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:47,629
What the...?!

181
00:23:34,554 --> 00:23:38,354
But why did he set fire
to that old factory?

182
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,552
Well, that strange old man
was around...

183
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:45,758
An old man? This one?

184
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:47,797
Yes.

185
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,425
Thanks a lot!

186
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:01,641
There's someone in there!

187
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,341
Uh-oh...

188
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:07,682
Ken-ichi, go round the back.

189
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:08,811
Hurry!

190
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:09,345
Come on, Laughton!

191
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:10,972
N-n-notebook...

192
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,981
That notebook?

193
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,679
Laughton!

194
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,499
Laughton's lab burned down?!

195
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,266
I guess he was doing an experiment.
The fire just ripped right through it.

196
00:26:06,372 --> 00:26:08,169
What happened to him?

197
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:10,172
His body was found.

198
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,009
Whatever he was doing...

199
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,073
...considering there are
warrants for his arrest...

200
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:22,087
...it must have been
something dangerous.

201
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:27,916
What's wrong, Father?
What did Dr Laughton mean to you?

202
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:29,187
Get out!

203
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,690
Leave me alone.

204
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:17,834
Where am I?

205
00:28:29,782 --> 00:28:32,774
That was sure some fire!

206
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:36,220
Well, it was just an old factory.

207
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:39,348
Saves the trouble of tearing it down.

208
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,126
<i>This is strange.</i>

209
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:48,500
<i>She was the most advanced</i>
<i>robot there is.</i>

210
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,959
<i>There should be something left...</i>

211
00:28:54,574 --> 00:28:56,064
Pero, who's that?

212
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:57,802
Rock of the Malduks.

213
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:02,310
He's young, but he's one of
their main men.

214
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:05,479
They say he does
Duke Red's dirty work.

215
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:06,846
Duke Red?

216
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,648
Is he connected with the Malduks?

217
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:13,348
He's the party founder.

218
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:19,363
Now there's no official connection,
but he funds their activities.

219
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:25,501
It's a public secret.

220
00:29:25,672 --> 00:29:27,196
Everyone knows.

221
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:35,011
Where does this sewer come out?

222
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:39,176
It merges up ahead with
the sewage from Zone 2...

223
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:42,277
...and goes to the processing plant
in Zone 3.

224
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:47,858
If she's down there she'll have been
chopped up with the other garbage.

225
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,392
Anyone else, yes.

226
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:53,195
The criminal always returns
to the scene.

227
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:57,025
An old saying, but a good one.

228
00:29:57,136 --> 00:30:00,264
We should continue searching
for Ken-ichi.

229
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,159
Who are you?

230
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:24,663
'Who are you.'

231
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:29,732
No, no, no... you call yourself'I'.

232
00:30:31,337 --> 00:30:33,066
'I' am who?

233
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:36,305
'I am'...

234
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:38,410
You are I.

235
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:40,742
No... listen...

236
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:44,849
'You' are 'I'. 'I' am 'you'...

237
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,441
Huh?

238
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:48,914
I am who.

239
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:52,754
Yeah, that's right.
And I'm Ken-ichi.

240
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:54,915
'Ken-ichi'.

241
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:56,921
'Ken-ichi'...

242
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:58,227
Yeah.

243
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:03,199
Anyway, it'll all come to you
after a while.

244
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:09,002
Your name, your family,
your father, your mother...

245
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:11,439
'Family'... 'father'...

246
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,520
Uh, thanks, I guess.

247
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:31,123
I know this is food,
but it's all rotten.

248
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:32,990
'Food'...

249
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:38,866
Yeah. You put it in your mouth
like this... and eat it.

250
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:43,804
No, don't eat that!
It'll make you sick!

251
00:31:44,143 --> 00:31:46,805
'No, don't eat... make you sick'...

252
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,985
<i>Attention Control: cloud cover 1. 1.</i>

<i>Radiation equipment in position.</i>

266
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:09,627
We'll radiate for three minutes.

267
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:17,059
Citizens won't be affected,
but above-ground robots will.

268
00:33:17,737 --> 00:33:20,570
I'm having everything recorded.

269
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,901
The data will be valuable.

270
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:26,811
Begin at Level 3.

271
00:33:27,146 --> 00:33:28,306
Yes, Doctor.

272
00:33:38,591 --> 00:33:40,286
Commencing radiation!

273

<i>Control disengaged.</i>

284
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,560
Success!

285
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,364
This will set the whole world
on its ear!

286
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:07,299
You now hold the power
of the gods themselves.

287
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:16,312
If only Dr Laughton had finished
building our guardian deity...

288
00:36:22,488 --> 00:36:25,480
He's caused anomalies in sunspots...

289
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:29,253
...and bathed Earth
in harmful magnetic radiation.

290
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:33,525
It's an outrage that he would
endanger national security...

291
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,691
...by developing such a thing!

292
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,902
The Malduk robot hunters...

293
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:42,132
...are using this as an excuse...

294
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:46,701
...to cry 'human rights' and press
for changes in the Robot Law.

295
00:36:47,046 --> 00:36:50,015
The pro-robot citizens' groups...

296
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:54,018
...say that's reactionary nonsense.
They're organizing protests.

297
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,680
There's fighting breaking out.

298
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,082
This is our chance, Mr President!

299
00:37:01,193 --> 00:37:05,357
We could make a case
for treason here.

300
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:12,369
Will the military support us?

301
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:17,807
Some units are under Duke Red's
influence, but I can handle that.

302
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:26,074
We'll stir up the public
with a few leaks.

303
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:31,920
Once sentiment is against Duke Red,
we'll arrest him for treason.

304
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,151
Should military action be needed,
you have...

305
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,725
...my approval.

306
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,573
I suspect he was the guy
who did in Laughton.

307
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,805
What I don't understand is
how they were connected.

308
00:37:55,915 --> 00:38:00,352
Just what was Laughton
working on, anyway?

309
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,917
What will you do?

310
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:09,489
Laughton's already dead.
I want at least to know why.

311
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:12,188
My client deserves that.

312
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,377
Where's he going now?

313
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,146
Zone 2, I think.

314
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:40,188
There's another level below this?
How far down does this place go?

315
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:45,527
Zone 2 is the Metropolis
power-plant area.

316
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:50,199
Zone 3 below that
is the sewage-handling facility.

317
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:52,366
The sewage facility...

318
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:57,805
You know, he was looking at
a drain behind that factory...

319
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,740
I'll report back and get
permission to go below.

320
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:08,876
I'll file a missing-persons
report on Ken-ichi, too.

321
00:39:10,022 --> 00:39:12,923
Hey! You're kind of old
for a petty thief!

322
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:13,822
Sorry!

323
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:20,023
If anyone was wandering around
down there...

324
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:22,760
...they'd notice him right away.

325
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,229
How often are you down here?

326
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:30,740
Twice a week,
for maintenance on the robots.

327
00:39:40,953 --> 00:39:46,858
These are Albert II types.
It's their last check this week.

328
00:40:07,146 --> 00:40:08,773
Is anyone here?

329
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:21,222
You never get used to the stink
down here, though.

330
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:25,858
No human could last a day
at this work.

331
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:40,471
What is it?

332
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:41,376
Someone's there.

333
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,038
Impossible!

334
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:46,640
Hey! What are you doing there?!

335
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:49,985
This is a restricted area!

336
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:51,647
So she survived...

337
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:54,150
Help!

338
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,720
What are you doing?!

339
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,991
It's all right. They're criminals.

340
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:03,163
How do we get out of here?

341
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:10,671
Stop that, please!
You'll hit the equipment!

342
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,008
Are you OK?

343
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,437
That guy's trying to kill us!

344
00:42:18,944 --> 00:42:21,469
Move! Move! Out of the way!

345
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,079
You piece of junk!

346
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:27,282
Move!

347
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,783
Is it safe?

348
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:28,378
It looks OK.

349
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,152
What's wrong?

350
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,562
Oh, I get it...

351
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:53,828
Fifi can't go through that gate.

352
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:58,200
Thanks for everything, Fifi.
We'll see you again.

353
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,336
Ow!

354
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,077
Move!

355
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:05,683
It's him!

356
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,436
Fifi!

357
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,942
No weapons through here.
May I see your I D?

358
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:44,449
I'm Rock of the Malduks!

359
00:44:48,093 --> 00:44:51,324
<i>Demonstrations are forbidden</i>
<i>during Celebration Week.</i>

360
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,957
<i>Please disperse immediately.</i>

361
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,426
Ken-ichi?

362
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,502
Ken-ichi?

363
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,404
Hey!

364
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:06,842
Pay up!

365
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:26,314
They're not here!

366
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:28,715
They have to be! Keep looking!

367
00:48:02,687 --> 00:48:04,621
Look over that way!

368
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,577
What's the matter, Atlas?
We're waiting for your signal!

369
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:42,388
Not today. There are Malduks
all over the place.

370
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:44,018
Was there a leak?

371
00:48:44,362 --> 00:48:46,489
They're the reason.

372
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,059
Rock's after them.

373
00:48:50,702 --> 00:48:51,862
Come on!

374
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:56,130
He was at that factory...

375
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,548
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

376
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,927
I'm Ken-ichi. I'm from Japan.
My uncle's a private...

377
00:49:17,062 --> 00:49:18,324
A private what?

378
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:23,491
Uh... a journalist!
I'm his assistant.

379
00:49:25,237 --> 00:49:27,000
Why is Rock after you?

380
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,231
I don't know.

381
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,839
He just started shooting at us.

382
00:49:31,943 --> 00:49:33,501
I don't trust them.

383
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:35,103
Let's kill them.

384
00:49:35,747 --> 00:49:37,180
Cool it!

385
00:49:37,716 --> 00:49:39,707
We're not a gang.

386
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:42,550
He says he's a journalist.

387
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:50,184
If he can tell the world about
Metropolis, that helps us!

388
00:49:50,762 --> 00:49:56,598
We can't waste time on nice uniforms
and our pictures in the paper.

389
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,634
The uniform I die in...

390
00:50:02,307 --> 00:50:05,367
...will be the uniform
of the revolution!

391
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,012
Look at that!

392
00:50:47,452 --> 00:50:49,317
She looks like an angel!

393
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,015
Yeah! An angel!

394
00:50:59,864 --> 00:51:04,164
Around here there's two
or three families to a room.

395
00:51:05,337 --> 00:51:08,329
There's no schools,
hardly any jobs for people...

396
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:14,268
They survive on food handouts,
but with the Ziggurat celebrations...

397
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:16,176
...that's all been stopped.

398
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:20,211
What does 'ziggurat' mean?

399
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,380
It's an ancient Babylonian tower.

400
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:30,853
'The Tower of Babel' was one.
You know what happened to that.

401
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:35,190
The king's pride brought down
the wrath of God on him.

402
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:41,033
History repeats itself. The same thing
will happen to Duke Red.

403
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,806
But it won't be God this time.
It'll be us.

404
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,667
Is that wrong?

405
00:52:18,443 --> 00:52:20,104
No, it's fine.

406
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,440
I was just thinking your hair's grown.

407
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,845
What kind of hair do you like?

408
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:30,111
Huh?

409
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,349
Yours is fine right now.

410
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:37,485
Let's get back to your writing.

411
00:52:37,595 --> 00:52:38,823
Next comes...

412
00:52:38,897 --> 00:52:39,556
'Tima'.

413
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:40,859
Huh? What?

414
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,895
'Tima'. My name.

415
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,364
So you remember!

416
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:55,509
That's great! Now you'll start
remembering more and more.

417
00:52:56,881 --> 00:53:00,044
Thank you, Ken-ichi.

418
00:53:07,959 --> 00:53:12,487
Oh, I forgot... I borrowed this
from Atlas.

419
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,662
Ken-ichi...

420
00:53:27,312 --> 00:53:31,248
So the Army's with us?
That helps a lot.

421
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,416
The underground residents
support us...

422
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:39,180
...but they're not sure if we've got
the strength to win or not.

423
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:44,091
The Malduks are to move
when the Ziggurat celebrations end.

424
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:49,756
We want you to crush them
and storm the Ziggurat.

425
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:56,673
The President will announce the arrest
of Duke Red for treason.

426
00:53:57,142 --> 00:53:59,610
He will invoke his powers...

427
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:03,111
...to take control of
the police and military.

428
00:54:04,649 --> 00:54:09,712
Then Metropolis will be governed
by the rule of law.

429
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:15,724
And we will participate
as a proper political party.

430
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:27,162
Of course, Atlas. The President
will welcome you with open arms.

431
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,101
The things I get myself into!

432
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:34,610
I finally find that kid,
and look what happens!

433
00:54:34,712 --> 00:54:39,081
I'm sorry I could not have been
of more assistance.

434
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:41,243
What are you talking about?

435
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:46,514
You've been lots of help!
I don't know east from west here.

436
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:51,254
Don't worry about Ken-ichi.
He's tougher than he...

437
00:54:54,766 --> 00:54:56,666
Cut that out!

438
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,038
Just look at this, will you?

439
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:52,647
'Watch out. Hide, robots.
Coup d'état.'

440
00:55:52,757 --> 00:55:55,089
What?! A coup d'état?!

441
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,745
Oh, man!

442
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,944
Take a good look, Ken-ichi.

443
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:54,182
Tell the whole world
how angry we are.

444
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:15,463
I'm all out of breath!

445
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:26,714
We'd better get out of here, Pero.
We can't do anything.

446
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:29,553
Ask headquarters for back-up.

447
00:57:29,787 --> 00:57:32,585
I'm not leaving you here!

448
00:57:33,591 --> 00:57:38,119
It's robots they're going to
attack first!

449
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:41,598
I will be fine.

450
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,496
What?!

451
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:47,896
It is also my duty to ensure
the safety of all visitors...

452
00:57:47,972 --> 00:57:49,599
...to our city.

453
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,504
All right.

454
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:55,803
Just don't stir anything up
till I get back!

455
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:15,196
Are you going to hold this gate
all by yourself?

456
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:19,492
Demonstrations are forbidden
during Celebration Week.

457
00:58:19,604 --> 00:58:20,901
Please disperse immediately.

458
00:58:21,005 --> 00:58:24,304
Sorry, we can't do that.
Our time has come.

459
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:29,845
Why must humanity settle matters
by resorting to violence?

460
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:36,911
Yes, we all know that.
I agree it is a problem.

461
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:40,855
It's our emotions. They vibrate,
and all we can do...

462
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:43,620
...is move forward
within that amplitude.

463
00:58:43,795 --> 00:58:47,697
But without affirming them,
we can't survive.

464
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:14,822
It's time for the uprising to begin.

465
00:59:15,193 --> 00:59:18,162
When should we release a statement?

466
00:59:19,163 --> 00:59:22,189
Things should be clear
by about 1 p.m<i>....</i>

467
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:25,167
...so I suggest 3 or 3:30.

468
00:59:31,509 --> 00:59:33,272
What is it, Minister?

469
00:59:35,513 --> 00:59:37,276
Hard to relax, eh?

470
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:42,181
Yes, Mr President.
I have an unpleasant duty to perform.

471
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:49,218
What the...?!

472
00:59:49,527 --> 00:59:52,928
You've gone over to Duke Red!

473
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,131
I am merely history's agent.

474
01:00:03,274 --> 01:00:06,869
Wait! We can discuss this!

475
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,259
Why?

476
01:01:05,002 --> 01:01:08,597
Why do humans just go
and destroy robots?

477
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,271
'Revolution'!

478
01:01:23,955 --> 01:01:26,116
<i>The coup d'état has failed.</i>

479
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:31,023
<i>Martial law is in effect,</i>
<i>under the command of Duke Red.</i>

480
01:01:31,495 --> 01:01:35,864
<i>Abandon your weapons and surrender.</i>

481
01:01:36,534 --> 01:01:37,558
<i>I repeat...</i>

482
01:01:37,802 --> 01:01:39,895
<i>...the coup d'état has failed.</i>

483
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:44,668
<i>Martial law is in effect,</i>
<i>under the command of Duke Red.</i>

484
01:01:45,042 --> 01:01:49,206
<i>Abandon your weapons and surrender.</i>

485
01:01:52,984 --> 01:01:55,179
Ken-ichi!

486
01:01:55,653 --> 01:01:59,054
Hey! Ken-ichi!

487
01:02:04,395 --> 01:02:05,828
Uncle!

488
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,597
You're safe! That's great!

489
01:02:13,704 --> 01:02:15,899
Are you all right?

490
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:18,168
This? It's nothing!

491
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,578
Who's this?

492
01:02:25,383 --> 01:02:26,714
Her name's Tima.

493
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:30,577
We escaped from that fire together.

494
01:02:31,355 --> 01:02:34,415
Tima, this is my uncle.

495
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,920
'Uncle'...

496
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,868
Atlas!

497
01:02:53,077 --> 01:02:57,571
It... was... a...trap!

498
01:03:06,223 --> 01:03:07,884
We meet at last.

499
01:03:09,593 --> 01:03:10,491
Don't move!

500
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,769
No trouble.

501
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:25,472
Give me the girl,
and you might get back home alive.

502
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:29,438
Don't make promises
you won't keep, Rock!

503
01:03:42,093 --> 01:03:44,459
Don't play games with me!

504
01:03:44,762 --> 01:03:46,821
Tima! Pick up the gun!

505
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:13,784
I'll have that back, please.

506
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,821
Don't give it to him!

507
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,308
You going to shoot?

508
01:04:34,812 --> 01:04:36,507
I'm human, you know.

509
01:04:40,684 --> 01:04:41,742
Rock!

510
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,963
So it's these people
you've neglected your duties...

511
01:05:02,973 --> 01:05:05,032
...to go chasing after...

512
01:05:19,056 --> 01:05:20,819
Tima!

513
01:05:21,992 --> 01:05:23,016
It's you!

514
01:05:24,862 --> 01:05:25,692
Rock!

515
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,291
What's going on here?!

516
01:05:30,067 --> 01:05:35,801
You told me no one survived
the fire in Dr Laughton's lab!

517
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:40,367
And how did you know about Tima?
Answer me!

518
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,680
I will.

519
01:05:50,254 --> 01:05:54,657
You are the one who must sit
on the Throne of Power.

520
01:05:55,593 --> 01:05:57,493
No robot must ever rule...

521
01:05:58,028 --> 01:06:00,326
...the Ziggurat, and Metropolis!

522
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,522
Fool!

523
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,262
'Robot'?

524
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:10,905
Do you think you fool me?
You're out of line, boy!

525
01:06:11,442 --> 01:06:12,636
Get up!

526
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:28,753
I never want to see you again!

527
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:30,925
Ken-ichi!

528
01:06:33,731 --> 01:06:36,791
So it was you who hired Laughton!

529
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:38,766
What if I did?

530
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:42,703
I've come from Japan
to arrest Laughton.

531
01:06:42,806 --> 01:06:46,242
My name is Shunsaku Ban...

532
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,217
Get in.

533
01:07:01,258 --> 01:07:02,384
And Ken-ichi?

534
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:04,385
You'll see him later.

535
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:42,255
I'm here to see
Superintendent Notarlin.

536
01:07:42,366 --> 01:07:46,598
He's been transferred.
His successor hasn't been named.

537
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:53,610
There's been a mistake. The Malduks
have taken my nephew away...

538
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:56,737
Handle it through your embassy!

539
01:08:19,937 --> 01:08:25,671
<i>At this moment our state</i>
<i>extends its reach to the stars!</i>

540
01:08:26,176 --> 01:08:29,236
<i>I tremble at the honor</i>
<i>of announcing...</i>

541
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:35,283
<i>...the culmination of humanity's</i>
<i>long history of intellect and science.</i>

542
01:08:45,696 --> 01:08:46,685
Saké.

543
01:08:48,432 --> 01:08:49,626
Make it hot.

544
01:08:50,768 --> 01:08:55,034
Hot whisky or gin I can do,
for a Japanese detective.

545
01:08:55,139 --> 01:08:57,937
Hot whisky, then.

546
01:08:59,777 --> 01:09:03,679
Who gives a damn about the Ziggurat?!

547
01:09:03,781 --> 01:09:08,115
And those Malduks can eat dogshit!

548
01:09:08,218 --> 01:09:09,048
Here.

549
01:09:14,124 --> 01:09:16,752
Hey! That was Rock!

550
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:21,364
I heard he quit the party.
What's he doing here?

551
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,097
Thanks.

552
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,326
Take care.

553
01:09:33,844 --> 01:09:34,970
Whoops!

554
01:10:03,507 --> 01:10:04,838
Um...

555
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:11,844
...a man earlier tonight
asked me to give you this.

556
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:13,548
I said 'no'.

557
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:18,781
He wanted it kept secret
from Duke Red, and of course...

558
01:10:18,856 --> 01:10:23,657
...I said I couldn't possibly, but...
his name was 'Ken-ichi'.

559
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:32,592
'I can't move at the moment,
so I can't...

560
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:34,699
'...come to you.

561
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:39,105
'I'm leaving the country soon.

562
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:42,810
'I want to see you again.'

563
01:10:57,961 --> 01:10:59,053
Ken-ichi!

564
01:11:14,745 --> 01:11:17,077
What's going on here?

565
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:21,314
You will bring her back soon,
won't you?

566
01:11:21,518 --> 01:11:25,545
I'll be in real trouble
if they ever find out.

567
01:11:25,889 --> 01:11:28,858
Don't worry. This won't take long.

568
01:11:31,528 --> 01:11:33,257
This wasn't my idea.

569
01:11:33,864 --> 01:11:35,559
I have to get back.

570
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:39,430
You tricked me.

571
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:45,335
How else could I talk to you?

572
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:50,241
Where's Ken-ichi?
If you know, take me to him.

573
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,943
Well, well, well...

574
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:02,056
To talk to you, you'd never guess
you were a robot.

575
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:14,529
I guess Father chose
his mad scientist very well.

576
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:17,199
What are you talking about?

577
01:12:17,808 --> 01:12:19,571
You being a robot.

578
01:12:20,043 --> 01:12:23,240
That's not true. I'm not a robot.

579
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,873
So what are you? Human?

580
01:12:30,787 --> 01:12:33,881
So who's your father? Where is he?

581
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:35,549
My father...

582
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:38,389
...is Ken-ichi.

583
01:12:57,014 --> 01:13:00,472
The super-being?
A mannequin like you?!

584
01:13:08,859 --> 01:13:12,090
If you can't take me to Ken-ichi,
I'm going.

585
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:26,638
Tima's gone?!

586
01:13:36,853 --> 01:13:39,185
Watch where you're going!

587
01:14:29,406 --> 01:14:34,935
Let's see inside this super-being
Father wants so much.

588
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,036
<i>Come on, Laughton!</i>

589
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,707
<i>N-n-notebook...</i>

590
01:15:15,218 --> 01:15:16,981
<i>That notebook?</i>

591
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,129
Don't be alarmed.

592
01:16:40,704 --> 01:16:44,162
I taught Rock a lesson
he won't forget.

593
01:16:44,674 --> 01:16:46,073
Where's Ken-ichi?

594
01:16:46,243 --> 01:16:48,803
I'm looking for him, too.

595
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,641
I need your help for that.

596
01:16:52,215 --> 01:16:53,079
You do?

597
01:16:53,183 --> 01:16:57,813
I think they've got him somewhere
in the Ziggurat.

598
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,650
I need to look for him...

599
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:04,517
...on the Ziggurat's data network.

600
01:17:04,728 --> 01:17:06,491
Can you do that?

601
01:17:27,551 --> 01:17:30,076
Hold out your hand.

602
01:18:26,276 --> 01:18:27,436
Ken-ichi!

603
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:40,315
Well?

604
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,080
Ken-ichi's in...

605
01:18:43,193 --> 01:18:44,524
...that building!

606
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:48,086
You did it! I knew he was there!

607
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,526
What happened to me?

608
01:18:53,436 --> 01:18:57,702
I see... you don't know
who you are, do you.

609
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,674
What do you mean?

610
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:09,847
I'll report the instant
we find anything, sir.

611
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:11,445
Duke Red?

612
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:12,451
Yeah.

613
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,189
Anything?

614
01:19:15,392 --> 01:19:17,121
We can track the signal...

615
01:19:17,827 --> 01:19:21,126
...by where it burned out the splitters.

616
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:26,567
Got it!

617
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:27,534
Where?

618
01:19:28,171 --> 01:19:31,629
Zone 1, South Block 17.
The Hotel Coconut.

619
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:40,549
Tell me, please! Am I human,
or am I...

620
01:19:41,351 --> 01:19:43,649
Well, you're different...

621
01:19:44,487 --> 01:19:47,149
...from normal robots.

622
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,314
I'm human.

623
01:19:51,027 --> 01:19:52,585
Just like Ken-ichi!

624
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:56,157
Uh, yes... of course you are!

625
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:00,831
Anyway, now we've got to
rescue Ken-ichi.

626
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:34,693
Tima! I've been looking for you!

627
01:20:48,752 --> 01:20:53,746
Tell me what's going on,
or I'll charge you with kidnapping!

628
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,757
I'm not your man.

629
01:20:57,293 --> 01:20:59,784
It's your son you want to talk to.

630
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:01,758
Huh? Rock?

631
01:21:02,332 --> 01:21:04,732
I don't know what the plan is...

632
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:10,773
...but I suspect Dr Laughton
was involved in it somehow.

633
01:21:10,974 --> 01:21:14,774
And I suspect
you had him killed...

634
01:21:15,445 --> 01:21:17,276
...to keep her a secret.

635
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:25,245
Take him away.

636
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:29,580
Come on!

637
01:21:59,255 --> 01:22:03,248
That is a special throne made
especially for you.

638
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,386
One day from here
you will rule the entire world!

639
01:22:07,664 --> 01:22:08,824
Me?

640
01:22:09,766 --> 01:22:10,698
Why?

641
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:13,767
That is your destiny.

642
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:15,862
I'll show you.

643
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:28,916
Ken-ichi!

644
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:30,176
Ken-ichi!

645
01:22:31,454 --> 01:22:32,682
Ken-ichi!

646
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,023
Wake up, Ken-ichi!

647
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:42,426
It's me! Can you hear me?

648
01:22:43,066 --> 01:22:46,593
Ken-ichi... Ken-ichi?

649
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:50,368
What have you done to him?!

650
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:56,536
He's in no danger. We just had to
quiet him down a little.

651
01:22:57,881 --> 01:23:00,475
Ken-ichi? Ken-ichi?

652
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:06,679
I'll file a protest with my embassy!
It'll be an international incident!

653
01:23:06,789 --> 01:23:12,625
Oh? I didn't realize you were
so politically important.

654
01:23:12,795 --> 01:23:14,490
My apologies.

655
01:23:15,565 --> 01:23:21,435
But soon every nation in the world
will bow down before Tima.

656
01:23:23,072 --> 01:23:25,404
Make Ken-ichi the way he was.

657
01:23:26,943 --> 01:23:30,743
What's one or two young kids, Tima?

658
01:23:31,347 --> 01:23:35,078
You have the power to rule the world!

659
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:38,952
What power is that?

660
01:23:39,322 --> 01:23:41,085
Am I human?

661
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:46,425
Or am I one of those poor robots?

662
01:23:46,596 --> 01:23:49,690
Oh, don't be silly!

663
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:53,098
You're nothing like those piles of junk!

664
01:23:53,436 --> 01:23:57,099
Then am I human, like Ken-ichi?

665
01:23:58,775 --> 01:24:02,768
What are you saying?!
You're no mere human being...

666
01:24:03,146 --> 01:24:08,448
...ruled by emotion and feeling,
torn between morality and love!

667
01:24:12,021 --> 01:24:14,046
You are the super-being!

668
01:24:15,158 --> 01:24:17,649
So then I am a...

669
01:24:18,127 --> 01:24:21,585
I've brought you new clothes,
Miss Tima.

670
01:24:22,365 --> 01:24:24,993
Yes, you are a robot...

671
01:24:25,234 --> 01:24:29,466
...but you stand at the pinnacle
of all existence!

672
01:24:35,912 --> 01:24:40,474
No. I have the emotions and love
that you hate.

673
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:46,146
That's because your full capacities
haven't yet taken form.

674
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,424
As your abilities evolve...

675
01:24:48,758 --> 01:24:52,421
...they're simply taking
the form of emotion and love.

676
01:24:52,528 --> 01:24:53,517
In time...

677
01:24:53,730 --> 01:25:00,363
You will become one with that throne,
a computer weapon meant on conquest!

678
01:25:01,337 --> 01:25:05,933
Your memories and emotions
will all be erased!

679
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:09,576
How did you know that?!

680
01:25:10,246 --> 01:25:12,476
I fancy myself a detective.

681
01:25:18,788 --> 01:25:22,656
Come, Miss Tima.
You should change.

682
01:25:25,061 --> 01:25:27,996
Father... open your eyes!

683
01:25:33,236 --> 01:25:34,328
Rock!

684
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:36,832
What on earth?!

685
01:25:38,775 --> 01:25:40,333
What are you doing?!

686
01:25:44,781 --> 01:25:48,342
It is you who must sit
on that throne.

687
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:53,352
You are the leader we must bow to!

688
01:25:57,627 --> 01:25:58,525
No!

689
01:26:26,923 --> 01:26:27,947
Tima!

690
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:41,802
You're awake?

691
01:27:07,697 --> 01:27:13,693
I am a humanoid... a machine
made to destroy the world...

692
01:27:15,705 --> 01:27:18,765
Not 'destroy'! 'Make again'!

693
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:19,933
Stop!

694
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:25,571
Ken-ichi...

695
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,171
Hey!

696
01:28:26,275 --> 01:28:27,572
Who threw that switch?!

697
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:29,338
It just started up!

698
01:28:29,445 --> 01:28:31,208
Cut the power!

699
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:32,541
It won't respond!

700
01:28:32,648 --> 01:28:34,707
It's going into the red!

701
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,129
Dr Ponkotz!

702
01:28:54,136 --> 01:28:56,036
What's that alarm?!

703
01:28:56,138 --> 01:28:59,369
The omotanium generator's going wild!

704
01:28:59,976 --> 01:29:00,908
What's going on!?

705
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:02,136
I'm not sure...

706
01:29:45,688 --> 01:29:48,555
Stop, Tima!
You'll destroy the Ziggurat!

707
01:29:52,028 --> 01:29:54,462
This comes of trifling with robots.

708
01:29:59,235 --> 01:30:04,537
Her memory's merging with
the data network! She'll go mad!

709
01:30:05,374 --> 01:30:08,605
Thus God destroyed
the Tower of Babel...

710
01:30:09,478 --> 01:30:11,036
Tima!

711
01:30:12,114 --> 01:30:15,550
No! She's no longer
the Tima you knew!

712
01:30:27,096 --> 01:30:28,495
All right.

713
01:30:28,831 --> 01:30:34,394
The omotanium generator will explode
if we don't shut it down!

714
01:30:40,576 --> 01:30:42,635
The chance of human survival...

715
01:30:42,745 --> 01:30:46,146
...will fall to 30 per cent
within one hour.

716
01:30:46,716 --> 01:30:49,913
My entire world-wide network
of forces...

717
01:30:50,019 --> 01:30:53,477
...will be completely activated
within 30 minutes.

718
01:30:55,424 --> 01:30:58,393
Their targets are
the world's major cities...

719
01:30:58,494 --> 01:31:01,190
...and 7,586 other facilities.

720
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:06,601
Estimated time period...

721
01:31:06,736 --> 01:31:11,105
...for eradication of humanity
by biological warfare:

722
01:31:11,207 --> 01:31:13,437
17 hours, 27 minutes.

723
01:31:15,644 --> 01:31:17,271
Hear that, Duke Red?

724
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:24,442
Your super-being says
she doesn't need us!

725
01:31:24,787 --> 01:31:25,947
Tima!

726
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:28,547
Come back!

727
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,554
Ken-ichi!

728
01:31:46,342 --> 01:31:47,502
Ken-ichi!

729
01:31:49,645 --> 01:31:51,476
Ken-ichi!

730
01:31:52,848 --> 01:31:55,146
Ken-ichi!

731
01:32:11,834 --> 01:32:12,823
Tima!

732
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:35,748
Tima!

733
01:33:43,092 --> 01:33:44,116
Tima!

734
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:06,908
<i>Doctor! We've lost control of</i>
<i>the underground power pl...</i>

735
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,845
What's happening?!

736
01:34:30,806 --> 01:34:34,902
Get out! You robots
are not supposed to be here!

737
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:42,248
Tima! It's me!

738
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:53,884
Ken-ichi!

739
01:34:54,964 --> 01:34:56,261
It's Ken-ichi!

740
01:35:33,736 --> 01:35:34,634
Stop!

741
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:39,665
The likes of you...

742
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:43,672
...will never kill...

743
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:46,169
...my father!

744
01:35:49,518 --> 01:35:50,849
Rock!

745
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:49,596
Tima!

746
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:04,583
Tima!

747
01:38:45,928 --> 01:38:47,919
Tima! Grab my hand!

748
01:38:49,665 --> 01:38:50,859
<i>I'm Ken-ichi.</i>

749
01:38:51,133 --> 01:38:52,760
<i>Who are you?</i>

750
01:38:52,868 --> 01:38:54,358
<i>'Who are you.'</i>

751
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:59,203
<i>No, no, no... you call yourself 'I'.</i>

752
01:38:59,675 --> 01:39:00,869
Ken-ichi!

753
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:03,877
Grab on!

754
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,107
I am... who?

755
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:17,816
Tima!!!

756
01:41:05,734 --> 01:41:08,328
Where did you find this?

757
01:41:24,186 --> 01:41:25,175
Fifi?

758
01:41:28,256 --> 01:41:29,154
Fifi!

759
01:42:07,996 --> 01:42:10,396
Ken-ichi!

760
01:42:12,467 --> 01:42:14,492
Uncle!

761
01:42:32,421 --> 01:42:33,319
Uncle...

762
01:42:34,923 --> 01:42:38,381
...I think I'd like to
stay here a bit longer.

763
01:43:52,067 --> 01:43:54,126
<i>I am... who?</i>
