1
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,647
The day shift.

2
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:57,471
The workers' city, far below the
 surface of the earth.

3
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:31,231
And high above, a pleasure garden for the sons of the masters of Metropolis.

4
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:43,143
"Freder!"

5
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:31,718
"Look, these are your brothers."

6
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,194
"Who was that?"

7
00:08:52,065 --> 00:09:00,741
"Just the daughter of a worker."

8
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:21,028
The great machines, far underground,
 yet high above the workers' city.

9
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,186
"Moloch!"

10
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:39,459
"Such acidents are unavoidable."

11
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:20,667
"Why was my son allowed to go
 into the machine-rooms?"

12
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:41,188
"Why did you go down there?"

13
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:54,568
"I wanted to see what my brothers
 looked like."

14
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:28,562
"It was their hands that built this
 city of ours, father."

15
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,601
"In their proper place---
the depts."

16
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:33,961
"What will you do if they turn against
 you some day?"

17
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:20,107
"The foreman from the central dynamo 
room is here with an urgent message."

18
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:54,274
"More of those plans, sir."

19
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:49,329
"They were found on two of the men
 who were killed today."

20
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:12,085
"Joseph, why was it not you who
 brought me these plans?"

21
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:48,255
"You are dismissed. Go to the G-Bank 
for the balance of your wages."

22
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:56,623
"Father, don't you realize what it 
means to be dismissed by you?"

23
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:16,069
"Joseph, I need your help."

24
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:34,688
"I have far to go today
-- alone, into the depths
-- to my borthers."

25
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:09,383
"The machine! Someone must stay
 with the machine."

26
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:20,060
"I will stay at the machine."

27
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:50,090
In the middle of the city was an old house.

28
00:29:57,097 --> 00:30:02,569
Here lived, Rotwang, the inventor.

29
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,720
"At last, my work is ready."

30
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:07,935
"I have created a machine in the image
 of man, that never tires or makes a mistake."

31
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:29,022
"Now we have no further use for
living workers."

32
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:17,257
"Isn't it worth the loss of a hand to have 
created the workers of the future -- -- the machine men?"

33
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:38,578
"Give me another 24 hours, and I'll bring
you a machine which no one will be able to tell from a hum

34
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:12,245
"As always, when my experts fail 
I come to you for advice."

35
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:42,976
"For months now, we have been finding these 
plans in the workers' clothing. What do they mean?"

36
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:32,626
"At two -- at the end of this shift.
She has called another meeting."

37
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:05,712
"These are the plans of the ancient catacombs 
-- far below the lowest levels of the workers' city."

38
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:57,164
"What is down there that interests the workers?"

39
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:15,236
"Today I will tell you the story of the Tower of Babel."

40
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:03,203
"Let us build a tower whose summit will touch the skies--"

41
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:18,185
"-- and on it we will inscribe: 'Great is
the world and its Creator. And great is Man.'"

42
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:53,587
"Those who had conceived the idea of this tower 
could not build it themselves, so they hired thousan

43
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:18,999
"Between the brain that plans and the 
hands that build there must be a mediator."

44
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:26,640
"It is the heart that must bring about 
an understanding between them."

45
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,652
"But where is our mediator, Maria?"

46
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:38,879
"Be patient, he will surely come."

47
00:49:57,764 --> 00:50:03,003
"We will wait, but not for long."

48
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:40,507
"Rotwang, make your Robot in the 
likeness of that girl."

49
00:50:52,653 --> 00:51:06,600
"Hide the girl in your house, I will send the 
Robot down to the workers, to sow discord among them a

50
00:51:19,012 --> 00:51:23,884
"Leave me here, John Fredersen."

51
00:54:09,182 --> 00:54:15,689
"Until tomorrow--- in the cathedral."

52
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:34,101
The Seven Deadly Sins.

53
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:30,524
Maria was a prisoner in Rotwang's house.

54
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:21,441
"Come, I am going to make the
Robot look like you."

55
01:06:47,993 --> 01:06:49,194
"Maria!"

56
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:40,852
"Where is Maria?"

57
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:52,898
"She is with your father."

58
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:38,510
"The copy is perfect. Now go down to the workers 
and undo Maria's teaching; stir them up to criminal

59
01:13:00,866 --> 01:13:02,467
"Maria!"

60
01:15:07,392 --> 01:15:17,869
"Now we shall see whether people believe
the Robot is a creature of flesh and blood."

61
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:41,773
"John Fredersen is looking for an excuse
to use violence against the workers."

62
01:19:06,031 --> 01:19:16,708
"Maria, you always pleaded for peace -- but now the 
Robot in your likeness has been commanded to inc

63
01:19:28,687 --> 01:19:33,825
The workers accept the Robot as Maria.

64
01:19:41,466 --> 01:19:46,404
"I have preached patience --"

65
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:13,665
"But your mediator has not come -- 
and will never come."

66
01:20:43,461 --> 01:20:48,633
"Maria is inciting the workers to revolt."

67
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:12,324
"She has told them to destroy everything."

68
01:21:15,994 --> 01:21:19,364
"I cannot believe it."

69
01:21:55,374 --> 01:22:05,710
"You have waited patiently too long.
The time has come to act!"

70
01:22:16,254 --> 01:22:22,761
"Why should you sweat yourself to death
to benefit the Lord of Metropolis?"

71
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:32,170
"Who keeps the machines going?"

72
01:22:51,323 --> 01:22:55,026
"Who are the slaves of the machines?"

73
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:07,839
"Let the machines stop!"

74
01:23:13,912 --> 01:23:17,616
"Destroy the machines!"

75
01:23:33,331 --> 01:23:36,535
"You are not Maria!"

76
01:23:58,456 --> 01:24:05,664
"Maria pleads for peace, not for
violence. This is not Maria!"

77
01:24:10,402 --> 01:24:14,072
"John Fredersen's son!"

78
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:22,447
"Kill him!"

79
01:27:38,977 --> 01:27:44,683
Not one man or woman remained behind.

80
01:28:16,448 --> 01:28:20,485
"To the central power house!"

81
01:29:20,378 --> 01:29:25,016
"The workers are destroying the machines."

82
01:29:28,887 --> 01:29:32,157
"What shall I do?"

83
01:29:34,392 --> 01:29:39,564
"If they destroy the power house,
the workers' city will be flooded."

84
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:44,703
"Open the doors."

85
01:30:06,791 --> 01:30:11,997
"Have you gone mad? You are 
flooding your own homes."

86
01:31:26,605 --> 01:31:31,142
At last Maria managed to escape.

87
01:37:16,388 --> 01:37:20,358
"Yes, you are the real Maria."

88
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:27,832
"To the airshaft -- quickly !
The reservoirs have burst."

89
01:39:59,384 --> 01:40:02,420
"Where is my son?"

90
01:40:03,421 --> 01:40:09,995
"Tomorrow thousands will ask in
anguish -- where is my son?"

91
01:40:43,528 --> 01:40:50,135
"Save the children -- I will tell the 
workers that they are safe."

92
01:42:31,403 --> 01:42:35,307
"Where are your children?"

93
01:42:44,983 --> 01:42:50,922
"The entire workers' city is under water."

94
01:43:02,234 --> 01:43:07,405
"Who told you to destroy the machines,
you fools -- and thus to destroy yourselves?"

95
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:34,199
"The witch! She's to blame for all 
this. Find her! Kill her."

96
01:44:00,425 --> 01:44:05,497
"Let's watch the world going to the devil!"

97
01:48:09,307 --> 01:48:11,343
"Maria!"

98
01:49:09,401 --> 01:49:15,774
"If the mob sees you they will kill 
me for having tricked them."

99
01:50:26,444 --> 01:50:28,947
"The witch, the witch!"

100
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:06,011
"Where are our children?"

101
01:52:22,928 --> 01:52:27,732
"John Fredersen's son has saved your children."

102
01:52:40,946 --> 01:52:43,682
"Save my son!"

103
01:54:18,376 --> 01:54:21,513
"Thank heaven!"

104
01:56:45,423 --> 01:56:53,732
"There can be no understanding between
the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator."

105
01:57:45,684 --> 01:57:47,285
THE END
