00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:22,400
The film "Metropolis" was heavily edited
and abridged shortly after its premier.

4
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,960
About 1/4 of the film was considered lost
forever. Only in 2008, in Buenos Aires, 

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,520
was a nearly-complete copy discovered.
Unfortunately it was in terrible condition

6
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,760
and a cropped 16 mm version.

7
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,360
A substantially complete reconstruction was
made using the Argentinian material

8
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,600
and material from the previous restoration.
Spanish intertitles were identified using

9
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,840
censor cards translated into German. To
accurately portray the correct position

10
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,960
of the cropped images, black borders
have been added to them.

11
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,720
The Intertitles appear in their original
font. Intertitles with a different typeface

12
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,160
(like this one) have been added to
summarize the plot of missing segments.

13
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,600
Black film stock indicates shorter
sections of missing footage.

31
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Deep below

32
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,320
the earth's surface lay

33
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,720
the workers' city.

34
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,280
As
deep as

35
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,680
lay the workers'
city below the earth,

36
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,560
so high above it towered
the complex named the "Club

37
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,500
of the Sons," with its lecture halls
and libraries, its theaters and stadiums.

38
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,000
Fathers, for whom every revolution of a
machine wheel meant gold, had created for

39
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,760
their sons the miracle of the
Eternal Gardens.

40
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,320
"Which of you ladies shall today
have the honor of entertaining

41
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,600
Master Freder, Joh Fredersen's Son?"

42
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,080
"Freder-! Freder-!"

43
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,920
"Look!
These are your brothers!"

44
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,240
"L o o k - - !"

45
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,920
"These are your brothers!"

46
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,640
"Who - was that?"

47
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,080
But this is what happened to
Freder - son of Joh Fredersen,

48
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,640
master of Metropolis - when he
went in search of the girl:

49
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,480
"To the new Tower of Babel -
to my father-!"

50
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,320
"Why is it, Josaphat,
that I learn of the explosion

51
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,000
from my son,
and not from you--!"

52
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,200
"The details--!"

53
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,920
"What were you doing in the
machine halls, Freder?"

54
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,960
"I wanted to look into
the faces of the people

55
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,280
whose little children are
my brothers, my sisters..."

56
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,280
"Your magnificent city, Father-
and you the brain of this city-

57
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
and all of us
in the city's light...--"

58
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,080
"...and where are the people, father,
whose hands built your city---?"

59
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,080
"Where they belong..."

60
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
"...where they belong...?"

61
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,520
"...in the depths...?"

62
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,800
"And if those in the depths
should rise up against you?"

63
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,720
"The chief foreman of the Heart Machine,
Grot - with an important message..."

64
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,680
"Two more of those damned
plans, Mr. Fredersen..."

65
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,640
"... in the pockets of two men involved
in today's accident at the M-Machine..."

66
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:41,400
"Why is it, Josaphat, that these plans were
brought to me by Grot and not by you?"

67
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,680
"Apply to the G-Bank for
your remaining wages..."

68
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,820
"Father, do you know what it means
to be dismissed by you? --

69
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,000
It means: Go below! - Father! -
go below! Into the depths--!"

70
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:43,320
"Do you know what it means to be 
dismissed like that by Joh Fredersen?"

71
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,880
"Do you want to work for me,
Josaphat?"

72
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:54,680
"Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight..."

73
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,920
"Into the depths, -
to be with my brothers..."

74
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,960
"Beginning today I wish to be kept informed
of every step taken by my son..."

75
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,320
"Brother..."

76
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,640
"...the machine!...
Someone h a s  t o stay at the machine!"

77
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,200
"Someone w i l l stay at the machine..."

78
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
"ME"

79
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,000
"Listen to me... I want to
trade lives with you!"

80
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,280
"Wait for me - both of you..."

81
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:05,040
In the middle of Metropolis there was a
strange house, overlooked by the centuries.

82
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,960
The man who lived in it
was Rotwang, the inventor.

83
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,720
"Joh Fredersen......"

84
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,200
HEL; BORN FOR MY HAPPINESS
AND MANKIND'S BLESSING

85
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:46,640
LOST TO JOH FREDERSEN; DIED
GIVING BIRTH TO FREDER, HIS SON

86
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,560
"A brain like yours, Rotwang,
should be able to forget..."

87
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:29,240
"Only once in my life did I forget anything:
that Hel was a woman and you a man..."

88
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,240
"Let the dead rest in peace, Rotwang...
For you, as for me, she is dead......"

89
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,880
"For me, she is not dead, Joh Fredersen,-
for me, s h e  l i v e s --!"

90
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:10,960
"Do you think that losing a hand is too high
a price to pay for re-creating Hel-?!"

91
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,800
"Do you want to see her-?!"

92
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,120
"So, Joh Fredersen-?! Isn't it worth the
loss of a hand to have created

93
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,680
the man of the future, the
M a c h i n e - M a n -?!"

94
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:46,160
"Give me another 24 hours-, and no one, Joh
Fredersen, no one will be able to tell a

95
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,400
Machine-Man from a mortal--!"

96
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,200
"The woman is m i n e, Joh Fredersen!
The son of Hel was yours!"

97
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:46,000
"And what brings you to me, Joh Fredersen?"

98
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:03,400
"As usual, when my experts fail me,
I come to you for advice..."

99
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,600
"For months now, we have been finding
these plans in my workers' clothes.

100
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,040
What do they mean?"

101
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,400
"...at two... at the end of the shift!
S h e has summoned us again..."

102
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:38,480
"Father-! Father-! 
Will ten hours n e v e r end--??!!"

103
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,600
"-it is a plan of the 2000-year-old
catacombs deep below the lowest levels

104
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,360
of your Metropolis..."

105
00:50:52,600 --> 00:51:00,920
"I should like to know what my workers
 are doing in the catacombs..."

106
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:31,760
"Today I will tell you the legend of
THE TOWER OF BABEL..."

107
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:37,240
The legend of
THE TOWER OF BABEL...

108
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,480
"Come, let us build us a tower
whose top may reach unto the stars!"

109
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,240
"And on the top of the tower we will write
these words: Great is the world

110
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,040
and its creator!  And great is Man!"

111
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:30,200
...but the minds that had conceived the
Tower of Babel could not build it.

112
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,360
The task was too great.
So they hired hands for wages.

113
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:59,600
But the h a n d s that built the Tower of
Babel knew nothing of the dream of the

114
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,040
b r a i n that had conceived it.

115
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,920
One man's hymns of praise
became other men's curses.

116
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,360
People spoke the same language,
but could not understand each other...

117
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:11,320
GREAT IS THE WORLD AND ITS CREATOR
AND GREAT IS MAN

118
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,880
"HEAD and HANDS
need a mediator."

119
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:39,520
"THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD
AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!"

120
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,560
"And where is o u r mediator, Maria-?"

121
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,760
"Wait for him!
He will surely come!"

122
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,040
"We will wait, Maria...!
But not much longer--!"

123
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:53,040
"Oh mediator, have you finally come?"

124
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,720
"You called me-- here I am!"

125
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:38,160
"Rotwang, give the Machine-Man
the likeness of that girl."

126
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:55,640
"I shall show discord between them and her!
I shall destroy their belief in this woman--"

127
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:29,400
"Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen...
You will find the way back without me..."

128
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,760
"You fool! Now you will lose the
one remaining thing you have from Hel-

129
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,840
y o u r  s o n!"

130
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,880
"Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!"

131
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,120
Freder sees a monk in the pulpit who
preaches: "Verily, I say unto you,

132
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,640
the days spoken of in the Apocalypse
are nigh!"

133
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:13,840
The monk's hand points to the
Bible, in which is written:

134
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,760
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
colored beast, full of names of blasphemy

135
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:25,520
having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and

136
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:31,240
scarlet color, having a golden cup in her
hand. And upon her forehead was a name,

137
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:37,000
written, mystery, Babylon the Great,
the mother of abominations of the Earth."

138
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,720
"You will destroy Joh Fredersen -
him and his city and his son -!"

139
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,880
Gluttony, Greed, Pride

140
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:55,160
Lust, Envy, Wrath, Sloth

141
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,400
"If you had come earlier, you wouldn't
have scared me... But now I beg you:

142
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,160
Stay away from me and my beloved...!"

143
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,480
"Where is the man whose clothes you wear?"

144
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:29,840
"Will you please wake Georgy? We must 
go at once to the workers' city..."

145
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:56,480
"No. 11811, go back to your machine and 
forget this ever happened - understood?"

146
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:25,160
"I must have someone who is faithful to me,
Josaphat, how else can I fulfill my destiny?!"

147
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:56,840
"I must go, Josaphat,- I must look
on my own for the person to whom

148
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,400
11811 was supposed to lead me."

149
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,040
"Tonight, Josaphat - 
tonight when I come back..."

150
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:46,120
"So, what is your price for leaving this
apartment tonight?"

151
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:37,440
"You do not seem to understand on
whose behalf I am here..."

152
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:50,520
"T h i s  m a n does not wish his
son to be here this evening!"

153
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:48,080
"In three hours I will come for you!"

154
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:50,680
"Come!  It is time to give the
Machine-Man your face!"

155
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,240
"Maria--!!!"

156
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,560
"MARIA!!!"

157
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:39,400
"Where is Maria-?!"

158
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:52,680
"She is with your father..."

159
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:14,440
"I tell you, she is
with your father---!"

160
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:25,720
"She is the most perfect and obedient tool
that ever man possessed. You will see, 

161
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:35,360
tonight, when she dances before the eyes
of the the hundred richest gentlemen..."

162
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:17,800
"I w a n t you to visit those in the
depths, in order to destroy the work of

163
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,040
the woman in whose image you were created!"

164
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:15,640
C.A. Rotwang invites Mr. Joh Fredersen
to be his guest tonight.

165
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:15,640
"Verily I say unto you: the days spoken of
in the Apocalypse are nigh...!"

166
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:31,440
"For her- all seven deadly sins!"

167
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:22,120
"Death descends upon the city---!"

168
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:10,080
The Book of Revelations

169
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:32,840
"I put on this disguise to escape from
the Thin Man... But for ten days your

170
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:37,400
father's spy has been making even
the workers' city risky..."

171
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:54,640
"Only their hope for a mediator
is keeping the workers in check..."

172
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:24,960
"There are still more strange things
happening, Freder..."

173
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:40,040
"On the evening when you fell sick..."

174
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:55,600
"...once the best of friends...
because of that woman..."

175
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:06,280
"...the other man...
the same evening..."

176
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:20,760
"...The Eternal Gardens lie abandoned...
but night after night in Yoshiwara..."

177
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:08,360
"And this woman, at whose feet all sins 
are heaped... is a l s o named Maria..."

178
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:23,240
"The same woman who those in the depths
look up to as a saint---?!"

179
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:43,280
"Many now go to the city of the dead,
to a woman who has proven herself

180
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:46,040
as true as gold..."

181
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,240
"But the mediator must appear..."

182
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:26,640
"Whatever happens tonight: it is my express
order to let the workers do as they will..."

183
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:43,040
"Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the
depths use force and do wrong,

184
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:48,480
so that he can claim the right to use
force against them..."

185
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:11,320
"When you spoke to your poor brothers,
you spoke of peace, Maria... Today a

186
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:16,720
mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen is inciting
them to rebel against him..."

187
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:45,080
"She will destroy their belief
in a mediator!"

188
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:30,000
"You know that I have always spoken of
peace... but your mediator has not come..."

189
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,760
"You have waited long enough!
Your time has come-!"

190
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:59,680
"...but I have tricked Joh Fredersen! Your
double does not obey h i s will-

191
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,760
only m i n e!"

192
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:17,440
"Who is the living food for the
machines in Metropolis-?!"

193
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:28,640
"Who lubricates the machine
joints with their own blood-?!"

194
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:48,480
"Who feeds the machines with
their own flesh--?!"

195
01:44:55,240 --> 01:45:01,880
"Let the machines starve, you fools-!
Let them die-!!"

196
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:10,000
"Kill them- the machines-!!"

197
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:29,320
"You are not Maria-!!!"

198
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:35,280
"YOU ARE NOT MARIA-!"

199
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:54,680
"Maria speaks of peace, not killing-!
This is not Maria-!!"

200
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:03,480
"Joh Fredersen's Son-!!"

201
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:12,640
"Kill him, the dog, in
his white silken fur-!!!"

202
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:49,200
"Get your women, your sons, from the
workers' city! Let no one stay behind!

203
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:52,000
Death to the machines-!!!"

204
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:07,920
In the attic with Maria, Rotwang
grows ever more intoxicated by

205
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,680
his triumph over Fredersen.

206
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:15,000
"...and I tricked Joh Fredersen twice
over-! For I concealed from him that

207
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:19,120
his son wants to be your brothers'
mediator - and loves you-!"

208
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:23,800
Maria is not the only one listening to
Rotwang.  Outside the attic window

209
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,000
Joh Fredersen has been eavesdropping...

210
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:31,760
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He battles with his old rival, 

211
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,880
overcoming him. Maria is free.

212
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:05,280
"...faithful after all..."

213
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,480
"Come on, Freder! We still have
the workers' city."

214
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:07,160
"Women and men, let no one miss
today-! Death to the machines-!!"

215
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,840
"Not one man - or woman
remains behind-!"

216
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:08,760
"Away from the machines-!
L e t them spin out of control-!"

217
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:20,120
"The Heart Machine-!"

218
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,960
DANGER

219
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,880
"Open the gates!"

220
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:07,880
"Open the gates, I said!"

221
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:17,000
"If the Heart Machine is destroyed, the entire
machine district will end up in ruins!!"

222
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:09,640
"Have you gone mad-?? 
If the Heart Machine is destroyed, 

223
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:14,200
the entire workers' city
will be flooded-!!"

224
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,400
"Where are your fathers,
your mothers?"

225
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:06,880
"Do you know that your son
is among the workers?"

226
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:49,640
"Yes-you! You are Maria-!"

227
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:07,080
"To the air shafts - quickly! The reservoirs
have burst! The city is flooding-!"

228
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,960
"We will take the children to the
Club of the Sons!"

229
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:03,240
"Why are all the lights out?"

230
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:31,000
"I must know! Where is my son?!!!"

231
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:38,040
"Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury
and desperation:

232
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:40,760
Joh Fredersen, where is my son-!"

233
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:29,640
"Where are your children??!"

234
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:44,760
"The city lies underwater, the shafts are
completely flooded-!!"

235
02:10:51,560 --> 02:11:00,640
"Who told you to attack the machines, you
idiots? Without them you'll all die!!"

236
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,600
"It's the witch's fault-!"

237
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:24,960
"Let's all watch as the world
goes to the devil!"

238
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:12,680
"Find the witch, this is all her fault-!
Strike her dead-!!"

239
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:32,000
"Now I'm going to take you home, my Hel!"

240
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:51,960
"The witch-! the witch-!
There she is-! there she is-!"

241
02:14:54,400 --> 02:15:01,680
"Where are our children, you witch-??!"

242
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:13,920
"Burn the witch.-
To the stake with her!!!"

243
02:17:08,082 --> 02:17:11,362
"To the stake with her-!"

244
02:19:03,482 --> 02:19:07,600
"Maria--!!!"

245
02:19:31,482 --> 02:19:33,520
"Maria--!!!"

246
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:42,162
"Hel-! My Hel-!!"

247
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:35,600
"Your children... saved--!!!"

248
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:42,880
"Head and hands want to join together,
but they don't have the heart to do it...

249
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:47,082
Oh mediator, show them the 
way to each other..."
