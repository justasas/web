1
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Close your eyes
and begin to relax

2
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Take a deep breath
and let it out slowly

3
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Concentrate on your breathing

4
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
With each breath
you become more relaxed

5
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Imagine a brilliant white light
above you

6
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Focusing on this light
as it flows through your body

7
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Allow yourself to drift off
as you fall

8
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Deeper and deeper

9
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Into a more relaxed state of mind

10
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now as I count back from ten to one

11
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You will feel more peacefull and calm

12
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
10, 9, 8...

13
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You will enter a safe place
were nothing can harm you

14
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If at any time
you need to come back

15
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All you need to do
is open your eyes

16
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Safe in the light that surrounds me

17
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Free of the fear and the pain

18
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
My subconscious mind

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Starts spinning through time

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
To rejoin the past once again

21
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nothing seems real

22
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I´m starting to feel

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Lost in the haze of a dream

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And as I draw near

25
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The scene becomes clear

26
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Like watching my life on a screen

27
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hello Victoria...

28
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
...so glad to see you

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
My friend

30
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Susconscius Strange Sensation

31
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Unconscious relaxation

32
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What a pleasant nightmare

33
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I can`t wait to get there again

34
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Every time I close my eyes

35
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There`s another vivid surprise

36
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Another whole life`s waiting

37
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Chapters unfinished, fading

38
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Closer now

39
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
- Slowly coming into view

40
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I`ve arrived

41
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
- Vlindling sunshing beaming through

42
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There`s a house I`m drawn into

43
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Familiar settings, nothing new

44
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There`s a pathway leading there

45
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
With a haunting chill in the air

46
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There`s room at the top of the stairs

47
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Every night I`m drawn up there

48
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There`s a girl in the mirror

49
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Her face is getting clearer

50
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Young child won`t you tell me...

51
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
...why I`m here?

52
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
In her eyes

53
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
-I sense a story never told

54
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Behind the disguise

55
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
- There`s something tearing at her soul...

56
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Tonight I`ve been searching for it

57
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A feeling that`s deep inside me

58
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Tonight I`ve been searching for

59
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The one that nobody knows

60
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Trying to break free

61
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I just can`t help myself

62
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I`m feeling like I`m going...

63
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
...out of my head

64
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Tears my heart into two

65
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I`m not the one...

66
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
...the sleeper thought he knew

67
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Back on my feet again

68
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Eyes open to real world

69
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Metropolis surrounds me

70
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The mirror`s shattered the girl

71
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Why is this other life

72
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Haunting me everyday

73
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I`d break through the other side

74
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If only I`d find the way

75
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Something`s awfully familiar

76
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The feeling`s so hard to shake

77
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Could I have lived in that other world

78
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It`s a link that I`m destined to make

79
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I`m still searching but I don`t know what for

80
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The missing key to unlock my mind`s door

81
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Today I am searching for it

82
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
A feeling that won`t go away

83
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Today I am searching for

84
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The one that I only know

85
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Trying to break free

86
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I just can`t help myself

87
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I`m feeling like I`m going...

88
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
...out of my head

89
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Tears my soul into two

90
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I`m not the one...

91
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I thought I always knew

92
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I just can`t help myself

93
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I`m feeling like I`m going...

94
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
...out of my head

95
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Uncanny, strange Deja Vu

96
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But I don`t mind

97
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
- I hope to find

98
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The truth

99
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
All your eyes have ever seen

100
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
All you`ve ever heard

101
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Is etched upon my memory

102
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Is spoken through my words

103
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
All that I take with me

104
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Is all you`ve left behind

105
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We`re sharing one eternity

106
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Living in two minds

107
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Linked by an endless thread

108
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Impossible to break

109
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Alone at night

110
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I feel so strange

111
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I need to find

112
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
All the answers to my dreams

113
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When I sleep at night

114
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I hear the cries

115
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What does this mean?

116
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I shut the door
and traveled to another home

117
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I met an older man,
he seemed to be alone

118
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I felt that I could trust him

119
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He talked to me that night

120
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
"Lad did you know
a girl was murdered here?"

121
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
"This fatal tragedy
was talked about for years"

122
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Victoria`s gone forever

123
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Only memories remain

124
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
She passed away

125
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
She was so young

126
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Without love
Without truth

127
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There can be no turning back

128
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Without faith
Without hope

129
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There can be no peace of mind

130
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
As the night went on

131
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I started to find my way

132
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I learned about a tragedy

133
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
A mystery still today

134
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I tried to get more answers

135
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But he said,
"You`re on your own"

136
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Then he turned away and left me

137
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
As I stand there all alone

138
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He said,
"You`ll know the truth...

139
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
...As your future days unfold"

140
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Without love
Without truth

141
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There can be no turning back

142
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Without faith
Without hope

143
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There can be no peace of mind

144
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Now its time to see how you died

145
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Remember the death is not the end...

146
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
...but only a transition

147
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
[Headline:] "Murder,
young girl killed

148
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Desperate shooting
at Echoe`s hill

149
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Dreadful ending,
killer died

150
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Evidently suicide"

151
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
A witness heard a horrifying sound

152
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He ran to find a woman dead and

153
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Lying on the ground

154
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Standing by her was a man

155
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Nervous, shaking,
gun in hand

156
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Witness says he tried to help

157
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But he`d turned the weapon on himself

158
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
His body fell across that poor young girl

159
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
After shouting out in vain

160
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The witness ran to call for assistance

161
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
A sad close to a broken love affair

162
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Our deeds have traveled far

163
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What we have been is what we are

164
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Our deeds have traveled far

165
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What we have been is what we are

166
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
She wanted love forever

167
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But he had another plan

168
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
He fell into an evil way

169
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
She had to let him down

170
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
She said
"I can`t love a wayward man"

171
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
She may have found a reason to forgive

172
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
If he had only tried to change

173
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Was their fatal meeting prearranged?

174
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Had a violent struggle taken place?

175
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
There was every sign that lead there

176
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Witness found a switchblade on the ground

177
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Was the victim unaware?

178
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
They continued to investigate

179
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
They found a note in the killer`s pocket

180
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It could have been a suicide letter

181
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Maybe he had lost her love

182
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I feel there`s only one thing left to do

183
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I`d sooner take my life away

184
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
than live without losing you

185
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Our deeds have traveled far

186
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What we have been is what we are

187
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Our deeds have traveled far

188
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What we have been is what we are

189
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
All that we learn this time
(What we have been is what we are)

190
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Is carried beyond this life

191
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
All that we learn this time
(What we have been is what we are)

192
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Is carried beyond this life

193
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Our deeds have traveled far

194
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What we have been is what we are

195
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Our deeds have traveled far

196
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
What we have been is what we are

197
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
All that we learn this time

198
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
(What we have been is what we are)

199
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Is carried beyond this life

200
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
All that we learn this time

201
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
(What we have been is what we are)

202
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Is carried beyond this life

203
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
She never really had a chance

204
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
On that fateful moonlit night

205
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Sacrificed without a fight

206
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
A victim of her circumstance

207
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Now that I've become aware

208
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And I've exposed this tragedy

209
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
A sadness grows inside of me

210
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It all seems so unfair

211
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm learning all about my life

212
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
By looking through her eyes

213
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Just beyond the churchyard gates

214
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Where the grass is overgrown

215
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I saw the writing on her stone

216
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I felt like I would suffocate

217
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
In loving memory of our child

218
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So innocent, eyes open wide

219
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I felt so empty as I cried

220
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Like part of me had died

221
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm learning all about my life

222
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
By looking through her eyes

223
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And as her image

224
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Wandered through my head

225
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I wept just like a baby

226
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
As I lay awake in bed

227
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And I know what it's like

228
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
To lose someone you love

229
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And this felt just the same

230
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
She wasn't given any choice

231
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Desperation stole her voice

232
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I've been given so much more in life

233
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I've got a son, I've got a wife

234
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I had to suffer one last time

235
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
To grieve for her and say goodbye

236
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Relive the anguish of my past

237
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
To find out who I was at last

238
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The door has opened wide

239
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm turning with the tide

240
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Looking through her eyes

241
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Shine

242
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
-lake of fire

243
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Lines

244
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
take me higher

245
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
My mind

246
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
drips desire

247
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Confined

248
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and overtired

249
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Living this charade

250
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Is getting me nowhere

251
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I can`t shake this charade

252
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
The city`s cold blood

253
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
calls me home

254
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Home

255
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
it`s what I long

256
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
for back home

257
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
where I belong

258
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The city

259
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
it calls me

260
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Decadent scenes from my memory

261
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Sorrow

262
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
eternity

263
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
My demons are coming to drown me

264
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Help

265
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I`m falling

266
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I`m crawling

267
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I can`t keep away from its clutch

268
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Can`t have it

269
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
this habit

270
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It`s calling me back to my home

271
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I remember the first time she came to me

272
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Poured her soul out all night and cried

273
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I remember I was told there`s a new love that`s born

274
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
For each one that has died

275
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I never thought that I

276
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Could carry on with this life

277
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
But I can`t resist myself

278
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
No matter how hard I try

279
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Living their other life

280
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Is getting them nowhere

281
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I`ll make her my wife

282
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Her sweet temptations

283
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
calls me home

284
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Home

285
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
it`s what I long for

286
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
my home

287
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
where she belongs

288
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Her ecstasy

289
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
means so much to me

290
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Even decieving my own blood

291
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles

292
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
She`s taking me to my home

293
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Help - he`s my brother

294
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
but I love her

295
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I can`t keep away from her touch

296
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Deception

297
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Dishonor

298
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It`s calling me back to my home

299
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Her story

300
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
it holds the key

301
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Unlocking dreams from my memory

302
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Solving

303
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
this mystery

304
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Is everything that is a part of me

305
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Help

306
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Regression

307
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Obsession

308
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I can`t keep away from her touch

309
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Leave no doubt

310
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
to find out

311
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It`s calling me back to my home

312
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It doesn`t make any sense

313
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
This tragic ending

314
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
In spite of the evidence

315
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
There`s something still missing

316
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Heard some of the rumours told

317
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
A taste of one`s wealth

318
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Did Victoria wound his soul?

319
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Did she bid him farewell?

320
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
One last time

321
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
We`ll lay down today

322
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
One last time

323
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Until we fade away

324
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
One last time

325
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
We`ll lay down today

326
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
One last time

327
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
We slowly fade away

328
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Away...

329
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Here I am inside his home

330
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It holds the many clues

331
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
To my suspicions

332
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And as I`m standing here right now

333
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I`m finally shown

334
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
what I have always known

335
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Coincidence I can`t belive

336
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
As my childhood dreams alowly come true

337
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Are these her memories

338
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Awakened through my eyes

339
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
This house has brought back to life

340
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
An open door

341
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I walk on through

342
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Into his bedroom

343
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Feeling as cold as outside

344
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
The walls disappear

345
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
To some woman who`s screaming

346
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
A man pleads forgiveness

347
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
His words I cannot...

348
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
...hear

349
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Where did we come from?

350
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Why are we here?

351
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Where do we go when we die?

352
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
What lies beyond

353
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And what lay before?

354
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Is anything certain in life?

355
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
They say

356
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
"Life is too short"

357
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
"The here and the now"

358
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And "You`re only given one shot"

359
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
But could there be more

360
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Have I lived before

361
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Or could tis be all that we`ve got?

362
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
If I die tomorrow

363
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I`d be allright

364
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Because I believe

365
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
That after we`re gone

366
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
The spirit carries on

367
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I used to be frightened of dying

368
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I used to think death was the end

369
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
But that was before

370
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I`m not scared anymore

371
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I know that my soul will transcend

372
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I may never find all the answers

373
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I may never understand why

374
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I may never prove

375
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
What I know to be true

376
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But I know that I still have to try

377
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
If I die tomorrow

378
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I`d be allright

379
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Because I believe

380
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That after we`re gone

381
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
The spirit carries on

382
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
"Move on, be brave

383
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Don`t weep at my grave

384
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Because I`m no longer here

385
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But please never let

386
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
You memories of me disappear"

387
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Safe in the light that surrounds me

388
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Free of the fear and the pain

389
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
My questioning mind

390
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Has help me to find

391
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
The meaning in my life again

392
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Victoria`s real

393
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I finally feel

394
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
At peace with the girl in my dreams

395
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And now that I`m here

396
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It`s perfectly clear

397
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I found out what all of this means

398
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
If I die tomorrow

399
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I`d be allright

400
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Because I believe

401
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That after we`re gone

402
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The spirit carries on

403
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
You are once again surrounded
by a brilliant white light

404
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Allow the light to lead you away
from the past

405
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
and into this lifetime

406
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
As the light dissipates

407
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
you will slowly fade back
into conciousness

408
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
remembering all you have learned

409
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
When I tell you to open your eyes

410
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
you will return to the present

411
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
feeling peaceful and refreshed

412
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Open your eyes, Nicholas

413
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Friday evening

414
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
The blood still on my hands

415
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
To think that she would leave me now

416
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
For that ungreateful man

417
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Sole survivor

418
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
No witness to the crime

419
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I must act fast to cover up

420
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I think that there`s still time

421
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
He`d seem hopeless and lost with this note

422
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
They`ll buy into the words that I wrote

423
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
" This feeling
inside me

424
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Finally found my love,

425
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I`ve finally broke free

426
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
No longer
torn in two

427
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I`d take my own life
before loosing you"

428
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Feeling good this friday afternoon

429
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I ran into Julian

430
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Said we`d get together soon

431
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
He`s always had my heart

432
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
He needs to know

433
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I`ll break free of the Miracle

434
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
It`s time for him to go

435
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
This feeling
inside me

436
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Finally found my love,

437
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I`ve finally broke free

438
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
No longer
torn in two

439
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
He`d kill his brother if he only knew

440
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Their love renewed

441
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
They`d rendezvous

442
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
In a pathway out of view

443
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
They thought no one knew

444
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
They came a shot out

445
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
of the night

446
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
One last time

447
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
We`ll lay down today

448
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
One last time

449
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Until we fade away

450
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
One last time

451
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
We`ll lay down today

452
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
One last time

453
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
We fade away

454
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
As their bodies lie still

455
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And the ending draws near

456
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Spirits rise through the air

457
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
All their fears disappear, it all becomes clear

458
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
A blinding light comes into view

459
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
An old soul exchanged for a new

460
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,000
A familiar voice
comes shining through

461
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
This feeling
inside me

462
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Finally found my love

463
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I`m finally free

464
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
No longer
torn in two

465
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I learned about my life
by living through you

466
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
This feeling
inside me

467
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Finally found my love

468
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I`ve finally free

469
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
No longer
torn in two

470
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Living my own life
by learning from you

471
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
We`ll meet again my friend...

472
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,000
someday soon...

473
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
" news in London, France, Russia and Italy
have deleted their lead story,

474
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,000
all anticipating the outcome of the man
considered to be a member of American nobility.

475
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And as you can imagine, as the skies
have grown darker here over Washington,

476
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
the mood has grown darker as well and people
here are beginning to resign themselves...

477
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,000
to the possibility that they are witnessing
yet another tragedy in a long string of misfortunes.

478
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Reaction from everywhere, from Washington
and certainly from around the world has guess..."

479
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
"Open your eyes, Nicholas"
