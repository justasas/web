00:00:01-->00:00:05
Oh oh, I can't even take it in

00:00:05-->00:00:08
Oh oh, I can't even take it in


00:00:09-->00:00:14
Oh oh, I left my heart in metropolis



00:00:
31-->00:00:34
So far apart

00:00:34-->00:00:37
I checked but the coast was clear


00:00:37-->00:00:41
I feel like a postcard


00:00:41-->00:00:45
I wish you were here



00:00:46-->00:00:48
Subway through the dark

00:00:48-->00:00:50
carriage through the park

00:00:50-->00:00:51
Taxi down the street,

00:00:51-->00:00:53
get out and use my feet

00:00:53-->00:00:56
Don't matter much to me

00:00:56-->00:00:59
what it is that I do


00:00:59-->00:01:01
As long as I'm coming home to you



00:01:01-->00:01:07
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see



00:01:08-->00:01:11
You're the only one,

00:01:11-->00:01:14
the only one who can get to me


00:01:16-->00:01:18
Like a hijacked plane

00:01:19-->00:01:22
or a runaway train

00:01:23-->00:01:25
Or a speeding bullet,

00:01:26-->00:01:28
there's no stopping this


00:01:29-->00:01:33
I left my heart in metropolis

00:01:41-->00:01:44
A thousand miles

00:01:45-->00:01:48
feels like a million years


00:01:49-->00:01:51
Like hundreds of postcards

00:01:52-->00:01:54
that say I wish you were here

00:01:55-->00:01:57
(I can't even take it in)

00:01:57-->00:01:59
Airplane through the sky

00:01:59--00:02:01
greyhound racing by


00:02:01-->00:02:02
Dirt bike on the beach

00:02:02-->00:02:04
sailboat on the sea


00:02:04-->00:02:06
Don't matter much to me

00:02:07-->00:02:09
what it is that I do


00:02:10-->00:02:13
As long as I'm coming home to you

00:02:13-->00:02:18
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see


00:02:19-->00:02:22
You're the only one

00:02:22-->00:02:25
the only one who can get to me


00:02:26-->00:02:30
Like a hijacked plane

00:02:31-->00:02:33
or a runaway train


00:02:34-->00:02:37
Or a speeding bullet

00:02:38-->00:02:40
there's no stopping this


00:02:41-->00:02:44
I left my heart in metropolis


00:02:45-->00:02:52
I left my heart in metropolis



00:02:53-->00:02:56
Like a hijacked plane

00:02:57-->00:02:59
or a runaway train


00:03:00-->00:03:03
Or a speeding bullet

00:03:04-->00:03:06
there's no stopping this


00:03:07-->00:03:09
I left my heart in metropolis


00:03:10-->00:03:13
I left my heart in metropolis

00:03:14-->00:03:17
I left my heart in metropolis


00:03:18-->00:03:19
I left my heart in metropolis


00:03:20-->00:03:23
Oh oh, I can't even take it in


00:03:24-->00:03:27
Oh oh, I can't even take it in


00:03:28-->00:03:31
Oh oh, I can't even take it in


00:03:32-->00:03:35
Oh oh, I left my heart in metropolis.
