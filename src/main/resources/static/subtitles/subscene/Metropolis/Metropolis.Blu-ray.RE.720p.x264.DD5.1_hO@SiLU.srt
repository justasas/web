10
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:16,214
At this moment our state extends
its reach to the stars!

11
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:19,719
I tremble at the honour
of announcing...

12
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,855
...the culmination of humanity's
long history of intellect and science.

13
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:31,647
Our power spans the earth.
Now it will illuminate the stars!

14
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:36,240
May it stand forever! Our Ziggurat!

15
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:22,247
Those robots are getting big ideas.
They don't know their place!

16
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,700
But our economy is unthinkable
without robot labour.

17
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:30,745
Yes, but they cause friction
with human workers.

18
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:34,251
The enemy is developing new weapons.

19
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:39,758
What Metropolis needs is a leader
who will be a powerful symbol!

20
00:03:55,612 --> 00:04:00,155
Duke Red, with the Ziggurat complete,
will you be entering politics?

21
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,199
Don't be silly!

22
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,949
As long as President Boone governs,
our state is secure.

23
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,655
Politics has no need of me.

24
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,285
Mr. President, would you like
to see Duke Red in politics?

25
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:21,164
Don't encourage him! How could l
compete with anyone so popular?

26
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:29,014
Is it true there are military
facilities in the Ziggurat?

27
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:31,928
Would the mayor care to comment?

28
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:37,436
Ask Minister of State Skunk
about that.

29
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:39,973
Hurray for the Ziggurat!

30
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,438
Long live Metropolis!

31
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:50,200
Uncle Shunsaku,
what does "Ziggurat" mean?

32
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:52,858
Who knows?

33
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:57,703
- Hey! Look up there!
- What's that?

34
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:08,879
Malduk! It's the Malduks!

35
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,805
There he is!

36
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,948
You said she'd be ready tonight,
Dr. Laughton.

37
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,571
Er, well...

38
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:34,945
What is the meaning of this?
I've given you the best facilities...

39
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:36,452
...money can buy!

40
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,913
If you could wait a little longer,
I'm almost done.

41
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:45,998
I'm tired of hearing that.
I'll be at your lab tomorrow night.

42
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:50,712
But it's not the kind of place
you'd go to!

43
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,337
And the place is a mess!

44
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:55,632
Get back to work!

45
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:14,654
- It's me.
- I hear there was trouble, Rock.

46
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:18,658
Yes. A robot agitator in the plaza.

47
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,073
You were supposed
to have that under control!

48
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,247
Yes, Father.

49
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,450
Fool! I am not your father!

50
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:33,872
I merely found you during
the last war and took you in.

51
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:35,917
Yes, sir.

52
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:03,652
I'm Shunsaku Ban,
a private investigator from Japan.

53
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:08,944
I have a letter of introduction
to Superintendent Notarlin.

54
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:18,997
I see.

55
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:23,377
So you're saying this Dr. Laughton...

56
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:26,463
...is hiding out...

57
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,136
...here in Metropolis?

58
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:43,395
Yes. This is a reliable tip from
an organ smuggler he dealt with.

59
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:47,856
The lnternational Human Rights
Committee and other organizations...

60
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:50,070
...have warrants for him...

61
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:54,908
...for vivisection experiments
and dealing in human organs.

62
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:59,538
To which end
I ask for your cooperation...

63
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:06,166
...seeing I've never been in this city
and I don't know east from west here.

64
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:12,212
I'd like to help, but with
the celebrations for the Ziggurat...

65
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,300
...going on all week...

66
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:20,679
...it's taking every single person
I have to keep things under control.

67
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:23,757
I don't have anybody.

68
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,432
Well, I could give you a robot
if that's okay with you.

69
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:31,020
A robot?

70
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:34,235
Yes. He's very good.

71
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:38,738
He's not authorized to
arrest people...

72
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:44,155
<i>...but he can certainly assist you
in your investigation.</i>

73
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:51,453
Do I have to return him
with a full tank?

74
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:57,296
He only needs refueling
every five years.

75
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:06,509
Soon they won't need us anymore.

76
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:09,801
I'm Kenichi. How do you do?

77
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:14,181
I am Model 803-D-RP-DM...

78
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,314
...497-3-C.

79
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:21,311
Uh, how do you do?

80
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:35,622
<i>The completion of the Ziggurat...</i>

81
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:39,780
<i>... establishes our Metropolis
as the world leader...</i>

82
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:43,204
<i>... in industry, economics and culture.</i>

83
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:50,211
<i>Thus is born a state that
will last a thousand years!</i>

84
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,843
<i>I tremble at the honour
of announcing...</i>

85
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,470
<i>... the culmination of humanity's
long history of intellect and science.</i>

86
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:05,390
<i>Our power spans the earth.
Now it will illuminate the stars!</i>

87
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:09,735
<i>May it stand forever! Our Ziggurat!</i>

88
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:21,445
Well, where do we start,
uh, 803, uh...

89
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:27,161
D- RP-DM497-3-C.

90
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:31,039
Don't you have an easier name?

91
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:35,999
We are not allowed human names,
as it may infringe...

92
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,423
...upon human rights.

93
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:47,216
I know! As of now, your name is Pero.

94
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,515
That's a dog's name!

95
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:55,267
That's right. I used to have a dog
named Pero. He was a great dog.

96
00:11:56,734 --> 00:12:00,434
In my opinion,
a criminal could not hide...

97
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,655
...up here in Metropolis.

98
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:07,448
I have reliable sources
that say he's here!

99
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:12,245
Dr. Laughton would not hide up here.
He would go to Zone 1.

100
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,249
- Zone 1?
- Underground.

101
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,288
Hey! You are a detective!

102
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:24,506
It is simply a calculation
of probabilities.

103
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:50,318
Robots are strictly forbidden...

104
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,735
...to operate outside
their assigned area.

105
00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:00,367
That robot was not authorized
to operate at surface level.

106
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:13,581
Okay, but who are those guys?
They look like fascists.

107
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:18,961
The Malduk Party, vigilantes
who started as a political group.

108
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:23,508
Movement between levels is restricted.

109
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:28,932
No one who carries the mark
may pass through this gate.

110
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:31,435
So that robot had the mark?

111
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,183
Yes. Each block has a gate like this.

112
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:40,823
There are, of course, hidden ways
and people who work as guides to them.

113
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,523
Damn right! The system's wrong!

114
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:53,407
It takes light
to create shadow, I guess.

115
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:57,202
This level is not
particularly dangerous...

116
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:03,589
...but there are places in which
police writ does not run. Avoid them.

117
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:09,181
We can't do that.
We're not here as tourists.

118
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,690
Duke Red.

119
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,644
Let's see it.

120
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:36,878
Very good. lsn't she finished?

121
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:42,713
Her final-stage energy processor
isn't stable yet.

122
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:46,971
Are you using real organs?

123
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:51,049
Dear me, no! That's illegal!

124
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:56,096
Real organs are quicker,
but they don't last very long.

125
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:59,185
Hers are mechanical. I made them.

126
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:04,104
She will be my masterpiece!

127
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:09,700
When will you finish?

128
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,990
Within the week.
If I start her too early...

129
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:19,200
...she'll build up too much energy,
catch fire and explode.

130
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,335
My Tima...

131
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,868
I'm not giving you to anyone!

132
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:12,620
I'll put on the finishing touches...

133
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,125
...and together we will flee!

134
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:36,646
Rock? What are you doing here?

135
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,311
Protecting my father is
my most important task.

136
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,440
Father? But Duke Red has no children.

137
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,453
And the child who died was a girl.

138
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:51,911
Quiet! I know what you're up to.

139
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:57,706
No mad scientist is going
to deceive my father.

140
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:04,003
And no mannequin like this
will steal his heart.

141
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:06,420
Stop!

142
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:11,173
It is at Duke Red's request
that I've made Tima.

143
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,675
Tima is the super-being
who is to sit...

144
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:18,636
...on the Throne of Power
atop the Ziggurat.

145
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:24,685
You lie! He would never give
the Ziggurat to a robot!

146
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:28,816
Perhaps you should ask
Duke Red about that.

147
00:18:29,156 --> 00:18:35,868
Will you destroy the super-being for
whom the one you call Father waits?

148
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:44,410
No robot will steal my father!

149
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,459
No! Don't!

150
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:06,096
<i>O, ye Gods, give me courage...</i>

151
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:11,732
<i>...and strength to guard
my father from machines!</i>

152
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:13,908
Fire! Fire!

153
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:47,934
A Malduk set that fire!

154
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,771
I saw him!

155
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:55,359
The ones up there want to kill us!

156
00:20:56,906 --> 00:21:02,149
Atlas is right!
They think we're nothing but garbage!

157
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:06,659
To arms! Now we have to fight!

158
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:11,660
Please remain calm. Fire-fighting
operations are commencing.

159
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:16,461
Everyone please step back.

160
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:18,625
Robots out!

161
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:25,220
First you take our jobs,
and now you're trying to kill us!

162
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:28,143
This is no time to be fighting!

163
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,640
What the-- ?

164
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:25,056
But why did he set fire
to that old factory?

165
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:28,602
Well, that strange old man was around.

166
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:33,564
An old man? This one?

167
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:37,115
- Yes.
- Thanks a lot!

168
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:50,162
There's someone in there!

169
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:55,921
Oh, no. Kenichi, go round the back.
Hurry!

170
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:57,969
- Come on, Laughton!
- Notebook...

171
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,436
That notebook?

172
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,358
Laughton!

173
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:47,229
<i>Laughton's lab burned down?</i>

174
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:53,144
<i>I guess he was doing an experiment.
The fire just ripped right through it.</i>

175
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,856
<i>- What happened to him?
- His body was found.</i>

176
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:02,366
Whatever he was doing...

177
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:05,945
...considering there are warrants
for his arrest...

178
00:25:06,163 --> 00:25:09,531
...it must have been
something dangerous.

179
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,699
What's wrong, Father?
What did Dr. Laughton mean to you?

180
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,669
Get out! Leave me alone.

181
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:05,254
Where am l?

182
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:20,191
That was sure some fire!

183
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:22,941
Well, it was just an old factory.

184
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:26,939
Saves the trouble of tearing it down.

185
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,740
<i>This is strange. She was
the most advanced robot there is.</i>

186
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,331
<i>There should be something left.</i>

187
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:44,837
- Pero, who's that?
- Rock of the Malduks.

188
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:49,294
He's young,
but he's one of their main men.

189
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:52,429
They say he does
Duke Red's dirty work.

190
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,431
Duke Red?
Is he connected with the Malduks?

191
00:27:57,644 --> 00:28:00,313
He's the party founder.

192
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:07,189
Now there's no official connection,
but he funds their activities.

193
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:12,401
It's a public secret.

194
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,690
Everyone knows.

195
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:22,326
Where does this sewer come out?

196
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,039
It merges up ahead
with the sewage from Zone 2...

197
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:29,206
...and goes to
the processing plant in Zone 3.

198
00:28:29,463 --> 00:28:34,504
If she's down there, she'll have
been chopped up with the garbage.

199
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:36,342
Anyone else, yes.

200
00:28:36,803 --> 00:28:40,503
The criminal always returns
to the scene.

201
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:43,891
An old saying, but a good one.

202
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:47,266
We should continue searching
for Kenichi.

203
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,449
Who are you?

204
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,573
Who are you?

205
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:17,288
No, no, no. You call yourself "I."

206
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:20,792
"I" am who?

207
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:25,378
- "I" am...
- You are I.

208
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:28,294
No, listen.

209
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:33,882
You are "I." I am "you"...
Huh?

210
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:35,888
I am who.

211
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:41,900
Yeah, that's right.
And I'm Kenichi. Kenichi.

212
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:45,141
- Kenichi.
- Yeah.

213
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,525
Anyway, it'll all come to you
after a while.

214
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:55,865
Your name, your family,
your father, your mother.

215
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,866
Family...father...

216
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:13,586
Uh, thanks, I guess.

217
00:30:13,844 --> 00:30:18,304
I know this is food,
but it's all rotten.

218
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:19,878
Food...

219
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:25,769
Yeah. You put it in your mouth
like this and eat it.

220
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,771
No, don't eat that!
lt'll make you sick!

221
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:33,819
No, don't eat. Make you sick.

222
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:45,829
<i>Attention Control. Cloud cover 1. 1.

223

<i>Magnetic bias 3. 7.

224
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:53,001

226
00:30:56,214 --> 00:31:01,504
<i>Motor, cooling, sensor
and operating systems, all go.</i>

227
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:04,334
<i>Control authorization. We are go.</i>

228
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:08,847
<i>Energy condensers confirmed

229
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:10,338

<i>Magnetic target: bias 0. 25.</i>

<i>Optical target: bias 1. 06.</i>

234
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:51,964
<i>Radiation equipment in position.</i>

235
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:57,301
We'll radiate for three minutes.

236
00:31:57,517 --> 00:32:04,313
Citizens won't be affected,
but aboveground robots will.

237
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:10,108
I'm having everything recorded.
The data will be valuable.

238
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:13,857
Begin at Level 3.

239
00:32:14,072 --> 00:32:16,029
Yes, doctor.

240
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:27,699
Commencing radiation!

241
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:47,052
<i>Terminate Level-3 radiation

<i>Omotanium fusion!</i>

00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:07,235
<i>Omotanium confirmed

<i>35, 000...40, 000...45, 000.</i>

248
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:17,583

249
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:20,960
<i>Ionospheric disturbance.

250
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:39,480
<i>Level-3 radiation terminated.

251
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,858
Success!

252
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:49,245
This will set
the whole world on its ear!

253
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:54,913
You now hold the power
of the gods themselves.

254
00:34:57,338 --> 00:35:03,506
If only Dr. Laughton had finished
building our guardian deity...

255
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:12,349
<i>He's caused anomalies in sunspots...</i>

256
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,058
<i>...and bathed Earth
in harmful magnetic radiation.</i>

257
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,350
<i>It's an outrage that he would
endanger national security...</i>

258
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,605
<i>...by developing such a thing!</i>

259
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:28,986
The Malduk robot hunters are
using this as an excuse...

260
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,576
...to cry " human rights" and press
for changes in the Robot Law.

261
00:35:33,911 --> 00:35:36,828
The pro-robot citizens' groups...

262
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,823
...say that's reactionary nonsense.
They're organizing protests.

263
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:44,127
There's fighting breaking out.

264
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:47,870
This is our chance, Mr. President!

265
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:53,085
We could make a case for treason here.

266
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:59,178
Will the military support us?

267
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:05,096
Some units are under Duke Red's
influence, but I can handle that.

268
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,901
We'll stir up the public
with a few leaks.

269
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:19,362
Once sentiment is against Duke Red,
we'll arrest him for treason.

270
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:24,152
Should military action be needed,
you have...

271
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:26,031
...my approval.

272
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:38,378
I suspect he was the guy
who did in Laughton.

273
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:42,589
What I don't understand is
how they were connected.

274
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:47,596
Just what was Laughton
working on, anyway?

275
00:36:48,851 --> 00:36:50,890
What will you do?

276
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:56,305
Laughton's already dead.
I want, at least, to know why.

277
00:36:56,524 --> 00:36:59,608
My client deserves that.

278
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:22,127
- Where's he going now?
- Zone 2, I think.

279
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:27,129
There's another level below this?
How far down does this place go?

280
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:32,380
Zone 2 is the Metropolis
power plant area.

281
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:37,098
Zone 3 below that is
the sewage-handling facility.

282
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,177
The sewage facility.

283
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:45,266
You know, he was looking
at a drain behind that factory.

284
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:51,606
I'll report back
and get permission to go below.

285
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:56,530
I'll file a missing persons report
on Kenichi too.

286
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,657
- Hey! You're old for a petty thief!
- Sorry!

287
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,826
If anyone was wandering
around down there...

288
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:09,664
...they'd notice him right away.

289
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,878
How often are you down here?

290
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:17,667
Twice a week,
for maintenance on the robots.

291
00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:34,263
These are Albert II types.
It's their last check this week.

292
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,707
Is anyone here?

293
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:08,127
You never get used to
the stink down here, though.

294
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:13,265
No human could last a day
at this work.

295
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:28,150
- What is it?
- Someone's there.

296
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:30,022
Impossible!

297
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:36,737
Hey! What are you doing there?
This is a restricted area!

298
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,531
So she survived.

299
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:41,032
Help!

300
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:47,536
- What are you doing?
- It's all right. They're criminals.

301
00:39:47,797 --> 00:39:50,038
How do we get out of here?

302
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,553
Stop that, please!
You'll hit the equipment!

303
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:08,514
Are you okay?

304
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:28,329
That guy's trying to kill us!

305
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:08,359
Move! Move! Out of the way!

306
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:11,697
You piece of junk!

307
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:14,821
Move!

308
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:49,392
Is it safe?

309
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:16,340
It looks okay.

310
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:31,133
What's wrong?

311
00:42:36,149 --> 00:42:40,645
Oh, I get it.
Fifi can't go through that gate.

312
00:42:41,529 --> 00:42:45,740
Thanks for everything, Fifi.
We'll see you again.

313
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:48,153
Move!

314
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:52,782
It's him!

315
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,309
Fifi!

316
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:28,815
No weapons through here.
May I see your I.D.?

317
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:31,317
I'm Rock of the Malduks!

318
00:43:34,908 --> 00:43:38,074
<i>Demonstrations are forbidden
during Celebration Week.</i>

319
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:41,785
<i>Please disperse immediately.</i>

320
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:45,414
Kenichi?

321
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:50,203
- Kenichi!
- Hey!

322
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:53,710
Pay up!

323
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:15,535
- They're not here!
- They have to be! Keep looking!

324
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:52,201
Look over that way!

325
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:24,304
What's the matter, Atlas?
We're waiting for your signal!

326
00:47:24,523 --> 00:47:29,101
Not today. There are Malduks
all over the place.

327
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:33,445
- Was there a leak?
- They're the reason.

328
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:38,694
Rock's after them. Come on!

329
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:43,447
He was at that factory.

330
00:47:57,092 --> 00:47:59,417
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

331
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:03,680
I'm Kenichi. I'm from Japan.
My uncle's a private...

332
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:10,639
- A private what?
- A journalist! I'm his assistant.

333
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,556
Why is Rock after you?

334
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:18,357
I don't know.
He just started shooting at us.

335
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:21,984
I don't trust them. Let's kill them.

336
00:48:22,531 --> 00:48:26,824
Cool it! We're not a gang.

337
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:29,786
He says he's a journalist.

338
00:48:29,996 --> 00:48:37,325
If he can tell the world
about Metropolis, that helps us!

339
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:43,960
We can't waste time on nice uniforms
and our pictures in the paper.

340
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:47,504
The uniform I die in...

341
00:48:49,095 --> 00:48:52,131
...will be the uniform
of the revolution!

342
00:49:32,341 --> 00:49:34,001
Look at that!

343
00:49:34,217 --> 00:49:36,505
- She looks like an angel!
- Yeah.

344
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,420
An angel.

345
00:49:46,603 --> 00:49:51,015
Around here there's two
or three families to a room.

346
00:49:52,149 --> 00:49:55,316
There are no schools
and hardly any jobs.

347
00:49:55,569 --> 00:50:00,943
They survive on food handouts,
but with the Ziggurat celebrations...

348
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,066
...that's all been stopped.

349
00:50:04,285 --> 00:50:07,784
What does "Ziggurat" mean?

350
00:50:08,914 --> 00:50:12,164
It's an ancient Babylonian tower.

351
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:17,617
The Tower of Babel was one.
You know what happened to that.

352
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,043
The king's pride brought down
the wrath of God on him.

353
00:50:23,384 --> 00:50:28,010
History repeats itself.
The same thing will happen to Duke Red.

354
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:32,599
But it won't be God this time.
It'll be us.

355
00:50:58,081 --> 00:51:00,120
Is that wrong?

356
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:11,167
No, it's fine.
I was just thinking your hair's grown.

357
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,628
What kind of hair do you like?

358
00:51:17,514 --> 00:51:20,135
Yours is fine right now.

359
00:51:21,226 --> 00:51:25,472
Let's get back to your writing.
Next comes...

360
00:51:25,688 --> 00:51:27,727
- Tima.
- What?

361
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:30,724
Tima. My name.

362
00:51:34,112 --> 00:51:37,231
So you remember!

363
00:51:37,948 --> 00:51:42,241
That's great! Now you'll start
remembering more and more.

364
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:47,244
Thank you, Kenichi.

365
00:51:54,713 --> 00:51:59,209
Oh, I forgot.
I borrowed this from Atlas.

366
00:52:05,306 --> 00:52:07,049
Kenichi?

367
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:18,142
So the army's with us?
That helps a lot.

368
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:21,193
The underground residents
support us...

369
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:25,863
...but they're not sure
if we've got the strength to win.

370
00:52:26,073 --> 00:52:30,818
The Malduks are to move
when the Ziggurat celebrations end.

371
00:52:31,036 --> 00:52:36,825
We want you to crush them
and storm the Ziggurat.

372
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:43,493
The president will announce
the arrest of Duke Red for treason.

373
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:46,334
He will invoke his powers...

374
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:50,416
...to take control of
the police and military.

375
00:52:51,428 --> 00:52:56,553
Then Metropolis will be governed
by the rule of law.

376
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:02,556
And we will participate as
a proper political party.

377
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:14,072
Of course, Atlas. The president
will welcome you with open arms.

378
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,821
The things I get myself into!

379
00:53:18,035 --> 00:53:21,284
I finally find that kid
and look what happens!

380
00:53:21,496 --> 00:53:25,789
I'm sorry I could not have been
of more assistance.

381
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,076
What are you talking about?

382
00:53:28,294 --> 00:53:33,204
You've been lots of help!
I don't know east from west here.

383
00:53:33,423 --> 00:53:38,085
Don't worry about Kenichi.
He's tougher than he--

384
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:44,003
Cut that out!

385
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:52,562
Just look at this, will you?

386
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:39,304
"Watch out. Hide, robots.
Coup d'état."

387
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:42,605
What? A coup d'état?

388
00:55:10,966 --> 00:55:13,041
Oh, man!

389
00:55:33,818 --> 00:55:36,938
Take a good look, Kenichi.

390
00:55:37,155 --> 00:55:41,022
Tell the whole world how angry we are.

391
00:55:59,966 --> 00:56:02,670
I'm all out of breath!

392
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,348
We'd better get out of here, Pero.
We can't do anything.

393
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,272
Ask headquarters for backup.

394
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,814
I'm not leaving you here!

395
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:25,404
It's robots they're going
to attack first!

396
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:29,193
- I will be fine.
- What?

397
00:56:29,866 --> 00:56:36,034
It is also my duty to ensure the
safety of all visitors to our city.

398
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:42,581
All right. Just don't stir
anything up till I get back!

399
00:56:57,557 --> 00:57:01,850
Are you going to hold this gate
all by yourself?

400
00:57:02,061 --> 00:57:07,517
Demonstrations are forbidden during
Celebration Week. Please disperse.

401
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:11,059
Sorry, we can't do that.
Our time has come.

402
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:16,561
Why must humanity settle matters
by resorting to violence?

403
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:23,363
Yes, we all know that.
I agree it is a problem.

404
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:27,493
It's our emotions.
They vibrate, and all we can do...

405
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,281
...is move forward
within that amplitude.

406
00:57:30,502 --> 00:57:34,416
But without affirming them,
we can't survive.

407
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:01,563
It's time for the uprising to begin.

408
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,856
When should we release a statement?

409
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,652
Things should be clear
by about 1 p.m...

410
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:12,361
...so I suggest 3 or 3:30.

411
00:58:18,085 --> 00:58:20,872
What is it, minister?

412
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:23,962
Hard to relax, eh?

413
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:28,881
Yes, Mr. President.
I have an unpleasant duty to perform.

414
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:35,971
What the-- ?

415
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:40,305
You've gone over to Duke Red!

416
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:45,848
I am merely history's agent.

417
00:58:49,778 --> 00:58:54,071
Wait! We can discuss this!

418
00:59:46,536 --> 00:59:48,408
Why?

419
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:56,117
Why do humans just go
and destroy robots?

420
01:00:02,215 --> 01:00:04,457
Revolution.

421
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,798
<i>The coup d'état has failed.</i>

422
01:00:13,017 --> 01:00:17,927
<i>Martial law is in effect,
under the command of Duke Red.</i>

423
01:00:18,146 --> 01:00:23,057
<i>Abandon your weapons and surrender.</i>

424
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:26,484
<i>I repeat,
the coup d'état has failed.</i>

425
01:00:26,696 --> 01:00:31,522
<i>Martial law is in effect,
under the command of Duke Red.</i>

426
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:36,568
<i>Abandon your weapons and surrender.</i>

427
01:00:39,706 --> 01:00:42,114
Kenichi!

428
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:46,497
Hey! Kenichi!

429
01:00:50,924 --> 01:00:52,833
Uncle!

430
01:00:56,554 --> 01:01:00,218
You're safe! That's great!

431
01:01:00,432 --> 01:01:04,844
- Are you all right?
- This? It's nothing!

432
01:01:07,105 --> 01:01:08,896
Who's this?

433
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:17,357
Her name's Tima.
We escaped from that fire together.

434
01:01:17,864 --> 01:01:21,067
Tima, this is my uncle.

435
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,618
Uncle.

436
01:01:36,213 --> 01:01:38,087
Atlas!

437
01:01:39,716 --> 01:01:44,757
It was a trap!

438
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,182
We meet at last.

439
01:01:56,063 --> 01:01:57,890
Don't move!

440
01:02:04,904 --> 01:02:06,648
No trouble.

441
01:02:07,198 --> 01:02:12,109
Give me the girl,
and you might get back home alive.

442
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:17,494
Don't make promises
you won't keep, Rock!

443
01:02:28,592 --> 01:02:31,165
Don't play games with me!

444
01:02:31,428 --> 01:02:33,716
Tima, pick up the gun!

445
01:02:56,782 --> 01:03:00,482
I'll have that back, please.

446
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:04,409
Don't give it to him!

447
01:03:18,426 --> 01:03:23,384
You going to shoot?
I'm human, you know.

448
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,218
Rock!

449
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:49,409
So it's these people
you've neglected your duties...

450
01:03:49,661 --> 01:03:52,579
...to go chasing after--

451
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,000
Tima!

452
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,712
It's you!

453
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:15,511
Rock! What's going on here?

454
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:22,805
You told me no one survived
the fire in Dr. Laughton's lab!

455
01:04:23,024 --> 01:04:27,103
And how did you know about Tima?
Answer me!

456
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:36,616
I will.

457
01:04:36,868 --> 01:04:41,364
You are the one who must sit
on the Throne of Power.

458
01:04:42,248 --> 01:04:46,910
No robot must ever rule
the Ziggurat and Metropolis!

459
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:48,871
Fool!

460
01:04:49,463 --> 01:04:51,123
Robot?

461
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:57,630
Do you think you fool me?
You're out of line, boy!

462
01:04:57,969 --> 01:04:59,926
Get up!

463
01:05:12,566 --> 01:05:16,184
I never want to see you again!

464
01:05:16,403 --> 01:05:17,647
Kenichi!

465
01:05:20,364 --> 01:05:25,322
- So it was you who hired Laughton!
- What if I did?

466
01:05:25,536 --> 01:05:29,284
I've come from Japan
to arrest Laughton.

467
01:05:29,498 --> 01:05:33,495
My name is Shunsaku Ban...

468
01:05:45,094 --> 01:05:47,501
Get in.

469
01:05:47,721 --> 01:05:51,090
- And Kenichi?
- You'll see him later.

470
01:06:25,921 --> 01:06:28,838
I'm here to see
Superintendent Notarlin.

471
01:06:29,049 --> 01:06:33,509
He's been transferred.
His successor hasn't been named.

472
01:06:34,303 --> 01:06:40,174
There's been a mistake.
The Malduks have taken my nephew away.

473
01:06:40,391 --> 01:06:44,175
Handle it through your embassy!

474
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:12,369
<i>At this moment our state extends
its reach to the stars!</i>

475
01:07:12,627 --> 01:07:16,328
<i>I tremble at the honour
of announcing...</i>

476
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:23,386
<i>... the culmination of humanity's
long history of intellect and science.</i>

477
01:07:32,312 --> 01:07:34,019
Sake.

478
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:36,398
Make it hot.

479
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,603
Hot whiskey or gin I can do,
for a Japanese detective.

480
01:07:41,819 --> 01:07:45,270
Hot whiskey, then.

481
01:07:46,365 --> 01:07:50,196
Who gives a damn about the Ziggurat?

482
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:54,657
And those Malduks can eat dogshit!

483
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:56,532
Here.

484
01:08:00,752 --> 01:08:03,325
Hey! That was Rock!

485
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:08,421
I heard he quit the party.
What's he doing here?

486
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,754
- Thanks.
- Take care.

487
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:22,185
Whoops!

488
01:08:53,715 --> 01:09:00,132
A man earlier tonight asked me
to give you this. I said no.

489
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:05,339
He wanted it kept secret
from Duke Red, and of course...

490
01:09:05,557 --> 01:09:11,144
...I said I couldn't possibly,
but his name was Kenichi.

491
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:17,687
"I can't move at the moment...

492
01:09:17,944 --> 01:09:21,644
...so I can't come to you.

493
01:09:21,864 --> 01:09:25,813
<i>I'm leaving the country soon.</i>

494
01:09:26,076 --> 01:09:30,571
<i>I want to see you again. "</i>

495
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,423
Kenichi!

496
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:04,397
What's going on here?

497
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:07,935
You will bring her back soon,
won't you?

498
01:10:08,153 --> 01:10:12,197
I'll be in real trouble
if they ever find out.

499
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:16,238
Don't worry. This won't take long.

500
01:10:18,037 --> 01:10:22,698
This wasn't my idea.
I have to get back.

501
01:10:24,668 --> 01:10:26,744
You tricked me.

502
01:10:28,254 --> 01:10:32,334
How else could I talk to you?

503
01:10:32,591 --> 01:10:37,716
Where's Kenichi?
If you know, take me to him.

504
01:10:40,724 --> 01:10:43,559
Well, well, well.

505
01:10:45,143 --> 01:10:50,019
To talk to you,
you'd never guess you were a robot.

506
01:10:56,403 --> 01:11:01,148
I guess Father chose
his mad scientist very well.

507
01:11:01,616 --> 01:11:06,277
- What are you talking about?
- You being a robot.

508
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,910
That's not true. I'm not a robot.

509
01:11:10,457 --> 01:11:13,493
So what are you? Human?

510
01:11:17,379 --> 01:11:20,499
So who's your father? Where is he?

511
01:11:21,049 --> 01:11:22,958
My father...

512
01:11:23,593 --> 01:11:25,502
...is Kenichi.

513
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:47,981
The super-being?
A mannequin like you?

514
01:11:55,329 --> 01:11:58,698
<i>If you can't take me
to Kenichi, I'm going.</i>

515
01:12:11,217 --> 01:12:13,293
Tima's gone?

516
01:12:23,353 --> 01:12:26,971
Watch where you're going!

517
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:21,568
Let's see inside this super-being that
Father wants so much.

518
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:56,887
<i>Come on, Laughton!</i>

519
01:13:57,142 --> 01:13:59,763
<i>Notebook.</i>

520
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,562
<i>That notebook?</i>

521
01:15:25,051 --> 01:15:30,839
Don't be alarmed. I taught Rock
a lesson he won't forget.

522
01:15:31,056 --> 01:15:32,681
Where's Kenichi?

523
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:38,265
I'm looking for him too.
I need your help for that.

524
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,724
You do?

525
01:15:39,939 --> 01:15:44,316
I think they've got him
somewhere in the Ziggurat.

526
01:15:44,527 --> 01:15:51,062
I need to look for him
on the Ziggurat's data network.

527
01:15:51,282 --> 01:15:53,819
Can you do that?

528
01:16:14,093 --> 01:16:17,378
Hold out your hand.

529
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:14,553
Kenichi!

530
01:17:25,529 --> 01:17:26,905
Well?

531
01:17:27,156 --> 01:17:31,023
Kenichi's in that building!

532
01:17:31,243 --> 01:17:34,658
You did it! I knew he was there!

533
01:17:36,873 --> 01:17:39,161
<i>What happened to me?</i>

534
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:44,585
I see. You don't know
who you are, do you?

535
01:17:44,797 --> 01:17:47,252
What do you mean?

536
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:56,677
I'll report the instant
we find anything, sir.

537
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:59,967
- Duke Red?
- Yeah.

538
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:03,679
- Anything?
- We can track the signal...

539
01:18:04,396 --> 01:18:07,682
...by where it burned out
the splitters.

540
01:18:12,153 --> 01:18:14,477
- Got it!
- Where?

541
01:18:14,696 --> 01:18:18,147
Zone 1, South Block 17.
The Hotel Coconut.

542
01:18:22,662 --> 01:18:27,656
Tell me, please!
Am I human or am I...?

543
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:33,995
Well, you're different
from normal robots.

544
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:39,208
I'm human. Just like Kenichi!

545
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:42,712
Uh, yes, of course you are!

546
01:18:43,597 --> 01:18:48,140
<i>Anyway, now we've got
to rescue Kenichi.</i>

547
01:19:19,252 --> 01:19:22,122
Tima! I've been looking for you!

548
01:19:35,183 --> 01:19:40,307
Tell me what's going on
or I'll charge you with kidnapping!

549
01:19:40,813 --> 01:19:46,352
I'm not your man.
It's your son you want to talk to.

550
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,353
Rock?

551
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:51,144
I don't know what the plan is...

552
01:19:51,364 --> 01:19:57,365
...but I suspect Dr. Laughton
was involved in it somehow.

553
01:19:57,577 --> 01:20:01,360
And I suspect you had him killed...

554
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:04,666
...to keep her a secret.

555
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:12,377
Take him away.

556
01:20:14,967 --> 01:20:16,758
Come on!

557
01:20:45,785 --> 01:20:49,699
That is a special throne
made especially for you.

558
01:20:49,914 --> 01:20:53,864
One day from here,
you will rule the entire world!

559
01:20:54,168 --> 01:20:57,667
Me? Why?

560
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:03,038
That is your destiny.
I'll show you.

561
01:21:14,185 --> 01:21:15,430
Kenichi!

562
01:21:15,644 --> 01:21:17,222
Kenichi!

563
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:29,113
Wake up, Kenichi!
It's me! Can you hear me?

564
01:21:29,614 --> 01:21:33,481
Kenichi. Kenichi?

565
01:21:34,118 --> 01:21:36,739
What have you done to him?

566
01:21:36,954 --> 01:21:43,122
He's in no danger. We just had
to quiet him down a little.

567
01:21:44,377 --> 01:21:46,951
Kenichi? Kenichi?

568
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:53,086
I'll file a protest with my embassy!
It'll be an international incident!

569
01:21:53,302 --> 01:21:59,055
Oh? I didn't realize
you were so politically important.

570
01:21:59,266 --> 01:22:01,637
My apologies.

571
01:22:01,975 --> 01:22:08,309
But soon every nation in the world
will bow down before Tima.

572
01:22:09,566 --> 01:22:13,100
Make Kenichi the way he was.

573
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:17,607
What's one or two young kids, Tima?

574
01:22:17,823 --> 01:22:22,400
You have the power to rule the world!

575
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:27,659
What power is that? Am I human?

576
01:22:28,999 --> 01:22:32,866
Or am I one of those poor robots?

577
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:39,622
Oh, don't be silly! You're nothing
like those piles of junk!

578
01:22:39,842 --> 01:22:43,673
Then am I human, like Kenichi?

579
01:22:45,263 --> 01:22:49,260
What are you saying?
You're no mere human being...

580
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:55,015
...ruled by emotion and feeling,
torn between morality and love!

581
01:22:58,483 --> 01:23:00,559
You are the super-being!

582
01:23:01,652 --> 01:23:04,225
So then I am a...

583
01:23:04,488 --> 01:23:08,532
I've brought you
new clothes, Miss Tima.

584
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:11,493
Yes, you are a robot...

585
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:16,038
...but you stand at
the pinnacle of all existence!

586
01:23:22,378 --> 01:23:26,754
No. I have the emotions
and love that you hate.

587
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:32,800
That's because your full capacities
haven't yet taken form.

588
01:23:33,012 --> 01:23:38,551
As your abilities evolve, they're
taking the form of emotion and love.

589
01:23:38,767 --> 01:23:40,095
In time--

590
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:46,846
You will become one with that throne,
a computer weapon meant on conquest!

591
01:23:47,817 --> 01:23:52,811
Your memories and emotions
will all be erased!

592
01:23:53,072 --> 01:23:56,357
How did you know that?

593
01:23:56,616 --> 01:23:59,653
I fancy myself a detective.

594
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:09,666
Come, Miss Tima. You should change.

595
01:24:11,462 --> 01:24:15,127
Father, open your eyes!

596
01:24:19,594 --> 01:24:21,338
Rock!

597
01:24:22,055 --> 01:24:24,461
What on earth?

598
01:24:25,223 --> 01:24:27,382
What are you doing?

599
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:34,893
It is you who must sit on that throne.

600
01:24:36,483 --> 01:24:39,899
You are the leader we must bow to!

601
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:46,156
No!

602
01:25:13,265 --> 01:25:14,925
Tima!

603
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:28,644
You're awake?

604
01:25:54,134 --> 01:26:00,302
I am a humanoid, a machine
made to destroy the world.

605
01:26:02,141 --> 01:26:06,517
- Not destroy! Make again!
- Stop!

606
01:26:10,981 --> 01:26:12,890
Kenichi...

607
01:27:11,784 --> 01:27:15,698
Hey! Who threw that switch?
It just started up!

608
01:27:15,912 --> 01:27:18,948
- Cut the power!
- It won't respond!

609
01:27:19,165 --> 01:27:22,332
It's going into the red!

610
01:27:37,848 --> 01:27:39,721
Dr. Ponkotz!

611
01:27:40,308 --> 01:27:42,384
What's that alarm?

612
01:27:42,602 --> 01:27:46,220
The omotanium generator's going wild!

613
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:49,854
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

614
01:28:32,102 --> 01:28:35,186
Stop, Tima!
You'll destroy the Ziggurat!

615
01:28:38,358 --> 01:28:42,190
This comes of trifling with robots.

616
01:28:45,573 --> 01:28:51,361
Her memory's merging with
the data network. She'll go mad!

617
01:28:51,703 --> 01:28:55,570
Thus God destroyed the Tower of Babel.

618
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,617
Tima!

619
01:28:58,543 --> 01:29:02,125
No! She's no longer the Tima you knew!

620
01:29:13,388 --> 01:29:15,048
All right.

621
01:29:15,265 --> 01:29:21,018
The omotanium generator will explode
if we don't shut it down!

622
01:29:26,984 --> 01:29:33,020
The chance of human survival will fall
to 30 percent within one hour.

623
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:36,274
My entire worldwide
network of forces...

624
01:29:36,491 --> 01:29:40,785
...will be completely activated
within 30 minutes.

625
01:29:41,746 --> 01:29:48,033
<i>Their targets are the world's major
cities and 7586 other facilities.</i>

626
01:29:50,128 --> 01:29:53,046
Estimated time period...

627
01:29:53,256 --> 01:29:57,300
...for eradication of humanity
by biological warfare:

628
01:29:57,552 --> 01:30:00,042
17 hours, 27 minutes.

629
01:30:02,056 --> 01:30:04,760
Hear that, Duke Red?

630
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:11,061
Your super-being says
she doesn't need us!

631
01:30:11,271 --> 01:30:15,138
Tima! Come back!

632
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:19,983
Kenichi!

633
01:30:32,664 --> 01:30:34,123
Kenichi!

634
01:30:58,145 --> 01:30:59,521
Tima!

635
01:32:21,342 --> 01:32:22,800
Tima!

636
01:32:49,783 --> 01:32:54,076
<i>Doctor, we've lost control
of the underground power pl--</i>

637
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,577
What's happening?

638
01:33:17,181 --> 01:33:21,593
Get out! You robots are
not supposed to be here!

639
01:33:27,148 --> 01:33:30,149
Tima! It's me!

640
01:33:39,158 --> 01:33:43,286
Kenichi! It's Kenichi!

641
01:34:20,235 --> 01:34:22,027
Stop!

642
01:34:24,364 --> 01:34:26,522
The likes of you...

643
01:34:27,283 --> 01:34:30,201
...will never kill...

644
01:34:31,454 --> 01:34:33,779
...my father!

645
01:34:35,749 --> 01:34:37,373
Rock!

646
01:36:34,893 --> 01:36:36,684
Tima!

647
01:36:50,073 --> 01:36:51,864
Tima!

648
01:37:32,318 --> 01:37:35,354
Tima! Grab my hand!

649
01:37:35,946 --> 01:37:40,607
<i>- I'm Kenichi. Who are you?
- Who are you?</i>

650
01:37:40,825 --> 01:37:45,651
<i>No, no, no. You call yourself "I."</i>

651
01:37:45,912 --> 01:37:47,371
Kenichi!

652
01:37:48,915 --> 01:37:50,539
Grab on!

653
01:37:51,208 --> 01:37:53,580
I am who?

654
01:38:01,176 --> 01:38:04,212
Tima!

655
01:39:52,062 --> 01:39:55,727
Where did you find this?

656
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:12,197
Fifi?

657
01:40:14,582 --> 01:40:16,374
Fifi!

658
01:40:54,366 --> 01:40:56,857
Kenichi!

659
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:00,820
Uncle!

660
01:41:18,638 --> 01:41:20,180
Uncle...

661
01:41:21,182 --> 01:41:24,764
...I think I'd like
to stay here a bit longer.

662
01:42:38,289 --> 01:42:41,206
<i>I am who?</i>
