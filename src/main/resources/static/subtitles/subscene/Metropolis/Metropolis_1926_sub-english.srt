1
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:17,801
All that survive of the original
"Metropolis" are an incomplete copy

2
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:20,839
of the negative and shortened
and re-edited release prints.

3
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:26,564
Over a quarter of the film
is now considered lost.

4
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:29,839
The present version, which combines
all of the surviving elements,

5
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:33,323
attempts to recreate the film

6
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,006
as it was shown at its premiere.

7
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,246
The intertitles have been reproduced
in their original form.

8
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:45,326
Intertitles in a different typeface
(like this one)

9
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:50,361
Have been added to summarize
the plot of the missing sections.

10
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:54,400
Black film stock indicates shorter
sections of missing footage.

11
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:09,966
Epigram: The mediator between brain
and hands must be the heart!

12
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:17,518
Shift change.

13
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:32,964
Deep below

14
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:38,075
the earth's surface

15
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:43,241
lay the workers' city.

16
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:43,077
As deep as lay

17
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:47,325
the workers' city below the earth,
so high above it towered

18
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:51,406
the complex named the "Club of the Sons,"

19
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:55,440
with its lecture halls and libraries,
its theaters and stadiums.

20
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:34,807
Fathers for whom every revolution
of a machine wheel meant gold

21
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:38,004
Fathers for whom every revolution
of a machine wheel meant gold

22
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:42,484
had created for their sons
the miracle of the Eternal Gardens.

23
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:02,000
"Which of you ladies shall today
have the honor

24
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:06,040
of entertaining Master Freder,
Joh Fredersen's son?"

25
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:22,926
"Look! These are your brothers!"

26
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:28,126
"Look...!"

27
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:38,198
"These are your brothers!"

28
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,318
"Who- was that?"

29
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:58,405
But this is what happened to Freder
- son of Joh Fredersen,

30
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:02,998
master of Metropolis - when he went
in search of the girl:

31
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:03,726
"To the new Tower of Babel -
to my father-!"

32
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:41,880
"Why is it, Josaphat,
that I learn of the explosion

33
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:45,840
from my son,
and not from you...!"

34
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:56,524
"The details...!"

35
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:10,001
"What were you doing
in the machine halls, Freder?"

36
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:16,520
"I wanted to look into the faces
of the people whose little children

37
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,956
are my brothers, my sisters..."

38
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:48,116
"Your magnificent city, Father
- and you the brain of this city -

39
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,920
and all of us in the city's light..."

40
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:21,160
"...and where are the people, father,
whose hands built your city... - ?"

41
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:30,766
"Where they belong..."

42
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:42,126
"...In the depths?"

43
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:54,522
"What if one day those in the depths
rise up against you?"

44
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,920
"The chief foreman
of the Heart Machine, Grot -

45
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:30,003
with an important message..."

46
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:54,882
"Two more of those damned plans,
Mr. Fredersen..."

47
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:37,239
"...in the pockets of two men involved
involved in today's accident

48
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:39,005
at the M-Machine..."

49
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:56,799
"Why is it, Josaphat, that these plans
were brought to me by Grot,

50
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:58,923
and not by you?"

51
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:26,717
"Apply to the G-Bank
for your remaining wages..."

52
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:28,480
"Father, do you know what it means
to be dismissed by you?

53
00:26:28,527 --> 00:26:32,440
- It means: Go below! - Father!
- Go below! Into the depths...!"

54
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:35,961
"Do you know what it means to be dismissed
like that by Joh Fredersen?"

55
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:07,046
"Would you like to come with me,
Josaphat?"

56
00:28:34,287 --> 00:28:39,281
"Where do you live, Josaphat?"
Freder asked,

57
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:44,037
and noted:
Block 99, House 7, 7th Floor.

58
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:56,480
"Go home, Josaphat,
and wait for me...

59
00:28:56,527 --> 00:29:00,440
I still have a long way
to go tonight..."

60
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:07,722
"Into the depths,
- to be with my brothers..."

61
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:22,115
"Beginning today I wish to be kept
informed of every step taken by my son..."

62
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:37,598
"Brother..."

63
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:57,602
"...the machine!
Someone has to stay at the machine!"

64
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:06,364
"Someone will
stay at the machine..."

65
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,682
"ME"

66
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:20,442
"Listen to me...
I want to trade lives with you!"

67
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:27,876
Meanwhile, the Thin Man,
Joh Fredersen's spy, is watching the spot

68
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:32,717
where Freder's chauffeur
has parked his car.

69
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:42,836
Block 99, House 7, 7th Floor.

70
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:52,046
"Wait for me- both of you..."

71
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:20,201
The Thin Man watches Freder's car
drive off.

72
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:24,957
Worker 11811 has shown the chauffeur
the note with Josaphat's address...

73
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:28,722
But 11811 betrays his promise.
Finding money, lots of money,

74
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:32,237
in Freder's clothes,
he succumbs

75
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:35,757
to the temptations of the city
and the night...

76
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:40,000
Instead of going
to Josaphat's apartment,

77
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:45,405
he has himself driven to Yoshiwara,
Metropolis's entertainment district.

78
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:46,207
In the middle of Metropolis
is a strange house,

79
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:49,643
In the middle of Metropolis
is a strange house,

80
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,759
overlooked by the centuries.

81
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:04,201
Here lives Rotwang, the inventor.

82
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:34,878
In a high, gloomy room of the old house,
Joh Fredersen waits for Rotwang.

83
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:41,475
He notices a small alcove concealed
by a curtain. He draws it open.

84
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:44,241
There, on a pedestal as wide as a wall
and as tall as a man,

85
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:48,075
he sees the stone head of a woman.

86
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:59,477
"Joh Fredersen's eyes fall on the words
engraved on the pedestal."

87
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:03,720
HEL BORN FOR MY HAPPINESS
AND MANKIND'S BLESSING.

88
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:09,478
LOST TO JOH FREDERSEN DIED GIVING BIRTH
TO FREDER, JOH FREDERSEN'S SON.

89
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:16,761
Rotwang has silently entered the room
with the monument.

90
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:20,720
Furious, he tears closed the curtain
in front of the bust.

91
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:25,722
The angrier Rotwang becomes,
the calmer grows Joh Fredersen.

92
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:29,926
"A brain like yours, Rotwang,"
he says to the raving man,

93
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,481
"should be able to forget..."

94
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:38,357
"Only once in my life
did I forget anything:

95
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,240
That Hel was a woman,
and you a man..."

96
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,919
"Let the dead rest in peace,
Rotwang...

97
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,925
For you, as for me,
she is dead..."

98
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:00,036
"For me, she is not dead,
Joh Fredersen,

99
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:01,076
- for me, she lives...!"

100
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:08,162
"Do you think that losing a hand
is too high a price

101
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:11,199
to pay for re-creating Hel-?!"

102
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:21,486
"Do you want to see her-?!"

103
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:22,360
"So, Joh Fredersen-?!
Isn't it worth the loss of a hand

104
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:27,117
to have created the man of the future,
the Machine-Man-?!"

105
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:39,401
"Give me another 24 hours-,
and no one, Joh Fredersen,

106
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:43,156
no one will be able to tell a Machine-Man
from a mortal...!"

107
00:37:57,247 --> 00:38:02,799
"The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen!
The son of Hel was yours!"

108
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:17,362
"And what brings you to me,
Joh Fredersen?"

109
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,323
"As usual,
when my experts fail me,

110
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,359
I come to you for advice..."

111
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:44,082
"For months now, we have been finding
these plans in my workers' clothes.

112
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:47,119
What do they mean?"

113
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:25,882
"...at two... at the end of the shift!
She has summoned us again..."

114
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:55,235
"Father-! Father-!
Will ten hours never end...??!!"

115
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:28,042
"-It is a plan of the 2000-year-old
catacombs deep below the lowest levels

116
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:31,079
of your Metropolis..."

117
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:12,840
"I should like to know what my
workers are doing in the catacombs..."

118
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:31,604
"Today I will tell you

119
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:35,276
the legend of THE TOWER OF BABEL..."

120
00:45:35,327 --> 00:45:40,526
The legend of THE TOWER OF BABEL.

121
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:54,197
"Come, let us build us a tower
whose top may reach unto the stars!"

122
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:03,160
"And on the top of the tower
we will write the words:

123
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:07,200
Great is the world and its creator!
And great is man!"

124
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:31,475
...but the minds that had conceived
the Tower of Babel could not build it.

125
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:36,396
The task was too great.
So they hired hands for wages.

126
00:46:53,007 --> 00:46:58,001
But the hands that built
the Tower of Babel knew nothing

127
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,962
of the dream of the brain
that had conceived it.

128
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:34,443
One man's hymns of praise
became other men's curses.

129
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:53,117
People spoke the same language,
but could not understand each other...

130
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:08,720
GREAT IS THE WORLD AND ITS CREATOR,
AND GREAT IS MAN

131
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:27,126
"HEAD and HANDS
need a mediator."

132
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:35,437
"THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD
AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!"

133
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:08,122
"But where is our mediator, Maria-?"

134
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:32,322
"Wait for him!
He will surely come!"

135
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:51,842
"We will wait, Maria...!
But not much longer...!"

136
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:31,282
"Oh mediator, have you finally come?"

137
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:38,722
"You called me - - here I am!"

138
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:14,875
"Rotwang, give the Machine-Man
the likeness of that girl."

139
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:27,560
"I shall sow discord
between them and her!

140
00:52:27,607 --> 00:52:31,600
I shall destroy their belief
in this woman..."

141
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:01,117
"Leave me alone now,
Joh Fredersen...

142
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:04,159
You will find the way back
without me..."

143
00:53:29,087 --> 00:53:35,003
"You fool! Now you will lose the one
remaining thing you have from Hel -

144
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:37,038
your son!

145
00:53:59,047 --> 00:54:03,006
"Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!"

146
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:27,926
End of the prelude.

147
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:32,126
Intermezzo.

148
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:12,763
Feder sees a monk
in the pulpit who preaches: "Verily,

149
00:59:12,807 --> 00:59:16,800
I say unto you, the days spoken
of in the Apocalypse are nigh!"

150
00:59:17,047 --> 00:59:21,006
The monk's hand points to the Bible,
in which is written:

151
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:26,241
"And I saw a woman
sit upon a scarlet colored beast,

152
00:59:26,287 --> 00:59:30,041
full of names of blasphemy,
having seven heads and ten horns...

153
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:33,716
...And the woman was arrayed
in purple and scarlet color,

154
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:36,804
having a golden cup in her hand...

155
00:59:37,047 --> 00:59:40,722
...And upon her forehead
was a name written, mystery,

156
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:44,521
Babylon the Great, the mother
of abominations of the earth."

157
00:59:44,927 --> 00:59:48,522
In Rotwang's laboratory
the Machine-Man sits,

158
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:52,560
looking like an Egyptian deity.
Light streams from above.

159
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:55,599
Rotwang takes its hands
and speaks to it:

160
00:59:55,847 --> 01:00:01,319
"You will destroy Joh Fredersen -
him and his city and his son."

161
01:00:49,887 --> 01:00:53,800
"If you had come earlier,
you wouldn't have scared me...

162
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:57,840
But now I beg you: Stay away from me
and my beloved...!"

163
01:01:10,327 --> 01:01:13,956
Disappointed that Maria has not come,
Freder goes to Josaphat's home,

164
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:16,999
where he hopes to find Worker 11811.

165
01:01:17,247 --> 01:01:21,240
But after his night in Yoshiwara,
11811 was caught by the Thin Man

166
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:24,006
and sent back to his machine.

167
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:27,239
"I must go,
"Freder tells Josaphat.

168
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:30,996
"I must look on my own for the person
to whom 11811 was supposed to lead me."

169
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:35,559
Soon after Freder leaves,
the Thin Man forces his way

170
01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:39,600
into Josaphat's apartment and tries
to get him to leave Metropolis...

171
01:01:39,847 --> 01:01:42,884
He tries to bribe him,
then threatens him,

172
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:46,920
but Josaphat cannot stop thinking
of the man who trusts him...

173
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:56,876
In Josaphat's apartment a fight breaks
out between Josaphat and the Thin Man.

174
01:01:56,927 --> 01:01:58,918
Josaphat is overpowered.

175
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:56,115
"Come! It is time to give
the Machine-Man your face!"

176
01:10:22,007 --> 01:10:25,966
"Where is Maria-?!"

177
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:35,602
"She is with your father..."

178
01:10:51,727 --> 01:10:56,482
"I tell you,
she is with your father... - !"

179
01:11:22,447 --> 01:11:26,122
"I want you to visit those in the depths,
in order to destroy the work

180
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,806
of the woman in whose image
you were created!"

181
01:14:55,367 --> 01:15:00,202
In Freder's delirium the Thin Man appears
to him as the monk in the cathedral.

182
01:15:01,887 --> 01:15:06,961
The Thin Man in the form of a monk
preaches: "Verily, I say unto you,

183
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,999
the days spoken of
in the Apocalypse are nigh...!"

184
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:52,001
The Thin Man in the form of a monk
shows Freder the verse in the Bible:

185
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:55,683
"And the woman was arrayed
in purple and scarlet color

186
01:15:55,727 --> 01:15:58,719
having a golden cup in her hand..."

187
01:16:00,647 --> 01:16:07,325
"For her- all seven deadly sins!"**

188
01:16:53,487 --> 01:16:58,242
"Death descends upon the city... - !"

189
01:17:09,607 --> 01:17:14,317
End of intermezzo

190
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:19,158
Furioso

191
01:17:24,967 --> 01:17:32,920
The Book of Revelations

192
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:54,724
"I put on this disguise to escape
from the Thin Man... But for ten days

193
01:17:54,767 --> 01:17:59,045
your father's spy has been making
even the workers' city risky..."

194
01:18:01,327 --> 01:18:05,320
The Thin Man reports to Fredersen
in his office:

195
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:09,201
"Only their hope for a mediator
is keeping the workers in check."

196
01:18:09,447 --> 01:18:13,725
Josaphat relates to Freder
more of the strange events

197
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:18,158
after his collapse:
"On the evening you fell sick..."

198
01:18:30,007 --> 01:18:34,762
"...once the best of friends...
because of that woman..."

199
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:45,002
"...the other man...
the same evening..."

200
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:58,515
"The Eternal Gardens lie abandoned...
but night after night in Yoshiwara..."

201
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:47,160
"And this woman,
at whose feet all sins are heaped..."

202
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:51,723
"...is also named Maria..."

203
01:19:59,647 --> 01:20:03,640
"The same woman
who those in the depths

204
01:20:03,687 --> 01:20:05,996
look up to as a saint...?!"

205
01:20:11,647 --> 01:20:15,481
Freder reminds Josaphat:
"Many now go to the city of the dead,

206
01:20:15,527 --> 01:20:19,520
to a woman who has proven herself
as true as gold...

207
01:20:19,807 --> 01:20:24,483
...But the mediator must appear!"

208
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:37,279
"Whatever happens tonight," Fredersen
instructs the Thin Man in his office,

209
01:20:37,327 --> 01:20:38,885
"it is my express order
to let the workers do as they will..."

210
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:50,766
"Joh Fredersen wants
to let those in the depths use force

211
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:55,835
and do wrong, so that he can claim
the right to use force against them...

212
01:21:06,927 --> 01:21:11,955
"When you spoke
you spoke of peace, Maria...

213
01:21:12,007 --> 01:21:17,286
Today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen
is inciting them to rebel against him..."

214
01:21:45,487 --> 01:21:50,242
"She will destroy
their belief in a mediator!"

215
01:22:13,447 --> 01:22:16,723
"You know that I have always spoken
that I have always spoken of peace...

216
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:19,804
but your mediator has not come..."

217
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:49,482
"You have waited long enough!
Your time has come-!"

218
01:22:55,887 --> 01:23:00,802
"...but I have tricked Joh Fredersen!
Your double does not obey his will -

219
01:23:00,847 --> 01:23:03,839
only mine!"

220
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:18,875
"Who is the living food
for the machines in Metropolis-?!"

221
01:23:23,287 --> 01:23:29,635
"Who lubricates the machine
joints with their own blood-?!"

222
01:23:43,927 --> 01:23:48,682
"Who feeds the machines
with their own flesh...?!"

223
01:23:55,167 --> 01:24:01,515
"Let the machines starve,
you fools-! Let them die-!!"

224
01:24:04,647 --> 01:24:09,402
"Kill them- the machines-!!"

225
01:24:22,647 --> 01:24:27,402
"You are not Maria-!!!"

226
01:24:30,847 --> 01:24:34,806
"YOU ARE NOT MARIA-!"

227
01:24:48,727 --> 01:24:51,446
"Maria speaks of peace,
not killing-!

228
01:24:51,487 --> 01:24:53,478
This is not Maria-!!"

229
01:24:57,167 --> 01:25:01,922
"Joh Fredersen's son-!!"

230
01:25:04,327 --> 01:25:10,675
"Kill him, the dog,
in his white silken fur-!!!"

231
01:25:40,487 --> 01:25:45,402
"Get your women, your sons, from the
workers' city! Let no one stay behind!

232
01:25:45,447 --> 01:25:48,439
Death to the machines-!!!"

233
01:25:58,367 --> 01:26:02,360
In the attic with Maria,
Rotwang grows ever more intoxicated

234
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:06,320
by his triumph over Fredersen.

235
01:26:06,567 --> 01:26:10,480
"...and I tricked Joh Fredersen
twice over-! For I concealed from him

236
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:14,520
that his son wants to be your
brothers' mediator - and loves you-!"

237
01:26:14,767 --> 01:26:17,759
Maria is not the only one
listening to Rotwang.

238
01:26:17,807 --> 01:26:21,277
Outside the attic window
Joh Fredersen has been eavesdropping...

239
01:26:46,447 --> 01:26:50,406
"...faithful after all..."

240
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:59,165
Joh Fredersen
breaks into Rotwang's attic.

241
01:26:59,567 --> 01:27:03,560
He battles with his old rival,
overcoming him. Maria is free.

242
01:27:39,407 --> 01:27:44,162
"Women and men, let no one miss today-!
Death to the machines-!!"

243
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:31,082
"Not one man-
or woman remained behind-!"

244
01:29:57,367 --> 01:30:02,236
The mob storms the M-Machine
and rushes toward the Heart Machine,

245
01:30:02,287 --> 01:30:05,279
the power house of Metropolis.

246
01:30:05,527 --> 01:30:12,046
Grot closes the gates
and tries to notify Fredersen.

247
01:30:54,607 --> 01:30:59,362
"Open the gates!"

248
01:31:04,287 --> 01:31:09,042
"Open the gates, I said!"

249
01:31:09,927 --> 01:31:12,885
Grot warns Fredersen:
"If the Heart Machine is destroyed,

250
01:31:12,927 --> 01:31:16,203
the entire machine district
will end up in ruins."

251
01:31:17,567 --> 01:31:20,798
Finally Grot obeys Joh Fredersen's order
and opens the gates.

252
01:31:20,847 --> 01:31:23,839
The workers race
to the Heart Machine. *

253
01:31:41,487 --> 01:31:47,164
"Have you gone mad-??
If the Heart Machine is destroyed,

254
01:31:47,207 --> 01:31:50,199
the entire workers' city
will be flooded-!!"

255
01:37:25,487 --> 01:37:30,242
"Do you know that your son
is with the workers?"

256
01:38:29,207 --> 01:38:33,962
"Yes... you!
You are Maria-!"

257
01:38:40,367 --> 01:38:44,360
"To the air shafts- quickly!
Quickly! The reservoirs have burst!

258
01:38:44,407 --> 01:38:46,716
The city is flooding-!"

259
01:39:28,767 --> 01:39:32,442
At the upper end of the shaft
a metal fence blocks the children's path.

260
01:39:32,487 --> 01:39:34,478
More and more children press forward.
Panic threatens.

261
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:38,242
Freder and Josaphat scale the outside
of the stair railing and hurl

262
01:39:38,287 --> 01:39:40,243
themselves against the bars.

263
01:39:46,927 --> 01:39:51,205
Finally Freder and Josaphat succeed
in breaking down the metal gate.

264
01:39:55,567 --> 01:40:00,595
Freder climbs back down
to get Maria and the last of the children.

265
01:41:09,487 --> 01:41:14,242
"We'll take the children
to the Club of the Sons!"

266
01:41:25,127 --> 01:41:29,882
"Why are all the lights out?"

267
01:41:51,767 --> 01:41:56,522
"I must know!
Where is my son?!!!"

268
01:41:59,527 --> 01:42:03,122
"Tomorrow thousands will ask
in fury and desperation:

269
01:42:03,167 --> 01:42:05,886
Joh Fredersen, where is my son-!"

270
01:42:48,887 --> 01:42:52,846
"Where are your children??!"

271
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:07,355
"The city lies underwater,
the shafts are completely flooded-!!"

272
01:43:13,887 --> 01:43:19,564
"Who told you to attack
the machines, you idiots?

273
01:43:19,647 --> 01:43:22,639
Without them you'll all die!!"

274
01:43:28,607 --> 01:43:33,362
"It's the witch's fault-!"

275
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:49,315
"Let's all watch
as the world goes to the devil!"

276
01:44:14,327 --> 01:44:18,559
"Find the witch,
this is all her fault-!

277
01:44:18,687 --> 01:44:20,678
Strike her dead-!!"

278
01:45:15,847 --> 01:45:19,840
In front of Hel's monument
Rotwang decides:

279
01:45:19,887 --> 01:45:22,117
"Now I'm going to take you home,
my Hel!"

280
01:45:38,407 --> 01:45:43,481
Maria leads the last of the children
to safety in the Club of the Sons.

281
01:45:45,607 --> 01:45:49,885
Then she is spotted
by Grot and the mob.

282
01:45:52,727 --> 01:45:59,075
"The witch-! The witch-!
There she is-! There she is-!"

283
01:46:01,727 --> 01:46:08,075
"Where are our children,
you witch-??!"

284
01:46:15,327 --> 01:46:21,675
"Burn the witch. -
To the stake with her!!!"

285
01:46:21,767 --> 01:46:24,759
Suspecting nothing,
Maria tries to speak.

286
01:46:24,807 --> 01:46:27,480
But the mob roars
and throws hammers at her.

287
01:46:27,527 --> 01:46:30,997
Maria is hit. Only at the last minute
does she escape

288
01:46:31,047 --> 01:46:34,039
the mob's wrath.

289
01:46:56,927 --> 01:47:02,001
Maria, pursued by the mob, runs headlong
into the revellers from Yoshiwara.

290
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:25,722
"To the stake with her-!"

291
01:49:33,887 --> 01:49:38,642
"Hel-! My Hel-!!"

292
01:52:45,087 --> 01:52:49,842
"Your children... saved...!!!"

293
01:56:30,807 --> 01:56:35,278
"Head and hands want to join together
but they don't have the heart

294
01:56:35,327 --> 01:56:39,559
to do it... Oh mediator,
show them the way to each other..."

295
01:57:17,687 --> 01:57:26,436
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD
AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!

296
01:57:26,487 --> 01:57:30,560
THE END.
