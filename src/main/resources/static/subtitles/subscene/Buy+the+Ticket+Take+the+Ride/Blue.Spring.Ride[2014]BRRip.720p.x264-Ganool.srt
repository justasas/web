1
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,000
"Our adolescence is the season of love."

2
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,610
...is what everyone says.

3
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,180
Our hearts flutter. We feel restless.
And we're curious about boys.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,030
Yes, we fall for someone.

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,080
That is the greatest mission for us girls.

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,800
But for girls, life is more complicated than just love.

7
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,550
And that's why...

8
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,020
I focus on friends instead.

9
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,260
Futaba!

10
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,600
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,780
Long time no see!

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,250
Your seat is here.

13
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,840
- Here?
- Right behind me! Lucky!

14
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,910
Isn't she cute?

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,210
- She's cute!
- Right?

16
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,740
Who is it?

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,710
What was her name?

18
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,720
H-Hold on... Yoshioka. It's Yoshioka.

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,370
- Yoshioka?
- Yoshioka.

20
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,270
Our eyes met!

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,610
- Go talk to her!
- Me?

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,250
Hey!

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,650
- Oh, there it is.
- What are you doing?

24
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,470
Thaaat's not going to work.

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,850
- Isn't that Makita Yuuri? The girl you mentioned?

26
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,120
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,690
Hey, Makita. You were in class 1-5, right?

29
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,870
You were Mikami's friend, too.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,110
He said there was a really cute girl named Makita in class 1-5.

31
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,890
I'm not that cute!

32
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,110
That was so cute just now!

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,860
He even said she's--

34
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,080
Did you see those puppy dog eyes?

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,430
Why do guys like girls like Makita Yuuri?

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,220
It's like... she's stupid, or simple...

37
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,440
It's not like she's cute enough to say it, right?

38
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,720
Futaba, if you put a little work into being girly, you'd be popular.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,970
Actually, you're just not feminine enough.

40
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,360
It's fine, it's fine!

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,820
I'm bad with boys, anyway.

42
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,970
- What's with that way of putting it?
- Right?

43
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,640
Futaba, have you been in love with someone before?

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,610
No! Never!

45
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,410
Hey, don't laugh! Don't laugh!

46
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,520
I just lied to them.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,150
I think friends come first.

48
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,530
But this is the second year of high school!

49
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,940
In truth...

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,590
You've got no manners.

51
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,270
Tanaka-kun?

52
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,640
Huh? He's the transfer student in our class, right?

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,740
What is it, Futaba?

54
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,160
Sorry, go on ahead!

55
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,630
Hey!

56
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,790
- Tanaka-kun!
- Mabuchi!

57
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,680
- Hey.
- "Mabuchi"?

58
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,510
- School supplies?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,130
Then I guess I'll go with you.

60
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,280
That was close!

61
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,830
Somehow... I thought he looked like

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,240
the Tanaka-kun I knew when I was 13.

63
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,120
The rain started pretty suddenly, didn't it?

64
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,880
Tanaka-kun?

65
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,820
My name is Mabuchi.

66
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm sorry! I made a mistake.

67
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,050
The rain started pretty suddenly, didn't it?

68
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
I knew it!

69
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,570
You're Tanaka-kun! Tanaka Kou-k--

70
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,760
I'm telling you, my name is Mabuchi.

71
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm Mabuchi Kou now.

72
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,910
My parents got divorced.

73
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,070
I've been in Nagasaki ever since.

74
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,680
You're as dull as ever, aren't you?

75
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,900
I wondered when you'd figure it out.

76
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,740
Yeah, but... Tanaka-kun...

77
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,100
- you're completely different from bef--

78
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,100
- Again, I'm Mabuchi.

79
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,900
Well, how about a reunion hug?

80
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,090
I won't! I will not do that!

81
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,300
Tanaka-kun wouldn't sa--

82
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,540
He's gone.

83
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Huh?

84
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,650
Tanaka Kou isn't here anymore.

85
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,790
Why has he changed that much?

86
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,720
Tanaka-kun wasn't the type to come on so strong...

87
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,320
He smiled a lot, and was very kind.

88
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,180
The rain started pretty suddenly, didn't it?

89
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,320
Ever since then,

90
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,510
whenever our eyes met, we'd look away.

91
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,330
What's going on?

92
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,300
Cops and robbers. Want to join?

93
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,430
Girls are playing, too?

94
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,240
...and look again.

95
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,310
And in the first summer vacation of middle school...

96
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:29,340
Summer Festival</i>

97
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,390
7 o'clock.

98
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,810
At the clock in Sankaku Park.

99
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,390
7 o'clock.

100
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
At the clock...

101
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,700
in Sankaku Park.

102
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,670
I'm pretty sure that's what I heard.

103
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,750
But...

104
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,600
Tanaka-kun never came.

105
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,010
He never came to Sankaku Park, or to the festival.

106
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,970
Just like that, he never came.

107
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,750
Not even to school when the new semester started.

108
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,870
It'd be better if you had a bag, right?

109
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,210
It looks like I'm all out right now, hold on. Sorry!

110
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,660
It's okay!

111
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,150
Hey, you!

112
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,510
Hold on! Money!

113
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,160
Money!

114
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,240
I paid, though.

115
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,660
Don't try to fool me.

116
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,510
You were just trying to run off.

117
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,930
No!

118
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,930
Seriously, what a slimy person.

119
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,150
Hey, someone call the discipline officer!

120
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,930
No... I did, right?

121
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,210
Give it up, Futaba.

122
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,150
Just apologize and pay her.

123
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,310
Uh...

124
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
- Um...
- She paid.

125
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,850
Huh?

126
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,310
I saw it, too.

127
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,220
Get out of my way.

128
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,240
Mabuchi is right. I saw it, too!

129
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Yeah?

130
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,950
She paid me just a second ago.

131
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,550
- What? Did she?
- Yeah.

132
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,710
How could I have known? Then you can go.

133
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,040
You're so mean, old lady.

134
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,350
Terrible.

135
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,880
Are you letting out your stress?

136
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,840
That's not what you should be saying.

137
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,580
You lot, and you too.

138
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,080
Apologize.

139
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,360
S-s-s-sorry.

140
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,560
Excuse me!

141
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,980
Thank you.

142
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,610
It's nothing.

143
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,860
That wasn't right no matter how you think about it.

144
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,370
Yeah.

145
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,960
But you got mad for my sake, so I feel better.

146
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,660
If something that small makes you
feel better, then you come cheap.

147
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,580
Being like that would make your friendships come cheap, too.

148
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,240
Friendships are more important to me, anyway.

149
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,110
That would be making pretend friends.

150
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,300
They're trivial.

151
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,370
Mabuchi! Mabudachi!

152
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,370
[pun - mabudachi means "a close friend"]</i>

153
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,080
Thanks to you,

154
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,390
I got to talk to Murao Shuuko!

155
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,620
Thanks!

156
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,660
But... even if they're pretend friends,

157
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,190
it's a lot better than being on my own.

158
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,090
Hey.

159
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,340
If you'd like...

160
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,320
Thank you!

161
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,650
I'm sorry about back then.

162
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,360
I was the closest to you, and even saw it...

163
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,530
It's okay! It's fine!

164
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,390
But thanks for this.

165
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,650
It looks good!

166
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,710
Hey, why are you getting involved with someone like her?

167
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,500
Eating her bentou on her own is so strange.

168
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,000
Wouldn't it be nice if the boys talked to her?

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And you know, a heart being on that cake...

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,470
is so pathetic.

171
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,460
["itai" - "hurt" has been taking on a slang meaning]</i>

172
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,960
Seriously.

173
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,530
She's just putting on a cute act for the boys.

174
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,260
- She's pretty sly.
- Isn't she?

175
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,890
Being like that would make your friendships come cheap, too.

176
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,260
But being sly...

177
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,740
wouldn't that just mean that you want people to care about you?

178
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,020
If so, maybe we should act that way, too.

179
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,720
That's not the point.

180
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,970
I just hate girls like her.

181
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,260
If you hate her, you can just ignore her.

182
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,760
You're just so envious of her you can't ignore her!

183
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,800
What is this? I'm in such a bad mood now.

184
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,420
Where are your friends?

185
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,270
Tanaka-kun, you... !

186
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,730
Is it my fault?

187
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,980
No.

188
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,320
It's my own.

189
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,750
I was venting just now.

190
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,010
Sorry.

191
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,750
Actually...

192
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,570
in middle school...

193
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,870
just like Yuuri right now...

194
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,410
I was left out.

195
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,420
After you were gone,

196
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,000
I was always alone.

197
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,990
That's why

198
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,790
I thought I'd make high school better.

199
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,410
I have been...

200
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,230
lying to myself.

201
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,530
So that I can get along with people.

202
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,100
And that's why...

203
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,860
things ended this easily.

204
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,430
-- homework isn't done!

205
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,950
Seriously? It's due tomorrow!

206
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,720
Hurry up and finish!

207
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,990
Look at that.

208
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,100
Don't get all flirty in the school.

209
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,880
Are you stupid? Nothing is over yet.

210
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,420
You haven't even started yet, have you?

211
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,540
Also, give it a rest. Stop calling me Tanaka.

212
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,290
Kou!

213
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,210
You're dropping the honorific that suddenly?

214
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,050
Thank you!

215
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,280
The 5 students selected as the class leaders

216
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
are expected every year

217
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,060
to participate in the spring's leader orientation.

218
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,190
Tanaka-sensei will explain the details of the orientation.

219
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,240
Okay.

220
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,280
In Leader Orientation, the leaders of each class lodge together

221
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,540
to strengthen their interpersonal networks

222
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,170
and create a plan for the year's events.

223
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,060
The athletic festival, school festival, field trips...

224
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,300
One year of life in high school is busy and will pass quickly,

225
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,000
but what kind of life it will be is up to you all.

226
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,210
On that note, is there anyone who is up to the task?

227
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,810
Right.

228
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,810
I haven't even started anything yet.

229
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,070
In that case, I have to try starting something!

230
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,750
Yes!

231
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,970
Yes! I'll do it too.

232
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,670
I will, too.

233
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,360
Yes, yes! I will also do it!

234
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,800
And Mabuchi-kun, too!

235
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,570
- Hey, what are--
- I already said it!

236
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,580
Seriously?

237
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,290
For two days, starting today,

238
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,120
you will be sleeping and eating
together as part of Leader Orientation.

239
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,970
Listen up. You are preparing to be able
to help everyone in your classes.

240
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,490
Okay!

241
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,980
- I'll carry that! Your hands will get dirty.

242
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,980
- I'm wearing gloves so I'll be fine.

243
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,030
Thank you.

244
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,810
I know the thing that you're hiding, Sensei.

245
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,720
Hm?

246
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
The mole in your double eyelid.

247
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,280
This?

248
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,600
You're the first one to realize it, Murao.

249
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,690
Then... don't tell anyone but me about it.

250
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,870
Ever.

251
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,090
I can't make a promise like that.

252
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,830
Here, head back over to where everyone else is.

253
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,380
Mabuchi.

254
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,690
What was that?

255
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,610
Wouldn't it be... that?

256
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,320
Hey, help me... with this.

257
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,830
You can handle that just fine, Yoshioka.

258
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,120
Ow!

259
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,670
You alright?

260
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,350
It's okay, I'll do it. Have a seat.

261
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,580
Thank you.

262
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,980
What's with him?

263
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,400
Kominato-kun, carry the firewood.

264
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,960
And at tonight's meeting, we're going over 
"the significance of school events"

265
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,190
so we'll all do the sheet together.

266
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,630
Murao-san! Later on--

267
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,370
I have a bit of a headache.

268
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,860
Are you alright, Yoshioka-san?

269
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,930
I'm Kikuchi from class 6.

270
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,170
Class 2 seems to be difficult.

271
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,190
Yeah.

272
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,390
But I volunteered to do it, so...

273
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,580
It's one of those "if I don't give it my all, what then?" things.

274
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,340
I don't think carrying all of the burden is all there is to leadership, though.

275
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,930
I'll carry these, okay?

276
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,460
Class 6.

277
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,440
Yes.

278
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,100
The significance of school events

279
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,860
is to set up plans for events that cannot
be completed except as a group.

280
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,700
We need to improve the sense of belonging that everyone has.

281
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,530
In relation to the sense of self, doing things with others

282
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,030
will help reshape each person's
position, responsibility, and behavior.

283
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,670
If we consider that the desired result of the events,
then this will lead us to far better school events.

284
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,560
- Crap...

285
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,910
Wonderful!

286
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,210
Then next will be class 2.

287
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,080
Yes.

288
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,170
Uh...

289
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,680
The goal of school events...

290
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,480
is...

291
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,340
is...

292
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,800
to create memories... of fun times.

293
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,910
That's all.

294
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,150
Are you an elementary student?

295
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,830
You came up with that yourself, right?

296
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,900
Class 2 is starting out like that, then.

297
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,810
Today you will have no free time. Be sure
you think of something together.

298
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,630
Present something before orientation ends.

299
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,880
Okay, class 4 next.

300
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,870
Yes.

301
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,850
The significance of school events

302
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,680
is to hold events that give us the ability to adapt to society--

303
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,760
Her writing is messy, too.

304
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,210
It's pretty.

305
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,250
It's hard to tell if it's morning or night.

306
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,590
Kind of like you.

307
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,540
Huh?

308
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,830
Whether you're mean

309
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,390
or kind.

310
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,650
I can't tell.

311
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,060
You're the same, aren't you?

312
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,830
Weak or strong-willed.

313
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,670
But I think...

314
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,680
being a leader is too much for me.

315
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,890
Isn't that just fine?

316
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,110
Nobody will be troubled if you feel defeated so soon.

317
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,720
I think that was good.

318
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,810
Creating memories of fun times.

319
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,070
School events are... you know.

320
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,780
Long after they're done, when you remember them,

321
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,290
and the things you experienced with everyone else...

322
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,730
It's just fine if you all make those happy memories.

323
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,940
Something like that.

324
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,310
I see.

325
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,840
Right!

326
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,440
Huh? Where's Futaba?

327
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,190
Oh, you did one.

328
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,300
Hey, do you know where Mabuchi went?

329
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,220
Hey now. Aren't you guys being too distant?

330
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,350
It's so pretty!

331
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,340
Here we are. The start of a new day.

332
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,310
Yeah.

333
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,090
I...

334
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,090
will never forget this sunrise we're all seeing together!

335
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,960
Me neither!

336
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,190
This is "Aoharu"! Aoharu.

337
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,820
We'll ride out adolescence together!

338
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:19,820
["aoharu" is another way to read "seishun", adolescence]</i>

339
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,610
Hey, you guys...

340
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,850
You're done if this makes you embarrassed.

341
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,380
Things like growing cold can wait until we're old men and women!

342
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,870
You don't seem like you'll change even
when you're an old man, Kominato-kun.

343
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,360
You're really loudmouthed in that way.

344
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,650
Hey, wait... can you not say loudmouthed?

345
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,120
Being called loudmouthed is painful. But right now--

346
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,210
Would these be pretend friendships, too?

347
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,860
After that, the leadership group fell under Kominato Rule.

348
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,150
Whether there's something to do or not,
we get together once per week.

349
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,640
We did say that, right?

350
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,610
You did all on your own.

351
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,700
Anyway, come without missing any.
Your attendance is too low.

352
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,470
Coming or not as you please...
are you a kindergartener?

353
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,730
Okay, on that note, just like it says

354
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,630
- there are meetings everywhere.

355
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,630
- You're all really at it.

356
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,320
Hey.

357
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,330
The orientation report for the school's newsletter...

358
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,490
I want to have one of you do it. Anyone?

359
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,160
I have cram school...

360
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,480
Then I'll--

361
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,980
Kou! You're good at writing, right?

362
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,300
Huh?

363
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,800
This is my chance to walk home with Shuuko. Let it happen.

364
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,730
I'll handle it.

365
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,720
- I've got it.
- Thanks.

366
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,560
No, if you do it, it will be like an elementary student did it.

367
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,600
I said I'll do it, so I'll do it.

368
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,550
No, your writing is messy too.

369
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,880
I can write clearly.

370
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,800
- You won't finish it before the end of the day.

371
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,990
- I will! Give it back!

372
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,990
- Forget it! Lend me your lead pencil.

373
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,470
- Futaba-chan.
- Hm?

374
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,870
What do you think of Mabuchi-kun?

375
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,490
I...

376
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,700
think I've fallen for him.

377
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,060
Oh, I see!

378
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,300
I have a feeling that you like him, too.

379
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,260
No, no, no, no!

380
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,470
We just went to the same middle
school. His attitude is so poor...

381
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,410
He has that air of, "Aren't I so cool for not putting in my all?"

382
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,120
So now I don't...

383
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,170
Just now?

384
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,160
Not then and not now.

385
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,050
Never. At all.

386
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,190
Really? That's good!

387
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,060
I was scared.

388
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,870
I had no idea what I'd do if you were a rival.

389
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,340
- I won't be! Oh, hey, you're going to be late for cram school.

390
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,340
Yeah.

391
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,730
Right,

392
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,460
it's not that I like him.

393
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,300
Just...

394
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,010
His bony hands...

395
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,520
and his fairly clear handwriting...

396
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,320
and being able to barely see his eyes behind his bangs...

397
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,140
these are all more interesting to me than they were before.

398
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,810
That's the same habit you had before!

399
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,060
Do you...

400
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,560
like me?

401
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,760
What are you--

402
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,740
That's not what I mean! You're so different from before

403
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,500
so I wonder why you've changed so much.

404
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,040
Sorry.

405
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,030
Don't try and find the old me.

406
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,770
That would be seriously annoying.

407
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,560
You'll be a loser forever if you clutch your memories like that.

408
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,240
I definitely do not like him!

409
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,600
- Where's Mabuchi?
- I made him go home.

410
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,060
Why are you here?

411
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,860
You said...

412
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,970
you're going to hand that in, and to go on ahead.

413
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,710
I meant for you to go on home, though.

414
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:22,100
Are you thinking that I thought I said
too much and would wait for you--

415
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,380
I'm not.

416
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,230
Well... whatever.

417
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,120
We're going.

418
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,110
I'm sorry, Yuuri.

419
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,130
I, too...

420
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,040
like Kou.

421
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,740
At first, seeing him again...

422
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,970
I thought that I didn't like the new Kou.

423
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,240
But I realized that I was lying to myself.

424
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,170
Thanks to you, Yuuri.

425
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,200
I knew it! You too, Futaba-chan.

426
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,770
I thought so.

427
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,730
Then... no matter who things go well for,

428
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,850
let's not hold it against each other, okay?

429
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,590
But I don't think it'll work out for me if it's you.

430
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,950
Yuuri...

431
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,510
Oh, I'm going to the bathroom.

432
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,500
I was... actually scared to say it.

433
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,400
I thought that if I said it...

434
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,970
I'd lose a precious friend I'd finally made.

435
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,720
But I also thought that I have to say it

436
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,990
precisely because she's a precious friend.

437
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,040
I'm back.

438
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:49,530
I'm feeling hungry... maybe we should eat something.

439
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,450
I like Tanaka-sensei.

440
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,680
Why are you... so suddenly...?

441
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,120
It's just...

442
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,290
I thought that I could say it if it were to you two.

443
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,540
Well, Mabuchi is the one who has to decide, though.

444
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,340
He might even turn you both down.

445
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,790
And if it goes well for one of you...

446
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,590
I'll always be neutral to both of you.

447
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,620
Both of you, do your best.

448
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,650
So you see... the problem is Tanaka-sensei, after all.

449
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,490
I don't understand the feelings of women who fall for older guys!

450
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,610
I'm the one who has tighter skin! Right?

451
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,890
Hey, are you listening?! Hey!

452
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,300
Hey, Kominato.

453
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,770
You're as loud as ever.

454
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,170
Stop messing around and study a little.

455
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,310
You'll bring down the number of graduates.

456
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,690
The guy next to him... he was at Nagasaki Seiran High.

457
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,520
Really? Coming here from that Seiran isn't special at all.

458
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,450
Did something happen?

459
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,230
- Like he couldn't keep up?
- Seiran isn't a big deal, either.

460
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,430
Hey.

461
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,770
You guys need to get a grip.

462
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,780
He had nothing to do with it.

463
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,540
And why are you the one getting mad?

464
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,310
What are you talking about?

465
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,160
If your friend were getting spoken
to like this, you'd be pissed too.

466
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,180
Get out of here.

467
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,720
Hey, let's go.

468
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,980
What's with him?

469
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,090
Kou!

470
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,260
What is it?

471
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,190
Nothing.

472
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,940
I...

473
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,950
have given up looking for the old Kou.

474
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,810
Huh?

475
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,990
I want to get to know the new Kou.

476
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,170
Everything that I don't know from the
4 years you were in Nagasaki.

477
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,030
Hey, why did you come back here?

478
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,140
This and that.

479
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,720
Are you living in the same place?

480
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,670
Yeah.

481
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,880
With your mom?

482
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,090
No.

483
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,890
- Why?
-It doesn't matter, does it?

484
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,890
It has nothing to do with you.

485
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,650
It doesn't have nothing to do with me!

486
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,200
Suddenly going away, and then suddenly reappearing...

487
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,340
There are actually so many things that I want to ask you!

488
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,260
I'm asking you because I haven't sorted it all out in my head yet!

489
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,360
Please just... don't step into other people's
space any more than you already have.

490
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,060
Sooo hot!

491
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,100
Is Kou ditching the meeting again?

492
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,910
Forget that... why in summer vacation, too?

493
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,280
And at your house.

494
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,210
You know, the festival and field trip are soon
after the new semester starts.

495
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,150
What will happen if we don't do this now?

496
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,410
I wonder if something happened to Mabuchi-kun.

497
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,910
He hasn't replied on LINE, either.

498
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,910
[Japanese messaging app]</i>

499
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,820
It's like he's avoiding us.

500
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,890
Tanaka, Mabuchi</i>

501
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,580
Yes!

502
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,490
Yoshioka!

503
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,310
Tanaka-sensei!

504
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,200
Why...?

505
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,350
Kou is actually... my little brother.

506
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,120
Your brother?!

507
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,470
We're trying to keep life simple at school

508
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,610
by keeping it secret from the students, though.

509
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,260
But I want to ask about Kou, too.

510
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,070
He shows you a little bit of expression, after all.

511
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,090
Here.

512
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,990
In his first year of middle school,

513
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,570
our parents divorced, and I stayed here with our dad.

514
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,460
Kou went to our mom's parents' place in Nagasaki with her.

515
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,000
Why did he come back here?

516
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,900
Last year... of an illness.

517
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,290
He came back here because of that.

518
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,470
I couldn't be with him when life was at its hardest.

519
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,120
How about some other family?

520
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,200
I'm the only one who can be with her right now.

521
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,530
Her lung cancer is progressing.

522
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,400
We can consider it to be in its final stages.

523
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,880
Her back pain is most likely due to her bones changing.

524
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,870
I'm sorry to say it, but...

525
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,520
The results seem to have been good.

526
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,970
Oh?

527
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,330
How is your back pain?

528
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,950
It's alright.

529
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,090
Don't worry about me. Get home and study.

530
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,340
Kou is hiding it,

531
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,800
but I might not make it.

532
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,770
If something happens, Youichi,

533
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,750
take care of Kou.

534
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,180
I...

535
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,170
couldn't handle seeing her emaciated body.

536
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,680
I made excuses like work, or Nagasaki being too far.

537
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,190
I pushed everything onto Kou.

538
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,040
I'm sorry!

539
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,620
But it seems...

540
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,900
Kou couldn't forgive himself for being unable to help.

541
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,880
Mom!

542
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,510
He got absorbed in other things,

543
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,090
and started thinking that he just isn't allowed to enjoy himself.

544
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,020
He's been

545
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:14,030
carrying feelings like that the whole time.

546
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,160
He's actually a kind, good guy.

547
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,020
That's why--

548
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,290
I know.

549
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,300
I know.

550
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,230
I see.

551
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,730
My brother told you.

552
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,530
When I left for Nagasaki,

553
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,170
I made him a promise.

554
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,440
A promise that I would take care of our mom.

555
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:27,360
I gave him my word that I'd support her. Like a child.

556
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,370
I put my all into my studies, too.

557
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,830
So she could live in comfort once I became a doctor.

558
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,540
I didn't even realize that she was ill.

559
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,920
It's laughable.

560
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,090
At the side of my mother growing thinner and thinner,

561
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:56,970
every day,

562
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,750
as if she were already prepared to leave this world...

563
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,330
what was I thinking?

564
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,910
You don't understand, do you?

565
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,440
You don't need to understand.

566
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,080
You get tired of a lot of things

567
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,090
when you find things important to you.

568
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,530
Kou!

569
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,900
I don't understand!

570
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,580
I don't... not one bit! But...

571
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,880
Is wanting to understand from the bottom of my heart not okay?

572
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,970
Being scared of losing what's important to you

573
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,710
is pointless if you distance yourself from us all!

574
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,380
Because...

575
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,120
for us, you've already...

576
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,390
become someone really important!

577
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,850
That's why if you get absorbed in something,

578
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,410
and someone gives you
a hard time for enjoying yourself...

579
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,120
We can't forgive him!

580
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,880
If there's someone like that,

581
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,850
even if it's your mom,

582
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,880
I'll beat that person up!

583
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,690
Kou?

584
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,420
Don't pull away yet.

585
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,670
Then...

586
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,330
Yeah.

587
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:01,120
Summer Festival</i>

588
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,120
7 o'clock.

589
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,210
At the clock in Sankaku Park.

590
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,900
You didn't say anything except that, so...

591
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,100
I thought, "that wasn't a date..."

592
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,270
and sobbed at the park.

593
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,460
7 o'clock.

594
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,040
At the clock in Sankaku Park.

595
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:32,320
Yeah, that.

596
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,400
That was...

597
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,240
meant as a new promise to you.

598
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,870
Shall we go this time?

599
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,410
To the summer festival.

600
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,680
Okay!

601
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:20,220
I can rewrite what happened that day 4 years ago!

602
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,480
I'll tell him!

603
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,640
This time, I'll tell Kou that I like him!

604
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,660
Hello, Kou? Where are you?

605
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,740
Sorry.

606
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:44,980
Something came up that I can't get away from.

607
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,560
Uhh... what time can you make it?

608
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,540
I'll wait until whenever that is!

609
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:58,400
Can't make it. I'm actually in Nagasaki right now.

610
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,360
Nagasaki?

611
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,180
Kou-chan? What is it?

612
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:27,140
I wasn't able to get a hold of Kou after that day.

613
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,870
I was just wondering, "Is it second semester yet?"

614
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:39,920
and was scared that Kou would disappear somewhere again.

615
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,770
Kou.

616
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:03,900
Hi.

617
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,320
Um... about that.

618
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,630
We have... a meeting today.

619
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,010
I'll pass for today. Can't make it.

620
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,200
Mabuchi seems strange since second semester started...

621
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,570
He doesn't even come to our meetings at all.

622
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,970
I've been saying we need to prepare
for the culture festival, but it's all on LINE.

623
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,440
Kominato, do you know if he's seeing someone?

624
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,870
No... if I ask him, he just dodges the question.

625
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,120
But it does sound like it's a girl. One from his time in Nagasaki.

626
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,770
These are cute!

627
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,900
Hey, Futaba-chan.

628
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,320
I actually confessed to Mabuchi during summer vacation.

629
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,970
I thought I'd try and get a leg up on you, but he turned me down.

630
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:46,140
At that time, he told me there's someone he can't leave alone.

631
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,540
I was convinced that it was you...

632
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,710
Your nails are so small.

633
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,970
How about having a seat?

634
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,360
Okay.

635
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:05,140
You don't need to answer that?

636
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,740
There's a lot going on with an old classmate from Nagasaki.

637
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,160
The calls just keep coming.

638
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,340
Oh.

639
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,050
To make up for the summer festival,

640
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,690
want to do something now?

641
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,190
If you don't want to, it's okay.

642
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,440
Let's do it!

644
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,960
Hello?

645
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,120
Now?

646
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:09,190
Sorry... it's that classmate.

647
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,860
Another time, okay?

648
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,050
Kikuchi-kun?

649
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,350
Are you okay?

650
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:34,760
Your boyfriend just left... was there a fight?

651
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,040
No, no. He's not my boyfriend.

652
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,360
That so?

653
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,670
It turns out I'll be living with my mom.

654
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,410
So I'll be heading out your way.

655
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,610
We can see each other again.

656
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:57,330
Oh? That's good.

657
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,630
Yeah.

658
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,820
Oh, right. That DVD I borrowed from you before--

659
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,700
Sorry.

660
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,720
Can we talk about that later?

661
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,890
I'm going to give priority to that friend
I made a promise with first.

662
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,710
Everyone, are you having a good time?

663
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:08,100
The theme for this year's Sakigaya festival is markets.

664
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,210
Please enjoy all the stalls representing
countries from around the world!

Kominato, you need to put on some pants. It's creepy.

I can't let myself lose to Shuuko.

673
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,810
Is this the same as what you ordered?

674
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:42,940
- Yes. 
- Yes!

675
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,240
Thank you very much.

Please enjoy yourselves here.

Shuuko-chan suits the masculine clothing too well!

678
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,900
This is such a success!

679
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,860
Kominato's idea of doing reverse maids and butlers is such a hit!

I didn't. That's some outfit you're wearing!

684
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,050

- Okay.

Yoshioka-san, you look great as a butler!

701
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,700
Oh, well, that's because I'm not very feminine.

702
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,400
But, Yoshioka-san, you're such a girl.

703

01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:24,720
Again, about back then...

725
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,680
Please take the filled boxes of equipment to the leaders' room.

726
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,800
Why are you running away from me?

727
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,660
Don't worry about that. It was an accident.

728
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,480
What?! What is it?!

729
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,380
- Why are you mad?
- I'm not!

730
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,820
You are!

731
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,860
I'm not mad...

732
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,840
It was... meaningless...

733
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:13,080
Neither of us meant to. It was an accident.

734
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,760
It's the same as if it never happened.

735
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,960
Then...

736
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,330
is it okay if it isn't an accident?

737
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,510
If you don't want to, you can pull away.

738
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,540
For canceling our plans at the last second...

739
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,680
I'm sorry.

740
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:38,990
That night

741
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:42,740
was Narumi's father's wake.

742
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,700
Her parents are divorced as well

743
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,550
and her dad had been looking after her.

744
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:59,670
Telling something like that to you would be... you know.

745
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,350
Is Narumi-san

746
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:14,530
someone special to you?

747
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:25,630
A friend.

748
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:34,100
But I understand how she's feeling right now better than anyone else.

749
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,400
Yeah. You would.

750
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:51,420
It's... space I shouldn't step into, right?

751
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,450
What do you mean, "space"?

752
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:03,070
You know... before you get all soaked in sentimentality, help with cleaning up!

753
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:07,880
Seriously... thanks to your slightly triangular relationship...

754
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:16,590
Hello?

755
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,860
Kou? Do you know a girl named Narumi Yui?

756
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,380
Yeah.

757
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:25,940
Narumi is a classmate from Nagasaki.

758
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,510
The police were asking about her at school.

759
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,150
It seems she came here to visit

760
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,690
in order to run away from home.

761
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:35,870
Run away?

762
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,680
She's been staying with a relative since her father died, right?

763
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:44,540
But she told me she's going to live with her mother here.

764
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,070
No.

765
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,770
Her mother seems to have said no.

766
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,460
Her mom has a new family.

767
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:52,970
She was taken into custody.

768
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:55,810
Since she had something from our festival, the police called us.

769
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:58,510
I listened to the story, and she says she's a friend of yours.

770
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,750
The police.

771
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,680
Let's go.

772
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,690
If I said it was all...

773
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:46,380
on purpose...

774
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:50,890
what would you do, Kou-chan?

775
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:01,050
It's okay.

776
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,980
I understand.

777
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,210
Kou!

778
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,410
It's red.

779
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:35,790
It seems that until her family decides where she'll
be staying, her mother will take care of her.

780
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,830
I'll take her there.

781
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,200
Thanks. Please do.

782
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,100
Go ahead.

783
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,320
Why...

784
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,300
did you kiss me?

785
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,520
Sorry.

786
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,170
I got caught up in the mood.

787
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,840
Liar.

788
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,470
Right now is the time when the season is changing,

789
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,390
so I think there are people here who can't quite get in the mood.

790
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,350
What happened to Mabuchi-kun?

791
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,820
He's been off for a week already.

792
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,590
Narumi-cchi seems to have it pretty
rough staying with her mother.

793
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,780
So he's taking care of her.

794
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,010
Her relatives are still arguing over who is going to keep her.

795
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:04,880
I wonder what Mabuchi-kun will do if she has nowhere to go?

796
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:10,300
He might feel he has to take care of girls who feel that weak.

797
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:14,010
Their circumstances are even similar.

798
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:21,690
I...

799
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:28,850
want to take back Kou's smile.

800
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,790
This is about Kou-chan, right?

801
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,440
I would like you to let him go.

802
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,790
I know that you are having trouble right now,

803
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:10,610
and that there is a pain only you and he understand.

804
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:16,580
But...

805
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,460
When he is with you,

806
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:22,600
time stops for him.

807
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,450
We had finally started making progress, and...

808
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:29,590
I don't want to.

809
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,970
I don't have anyone but Kou-chan.

810
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:38,360
I want him with me no matter what.

811
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,000
I'll do anything if it's for that.

812
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,290
If acting all righteous to try and trick us

813
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,110
is as far as your feelings go, then you
are the one who needs to give up.

814
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:03,760
Yoshioka-san.

815
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,310
You only came to complain to me out of desperation

816
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,380
because the thought of losing Kou-chan is too painful, right?

817
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:19,520
This delusion that time stops for him when he's around me

818
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,050
is to try and push me away!

819
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,390
I...

820
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:40,950
just wanted to come up with a 
reason not give up on Kou.

821
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,710
I'm pretty stubborn, aren't I?

822
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,220
Futaba.

823
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:56,250
Don't go thinking strange things.

824
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,560
Today, I was dropping off some papers

825
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,510
and a guy saw me opening a door with my feet.

826
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,000
Another person driven away by my mannerisms.

827
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:39,470
Habits are really hard to get rid of, aren't they?

828
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,800
You're missing a button there.

829
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,630
I like you.

830
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,030
Kou,

831
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,240
I like you.

832
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,310
I came to you so you could clearly turn me down.

833
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,680
So that I can come to terms with a broken heart,

834
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:21,230
I want you to turn me down properly.

835
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:48,230
I... can't date you, Yoshioka.

836
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,100
That clears it up.

837
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,320
Thank you.

838
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:16,330
But we'll stay friends after this, too, okay?

839
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,560
Are you having flashbacks?

840
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:44,780
Yeah.

841
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,540
For no reason.

842
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:53,260
I just suddenly remember things.

843
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,960
I remember things I hate like sounds,

844
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,660
and places,

845
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:06,460
and they're in color.

846
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,730
What about you, Kou-chan?

847
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,750
Does something like this not happen to you?

848
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,540
Oh.

849
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,960
That's good.

850
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,200
Is he going to pick you up?

851
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,350
Your uncle in Nagasaki.

852
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:41,460
He's going to look after me until I graduate high school.

853
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,010
Don't worry about me.

854
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,010
Listen,

855
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,080
Narumi...

856
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:58,550
Kou-chan, I'm the only one

857
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,490
who understands you.

858
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:12,510
- Morning. - Morning.

859
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,130
Morning!

860
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:18,380
- Morning.
- Morning!

861
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,190
Yoshioka-san, the aura around you
has changed lately, hasn't it?

862
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,880
Or is it... you're changing it?

863
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,980
Yeah. I've decided to graduate from being the way I was.

864
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:40,100
I'll lose 1.5kg, stop running with huge
strides, and stop my bursts of laughter.

865
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:43,750
I'll be more feminine so that I'm more popular.

866
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:49,220
Is this to spite Mabuchi?

867
01:20:56,230 --> 01:21:02,380
I thought that if he clearly turned me down,
I would be able to move forward.

868
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,640
But I'm not doing that at all, am I?

869
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,210
Actually,

870
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,250
I don't know

871
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,480
how to move forward.

872
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,680
Or what to do.

873
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,730
You finally looked at me.

874
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:35,550
Looking somewhere is what it is to move forward.

875
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,890
That's fine, isn't it?

876
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,990
I don't think you need to force it.

877
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:45,440
Because there's someone right in front of you telling
you that Yoshioka-san is fine the way she is.

878
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:53,390
What I'm saying is that I like you, Yoshioka-san.

879
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,300
But... I don't really know you very well.

880
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,140
You can get to know me starting today.

881
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:07,220
I'm saying this about myself, but... I can recommend me.

882
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:14,160
Are you okay?

883
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:20,060
That's the first time anyone has said they like me.

884
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,460
So?

885
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,850
Do you think you can come to like him, too?

886
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:28,760
I'm not sure.

887
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:32,760
But when I'm with Kikuchi,

888
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,100
I can feel a little progress.

889
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:37,610
Also,

890
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:43,280
I think that if I'm with Kikuchi-kun, I can
get rid of Kou's memory sooner.

891
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,980
I see.

892
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,640
I'm not very confident about it, though!

893
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:10,090
Kikuchi is going to take Yoshioka away from you.

894
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,920
He can do what he wants.

895
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,980
There isn't anything

896
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,490
between Yoshioka and me.

897
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:21,010
How's that? You were just grinding your teeth like crazy.

898
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,310
Don't make yourself match Narumi-cchi's moods.

899
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:28,890
- I'm not matching or feeling for her.
- Then what is it?

900
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:33,620
People who can't consider their own happiness

901
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:36,860
shouldn't be proud of supporting other people.

902
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,950
You're such a nice guy it rubs off on people.

903
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:56,610
Being with you, I had a feeling I could go back to the old me.

904
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,880
But then things came up with Narumi.

905
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:04,230
I then realized I really couldn't forgive myself.

906
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:11,030
That's why, until Narumi can stand on her own two feet,

907
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,920
I decided I'll be responsible for her.

908
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,020
Thanks for being concerned.

909
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:43,220
The only one getting heated up was me.

910
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:48,180
To the point our moods were so
different I couldn't get anything across.

911
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,310
I'm seriously lame.

912
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:59,780
I don't think you're very lame at all.

913
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:01,510
Are you saying I'm coo--

914
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:02,750
I'm not.

915
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,490
Right.

916
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,740
It's frustrating.

917
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:17,190
I wonder how things would be if we had met sooner.

918
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,390
If we did,

919
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:24,310
I could have been around when things were hardest for him.

920
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,910
I wanted to do something for him.

921
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,210
You still can, can't you?

922
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:45,990
There's still something you can do, right?

923
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:50,620
[plan outline for a free day during field trip to Kyuushuu]</i>

924
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,000
This is a field trip that will round out the year,

925
01:25:56,230 --> 01:26:00,800
but to keep you from first saying "Kyuushuu 
is large, fun, and has delicious food!"

926
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:05,990
and then letting loose, every class must follow
the plan that they submitted for their free days.

927
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:06,900
Okay?

928
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:08,570
Sensei!

929
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,010
What is it?

930
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,780
Can I change our plan right now?

931
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:30,950
Nagasaki?

932
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,970
Don't be suspicious of it.

933
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:37,580
This isn't about what happened there for you.

934
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,920
This is about your knowing good places to go for a date there.

935
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,790
Huh?

936
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:46,380
If you're thankful for anything I've done, help me out.

937
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:49,400
So that things start going well between Shuuko and I.

938
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,710
Please!

939
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,750
Narumi: Is class done?</i>

940
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:00,770
Are things going well with your uncle and the others?</i>

941
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,070
Narumi: They're alright.</i>

942
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,920
How's the new school?</i>

943
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,490
Made any friends?</i>

944
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:42,400
Kou-chan: We're going to Nagasaki for our trip. Let's meet up.</i>

945
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,910
Yui, what is it?

946
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:49,060
What, a boyfriend? Good for you!

947
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:50,890
- Bye.
- Byebye.

948
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:53,100
Good work!

949
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,440
Byebye!

950
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,340
Do you need something?

951
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,400
Here.

952
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:36,750
Thanks.

953
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:37,770
Here.

954
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:43,300
Sorry to have bothered you.

955
01:29:57,370 --> 01:30:00,210
Unlike him, I won't let go of you.

956
01:30:15,970 --> 01:30:18,110
When I'm in a large group of people,

957
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:19,930
I always end up

958
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:22,610
unconsciously trying to find you.

959
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:26,120
Even if I get the wrong person, I look for you.

960
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,340
And when I'm trying to find you,

961
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,580
no matter how big the group is,

962
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,940
I somehow find you first.

963
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,060
I wonder if that's what it is to fall in love.

964
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,380
Good morning, Yoshioka-san.

965
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:06,880
Good morning, Kikuchi-kun.

966
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:15,600
The first day of our trip! Let's get really into it!

967
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:21,480
Have we finished changing seats around?

968
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,630
Have your expectations been met?

969
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:26,780
This time, for our trip,

970
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,840
we'll be shuffling around the seats!

971
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,500
We'll be shuffling!

972
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,420
You may not know who you'll be sitting next to.

973
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,260
Does his little trick seem like it's on purpose?

974
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,480
He's doing the best he can in his own way, I'd think.

975
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:45,710
But...

976
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:48,780
I wonder if it will go well.

977
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,970
Welcome!

978
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:00,690
Kominato-kun.

979
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:04,900
Is Kou alright?

980
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,000
With Nagasaki.

981
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:16,850
I'm counting on you to take care of Kou.

982
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,270
You plan to sneak out to see Narumi-cchi?

983
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:35,150
What the hell is with you?

984
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,200
That hurt.

985
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:42,900
I didn't go through the trouble of getting us
to Nagasaki so you could do that, you idiot!

986
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:45,640
You're an idiot. Seriously. An idiot.

987
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,460
What do you mean, "the trouble"?

988
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,090
The trip's plan.

989
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,160
The reason that I had it changed to Nagasaki.

990
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,740
No, I can't do it.

991
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:10,660
If we're going to fight the past, you're
the only one who can take that place.

992
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:13,440
You're the only one who knows the old Mabuchi.

993
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:17,610
But I have plans with Kikuchi-kun.

994
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:20,400
And...

995
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:23,280
Kou going to that place...

996
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,620
It'll never work.

997
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,330
The one who can get him there

998
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:30,550
is the class leader. You, Yoshioka Futaba.

999
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:35,780
You said that you want to take back Mabuchi's smile, right?

1000
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:37,830
Was that a lie?

1001
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:43,380
We feel the same way.

1002
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,850
Hey, Kou.

1003
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:55,030
Can you really not forgive yourself?

1004
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:56,890
How about making sure of that?

1005
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,010
Before meeting up with Narumi-cchi,

1006
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:05,660
at least kick away the past first.

1007
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:10,040
That's what we're asking of you.

1008
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:19,640
Okay, don't be late for meeting back up!

1009
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,110
Everyone, make sure you come back!

1010
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:38,570
Please let me take Futaba-chan for the day.

1011
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:43,480
If one of your friends was sending out a distress signal,

1012
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,380
you would go save that friend, right?

1013
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,180
Kou.

1014
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:39,060
You're late.

1015
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:48,750
Kominato...

1016
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,810
I'm leaving.

1017
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:51,810
Spineless.

1018
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:57,240
You've only grown taller. How sad.

1019
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:00,130
You really don't look like, and aren't like, Tanaka-kun.

1020
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:01,490
I said Tanaka is--

1021
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:04,840
Always dragging along and whining about stuff in the past...

1022
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,410
You're a loser yourself, Kou.

1023
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:12,760
What do you think you--

1024
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:12,760
Bedsores that got worse every day

1025
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:15,430
and so much vomit you know the end is coming.

1026
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:20,800
In the end, she couldn't even remember
your name, let alone your face.

1027
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,950
After hearing about your mom,

1028
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:29,390
I've studied a lot about her illness.

1029
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:33,480
I asked Tanaka-sensei a lot of questions.

1030
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:41,420
And after all that, I still couldn't get
any closer to the severity of your sadness.

1031
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:44,130
I didn't understand. I was frustrated.

1032
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:48,920
My desire to understand still hasn't changed.

1033
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:04,180
I said you don't need to know these things, didn't I?

1034
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:20,140
Her voice was getting hoarse back then.

1035
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:24,700
Kou, how about eating together downstairs?

1036
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,850
It's fine. I want to finish this.

1037
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:33,020
Then... I'll leave it here.

1038
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,260
Don't work too hard.

1039
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:36,610
Okay.

1040
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:38,660
I...

1041
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,560
wonder why I didn't realize.

1042
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:46,850
I wonder where I went wrong.

1043
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,960
Is everything over after only one mistake?

1044
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:03,270
There aren't any people who take the right path every time.

1045
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:07,710
Come with me

1046
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,310
and make sure...

1047
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,890
of whether or not you really did make a mistake.

1048
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,610
Come.

1049
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:21,350
I said come!

1050
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:22,910
That hurts!

1051
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:24,930
You're alright!

1052
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:28,860
No matter what happens, I'll help you.

1053
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:31,860
I promised you, right?

1054
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:34,870
That if there were somebody giving you a hard time,

1055
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:38,410
I would beat that person up.

1056
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:43,180
Come on.

1057
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:05,210
This is the area I lived in for 4 years.

1058
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,530
Yeah.

1059
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:12,090
When I first came here with my mom,

1060
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,780
I didn't speak for a long time.

1061
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:17,560
Kou, it's heavy, right?

1062
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:18,740
I'll carry some.

1063
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:23,950
But she kept talking to me.

1064
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:45,980
I'm home.

1065
01:40:46,670 --> 01:40:47,910
Welcome home.

1066
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,120
Actually, I'll just eat here.

1067
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:12,680
There wasn't a girl you liked there?

1068
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:16,470
How is it?

1069
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,740
This is strange.

1070
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,670
I wonder why,

1071
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:33,920
but I can only remember her smiling face.

1072
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,200
Mabuchi-san?

1073
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,610
You've come back?

1074
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,110
He's the priest.

1075
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:27,520
My mom came here a lot.

1076
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:30,700
In hopes she would get better.

1077
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,200
Your mother

1078
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:42,550
never once prayed for herself.

1079
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:46,140
Every day,

1080
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:48,440
she came here

1081
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:50,280
to pray for you.

1082
01:42:58,390 --> 01:43:03,810
I pray that Kou has fun at his new school.

1083
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:07,280
I pray that Kou remains healthy.

1084
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:11,260
I pray that Kou grows to be a kind-hearted person.

1085
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:15,000
I pray that Kou finds people important to him.

1086
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,130
I pray that Kou...

1087
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:24,630
lives his life with a smile.

1088
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:38,480
Not asking for her own sake...

1089
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:42,200
is what it is to be a mother.

1090
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:13,740
Sorry.

1091
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:20,900
It's okay.

1092
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:23,500
You did come, after all.

1093
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:32,960
I...

1094
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,620
couldn't move forward, after all.

1095
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:47,180
Kikuchi-kun, you said...

1096
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:52,200
that you see me first

1097
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,410
no matter where we are, right?

1098
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:56,520
Yeah.

1099
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:58,730
But...

1100
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:03,960
Back then and even now, what I see first

1101
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,570
has always been Kou's back.

1102
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:23,420
I'm sorry.

1103
01:47:29,390 --> 01:47:30,750
I knew that.

1104
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:44,940
I knew that you, without hesitation,
would always go straight after Mabuchi.

1105
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:50,570
But that being the way you are

1106
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:52,340
is exactly why I fell for you.

1107
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:56,710
This is me being a bad loser.

1108
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,080
Kikuchi-kun...

1109
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:04,920
I...

1110
01:48:26,990 --> 01:48:29,260
I wonder if those two are okay.

1111
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:32,460
Hey.

1112
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:34,530
- You lot.

1113
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:34,530
- Crap.

1114
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,310
What is it?

1115
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,720
Leave the rest to me.

1116
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,480
Come back before breakfast.

1117
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:22,930
Kou: I want you to come out with me one more time.</i>

1118
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:25,730
I want to see the sunrise with everyone.</i>

1119
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:27,160
We'll make a good memory!</i>

1120
01:49:30,830 --> 01:49:33,290
[Number withheld]</i>

1121
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:38,870
Yes, hello?

1122
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:40,730
Yoshioka-san?

1123
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:53,120
When Kou-chan transferred here 4 years ago,

1124
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:58,190
he was wearing a uniform that was different from everybody else's.

1125
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,880
He was short, too.

1126
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:05,710
He was always alone, and never fit in with other people.

1127
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:12,680
After school, he would stay at his art class desk

1128
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:15,080
and write graffiti on it while he was alone.

1129
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:30,490
He wrote so many girly things.

1130
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:42,340
Sankaku Park.

1131
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:43,860
7 o'clock.

1132
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:47,370
Sankaku Park.

1133
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:48,960
7 o'clock.

1134
01:50:57,650 --> 01:51:02,010
Start his clock up again for him.

1135
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:17,610
Yoshioka Futaba</i>

1136
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:39,440
Even if we just stay friends!

1137
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:42,880
As long as Kou will smile for me, it's okay!

1138
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,780
One more time...

1139
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:49,940
If all of us can just see

1140
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:53,120
that sunrise one more time!

1141
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:24,740
Everyone's pretty late.

1142
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:27,150
Yeah.

1143
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:38,010
Was it really okay for us to not go?

1144
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:43,100
This, too, is what friendship means.

1145
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,700
Here.

1146
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:51,840
Thanks.

1147
01:52:56,300 --> 01:53:00,330
Coming all the way here might have been a pretty big detour.

1148
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:05,470
Detours are what makes this Aoharu.

1149
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:09,120
Yeah, loudmouthed.

1150
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,200
This is cold!

1151
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,170
No, too loud.

1152
01:53:11,170 --> 01:53:13,800
Look! It's getting bright!

1153
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,360
Hey, look! Kou!

1154
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,870
Kou?

1155
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,490
Are you cold?

1156
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:30,580
Are you okay?

1157
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:34,630
I might die like this. Leave me here.

1158
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:37,740
Ow!

1159
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:40,070
I give! Uncle!

1160
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,490
Sorry.

1161
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:50,900
In the first year of middle school,

1162
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:53,180
I liked you.

1163
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:59,420
When I was in the jail in cops and robbers,

1164
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:04,210
you ran straight to me to get me out.

1165
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:06,900
Tanaka-kun!

1166
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:13,950
I'm getting you out!

1167
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:22,990
But before you could, you fell straight down.

1168
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:29,370
My sides hurt just remembering it!

1169
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:38,490
Like you said,

1170
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:44,900
I'm the loser for desperately clinging to my memories.

1171
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:55,820
I love you.

1172
01:54:58,370 --> 01:55:01,340
I did then, and I do now. Always did.

1173
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:10,830
You're okay with someone like me?

1174
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:17,040
I don't know.

1175
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:22,110
I've never liked anyone but you,

1176
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:23,390
so I don't know.

1177
01:55:28,330 --> 01:55:29,760
But you're, you know...

1178
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31,350
my...

1179
01:55:33,390 --> 01:55:34,920
hero.

We'll be at the airport soon.

02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:04,390
Make sure you're not leaving anything behind!

1183
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:05,010
Okay!

1184
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:06,340
Also,

1185
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:17,300
Mistakes are always made in our adolescence,

1186
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:21,780
but...

1187
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:25,770
it's adolescence exactly because there are mistakes.
