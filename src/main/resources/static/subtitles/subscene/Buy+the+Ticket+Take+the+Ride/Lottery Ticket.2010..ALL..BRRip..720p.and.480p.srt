00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,832
Every grocery store, liquor store,
gas station and corner market...

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,792
...has long lines out its doors...

5
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,004

00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,491
KEVlN: Ahem.
-l mean, Kevin doesn't have a girlfriend.

77
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,119
He doesn't let these Jezebels

78
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,539
You know the one l'd like
to see you with, huh?

Friends.

84
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,968
-All right, dear.
BENNY: That would be nasty.

85
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,929
Suit yourself.
Now, wait a minute, here.

86
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,516
l want you to play my number for me
on the way home, okay?

87
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,935
And don't let nobody copy them
either. All right?

88
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,562
-l won't.
-Those are my numbers.

89
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,606

They're out of the Holy Scripture.

90

Okay.

91
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:03,779
You know something? Last night l dreamt
that l was waiting on the number 1 7 bus.

92
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,866
You'll never guess who was driving
when the bus pulled up.

93
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,784
-Who?
-Jesus.

94
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,163
And l said, "Jesus, what are
you doing driving this bus?"

95
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,206
-You know what he said to me?
-No, ma'am.

96
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:19,462
He said, "Child, it's a recession.
Times is hard."

97
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,630
-That's what he said.
-You didn't ask me...

98
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,550
...but how did Jesus get a license
without a birth certificate?

99
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,802
-lt makes no sense.
-Out. Go.

100
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,929

How in the hell do you get this gossip?

134
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,882
First of all, it's not gossip.

You know he's crazy.

There ain't nothing wrong with
Mr. Washington.

00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,109
You need to stop treating people
