I HAVE TO BUY NEW SHOES

9
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,139
Hey, why don't you take a picture?

10
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,939
A picture?

11
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,940
OK...

12
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,349
Let's go over by the river.

13
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,350
Excuse me, Turn right over there
and down to the river.

14
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,520
River? What river?

15
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,589
The Seine?

16
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,229
Oh, I've heard of that.

17
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,099
You have, huh?

18
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,329
It's famous, right?

19
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,499
Paris, the Seine...

20
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,730
Yeah, it's big.

21
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,740
Here?

22
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,140
Yeah, yeah. Great.

23
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,349
This is great!

24
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,589
Yeah.

25
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,659
Let's take a picture.

26
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,389
That building's famous.

27
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,359
Notre Dame.

28
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,559
Uh-huh.

29
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,059
Get that in, too.

30
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,929
With you?

31
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,739
OK, pose...

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,169
Let me see.

33
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,839
I think I got it all...

34
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Now we're here,
let's take a real picture.

35
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,849
With the camera you hold like this...

36
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,850
The Hasselblad?
Let's not get that out now.

37
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,049
It's OK. I'll get it.

38
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,050
What's gotten into you?

39
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,090
That's a great sky!

40
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,529
Sen, here it is!

41
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,530
It's OK, I'll get it.

42
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Let's see...

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,930
OK...

44
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,099
Drive!

45
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,069
Thanks for coming out, Sen!

46
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,070
Now it's time for brother and sister
to part ways! 'Bye!

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,150
Hey, wait! Suzume! Suzume!

48
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,420
Made it!

49
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,290
Great!

50
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
What is she up to?!

51
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,490
Damn it!

52
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,609
OK, I'll see you at 2, then.

53
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,109
I'm looking forward to it. See you.

54
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,110
Thanks.

55
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Are you ok?

56
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,629
I'm fine. I just tripped.

57
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,029
Japanese?

58
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,469
Yes. Hello.

59
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,470
Hello.

60
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,570
Look...

61
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,279
You're not hurt?

62
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,280
No, I just sort of went over.

63
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,219
I think I stepped on that.

64
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,589
It's my passport.

65
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,590
What?

66
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,999
Don't look.

67
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think I'd better.

68
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,339
It'll be OK.

69
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,340
I don't know about that.
You should check with the embassy.

70
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,579
The embassy?

71
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,580
Avenue Hoche, between Courcelles
and Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

72
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,950
I'd take you there,
but I'm in a hurry.

73
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll write the address.

74
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,930
Do you live here?

75
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,699
Yes.

76
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,700
I've been here a while,
but I'm still not used to it.

77
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,510
There.

78
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,409
That's the address.

79
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,849
And...

80
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,779
...my card.

81
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,780
It's a free paper for Japanese.

82
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,219
You're the editor?

83
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,119
It's pretty small.

84
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,659
That's my number.

85
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,660
Let me know what happens.

86
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,799
Or for any other problems.

87
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,069
Thank you.

88
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,069
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,539
Not at all.

90
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,540
You're in a hurry, right?

91
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,679
Excuse me!

92
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,979
You forgot this.

93
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Oh.

94
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,890
Wait...

95
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
I think I have something...

96
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,209
Here.

97
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,509
Krazy Glue!

98
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,879
This should hold it.

99
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,879
For a while.

100
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Yeah.

101
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,549
Ms 'Teshigawara'?

102
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,550
Yes, but call me Aoi.
'Teshigawara' is hard to say.

103
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,490
I'm Sen Yagami. Call me Sen.

104
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,960
OK, 'Yagami' is easy.

105
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,999
Right.

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,899
Is there anywhere here
you'd recommend?

107
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,569
Sorry?

108
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,570
Your favorite place in Paris.

109
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,910
Where would that be?

110
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,579
Oh...

111
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,849
Where?

112
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,319
It's nowhere special.

113
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,819
I see...

114
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Hang on...

115
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,229
That should do it.

116
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,860
Thank you.

117
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,870
Try it.

118
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,009
It fits!

119
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,010
I guess it should,
since it's my shoe.

120
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,779
Good luck with your work.

121
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,819
Right.

122
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,619
And with your passport.

123
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,620
I'll do my best.

124
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,949
My passport...

125
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,389
Next window, please.

126
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,089
Thanks.

127
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,389
Hello.

128
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,390
Chocolate eggs came in the 1 800s.

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,059
Before that...

130
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,060
...they were made at home...

131
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,539
...hand-painted.

132
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,540
First they were boiled very hard.

133
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,169
Or else...

134
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,170
...you take the egg...

135
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,380
...put a small hole in both ends...

136
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,180
...and blow hard.

137
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,459
Three eggs and you're red in the face.

138
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,129
Yes.

139
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,559
So...

140
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,399
...I'm not speaking too fast?

141
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,429
No, I understand.

142
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,869
May I take pictures?

143
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,870
Of course.

144
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,310
The Easter-egg hunt is a tradition.

145
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Parents hide eggs outside...

146
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,320
...like gifts under a Christmas tree.

147
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,690
The children go and hunt for them.

148
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,289
I'd always take hours to find mine.

149
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,290
My father didn't want it to be easy.

150
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,360
I'd start crying...it was horrible.

151
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,970
But that's what got me into this work.

152
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,110
And here we are.

153
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,039
Want my picture?

154
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,279
Sure.

155
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Let's do it.

156
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,649
Ready.

157
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,819
Three, two...

158
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,549
Wait.

159
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,550
Three, two, one...

160
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,659
How about like this?

161
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,800
One more.

162
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,599
Great.

163
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Fantastic.

164
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,519
Thank you.

165
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,520
My pleasure.

166
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,689
Your phone.

167
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,499
Got it. Goodbye.

168
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Sayonara.

169
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,770
...leave a message after the tone.

170
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,270
Her message is all in French...

171
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Please leave a message.

172
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,210
Uh, it's Yagami.

173
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,720
The passport looks like it's OK.

174
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,890
I just thought I'd tell you.

175
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,040
Where do you want to go please?
Just a moment please.

176
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,439
That note...

177
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Where is it?

178
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,680
I'm sorry I don't know where to go.
Please let me out. Sorry.

179
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,329
This is Suzume.

180
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,869
Please leave a message after the tone.

181
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,870
Leave a message,
or you'll make me cry. 'Beep'.

182
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,010
Damn it, Suzume! You took the note
with the name of the hotel!

183
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Call me, will you?

184
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,930
What the hell do you think
you're doing, anyway?!

185
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,639
Hello?

186
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,770
Um...

187
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,780
Yes?

188
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,009
Uh...

189
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,010
...we met earlier.

190
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Uh, yes...Aoi-san,
Aoi Teshigawara.

191
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,289
Is something wrong?

192
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,559
No, that was something else.

193
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,560
A mistake.

194
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,929
Let me explain.

195
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,930
My sister wanted to come to Paris,
and she dragged me here...

196
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,140
...then she dumped me
by the Seine.

197
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,309
So anyway...

198
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,309
...I'm here with her.
I mean, our relationship isn't...

199
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,009
...weird or anything...

200
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,119
Hey, hey, hey...

201
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,180
...calm down.

202
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,989
Yeah, OK.

203
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,619
You're with your sister...

204
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,459
Yes.

205
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,460
You got dragged here,
and got dumped by the Seine?

206
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Yeah, that's right.
Then I met you...

207
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
...and you tromped
all over my passport.

208
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
You called me, I believe...

209
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,610
Oh yeah, right. They can't
replace my passport right away...

210
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,510
...but they said
they'd give me a travel document.

211
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,649
They did?

212
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,389
Yeah. So I can...

213
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,390
...get back to Japan OK.
Thank you.

214
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Not at all. Thanks for calling.

215
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,529
Not at all.

216
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,229
Oh, is your shoe OK?

217
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,230
I'd forgotten.
It's fine, no problem at all.

218
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,809
That's good.

219
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,239
Enjoy your stay.

220
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,109
Thank you.

221
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,509
Oh, hello?

222
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,649
Yes?

223
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,650
My sister took the memo
with the name of our hotel.

224
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,989
Oh, dear.

225
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,990
I've completely forgotten
its name.

226
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,330
There was a reason
she chose it, though.

227
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,299
Yes?

228
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Hotels give you
a basket of fruit, right?

229
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,099
Yes, in your room.

230
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Well, this hotel puts out
pastries, not fruit.

231
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,340
They're popular in Paris,
'po' something.

232
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,520
'Po' something?

233
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,420
My sister said it evolved from
a choux cream puff.

234
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,689
'Popelini'?

235
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,690
Yeah... something like that,
I'm not sure.

236
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,230
That's probably it. A pâtissière
from Ladurée makes them.

237
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,640
'Ladurée'? I think
I've heard of that.

238
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,570
They make macaroni
or something like that, right?

239
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,610
'Macaroons', Mr Yagami.

240
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,149
Yes, that's what I meant.

241
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,289
I did an article on Popelini.

242
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,290
I'll call and ask who they supply.

243
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,490
The reservation's
in your sister's name?

244
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,860
Yes. Her name's
Suzume Yagami.

245
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,099
'Sparrow'?

246
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,100
It's written with the characters
'bell' and 'love'.

247
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,640
OK. Wait there.
I'll call you back.

248
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,979
OK, thanks.

249
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,949
I found it.

250
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,279
You did?

251
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,280
'L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans'.

252
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,119
I called...

253
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
...and there's a reservation
under your sister's name.

254
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Great! Thanks a lot.

255
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,260
No problem.
It's near the Louvre Museum.

256
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,669
Where are you?

257
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,169
Right now I can see...

258
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,170
...the Arc de Triomphe.

259
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,770
You can probably walk from there.

260
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,440
I can?

261
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,449
Will you walk?

262
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,579
Sure, no problem.

263
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,119
I'll guide you.

264
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,089
No, I'll be fine.

265
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,090
It's no problem.
If you can see the Arc...

266
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,590
...are you on the street
the embassy's on?

267
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,329
Yes.

268
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,330
Then walk to
the Arc de Triomphe.

269
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
To the Arc...

270
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,539
Are you there?

271
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,540
I can't walk that fast.
I can't run that far, either.

272
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,580
I'm kidding. Just a bit of humor.

273
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,019
Right.

274
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,020
OK, I'm at the Arc de Triomphe.

275
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,590
There's a road that goes
right around it, isn't there.

276
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,159
Yes, there is.

277
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,929
Go left there.

278
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,930
OK, I'm going left.

279
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Could you go to where
you're right in front of it?

280
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,510
Sure.

281
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,920
It's really something, isn't it.

282
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,989
Very powerful.

283
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,959
They really knew how to build
back then.

284
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,960
I can see why
it's a big tourist draw.

285
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,660
Streets radiate out from it
in all directions.

286
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,340
From above they make
a star pattern.

287
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,740
That's Place de l'Étoile,
'the square of the star'.

288
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,380
'The square of the star'?
That's cool.

289
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,050
I'm almost in front of it now.

290
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,649
I'm there.

291
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,650
OK, then turn right...

292
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,719
No, I mean left.

293
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,359
Left?

294
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Now I'm facing back
the way I just came.

295
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,129
No, just turn 90 degrees.

296
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,069
90 degrees left.

297
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,699
Left...OK, I've turned left.

298
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Can you see a big street
in front of you?

299
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,739
Yes, I can.

300
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,740
That's Avenue des Champs Élysées.

301
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,410
Oh...Champs Élysées.

302
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,019
Humor.

303
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Right. OK, for now
go straight along that street.

304
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,729
Go straight.

305
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,729
It's a long street.

306
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,299
Yes, it's long.

307
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Shall I be your tour guide?

308
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,039
Sorry?

309
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,040
The avenue is said to be
the world's most beautiful street.

310
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,040
The main Louis Vuitton store...

311
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,310
...is a famous landmark.

312
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,750
People take pictures there,
and some even pray to it.

313
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,060
They do?

314
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,730
You should be coming to
the end of the avenue.

315
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,970
Yeah, I'm coming to a kind of
square or something.

316
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,040
OK, that's Place de la Concorde.

317
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Sorry, Aoi-san,
but could I take a break?

318
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Sure, go ahead.

319
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,149
Hello?

320
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,219
Yes?

321
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,220
The tour's fun, but why don't you
tell me something about yourself?

322
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,199
About me?

323
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,999
Yeah.

324
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
A guided tour of Aoi-san.

325
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,040
That wouldn't be much fun.
There's nothing to tell.

326
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,110
But you, Sen-san...

327
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,580
I almost called you 'Masao'.

328
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,850
Sorry.

329
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,319
That's OK.

330
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,320
My Mom loves Masao Sen's singing.

331
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,959
That's eccentric.

332
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Her tastes aren't all that elevated.

333
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,739
Now take your next right.

334
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,569
Right, OK.

335
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,570
Do you see a gold statue?
That's Joan of Arc.

336
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,379
A gold statue. Got it.

337
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,380
Your hotel's on the left.
L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

338
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,620
OK, I'm walking along
some sort of gallery.

339
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,090
I just go straight?
I'm facing the statue.

340
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,699
That's right.

341
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Left of the statue...

342
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Yep, there it is.
There's the hotel.

343
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,840
Thank you for taking
so much time.

344
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,609
Not at all.

345
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,049
Well, then...

346
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,050
Stay on the line as you go in.

347
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,119
Turn around.

348
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,189
Where?

349
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,190
I'm not there yet?

350
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,030
You came here?

351
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,939
I was close by.

352
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,939
Thank you.

353
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,940
Oh, you've got luggage!
I'm sorry I made you walk.

354
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,809
It was good exercise.

355
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,810
That's the front desk?

356
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,980
I'll go check in, then.

357
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,820
Excuse me, I have a reservation.
Can I check in?

358
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,590
Hello, welcome to Regina Hotel.
What is your name, please?

359
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,029
Suzume Yagami.

360
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,750
Mr Suzume. Yes I've got your reservation, I need
to use your credit card. Thank you very much.

361
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,240
If it's all right with you...

362
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,679
...and if you're finished work...

363
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,680
...could I buy you dinner?

364
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I don't know any restaurants,
and you could show me one.

365
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,359
Are you hungry?

366
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,059
I haven't eaten since lunch.

367
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,060
Oh, dear!

368
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,510
Woof!

369
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,020
Guess who's here.

370
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,550
I was lonely.

371
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,490
Kango!

372
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,629
Welcome.

373
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,630
Cheers.

374
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,469
Welcome to Paris.

375
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,679
Thanks for the help.

376
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,680
So you're a photographer?

377
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,810
Sort of.

378
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,820
My paper's kind of dull.

379
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,689
Would you like to see it?

380
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,889
Sure. How dull can it be?

381
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,890
Nothing.

382
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,560
You can have that.
There's lots of places in it.

383
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,930
Right, it's in Japanese...

384
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,039
I wrote that one.

385
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,539
Cool.

386
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,540
I did an interview
after I met you.

387
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,949
An interview about what?

388
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,649
A restaurant?

389
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,149
Eggs.

390
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,419
Eggs?

391
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,149
Easter eggs. The painted ones.

392
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,150
Oh, those.

393
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,729
I took pictures.

394
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,730
Want to see?

395
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,340
They're beautiful.

396
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,809
So you write and take pictures?

397
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,810
Yes. I can't afford a photographer.

398
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,010
I see.

399
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,280
I'd like to see your stuff.

400
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,889
Sure.

401
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,890
Just a minute...

402
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,890
Push on the right side.

403
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,809
She's cute.

404
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,810
That's my sister.
I hate how she poses.

405
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,580
Is that what they call a 'gotcha-face'?

406
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,950
Not quite.

407
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,880
I guess living here
it's hard to keep up with new slang.

408
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,390
You're right.
I feel like Rip van Winkle.

409
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Your sister's pretty.

410
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,360
I wonder what she's up to.

411
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,869
You can sit down.

412
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,709
OK.

413
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,710
That's my latest.

414
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,649
Why are they naked?

415
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,650
Not telling.

416
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,350
Paris is 1 0,000 kilometers
from Japan.

417
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,859
Yeah?

418
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,059
Yeah.

419
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,060
It's 1 2 hours by plane.

420
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
And 1 1 whole days by ship.

421
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,870
Why are you laughing?
I looked this up, so listen!

422
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,209
OK.

423
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,210
1 0,000km...

424
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,249
5,000...

425
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,349
5,000 already?

426
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,350
OK...

427
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,620
...500 meters.

428
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,359
You're getting closer...

429
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,360
OK...

430
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,339
...40 centimeters.

431
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,340
40cm...

432
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,279
4cm...

433
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,349
4cm?

434
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,350
My turn...

435
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,249
Fooled ya!

436
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,650
You're no fun!
I'm not playing with you any more.

437
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,660
Stop sulking.

438
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,599
Sorry.

439
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,499
I'm glad you're here.

440
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,500
It was a long trip.

441
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,510
You've got to watch your step here.

442
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,780
Let's keep going!

443
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,950
Just kidding.

444
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,050
I could drink a bit more.

445
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,290
Then come with me,
if you like.

446
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,399
I treat.

447
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
I will treat. I have treated before.

448
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm forgetting Japanese.

449
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,310
Are you drunk?

450
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Who, me?

451
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Paris! What a place!

452
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
Here?

453
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,899
Here we go again.

454
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Cheers.

455
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,109
That's good.

456
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,039
Really?

457
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,339
Try it.

458
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,509
May I?

459
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,510
OK.

460
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,849
That is good.

461
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,850
Have some more.

462
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,859
Want to trade?

463
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,860
It's good, but it's too strong.

464
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,830
Tell me more about your sister.

465
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,739
You're interested in her?

466
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,740
I'm jealous that she's crazy enough
to take off like that.

467
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
She has the name for it.

468
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,850
If only I had a name like...

469
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,480
...'sparrow'.

470
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,820
But why did she have to bring you
to Paris and then leave you?

471
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Why not just come herself?

472
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,699
I don't like talking about it...

473
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,399
Forget it, then.

474
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,400
But maybe I will.

475
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,109
Which is it?

476
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,110
She forced me to bring her.

477
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,849
You paid?

478
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,850
She's got a job.
I made her at least pay half.

479
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,690
Why did she bring you?

480
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,619
For good luck.

481
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,589
Good luck?

482
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,590
I always have to be there
when it's important.

483
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,360
University entrance exams,
job interviews, field days...

484
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,930
Or when her pet hamster
had surgery.

485
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,539
If I'm there, things go well.

486
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,540
And you're delighted to be there...

487
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,209
No, I'm not.

488
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,049
Sorry. It's just that she's so pretty.

489
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,219
There's more to it than that.

490
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,220
It started when she was born.

491
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,090
Her birth day...when she was born.
This is getting interesting.

492
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,789
It's not that special.

493
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,629
When Mom had Suzume...

494
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,630
...she needed a Cesarian.
It was touch and go.

495
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Her water had broken
long before her due date...

496
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,239
...so it was an emergency delivery.

497
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,240
It looked like things
weren't going to work out.

498
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,750
My father rushed to the hospital,
and I went to my grandmother's.

499
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,020
That's when we knew it was a girl.
Mom said the baby was calling me.

500
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Mom said to bring me from Grandma's
because the baby inside her wanted me.

501
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,070
So I was brought to the hospital
while my mother was in labor.

502
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,240
I sat out in this kind of corridor
and waited for seven whole hours.

503
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,349
I see.

504
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,350
In the end, my sister was fine.

505
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,049
That's great.

506
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,050
So we've heard this story
over and over again...

507
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,389
Oh, thanks.

508
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,390
The story of Suzume and me.

509
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,130
We've been ground into each other.

510
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
So whenever she has something,
I have to be there.

511
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,399
Now she doesn't even tell me why.

512
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I'm just summoned to be there.

513
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,510
Which means she has
something important in Paris.

514
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,249
Probably.

515
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,180
What could that be, I wonder.

516
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,190
Yeah!

517
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,420
The luck brother.

518
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,089
What?

519
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,090
The brother who brings
good luck.

520
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,099
Me?

521
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,629
Yeah, it's amazing. I'm like a shrine
she visits for every big step.

522
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,099
Safe birth...

523
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,100
...success at school, a job...

524
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,580
...and love. I wonder if that's
what this is all about.

525
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,879
I feel like I'd like to pray.

526
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,789
What?

527
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,790
Would you mind?

528
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Aoi-san!

529
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,799
Aoi-san! Hey!

530
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,529
Am I drunk?

531
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,669
Did you finish this already?!

532
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,039
And this?!

533
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Time out.

534
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,279
Aoi-san?

535
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,280
I'm a bit drunk. Sorry.

536
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,750
Hey, hey, hey!

537
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,120
Don't sleep here. It's dangerous!

538
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,189
Sit up.

539
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,159
You're going again!

540
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Hey! Hey! Try to focus.

541
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,030
OK, I'll carry you.

542
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,339
Climb on.

543
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,340
OK?

544
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,879
We can get a taxi over there.

545
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Right.

546
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,220
I know what you're thinking.

547
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,260
'How did I end up in a strange place
carrying a woman I don't even know?'

548
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I'm not thinking that.

549
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,770
OK, then what am I thinking?

550
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,310
I don't know.

551
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,940
I'm thinking a person's back
is so nice and warm.

552
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,989
Sorry. I'm OK now.

553
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,990
You are? You can stand up, right?

554
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,060
Oh, this is terrible!

555
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,200
I'm sorry!

556
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Are you all right?

557
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,879
Yes.

558
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm OK...for the most part.

559
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,750
Careful!

560
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Careful! It's a red light!

561
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,330
Hey, look!
You can see the Eiffel Tower.

562
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Yeah. It's beautiful.

563
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,040
How do you like Paris?

564
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,440
It's awesome.

565
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,779
I want...

566
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,780
...to go back to Japan.

567
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,920
How's the Tokyo Tower?

568
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,830
Here's a taxi.

569
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,739
Aoi-san...

570
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,740
Where on Belleville?
Tell him your address?

571
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,639
Komazawa 5, Setagaya...

572
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,909
Aoi-san! This is Paris!

573
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,910
I'm kidding. Just a bit of humor.
Funny?

574
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,450
Yes. What's your address?

575
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,630
Careful! Careful!
Which one is it?

576
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,060
Here?

577
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,970
Watch it!

578
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,679
Here?

579
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,679
I'm home!

580
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,249
Hello!

581
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,250
There's no one here.
I live alone.

582
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,949
But you said...

583
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,950
When I get home,
I say, 'I'm home!'

584
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,459
Are you sure you live here?

585
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,460
Why?

586
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,330
Which one's the key?
What if this isn't your house?

587
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,769
Great! Got it the first time.

588
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,879
You're home.

589
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,940
Welcome to my home.

590
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,950
No, no. I'm going.

591
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,249
Thank you very much.

592
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,250
Don't catch cold.
Make sure you go to bed.

593
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Good night.

594
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,060
I'm sorry, but what was the name
of my hotel again?

595
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,829
Hotel?

596
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,830
The name of the hotel
you guided me to.

597
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,170
L'hotel de...

598
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,010
Hotel le Meurice? Wow!
I'd love to stay there.

599
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,919
No, the hotel that I'm...

600
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Aoi-san?

601
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Aoi-san, don't go to sleep there.

602
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,860
Excuse me...

603
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,439
OK, I'll never kiss you again!

604
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,440
But you know you will.

605
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,319
What?

606
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,320
I'm happy.

607
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,460
Huh?

608
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,730
Huh?

609
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,900
What happened last night?

610
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,210
I still have make-up on.
I did it again.

611
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,880
Huh?

612
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,859
Sorry, I got lost.
I didn't touch. Sen.

613
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,459
Oh, right!

614
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,699
'Sen-san'...

615
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,700
'Mr Yagami'...he brought me back.

616
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,550
'Sen', written with
the character for 'thousand'.

617
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,989
Excuse me...

618
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,990
Why...

619
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,690
...are you sleeping here?

620
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I see. You got me here,
but you couldn't get home yourself.

621
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,270
Were you asking me the name
of your hotel?

622
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,880
Did I dream that?

623
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,880
It's L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

624
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,069
Close your eyes.

625
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,099
OK.

626
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,139
All right?

627
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,140
Hey...

628
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,780
What are you touching?

629
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,650
Huh?

630
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,089
Your cheek.

631
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,090
Wrong!

632
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,859
Again.

633
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,989
OK.

634
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,990
OK...

635
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,860
Here.

636
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,469
Wait...

637
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,539
I have no idea.

638
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,669
That's my heart.

639
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,009
How would I know that?

640
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,010
Ow!

641
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,309
Um...

642
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,449
Good morning.

643
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,319
Sorry. I crashed here.

644
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,819
That's OK.

645
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,820
Was I really drunk last night?

646
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,329
You don't remember?

647
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,299
Bits and pieces.

648
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,300
The restaurant, and the bar...

649
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,800
The Eiffel Tower, the taxi...

650
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,069
That's perfect.

651
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,909
Did I get out of line?

652
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,679
Not at all.

653
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,680
Good.

654
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,050
You're not all stiff
from sleeping in the bath?

655
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,950
I tried to find somewhere
I wouldn't be in the way.

656
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,129
Shall I do that?

657
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,029
I can do coffee.

658
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,030
OK.

659
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,369
It's hot.

660
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,239
May I?

661
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,100
Go ahead.

662
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,110
First...

663
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,710
...you pour just enough
to wet the top.

664
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,520
Let it swell up.

665
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,219
And then...

666
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,220
...pour it in gently
so it'll get drawn in.

667
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,730
These are good fresh beans.
They swell right up.

668
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,129
You're a pro?

669
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,239
I worked in a coffee shop.

670
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,969
A fancy one?

671
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,970
It's pretty well-known.
Tajimaya, in Shinjuku.

672
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,480
I've been there.
When I was a student.

673
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,619
About 20 years ago.

674
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,620
Yeah? Then maybe
I made your coffee...

675
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,359
...not.

676
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,360
I was just a kid.

677
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,729
That was humor.

678
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:26,730
Well, it's the truth.

679
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,700
How old are you?
As old as Tokyo Disneyland?

680
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,070
I was born the year it opened.

681
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,680
I'm Tokyo Disneyland's
slightly older sister.

682
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,580
'Slightly'?

683
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,202
Slightly.

684
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,060
Were you playing the piano?

685
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,160
Yes.

686
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:06,570
That's the one. I like that piece.

687
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,209
What is it?

688
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:11,210
Mozart's 'Minuet and Trio'.

689
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,780
So would you be a cat?

690
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,190
That's the piece of music
the world's cats like best.

691
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,559
Cat music?

692
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,199
For my cat...

693
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,200
...it meant 'food'.

694
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,670
Whenever I played it,
he'd come right home.

695
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,670
Morning or evening,
it didn't matter.

696
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,220
Then one day he didn't come home.

697
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,720
He never came back.

698
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,220
Three years ago, right around now.

699
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,390
At Easter.

700
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,730
Maybe he celebrated too much,
and went off somewhere.

701
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,340
So I play that piece a lot...

702
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,410
...hoping maybe he'll come back.

703
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,440
Sometimes they come back.

704
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,419
Did you ever have one?

705
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,980
A mongrel, when I was small.

706
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,549
Mine was a shorthair called Guru.

707
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,459
Ours was just called Tama.

708
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,220
'Tama'?

709
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,459
Like the 'Sazae-san' comic?

710
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,460
Probably.

711
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,010
'Sorry, but I got lost.

712
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,980
'I didn't touch.'

713
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,429
This is Suzume.

714
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,499
Please leave a message after the tone.

715
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,500
Leave a message,
or you'll make me cry.

716
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,830
'Beep!'

717
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Suzume, where are you?
Phone me, will you?

718
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,509
Ah, sorry.

719
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,510
Oh shit.

720
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,320
OK, I take it.

721
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,890
Thanks.

722
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,069
The two of you?

723
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,839
Look. I found this in Saint Pierre.

724
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,840
It's pretty.

725
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:36,110
This is my friend Joanne.
She lives on the 3rd floor.

726
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,019
Her studio's in my basement.

727
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,149
Basement?

728
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,419
Down those steps.

729
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,420
Joanne's a dress designer.

730
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:50,690
This is Sen Yagami.

731
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,029
He's a friend.

732
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,039
Oh, you're friends...

733
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,909
Joanne. Nice to meet you.

734
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,910
Nice to meet you too. My name is Sen Yagami

735
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,980
Sen

736
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,760
Careful of the step.

737
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,100
Ok. Wow..what a nice place.
Where should I put this?

738
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,830
Over here.
Ok.

739
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,339
Thank you.

740
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,970
Can I look around?

741
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,980
Yes, please.

742
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,119
They are very beautiful.

743
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,949
Really?

744
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:49,950
Look here. This dress is from 1 925.
And this one is from 1 950.

745
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,900
Sounds great. Can I take pictures?

746
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Aoi!

747
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,100
Can you help me when you're done?

748
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:42,110
Coming.

749
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,649
Showtime!

750
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,650
Showtime?

751
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,599
Like it?

752
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,600
Great! It's beautiful material.

753
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,110
Put it on, would you?

754
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,350
Sometimes I have her
put on the dresses for me.

755
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,260
For the hem and the line so I can see it.

756
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,400
I'm thinking bacon and spinach.

757
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,569
Fine.

758
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,570
Sen, I made a bunch of dishes
and Aoi is making the kische.

759
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:53,410
So it is going to be perfect.
Because it is Easter weekend.

760
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,920
So my daughter is bringing
my grandchildren this afternoon.

761
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,290
Oh really?

762
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,760
Can you give me a hand, Joanne?

763
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,770
Sen, would you like to come to the party
with us?

764
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,399
Can I?

765
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,400
Oh, no no. He has a plan I think.

766
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,570
Oh no no, can I join you?

767
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,539
Really?

768
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,679
Sure.

769
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,680
Of course.

770
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,690
Come over here.

771
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,430
Wow!

772
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,500
That's great.

773
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,540
No pictures!

774
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,550
This is just to see how it looks.
I'm just the dummy.

775
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,380
It suits you.

776
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:09,119
Don't take pictures.

777
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,120
I'll just pin it here.

778
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,100
You are a rare animal.

779
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,110
'A rare animal'?
A protected species?

780
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,750
It's the first time Aoi introduces me to a man.

781
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,359
She's been through a lot.

782
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,129
A lot?

783
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,130
it's the worst feeling in the world,
losing a child.

784
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,540
Sorry, lose a child?

785
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,909
Yes.

786
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,579
She had a child?

787
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,580
But you didn't know. You are her friend.

788
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:09,710
No, we just met.

789
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,950
I thought you were.

790
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,480
Pour it in...

791
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:49,490
Slowly...

792
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:58,190
I'll knead this.

793
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,839
More?

794
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,739
That looks good.

795
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,740
Wait...

796
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,860
One, two...

797
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,929
Got it!

798
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,930
Thanks.

799
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:49,549
Now what?

800
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,550
Here.

801
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:00,390
That's good.

802
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,100
Excuse me...

803
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,870
There. It's done.

804
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,480
Those are beautiful.

805
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,480
Oh...

806
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,490
...he left.

807
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,020
He left? He's gone?

808
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,830
Someone called him 20 minutes ago...

809
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,560
...and he ran out.

810
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,570
He ran out?

811
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Did he say anything?

812
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,640
No. Nothing.

813
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:01,380
I see.

814
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,780
OK?

815
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,820
We should go.

816
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,530
Sunset in Paris is romantic.

817
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,900
'Sunset in Paris is romantic.'

818
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:30,140
Suzume loves Kango.

819
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,510
'Suzume loves Kango.'

820
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:38,510
She cries when he's not there.

821
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,980
'She cries when he's not there.'

822
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:45,690
But Kango is forgetting Suzume.

823
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,559
What do you mean?

824
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,560
'Kango is forgetting Suzume.'
Say that in French.

825
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,399
No.

826
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,400
The translation machine
is out of order. 'Beep'.

827
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,110
'Beep' sounds more like
an answering machine.

828
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:08,310
Kango...

829
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:11,410
When my phone says 'Leave a message
after the tone,' what comes then?

830
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:15,819
'Beep'.

831
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:18,820
I say that myself.

832
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:22,290
People laugh.

833
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,430
You didn't know that.

834
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,070
Lately you don't phone.

835
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:35,270
You don't phone me much.

836
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,640
Don't get mad.

837
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,340
Meow...not.

838
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,309
The embassy called.

839
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,349
Yeah?

840
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:18,350
Tokyo faxed them
a copy of my family register.

841
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,720
They needed it for my travel document.
They called me...

842
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,590
...and I went to get it.

843
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,360
I thought you'd gone!

844
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:37,799
Oh...sorry.

845
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,800
I'll make tea.

846
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:46,440
You didn't go to the party?

847
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,450
I didn't feel like it.
She left some food.

848
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,589
Yeah?

849
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,590
It's probably in full swing now.

850
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:04,659
Let's have a party here, then.

851
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,660
Just the two of us.

852
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Why not?

853
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:14,369
This fills you up!

854
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,039
I won't waste it.

855
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,409
It's made right.

856
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,739
It's good!

857
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,740
It's good.

858
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:25,319
You made it, not me.

859
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,249
But no more.

860
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,049
I'm full.

861
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,050
Yeah.

862
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,860
You have to go back...

863
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,569
To the hotel.

864
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,939
Yeah.

865
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,940
I haven't stayed there yet.

866
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,709
That's a waste of money.

867
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,710
I forget the name again.

868
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,080
Oh, right... uh...

869
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,120
I'll write it down.

870
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,540
What was it?

871
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:26,610
It's a long name. Now I forget.

872
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,580
Have you really forgotten?

873
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:38,219
Let's drink some more.

874
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,759
More?

875
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,059
For now, let's drink.

876
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:45,060
Sure.

877
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,400
Bordeaux or Medoc?

878
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,209
Can you play?

879
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:01,210
No.

880
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,849
Sure you can!

881
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:08,850
We had a band in school,
so I know a few chords.

882
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,389
A popularity ploy.

883
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:16,759
How did you know?

884
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,760
People who play guitar
or sing...

885
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:22,930
Any boy who wants to be popular
is obliged to be in a band.

886
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,100
Maybe not 'obliged'.

887
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:30,110
'Obliged to be'?
How do you say that in French?

888
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:37,210
I don't know. I'm Japanese.

889
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:45,459
One day I reached a turning point.

890
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,759
What?

891
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,760
I switched from guitar to camera.

892
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,129
And?

893
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:54,130
People liked that better.

894
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:59,270
I won a prize,
and I got too confident.

895
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,339
Like that?

896
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:06,340
Not quite.

897
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,010
Like that.

898
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:13,020
I thought I'd make a living at it,
so after university I just did that.

899
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,960
That was brave.

900
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:23,460
But...

901
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,070
...it's a cold, cruel world.

902
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,700
I ended up working part-time
at Sukiya.

903
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,380
Do you know it?

904
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,910
Beef-bowl?

905
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,920
A chain, like Yoshinoya.

906
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,449
Film costs money.

907
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:52,450
I ate rice with bean sprouts
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

908
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:58,060
With citrus sauce,
then soy, then Worcestershire.

909
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,029
Are you listening?

910
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,030
I tried every taste variation
I could think of.

911
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,240
But bean sprouts are bean sprouts.

912
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,909
Still OK?

913
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:16,710
I'll have some more.

914
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,479
Thanks.

915
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,480
Then one day...

916
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,189
Is that too loud?

917
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:28,359
No. Add in the music.

918
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,360
Then a pro photographer
who used me sometimes...

919
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:36,170
...got sick and asked me
to sub for him...

920
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,440
...for a musician's
publicity photographs.

921
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:43,139
And they loved it?

922
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,140
Not so much the public
as the musician herself.

923
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:50,410
Then what? I took lots of stuff.
Publicity stills...

924
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,550
...advertising, CD jackets...

925
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:58,450
Then came actresses and so on
that she knew.

926
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,789
Yeah, that can happen.

927
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:04,759
And before I knew it...

928
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,760
...I was the best
retouching photographer around.

929
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,199
Retouching?

930
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,039
Yeah. You know
what it's like now.

931
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,040
It's all digital.

932
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:21,140
Spots, wrinkles, bags under the eyes.
The three-piece set.

933
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:26,180
If everything's right, you can even
change the shape of the face.

934
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:31,990
I'm more like a Takasu Clinic
than a photographer.

935
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:41,199
Cosmetic surgery.
I know the Takasu Clinic.

936
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,369
That's not why I stopped.

937
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,399
I was waiting.

938
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,139
So if you ask me...

939
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,140
...what pictures
I'm most confident about...

940
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:55,510
...I'd probably say the ones I took
when I was eating bean sprouts.

941
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,720
I don't know... it's like back then
I was in charge of my photographs.

942
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:07,589
Now my clients are.

943
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:08,589
Really?

944
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,490
For example...

945
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,500
I was doing a soft-drink poster
down in Okinawa.

946
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:18,530
The sky was so blue
it made your eyes sting.

947
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,240
But they wanted me to make it blue
right up to where the sun was.

948
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:30,010
And you know, Aoi-san,
a real sky...

949
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:33,350
...isn't blue right around the sun.

950
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:37,089
It's white.

951
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:40,090
But they wanted me to make
the whole thing blue.

952
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,960
It's like all they knew was
'the sky is blue'.

953
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:49,430
Do they want it to look painted?
The sky isn't like that!

954
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,080
Like that?

955
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:08,350
Exactly. Just like that.

956
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,120
But...

957
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:17,130
...I wanted the work.

958
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:21,030
Whenever one of my actresses
or woman editors calls me...

959
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:25,369
...no matter when or where,
I hurry right over.

960
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:28,039
Like a host.

961
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,509
That's not my plan for you.

962
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:32,179
Sorry?

963
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,180
I don't have a thing for hosts
or younger men.

964
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:39,650
That's not what I'm saying.
Don't take it like that.

965
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:42,950
You're not like those people
at all.

966
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,560
You're just...

967
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:58,130
...a little bit to one side
of absolute perfection.

968
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,940
I'm told that a lot.
Maybe I was born that way.

969
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:10,350
I don't know about that...

970
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:14,650
Like my tuning's wonky.
Does that bother you?

971
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,550
You're not 'wonky'.
'Laid-back', maybe.

972
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,430
I shouldn't say this
about someone older, but...

973
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:28,899
...you're cute.

974
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,900
'Cute'?

975
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:37,070
Wow! I haven't heard that
for a century.

976
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:39,209
You aren't that old.

977
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:42,210
Sorry.

978
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:46,550
I'm not all that good, so if I don't
spend all my time on my work...

979
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:52,490
...I can't make ends meet.

980
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,830
So the girlfriend I'd had for years
left me.

981
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,360
That was a come-on.

982
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,730
I said I'm single.

983
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,939
Forget it.

984
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,940
So anyway, because of that
I'm basically kind of miserable.

985
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,379
I started...

986
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:18,380
...wanting to take pictures
only I could take.

987
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,620
Like everyone else, the dream was
to put out books and have exhibitions.

988
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:29,930
But right now
I'm nothing but a yes-man...

989
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:33,830
...running around being nice
to the people who use me.

990
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,999
Really?

991
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,769
I'm only in Paris to be...

992
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,770
What did you call it?
The 'luck brother'.

993
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,210
The luck brother.

994
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,220
That's fine as far as it goes...

995
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:56,850
...but the whole situation
just irritates me.

996
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:00,790
I was thinking I'd like to
just pack it all in...

997
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:05,690
...but when my passport got wrecked,
the first thing I thought of was work.

998
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:18,170
I've been tamed.

999
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:23,110
I can't go forward,
and I can't go back.

1000
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,920
Surely something will work out.

1001
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,400
You can still take
your own photographs.

1002
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:46,430
Someone who's tried hard once
can always do it again.

1003
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:54,140
I'm no expert, but I'd love to see...

1004
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:58,550
...your exhibition.

1005
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,260
Want more cheese?
And some dried raisins?

1006
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:10,590
Yeah, sure.

1007
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,800
Shall we go on to
the 2nd movement?

1008
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,139
What's the chord?

1009
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,309
Of what?

1010
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:31,310
The Story of Aoi-san.

1011
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,549
Forget my story.

1012
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:37,550
I can't tell it as well.

1013
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,320
Too bad.

1014
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:52,430
Good night, Sen.
I'm going to bed.

1015
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:19,230
Hey, Sen...

1016
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:24,270
Why are you sleeping there?

1017
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,800
I thought you'd gone.

1018
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:33,810
Come here.

1019
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:38,780
OK, don't.

1020
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,069
May I?

1021
01:17:57,070 --> 01:18:00,070
Sure.

1022
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:03,870
What?

1023
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,139
Isn't this fun?

1024
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,140
When I started photography,
I took up climbing...

1025
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,279
...and bought a sleeping bag.

1026
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,280
The scenery changes
with where you sleep...

1027
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:19,450
...even in the same room.

1028
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:24,790
This isn't any fun.

1029
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Yours was my first bathtub.

1030
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,200
You're weird.

1031
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,440
My arms need to be
more than twice as long.

1032
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,480
It's like trying to hold
a sumo wrestler.

1033
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:46,350
No, thanks.

1034
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:51,150
I'm...

1035
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:57,260
No, I'm scared to say.

1036
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,670
I'm not scared to hear.

1037
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,239
No?

1038
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:10,240
No.

1039
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:15,849
OK.

1040
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,850
About me.

1041
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:27,690
I like art.

1042
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:32,730
When I finished art school,
I got a job in a gallery.

1043
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,270
The Japanese economy was still good,
and it had a branch here.

1044
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,540
I studied French real hard,
and got hired here.

1045
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:50,010
A man the gallery dealt with
was a local artist.

1046
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,519
French?

1047
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,219
Yeah.

1048
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:02,220
Maybe I was lonely in a new place.
We got married right away.

1049
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:13,100
But this guy had girls everywhere.

1050
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,840
I didn't like being cheated on...

1051
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,510
...so we got a divorce.

1052
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:40,860
And I quit the gallery, too,
and got a job with a company...

1053
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:43,870
...that published free papers.

1054
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,710
I had my cat.

1055
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:56,710
But he went, so it was just me.

1056
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:02,620
Without Guru or Shion, all alone.

1057
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,360
'Shion'?

1058
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,200
Shion was my baby.

1059
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,840
I heard about that.

1060
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,349
Joanne?

1061
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:34,350
She thought we were old friends.

1062
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,560
When I left my husband,
I was pregnant.

1063
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,300
I had...

1064
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:58,870
...a boy.

1065
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:03,180
The cutest little angel.

1066
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,080
But he was never healthy.

1067
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,120
He only lived five years.

1068
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:18,730
The poor thing.

1069
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:32,170
Shion named Guru.

1070
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,679
Shion played the piano.

1071
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,680
When Guru heard him playing
that Minuet and Trio...

1072
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:44,150
...he'd come straight home,
no matter where he was.

1073
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,720
Like magic.

1074
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,600
Shion found Guru
and brought him home.

1075
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,040
He came in with the kitten
in both his bony little hands...

1076
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:12,710
...and stood right there.

1077
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,950
'Mama, can we keep him?'
he said.

1078
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,660
'He'll die.

1079
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,760
'The poor cat!'

1080
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,040
Sorry.

1081
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
After he died,
I couldn't work for a long time.

1082
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,480
I couldn't move forward.

1083
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,260
Aoi-san...

1084
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,930
Yes?

1085
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:35,830
An idea.

1086
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:42,370
Come in here.

1087
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:17,770
Um...

1088
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,280
Yes?

1089
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:25,850
Closer.

1090
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:29,650
OK.

1091
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:33,990
As close as we can get.

1092
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,830
OK.

1093
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:06,659
Sorry. I woke you up.

1094
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:07,820
What's that?

1095
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,830
Scrambled eggs.
I thought I'd make breakfast.

1096
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,700
This is how you separate
the yolks from the white.

1097
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,800
You can do that?

1098
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,680
You go home tomorrow.
What are you doing today?

1099
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,119
I don't know...

1100
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,319
What are your plans?

1101
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,320
My plans are work.
My Easter egg special.

1102
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,400
I'll come with you.

1103
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:53,369
It's around here.

1104
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:56,370
Somewhere.

1105
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:02,210
Huge!

1106
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,750
Beautiful! That vapor trail.

1107
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:11,959
Yeah.

1108
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,960
Here it is.

1109
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,429
Hello.

1110
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:20,359
I'm from the Japanese paper.

1111
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,360
Leopaul, and my colleague Marion.

1112
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:26,369
I'm Aoi, and the photographer is Sen.

1113
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:28,000
Hello.

1114
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:30,339
You speak French well.

1115
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:32,239
'You speak French well.'

1116
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,240
These are small eggs.

1117
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,250
Made here, in different colors.

1118
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,289
Beautiful!

1119
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:47,290
Wow!

1120
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:57,030
Cute!

1121
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,769
What?

1122
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:04,609
I wore these again.

1123
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:07,610
You're right.

1124
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:11,010
I have to buy new shoes.

1125
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,320
Is there anywhere
you'd like to go?

1126
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:25,359
Somewhere I'd like to go?

1127
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,929
I know!

1128
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,929
When I first met you...

1129
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,930
...I asked you your favorite place
and you wouldn't tell me.

1130
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,139
There.

1131
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:41,140
But...

1132
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,450
If you don't want to, we could try
the Louvre, or the Quai d'Orsay.

1133
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:50,349
Let's go.

1134
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:53,059
To my favorite place.

1135
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:56,060
It's not a secret or anything?

1136
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:59,690
Well, yes...

1137
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,699
By boat?

1138
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:06,700
Yep. Right up to the source
of the Amazon.

1139
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:10,209
This is a sight-seeing boat!

1140
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:13,210
You're not fooled?

1141
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,180
Right there.
That's where we met.

1142
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:02,620
The passport incident.
That seems a long time ago now.

1143
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:07,290
There's Notre Dame.

1144
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,900
The day before yesterday, wasn't it?

1145
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:16,770
We've been together ever since.

1146
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:20,640
That's right.

1147
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:27,079
Hey, Sen...

1148
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,389
That bridge...

1149
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:32,390
...is the Pont Marie.

1150
01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:35,690
If you make a wish under it,
it comes true.

1151
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,400
It only works for lovers, though.

1152
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,130
Limited to lovers?

1153
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:48,140
I don't think it's a law...

1154
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:53,670
Let's pretend to be lovers, then.

1155
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,379
Pretend?

1156
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:59,380
Or our wishes won't come true.

1157
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:31,910
What did you wish for?

1158
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:36,620
Not telling.

1159
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:40,320
Maybe we were wishing for
the same thing.

1160
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:46,230
Let's just stay like this for a while.

1161
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,260
It's not fair.

1162
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:50,699
Who, me?

1163
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,700
Both of us.

1164
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,800
Both of us?

1165
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,880
Over there.

1166
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,689
I like that.

1167
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:13,989
The Eiffel Tower?

1168
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:16,359
Yeah.

1169
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:19,360
Although I'll admit
it's kind of a cliché.

1170
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:24,470
No, it's not.

1171
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,400
So much has happened
since I came here...

1172
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:32,270
...but the Eiffel's always there.

1173
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:35,879
The other buildings are low...

1174
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,880
...so you can see the Eiffel Tower
from anywhere.

1175
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:45,350
So it's special to you?

1176
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:49,220
Not 'special'.

1177
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:55,330
It's just always there.

1178
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,840
People go away.

1179
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,980
I wish I could be your Eiffel.

1180
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:22,690
Is that a confession of love?

1181
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:27,260
Hmm...

1182
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:31,730
Don't say that when you're leaving.

1183
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:35,370
I wish I wasn't.

1184
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:39,870
Then stay.

1185
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,280
Sorry.

1186
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:01,730
It's OK. I've still got him.

1187
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:10,109
Kango...

1188
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:13,110
I'm going home.

1189
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,780
All of a sudden?
I'm just making dinner.

1190
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:21,080
Kango...

1191
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:24,650
...one last request.

1192
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:29,460
Request?

1193
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:33,660
It's why I came.

1194
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:39,100
Look at me.

1195
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:54,050
I want you...

1196
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:01,060
...to marry me.

1197
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:05,530
What brought this on?

1198
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:13,930
It's like...

1199
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:17,440
...in the six months
since you came to Paris...

1200
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:24,780
...I can't breathe any more.
It's like the air in Tokyo...

1201
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:30,649
...is too thin.

1202
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:33,650
Can't we just go on like we are?

1203
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:37,790
I'm a spoiled brat
and I'm lonely.

1204
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,360
I need someone.

1205
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:47,469
You're the same.

1206
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:50,470
How?

1207
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:55,010
The way we're going, we'll fall apart.

1208
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:01,250
So marry me.

1209
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:06,050
I can come over here,
or you can come back.

1210
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,360
Whoa, whoa, wait.
How can I put this?

1211
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:17,030
There's a lot of things
you haven't thought about.

1212
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:18,999
I have.

1213
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Like what?
Like how we'd both survive?

1214
01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:26,139
Or how about, like...

1215
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:28,609
...my dream?

1216
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:30,279
We can do it!

1217
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,149
I think you're being naive.

1218
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,049
Why?

1219
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:37,050
I'm here for a reason.

1220
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:40,490
So? I'll be here, too.

1221
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:50,300
No, wait a minute...

1222
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,280
Marry me.

1223
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:16,590
Sorry.

1224
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:20,590
I can't do that.

1225
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:34,580
I'll end it.

1226
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:38,550
I'll break up with you.

1227
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,020
Well, if that's how it has to be...

1228
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,159
Stupid!

1229
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:53,330
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

1230
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:14,310
Kango...

1231
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:27,730
...be famous.

1232
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,720
Suzume...

1233
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:58,390
Look...

1234
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:04,230
So that's it?
Wait a minute...

1235
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:09,970
We're through?

1236
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:22,380
Work hard.

1237
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:22,240
Kango!

1238
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:38,330
Aoi-san...

1239
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:41,529
A picture.

1240
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,629
Of me?

1241
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:46,630
That won't be much of a picture.

1242
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,079
Don't!

1243
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:00,080
It's out of focus...

1244
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:19,070
Turn this way for a second.

1245
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:25,509
Stop it!

1246
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:28,510
That was good.

1247
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,800
Let's see...

1248
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:57,469
Line up with it.

1249
01:41:57,470 --> 01:42:00,470
With the Tower?

1250
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:04,780
You and the Eiffel Tower
are the real Paris for me.

1251
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:37,940
Was I smiling?

1252
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:41,450
Yes, you were.

1253
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:20,850
L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

1254
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,830
Your hotel.

1255
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:31,630
I knew it all along.

1256
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:35,870
I pretended I'd forgotten.
I'll write it down.

1257
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:06,470
There.

1258
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:53,180
Sorry.

1259
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:12,749
Hello.

1260
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,679
Hello. I have a package for you.

1261
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:17,680
Sign here.

1262
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:23,020
All right.

1263
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:26,030
Thank you. Have a good day.

1264
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:06,300
To Aoi-san
