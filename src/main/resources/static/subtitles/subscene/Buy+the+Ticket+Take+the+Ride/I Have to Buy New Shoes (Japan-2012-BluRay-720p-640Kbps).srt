I HAVE TO BUY NEW SHOES

9
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,939
Hey, why don't you take a picture?

10
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,739
A picture?

11
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,740
OK...

12
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,149
Let's go over by the river.

13
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,150
Excuse me, Turn right over there
and down to the river.

14
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,320
River? What river?

15
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,389
The Seine?

16
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,029
Oh, I've heard of that.

17
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,899
You have, huh?

18
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,129
It's famous, right?

19
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,299
Paris, the Seine...

20
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,530
Yeah, it's big.

21
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,540
Here?

22
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,940
Yeah, yeah. Great.

23
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,149
This is great!

24
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,389
Yeah.

25
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,459
Let's take a picture.

26
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,189
That building's famous.

27
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,159
Notre Dame.

28
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,359
Uh-huh.

29
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,859
Get that in, too.

30
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,729
With you?

31
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,539
OK, pose...

32
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,969
Let me see.

33
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,639
I think I got it all...

34
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Now we're here,
let's take a real picture.

35
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,649
With the camera you hold like this...

36
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,650
The Hasselblad?
Let's not get that out now.

37
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,849
It's OK. I'll get it.

38
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,850
What's gotten into you?

39
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,890
That's a great sky!

40
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,329
Sen, here it is!

41
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,330
It's OK, I'll get it.

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Let's see...

43
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,730
OK...

44
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,899
Drive!

45
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,869
Thanks for coming out, Sen!

46
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,870
Now it's time for brother and sister
to part ways! 'Bye!

47
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,950
Hey, wait! Suzume! Suzume!

48
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,220
Made it!

49
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,090
Great!

50
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
What is she up to?!

51
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,290
Damn it!

52
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,409
OK, I'll see you at 2, then.

53
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,909
I'm looking forward to it. See you.

54
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,910
Thanks.

55
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Are you ok?

56
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,429
I'm fine. I just tripped.

57
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,829
Japanese?

58
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,269
Yes. Hello.

59
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,270
Hello.

60
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,370
Look...

61
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,079
You're not hurt?

62
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,080
No, I just sort of went over.

63
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,019
I think I stepped on that.

64
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,389
It's my passport.

65
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,390
What?

66
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,799
Don't look.

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I think I'd better.

68
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,139
It'll be OK.

69
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,140
I don't know about that.
You should check with the embassy.

70
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,379
The embassy?

71
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,380
Avenue Hoche, between Courcelles
and Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ©.

72
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,750
I'd take you there,
but I'm in a hurry.

73
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I'll write the address.

74
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,730
Do you live here?

75
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,499
Yes.

76
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I've been here a while,
but I'm still not used to it.

77
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,310
There.

78
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,209
That's the address.

79
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,649
And...

80
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,579
...my card.

81
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,580
It's a free paper for Japanese.

82
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,019
You're the editor?

83
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,919
It's pretty small.

84
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,459
That's my number.

85
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,460
Let me know what happens.

86
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,599
Or for any other problems.

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,869
Thank you.

88
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,869
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,339
Not at all.

90
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,340
You're in a hurry, right?

91
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,479
Excuse me!

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,779
You forgot this.

93
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,780
Oh.

94
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,690
Wait...

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think I have something...

96
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,009
Here.

97
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,309
Krazy Glue!

98
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,679
This should hold it.

99
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,679
For a while.

100
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Yeah.

101
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,349
Ms 'Teshigawara'?

102
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,350
Yes, but call me Aoi.
'Teshigawara' is hard to say.

103
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,290
I'm Sen Yagami. Call me Sen.

104
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,760
OK, 'Yagami' is easy.

105
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,799
Right.

106
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,699
Is there anywhere here
you'd recommend?

107
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,369
Sorry?

108
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,370
Your favorite place in Paris.

109
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,710
Where would that be?

110
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,379
Oh...

111
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,649
Where?

112
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,119
It's nowhere special.

113
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,619
I see...

114
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,620
Hang on...

115
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,029
That should do it.

116
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,660
Thank you.

117
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,670
Try it.

118
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,809
It fits!

119
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,810
I guess it should,
since it's my shoe.

120
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,579
Good luck with your work.

121
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,619
Right.

122
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,419
And with your passport.

123
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
I'll do my best.

124
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,749
My passport...

125
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,189
Next window, please.

126
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,889
Thanks.

127
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,189
Hello.

128
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,190
Chocolate eggs came in the 1 800s.

129
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,859
Before that...

130
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,860
...they were made at home...

131
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,339
...hand-painted.

132
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,340
First they were boiled very hard.

133
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,969
Or else...

134
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,970
...you take the egg...

135
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,180
...put a small hole in both ends...

136
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,980
...and blow hard.

137
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,259
Three eggs and you're red in the face.

138
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,929
Yes.

139
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,359
So...

140
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,199
...I'm not speaking too fast?

141
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,229
No, I understand.

142
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,669
May I take pictures?

143
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,670
Of course.

144
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,110
The Easter-egg hunt is a tradition.

145
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Parents hide eggs outside...

146
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
...like gifts under a Christmas tree.

147
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,490
The children go and hunt for them.

148
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,089
I'd always take hours to find mine.

149
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,090
My father didn't want it to be easy.

150
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I'd start crying...it was horrible.

151
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,770
But that's what got me into this work.

152
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,910
And here we are.

153
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,839
Want my picture?

154
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,079
Sure.

155
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Let's do it.

156
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,449
Ready.

157
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,619
Three, two...

158
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,349
Wait.

159
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,350
Three, two, one...

160
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,459
How about like this?

161
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,600
One more.

162
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,399
Great.

163
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Fantastic.

164
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,319
Thank you.

165
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,320
My pleasure.

166
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,489
Your phone.

167
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,299
Got it. Goodbye.

168
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Sayonara.

169
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,570
...leave a message after the tone.

170
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,070
Her message is all in French...

171
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Please leave a message.

172
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,010
Uh, it's Yagami.

173
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,520
The passport looks like it's OK.

174
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,690
I just thought I'd tell you.

175
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Where do you want to go please?
Just a moment please.

176
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,239
That note...

177
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Where is it?

178
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm sorry I don't know where to go.
Please let me out. Sorry.

179
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,129
This is Suzume.

180
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,669
Please leave a message after the tone.

181
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,670
Leave a message,
or you'll make me cry. 'Beep'.

182
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,810
Damn it, Suzume! You took the note
with the name of the hotel!

183
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Call me, will you?

184
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,730
What the hell do you think
you're doing, anyway?!

185
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,439
Hello?

186
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,570
Um...

187
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Yes?

188
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,809
Uh...

189
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,810
...we met earlier.

190
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Uh, yes...Aoi-san,
Aoi Teshigawara.

191
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,089
Is something wrong?

192
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,359
No, that was something else.

193
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,360
A mistake.

194
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,729
Let me explain.

195
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,730
My sister wanted to come to Paris,
and she dragged me here...

196
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,940
...then she dumped me
by the Seine.

197
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,109
So anyway...

198
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,109
...I'm here with her.
I mean, our relationship isn't...

199
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,809
...weird or anything...

200
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,919
Hey, hey, hey...

201
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,980
...calm down.

202
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,789
Yeah, OK.

203
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,419
You're with your sister...

204
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,259
Yes.

205
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,260
You got dragged here,
and got dumped by the Seine?

206
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Yeah, that's right.
Then I met you...

207
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,800
...and you tromped
all over my passport.

208
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
You called me, I believe...

209
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,410
Oh yeah, right. They can't
replace my passport right away...

210
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,310
...but they said
they'd give me a travel document.

211
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,449
They did?

212
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,189
Yeah. So I can...

213
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,190
...get back to Japan OK.
Thank you.

214
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Not at all. Thanks for calling.

215
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,329
Not at all.

216
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,029
Oh, is your shoe OK?

217
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,030
I'd forgotten.
It's fine, no problem at all.

218
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,609
That's good.

219
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,039
Enjoy your stay.

220
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,909
Thank you.

221
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,309
Oh, hello?

222
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,449
Yes?

223
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,450
My sister took the memo
with the name of our hotel.

224
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,789
Oh, dear.

225
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,790
I've completely forgotten
its name.

226
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,130
There was a reason
she chose it, though.

227
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,099
Yes?

228
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Hotels give you
a basket of fruit, right?

229
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,899
Yes, in your room.

230
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Well, this hotel puts out
pastries, not fruit.

231
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,140
They're popular in Paris,
'po' something.

232
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
'Po' something?

233
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,220
My sister said it evolved from
a choux cream puff.

234
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,489
'Popelini'?

235
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,490
Yeah... something like that,
I'm not sure.

236
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,030
That's probably it. A pÃ¢tissiÃ¨re
from LadurÃ©e makes them.

237
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,440
'LadurÃ©e'? I think
I've heard of that.

238
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,370
They make macaroni
or something like that, right?

239
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,410
'Macaroons', Mr Yagami.

240
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,949
Yes, that's what I meant.

241
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,089
I did an article on Popelini.

242
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,090
I'll call and ask who they supply.

243
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,290
The reservation's
in your sister's name?

244
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Yes. Her name's
Suzume Yagami.

245
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,899
'Sparrow'?

246
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,900
It's written with the characters
'bell' and 'love'.

247
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,440
OK. Wait there.
I'll call you back.

248
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,779
OK, thanks.

249
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,749
I found it.

250
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,079
You did?

251
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,080
'L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans'.

252
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,919
I called...

253
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
...and there's a reservation
under your sister's name.

254
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Great! Thanks a lot.

255
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,060
No problem.
It's near the Louvre Museum.

256
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,469
Where are you?

257
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,969
Right now I can see...

258
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,970
...the Arc de Triomphe.

259
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,570
You can probably walk from there.

260
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,240
I can?

261
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,249
Will you walk?

262
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,379
Sure, no problem.

263
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,919
I'll guide you.

264
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,889
No, I'll be fine.

265
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,890
It's no problem.
If you can see the Arc...

266
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,390
...are you on the street
the embassy's on?

267
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,129
Yes.

268
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,130
Then walk to
the Arc de Triomphe.

269
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,100
To the Arc...

270
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,339
Are you there?

271
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,340
I can't walk that fast.
I can't run that far, either.

272
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,380
I'm kidding. Just a bit of humor.

273
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,819
Right.

274
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,820
OK, I'm at the Arc de Triomphe.

275
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,390
There's a road that goes
right around it, isn't there.

276
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,959
Yes, there is.

277
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,729
Go left there.

278
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,730
OK, I'm going left.

279
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Could you go to where
you're right in front of it?

280
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,310
Sure.

281
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
It's really something, isn't it.

282
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,789
Very powerful.

283
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,759
They really knew how to build
back then.

284
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
I can see why
it's a big tourist draw.

285
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Streets radiate out from it
in all directions.

286
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,140
From above they make
a star pattern.

287
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,540
That's Place de l'Ãtoile,
'the square of the star'.

288
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,180
'The square of the star'?
That's cool.

289
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,850
I'm almost in front of it now.

290
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,449
I'm there.

291
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,450
OK, then turn right...

292
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,519
No, I mean left.

293
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,159
Left?

294
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Now I'm facing back
the way I just came.

295
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,929
No, just turn 90 degrees.

296
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,869
90 degrees left.

297
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,499
Left...OK, I've turned left.

298
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Can you see a big street
in front of you?

299
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,539
Yes, I can.

300
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,540
That's Avenue des Champs ÃlysÃ©es.

301
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,210
Oh...Champs ÃlysÃ©es.

302
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,819
Humor.

303
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Right. OK, for now
go straight along that street.

304
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,529
Go straight.

305
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,529
It's a long street.

306
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,099
Yes, it's long.

307
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Shall I be your tour guide?

308
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,839
Sorry?

309
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,840
The avenue is said to be
the world's most beautiful street.

310
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
The main Louis Vuitton store...

311
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,110
...is a famous landmark.

312
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,550
People take pictures there,
and some even pray to it.

313
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,860
They do?

314
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,530
You should be coming to
the end of the avenue.

315
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,770
Yeah, I'm coming to a kind of
square or something.

316
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,840
OK, that's Place de la Concorde.

317
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Sorry, Aoi-san,
but could I take a break?

318
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Sure, go ahead.

319
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,949
Hello?

320
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,019
Yes?

321
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,020
The tour's fun, but why don't you
tell me something about yourself?

322
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,999
About me?

323
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,799
Yeah.

324
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
A guided tour of Aoi-san.

325
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,840
That wouldn't be much fun.
There's nothing to tell.

326
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,910
But you, Sen-san...

327
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,380
I almost called you 'Masao'.

328
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,650
Sorry.

329
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,119
That's OK.

330
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,120
My Mom loves Masao Sen's singing.

331
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,759
That's eccentric.

332
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Her tastes aren't all that elevated.

333
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,539
Now take your next right.

334
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,369
Right, OK.

335
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,370
Do you see a gold statue?
That's Joan of Arc.

336
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,179
A gold statue. Got it.

337
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Your hotel's on the left.
L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

338
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,420
OK, I'm walking along
some sort of gallery.

339
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,890
I just go straight?
I'm facing the statue.

340
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,499
That's right.

341
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Left of the statue...

342
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Yep, there it is.
There's the hotel.

343
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,640
Thank you for taking
so much time.

344
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,409
Not at all.

345
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,849
Well, then...

346
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,850
Stay on the line as you go in.

347
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,919
Turn around.

348
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,989
Where?

349
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,990
I'm not there yet?

350
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,830
You came here?

351
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,739
I was close by.

352
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,739
Thank you.

353
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,740
Oh, you've got luggage!
I'm sorry I made you walk.

354
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,609
It was good exercise.

355
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,610
That's the front desk?

356
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,780
I'll go check in, then.

357
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,620
Excuse me, I have a reservation.
Can I check in?

358
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,390
Hello, welcome to Regina Hotel.
What is your name, please?

359
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,829
Suzume Yagami.

360
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,550
Mr Suzume. Yes I've got your reservation, I need
to use your credit card. Thank you very much.

361
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,040
If it's all right with you...

362
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,479
...and if you're finished work...

363
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,480
...could I buy you dinner?

364
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,520
I don't know any restaurants,
and you could show me one.

365
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,159
Are you hungry?

366
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,859
I haven't eaten since lunch.

367
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Oh, dear!

368
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,310
Woof!

369
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,820
Guess who's here.

370
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,350
I was lonely.

371
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,290
Kango!

372
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,429
Welcome.

373
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,430
Cheers.

374
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,269
Welcome to Paris.

375
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,479
Thanks for the help.

376
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,480
So you're a photographer?

377
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,610
Sort of.

378
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,620
My paper's kind of dull.

379
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,489
Would you like to see it?

380
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,689
Sure. How dull can it be?

381
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,690
Nothing.

382
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,360
You can have that.
There's lots of places in it.

383
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,730
Right, it's in Japanese...

384
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,839
I wrote that one.

385
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,339
Cool.

386
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,340
I did an interview
after I met you.

387
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,749
An interview about what?

388
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,449
A restaurant?

389
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,949
Eggs.

390
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,219
Eggs?

391
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,949
Easter eggs. The painted ones.

392
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,950
Oh, those.

393
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,529
I took pictures.

394
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,530
Want to see?

395
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,140
They're beautiful.

396
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,609
So you write and take pictures?

397
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,610
Yes. I can't afford a photographer.

398
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,810
I see.

399
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,080
I'd like to see your stuff.

400
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,689
Sure.

401
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,690
Just a minute...

402
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,690
Push on the right side.

403
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,609
She's cute.

404
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,610
That's my sister.
I hate how she poses.

405
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Is that what they call a 'gotcha-face'?

406
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,750
Not quite.

407
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,680
I guess living here
it's hard to keep up with new slang.

408
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,190
You're right.
I feel like Rip van Winkle.

409
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Your sister's pretty.

410
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,160
I wonder what she's up to.

411
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,669
You can sit down.

412
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,509
OK.

413
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,510
That's my latest.

414
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,449
Why are they naked?

415
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,450
Not telling.

416
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,150
Paris is 1 0,000 kilometers
from Japan.

417
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,659
Yeah?

418
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,859
Yeah.

419
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,860
It's 1 2 hours by plane.

420
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,100
And 1 1 whole days by ship.

421
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,670
Why are you laughing?
I looked this up, so listen!

422
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,009
OK.

423
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,010
1 0,000km...

424
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,049
5,000...

425
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,149
5,000 already?

426
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,150
OK...

427
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,420
...500 meters.

428
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,159
You're getting closer...

429
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,160
OK...

430
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,139
...40 centimeters.

431
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,140
40cm...

432
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,079
4cm...

433
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,149
4cm?

434
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:50,150
My turn...

435
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,049
Fooled ya!

436
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,450
You're no fun!
I'm not playing with you any more.

437
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,460
Stop sulking.

438
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,399
Sorry.

439
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,299
I'm glad you're here.

440
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,300
It was a long trip.

441
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,310
You've got to watch your step here.

442
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Let's keep going!

443
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,750
Just kidding.

444
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,850
I could drink a bit more.

445
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,090
Then come with me,
if you like.

446
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,199
I treat.

447
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,200
I will treat. I have treated before.

448
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,100
I'm forgetting Japanese.

449
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,110
Are you drunk?

450
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,340
Who, me?

451
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Paris! What a place!

452
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Here?

453
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,699
Here we go again.

454
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Cheers.

455
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,909
That's good.

456
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,839
Really?

457
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,139
Try it.

458
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,309
May I?

459
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,310
OK.

460
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,649
That is good.

461
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,650
Have some more.

462
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,659
Want to trade?

463
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,660
It's good, but it's too strong.

464
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,630
Tell me more about your sister.

465
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,539
You're interested in her?

466
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,540
I'm jealous that she's crazy enough
to take off like that.

467
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,640
She has the name for it.

468
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,650
If only I had a name like...

469
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,280
...'sparrow'.

470
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,620
But why did she have to bring you
to Paris and then leave you?

471
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Why not just come herself?

472
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,499
I don't like talking about it...

473
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,199
Forget it, then.

474
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,200
But maybe I will.

475
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,909
Which is it?

476
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,910
She forced me to bring her.

477
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,649
You paid?

478
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,650
She's got a job.
I made her at least pay half.

479
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,490
Why did she bring you?

480
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,419
For good luck.

481
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,389
Good luck?

482
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,390
I always have to be there
when it's important.

483
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,160
University entrance exams,
job interviews, field days...

484
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,730
Or when her pet hamster
had surgery.

485
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,339
If I'm there, things go well.

486
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,340
And you're delighted to be there...

487
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,009
No, I'm not.

488
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,849
Sorry. It's just that she's so pretty.

489
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,019
There's more to it than that.

490
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,020
It started when she was born.

491
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,890
Her birth day...when she was born.
This is getting interesting.

492
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,589
It's not that special.

493
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,429
When Mom had Suzume...

494
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,430
...she needed a Cesarian.
It was touch and go.

495
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Her water had broken
long before her due date...

496
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,039
...so it was an emergency delivery.

497
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,040
It looked like things
weren't going to work out.

498
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,550
My father rushed to the hospital,
and I went to my grandmother's.

499
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,820
That's when we knew it was a girl.
Mom said the baby was calling me.

500
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Mom said to bring me from Grandma's
because the baby inside her wanted me.

501
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,870
So I was brought to the hospital
while my mother was in labor.

502
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,040
I sat out in this kind of corridor
and waited for seven whole hours.

503
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,149
I see.

504
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,150
In the end, my sister was fine.

505
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,849
That's great.

506
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,850
So we've heard this story
over and over again...

507
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,189
Oh, thanks.

508
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,190
The story of Suzume and me.

509
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,930
We've been ground into each other.

510
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,300
So whenever she has something,
I have to be there.

511
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,199
Now she doesn't even tell me why.

512
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
I'm just summoned to be there.

513
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,310
Which means she has
something important in Paris.

514
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,049
Probably.

515
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,980
What could that be, I wonder.

516
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,990
Yeah!

517
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,220
The luck brother.

518
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,889
What?

519
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,890
The brother who brings
good luck.

520
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,899
Me?

521
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,429
Yeah, it's amazing. I'm like a shrine
she visits for every big step.

522
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,899
Safe birth...

523
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,900
...success at school, a job...

524
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,380
...and love. I wonder if that's
what this is all about.

525
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,679
I feel like I'd like to pray.

526
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,589
What?

527
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,590
Would you mind?

528
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Aoi-san!

529
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,599
Aoi-san! Hey!

530
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,329
Am I drunk?

531
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,469
Did you finish this already?!

532
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,839
And this?!

533
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Time out.

534
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,079
Aoi-san?

535
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,080
I'm a bit drunk. Sorry.

536
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,550
Hey, hey, hey!

537
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Don't sleep here. It's dangerous!

538
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,989
Sit up.

539
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,959
You're going again!

540
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Hey! Hey! Try to focus.

541
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,830
OK, I'll carry you.

542
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,139
Climb on.

543
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,140
OK?

544
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,679
We can get a taxi over there.

545
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Right.

546
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,020
I know what you're thinking.

547
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,060
'How did I end up in a strange place
carrying a woman I don't even know?'

548
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm not thinking that.

549
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,570
OK, then what am I thinking?

550
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,110
I don't know.

551
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,740
I'm thinking a person's back
is so nice and warm.

552
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,789
Sorry. I'm OK now.

553
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,790
You are? You can stand up, right?

554
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Oh, this is terrible!

555
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm sorry!

556
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Are you all right?

557
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,679
Yes.

558
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,680
I'm OK...for the most part.

559
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,550
Careful!

560
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Careful! It's a red light!

561
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,130
Hey, look!
You can see the Eiffel Tower.

562
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Yeah. It's beautiful.

563
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,840
How do you like Paris?

564
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,240
It's awesome.

565
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,579
I want...

566
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,580
...to go back to Japan.

567
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,720
How's the Tokyo Tower?

568
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,630
Here's a taxi.

569
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,539
Aoi-san...

570
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,540
Where on Belleville?
Tell him your address?

571
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,439
Komazawa 5, Setagaya...

572
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,709
Aoi-san! This is Paris!

573
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,710
I'm kidding. Just a bit of humor.
Funny?

574
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,250
Yes. What's your address?

575
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,430
Careful! Careful!
Which one is it?

576
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,860
Here?

577
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,770
Watch it!

578
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,479
Here?

579
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,479
I'm home!

580
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,049
Hello!

581
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,050
There's no one here.
I live alone.

582
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,749
But you said...

583
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,750
When I get home,
I say, 'I'm home!'

584
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,259
Are you sure you live here?

585
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Why?

586
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,130
Which one's the key?
What if this isn't your house?

587
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,569
Great! Got it the first time.

588
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,679
You're home.

589
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,740
Welcome to my home.

590
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,750
No, no. I'm going.

591
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,049
Thank you very much.

592
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,050
Don't catch cold.
Make sure you go to bed.

593
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Good night.

594
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,860
I'm sorry, but what was the name
of my hotel again?

595
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,629
Hotel?

596
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,630
The name of the hotel
you guided me to.

597
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,970
L'hotel de...

598
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,810
Hotel le Meurice? Wow!
I'd love to stay there.

599
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,719
No, the hotel that I'm...

600
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Aoi-san?

601
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Aoi-san, don't go to sleep there.

602
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,660
Excuse me...

603
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,239
OK, I'll never kiss you again!

604
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,240
But you know you will.

605
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,119
What?

606
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm happy.

607
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Huh?

608
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,530
Huh?

609
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,700
What happened last night?

610
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,010
I still have make-up on.
I did it again.

611
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,680
Huh?

612
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,659
Sorry, I got lost.
I didn't touch. Sen.

613
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,259
Oh, right!

614
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,499
'Sen-san'...

615
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,500
'Mr Yagami'...he brought me back.

616
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,350
'Sen', written with
the character for 'thousand'.

617
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,789
Excuse me...

618
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,790
Why...

619
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,490
...are you sleeping here?

620
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I see. You got me here,
but you couldn't get home yourself.

621
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,070
Were you asking me the name
of your hotel?

622
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Did I dream that?

623
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,680
It's L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

624
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,869
Close your eyes.

625
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,899
OK.

626
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,939
All right?

627
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,940
Hey...

628
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,580
What are you touching?

629
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,450
Huh?

630
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,889
Your cheek.

631
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,890
Wrong!

632
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,659
Again.

633
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,789
OK.

634
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,790
OK...

635
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,660
Here.

636
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,269
Wait...

637
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,339
I have no idea.

638
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,469
That's my heart.

639
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,809
How would I know that?

640
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,810
Ow!

641
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,109
Um...

642
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,249
Good morning.

643
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,119
Sorry. I crashed here.

644
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,619
That's OK.

645
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,620
Was I really drunk last night?

646
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,129
You don't remember?

647
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,099
Bits and pieces.

648
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,100
The restaurant, and the bar...

649
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,600
The Eiffel Tower, the taxi...

650
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,869
That's perfect.

651
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,709
Did I get out of line?

652
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,479
Not at all.

653
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,480
Good.

654
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,850
You're not all stiff
from sleeping in the bath?

655
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,750
I tried to find somewhere
I wouldn't be in the way.

656
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,929
Shall I do that?

657
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,829
I can do coffee.

658
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,830
OK.

659
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,169
It's hot.

660
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,039
May I?

661
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,900
Go ahead.

662
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,910
First...

663
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,510
...you pour just enough
to wet the top.

664
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,320
Let it swell up.

665
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,019
And then...

666
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,020
...pour it in gently
so it'll get drawn in.

667
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,530
These are good fresh beans.
They swell right up.

668
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,929
You're a pro?

669
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,039
I worked in a coffee shop.

670
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,769
A fancy one?

671
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,770
It's pretty well-known.
Tajimaya, in Shinjuku.

672
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,280
I've been there.
When I was a student.

673
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,419
About 20 years ago.

674
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,420
Yeah? Then maybe
I made your coffee...

675
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,159
...not.

676
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,160
I was just a kid.

677
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,529
That was humor.

678
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,530
Well, it's the truth.

679
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,500
How old are you?
As old as Tokyo Disneyland?

680
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,870
I was born the year it opened.

681
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,480
I'm Tokyo Disneyland's
slightly older sister.

682
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,380
'Slightly'?

683
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,002
Slightly.

684
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,860
Were you playing the piano?

685
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,960
Yes.

686
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:07,370
That's the one. I like that piece.

687
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,009
What is it?

688
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,010
Mozart's 'Minuet and Trio'.

689
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,580
So would you be a cat?

690
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,990
That's the piece of music
the world's cats like best.

691
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,359
Cat music?

692
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,999
For my cat...

693
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
...it meant 'food'.

694
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,470
Whenever I played it,
he'd come right home.

695
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,470
Morning or evening,
it didn't matter.

696
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,020
Then one day he didn't come home.

697
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,520
He never came back.

698
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,020
Three years ago, right around now.

699
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,190
At Easter.

700
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,530
Maybe he celebrated too much,
and went off somewhere.

701
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,140
So I play that piece a lot...

702
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:18,210
...hoping maybe he'll come back.

703
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,240
Sometimes they come back.

704
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,219
Did you ever have one?

705
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,780
A mongrel, when I was small.

706
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,349
Mine was a shorthair called Guru.

707
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:31,259
Ours was just called Tama.

708
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,020
'Tama'?

709
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,259
Like the 'Sazae-san' comic?

710
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,260
Probably.

711
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,810
'Sorry, but I got lost.

712
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,780
'I didn't touch.'

713
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,229
This is Suzume.

714
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,299
Please leave a message after the tone.

715
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,300
Leave a message,
or you'll make me cry.

716
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,630
'Beep!'

717
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Suzume, where are you?
Phone me, will you?

718
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,309
Ah, sorry.

719
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,310
Oh shit.

720
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,120
OK, I take it.

721
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,690
Thanks.

722
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,869
The two of you?

723
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,639
Look. I found this in Saint Pierre.

724
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,640
It's pretty.

725
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,910
This is my friend Joanne.
She lives on the 3rd floor.

726
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,819
Her studio's in my basement.

727
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,949
Basement?

728
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,219
Down those steps.

729
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,220
Joanne's a dress designer.

730
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,490
This is Sen Yagami.

731
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,829
He's a friend.

732
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,839
Oh, you're friends...

733
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,709
Joanne. Nice to meet you.

734
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,710
Nice to meet you too. My name is Sen Yagami

735
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,780
Sen

736
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,560
Careful of the step.

737
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,900
Ok. Wow..what a nice place.
Where should I put this?

738
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,630
Over here.
Ok.

739
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,139
Thank you.

740
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,770
Can I look around?

741
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,780
Yes, please.

742
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,919
They are very beautiful.

743
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,749
Really?

744
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:50,750
Look here. This dress is from 1 925.
And this one is from 1 950.

745
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,700
Sounds great. Can I take pictures?

746
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Aoi!

747
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,900
Can you help me when you're done?

748
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,910
Coming.

749
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,449
Showtime!

750
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,450
Showtime?

751
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,399
Like it?

752
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,400
Great! It's beautiful material.

753
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,910
Put it on, would you?

754
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:29,150
Sometimes I have her
put on the dresses for me.

755
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,060
For the hem and the line so I can see it.

756
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,200
I'm thinking bacon and spinach.

757
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,369
Fine.

758
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:46,370
Sen, I made a bunch of dishes
and Aoi is making the kische.

759
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,210
So it is going to be perfect.
Because it is Easter weekend.

760
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,720
So my daughter is bringing
my grandchildren this afternoon.

761
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:07,090
Oh really?

762
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,560
Can you give me a hand, Joanne?

763
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,570
Sen, would you like to come to the party
with us?

764
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,199
Can I?

765
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,200
Oh, no no. He has a plan I think.

766
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:25,370
Oh no no, can I join you?

767
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:26,339
Really?

768
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,479
Sure.

769
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,480
Of course.

770
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,490
Come over here.

771
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:44,230
Wow!

772
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,300
That's great.

773
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,340
No pictures!

774
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,350
This is just to see how it looks.
I'm just the dummy.

775
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,180
It suits you.

776
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,919
Don't take pictures.

777
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,920
I'll just pin it here.

778
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:26,900
You are a rare animal.

779
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,910
'A rare animal'?
A protected species?

780
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,550
It's the first time Aoi introduces me to a man.

781
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,159
She's been through a lot.

782
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,929
A lot?

783
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,930
it's the worst feeling in the world,
losing a child.

784
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,340
Sorry, lose a child?

785
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,709
Yes.

786
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,379
She had a child?

787
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,380
But you didn't know. You are her friend.

788
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,510
No, we just met.

789
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,750
I thought you were.

790
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,280
Pour it in...

791
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,290
Slowly...

792
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,990
I'll knead this.

793
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,639
More?

794
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,539
That looks good.

795
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,540
Wait...

796
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,660
One, two...

797
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,729
Got it!

798
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,730
Thanks.

799
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:50,349
Now what?

800
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:53,350
Here.

801
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,190
That's good.

802
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,900
Excuse me...

803
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,670
There. It's done.

804
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,280
Those are beautiful.

805
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,280
Oh...

806
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,290
...he left.

807
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,820
He left? He's gone?

808
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:45,630
Someone called him 20 minutes ago...

809
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,360
...and he ran out.

810
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,370
He ran out?

811
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,800
Did he say anything?

812
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,440
No. Nothing.

813
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,180
I see.

814
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,580
OK?

815
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,620
We should go.

816
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:21,330
Sunset in Paris is romantic.

817
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,700
'Sunset in Paris is romantic.'

818
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,940
Suzume loves Kango.

819
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:34,310
'Suzume loves Kango.'

820
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:39,310
She cries when he's not there.

821
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,780
'She cries when he's not there.'

822
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:46,490
But Kango is forgetting Suzume.

823
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,359
What do you mean?

824
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,360
'Kango is forgetting Suzume.'
Say that in French.

825
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,199
No.

826
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,200
The translation machine
is out of order. 'Beep'.

827
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,910
'Beep' sounds more like
an answering machine.

828
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:09,110
Kango...

829
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:12,210
When my phone says 'Leave a message
after the tone,' what comes then?

830
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:16,619
'Beep'.

831
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,620
I say that myself.

832
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:23,090
People laugh.

833
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:28,230
You didn't know that.

834
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,870
Lately you don't phone.

835
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,070
You don't phone me much.

836
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,440
Don't get mad.

837
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:13,140
Meow...not.

838
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,109
The embassy called.

839
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,149
Yeah?

840
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:19,150
Tokyo faxed them
a copy of my family register.

841
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,520
They needed it for my travel document.
They called me...

842
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:29,390
...and I went to get it.

843
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,160
I thought you'd gone!

844
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,599
Oh...sorry.

845
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,600
I'll make tea.

846
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:47,240
You didn't go to the party?

847
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,250
I didn't feel like it.
She left some food.

848
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:55,389
Yeah?

849
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:58,390
It's probably in full swing now.

850
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:05,459
Let's have a party here, then.

851
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,460
Just the two of us.

852
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Why not?

853
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,169
This fills you up!

854
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:16,839
I won't waste it.

855
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,209
It's made right.

856
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:19,539
It's good!

857
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,540
It's good.

858
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:26,119
You made it, not me.

859
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,049
But no more.

860
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,849
I'm full.

861
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:32,850
Yeah.

862
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,660
You have to go back...

863
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,369
To the hotel.

864
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,739
Yeah.

865
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,740
I haven't stayed there yet.

866
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:52,509
That's a waste of money.

867
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:55,510
I forget the name again.

868
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,880
Oh, right... uh...

869
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,920
I'll write it down.

870
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,340
What was it?

871
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,410
It's a long name. Now I forget.

872
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,380
Have you really forgotten?

873
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,019
Let's drink some more.

874
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,559
More?

875
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,859
For now, let's drink.

876
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:45,860
Sure.

877
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,200
Bordeaux or Medoc?

878
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,009
Can you play?

879
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:02,010
No.

880
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,649
Sure you can!

881
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,650
We had a band in school,
so I know a few chords.

882
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,189
A popularity ploy.

883
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:17,559
How did you know?

884
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,560
People who play guitar
or sing...

885
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,730
Any boy who wants to be popular
is obliged to be in a band.

886
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,900
Maybe not 'obliged'.

887
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,910
'Obliged to be'?
How do you say that in French?

888
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,010
I don't know. I'm Japanese.

889
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:46,259
One day I reached a turning point.

890
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,559
What?

891
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,560
I switched from guitar to camera.

892
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:51,929
And?

893
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:54,930
People liked that better.

894
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:00,070
I won a prize,
and I got too confident.

895
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,139
Like that?

896
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,140
Not quite.

897
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,810
Like that.

898
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,820
I thought I'd make a living at it,
so after university I just did that.

899
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,760
That was brave.

900
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,260
But...

901
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,870
...it's a cold, cruel world.

902
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,500
I ended up working part-time
at Sukiya.

903
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,180
Do you know it?

904
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,710
Beef-bowl?

905
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,720
A chain, like Yoshinoya.

906
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,249
Film costs money.

907
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,250
I ate rice with bean sprouts
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

908
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:58,860
With citrus sauce,
then soy, then Worcestershire.

909
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,829
Are you listening?

910
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:05,830
I tried every taste variation
I could think of.

911
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,040
But bean sprouts are bean sprouts.

912
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,709
Still OK?

913
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:17,510
I'll have some more.

914
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,279
Thanks.

915
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,280
Then one day...

916
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,989
Is that too loud?

917
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:29,159
No. Add in the music.

918
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,160
Then a pro photographer
who used me sometimes...

919
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:36,970
...got sick and asked me
to sub for him...

920
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,240
...for a musician's
publicity photographs.

921
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:43,939
And they loved it?

922
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,940
Not so much the public
as the musician herself.

923
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:51,210
Then what? I took lots of stuff.
Publicity stills...

924
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:55,350
...advertising, CD jackets...

925
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,250
Then came actresses and so on
that she knew.

926
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,589
Yeah, that can happen.

927
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:05,559
And before I knew it...

928
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,560
...I was the best
retouching photographer around.

929
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,999
Retouching?

930
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,839
Yeah. You know
what it's like now.

931
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,840
It's all digital.

932
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,940
Spots, wrinkles, bags under the eyes.
The three-piece set.

933
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:26,980
If everything's right, you can even
change the shape of the face.

934
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,790
I'm more like a Takasu Clinic
than a photographer.

935
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,999
Cosmetic surgery.
I know the Takasu Clinic.

936
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,169
That's not why I stopped.

937
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,199
I was waiting.

938
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,939
So if you ask me...

939
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,940
...what pictures
I'm most confident about...

940
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:56,310
...I'd probably say the ones I took
when I was eating bean sprouts.

941
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,520
I don't know... it's like back then
I was in charge of my photographs.

942
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:08,389
Now my clients are.

943
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,389
Really?

944
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,290
For example...

945
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,300
I was doing a soft-drink poster
down in Okinawa.

946
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:19,330
The sky was so blue
it made your eyes sting.

947
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,040
But they wanted me to make it blue
right up to where the sun was.

948
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:30,810
And you know, Aoi-san,
a real sky...

949
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:34,150
...isn't blue right around the sun.

950
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,889
It's white.

951
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,890
But they wanted me to make
the whole thing blue.

952
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,760
It's like all they knew was
'the sky is blue'.

953
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:50,230
Do they want it to look painted?
The sky isn't like that!

954
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,880
Like that?

955
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:09,150
Exactly. Just like that.

956
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,920
But...

957
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,930
...I wanted the work.

958
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,830
Whenever one of my actresses
or woman editors calls me...

959
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:26,169
...no matter when or where,
I hurry right over.

960
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:28,839
Like a host.

961
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,309
That's not my plan for you.

962
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:32,979
Sorry?

963
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,980
I don't have a thing for hosts
or younger men.

964
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:40,450
That's not what I'm saying.
Don't take it like that.

965
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:43,750
You're not like those people
at all.

966
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,360
You're just...

967
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:58,930
...a little bit to one side
of absolute perfection.

968
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:06,740
I'm told that a lot.
Maybe I was born that way.

969
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,150
I don't know about that...

970
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:15,450
Like my tuning's wonky.
Does that bother you?

971
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,350
You're not 'wonky'.
'Laid-back', maybe.

972
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:25,230
I shouldn't say this
about someone older, but...

973
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:29,699
...you're cute.

974
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:32,700
'Cute'?

975
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:37,870
Wow! I haven't heard that
for a century.

976
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,009
You aren't that old.

977
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:43,010
Sorry.

978
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:47,350
I'm not all that good, so if I don't
spend all my time on my work...

979
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:53,290
...I can't make ends meet.

980
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,630
So the girlfriend I'd had for years
left me.

981
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,160
That was a come-on.

982
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:06,530
I said I'm single.

983
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,739
Forget it.

984
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,740
So anyway, because of that
I'm basically kind of miserable.

985
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,179
I started...

986
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,180
...wanting to take pictures
only I could take.

987
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,420
Like everyone else, the dream was
to put out books and have exhibitions.

988
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:30,730
But right now
I'm nothing but a yes-man...

989
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:34,630
...running around being nice
to the people who use me.

990
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:40,799
Really?

991
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,569
I'm only in Paris to be...

992
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:46,570
What did you call it?
The 'luck brother'.

993
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:51,010
The luck brother.

994
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,020
That's fine as far as it goes...

995
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:57,650
...but the whole situation
just irritates me.

996
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:01,590
I was thinking I'd like to
just pack it all in...

997
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:06,490
...but when my passport got wrecked,
the first thing I thought of was work.

998
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,970
I've been tamed.

999
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:23,910
I can't go forward,
and I can't go back.

1000
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,720
Surely something will work out.

1001
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,200
You can still take
your own photographs.

1002
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:47,230
Someone who's tried hard once
can always do it again.

1003
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,940
I'm no expert, but I'd love to see...

1004
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:59,350
...your exhibition.

1005
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,060
Want more cheese?
And some dried raisins?

1006
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,390
Yeah, sure.

1007
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,600
Shall we go on to
the 2nd movement?

1008
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:26,939
What's the chord?

1009
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,109
Of what?

1010
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:32,110
The Story of Aoi-san.

1011
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,349
Forget my story.

1012
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:38,350
I can't tell it as well.

1013
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,120
Too bad.

1014
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:53,230
Good night, Sen.
I'm going to bed.

1015
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:20,030
Hey, Sen...

1016
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:25,070
Why are you sleeping there?

1017
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,600
I thought you'd gone.

1018
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:34,610
Come here.

1019
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,580
OK, don't.

1020
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:57,869
May I?

1021
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:00,870
Sure.

1022
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:04,670
What?

1023
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,939
Isn't this fun?

1024
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:09,940
When I started photography,
I took up climbing...

1025
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,079
...and bought a sleeping bag.

1026
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,080
The scenery changes
with where you sleep...

1027
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:20,250
...even in the same room.

1028
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:25,590
This isn't any fun.

1029
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,800
Yours was my first bathtub.

1030
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
You're weird.

1031
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,240
My arms need to be
more than twice as long.

1032
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,280
It's like trying to hold
a sumo wrestler.

1033
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:47,150
No, thanks.

1034
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:51,950
I'm...

1035
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,060
No, I'm scared to say.

1036
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:05,470
I'm not scared to hear.

1037
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,039
No?

1038
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,040
No.

1039
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:16,649
OK.

1040
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:19,650
About me.

1041
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:28,490
I like art.

1042
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:33,530
When I finished art school,
I got a job in a gallery.

1043
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:38,070
The Japanese economy was still good,
and it had a branch here.

1044
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:43,340
I studied French real hard,
and got hired here.

1045
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:50,810
A man the gallery dealt with
was a local artist.

1046
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,319
French?

1047
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,019
Yeah.

1048
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:03,020
Maybe I was lonely in a new place.
We got married right away.

1049
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,900
But this guy had girls everywhere.

1050
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,640
I didn't like being cheated on...

1051
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:24,310
...so we got a divorce.

1052
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,660
And I quit the gallery, too,
and got a job with a company...

1053
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,670
...that published free papers.

1054
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:53,510
I had my cat.

1055
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,510
But he went, so it was just me.

1056
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,420
Without Guru or Shion, all alone.

1057
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,160
'Shion'?

1058
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Shion was my baby.

1059
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,640
I heard about that.

1060
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,149
Joanne?

1061
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:35,150
She thought we were old friends.

1062
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,360
When I left my husband,
I was pregnant.

1063
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:56,100
I had...

1064
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:59,670
...a boy.

1065
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:03,980
The cutest little angel.

1066
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,880
But he was never healthy.

1067
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,920
He only lived five years.

1068
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:19,530
The poor thing.

1069
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:32,970
Shion named Guru.

1070
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,479
Shion played the piano.

1071
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,480
When Guru heard him playing
that Minuet and Trio...

1072
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:44,950
...he'd come straight home,
no matter where he was.

1073
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,520
Like magic.

1074
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,400
Shion found Guru
and brought him home.

1075
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,840
He came in with the kitten
in both his bony little hands...

1076
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:13,510
...and stood right there.

1077
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:17,750
'Mama, can we keep him?'
he said.

1078
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:23,460
'He'll die.

1079
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,560
'The poor cat!'

1080
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,840
Sorry.

1081
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,800
After he died,
I couldn't work for a long time.

1082
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,280
I couldn't move forward.

1083
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:29,060
Aoi-san...

1084
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:32,730
Yes?

1085
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:36,630
An idea.

1086
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:43,170
Come in here.

1087
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:18,570
Um...

1088
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,080
Yes?

1089
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,650
Closer.

1090
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:30,450
OK.

1091
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:34,790
As close as we can get.

1092
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:39,630
OK.

1093
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:07,459
Sorry. I woke you up.

1094
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,620
What's that?

1095
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,630
Scrambled eggs.
I thought I'd make breakfast.

1096
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,500
This is how you separate
the yolks from the white.

1097
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,600
You can do that?

1098
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,480
You go home tomorrow.
What are you doing today?

1099
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:36,919
I don't know...

1100
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,119
What are your plans?

1101
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,120
My plans are work.
My Easter egg special.

1102
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,200
I'll come with you.

1103
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:54,169
It's around here.

1104
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:57,170
Somewhere.

1105
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:03,010
Huge!

1106
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,550
Beautiful! That vapor trail.

1107
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:12,759
Yeah.

1108
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,760
Here it is.

1109
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,229
Hello.

1110
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:21,159
I'm from the Japanese paper.

1111
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,160
Leopaul, and my colleague Marion.

1112
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:27,169
I'm Aoi, and the photographer is Sen.

1113
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:28,800
Hello.

1114
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,139
You speak French well.

1115
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:33,039
'You speak French well.'

1116
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,040
These are small eggs.

1117
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:38,050
Made here, in different colors.

1118
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,089
Beautiful!

1119
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:48,090
Wow!

1120
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:57,830
Cute!

1121
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,569
What?

1122
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:05,409
I wore these again.

1123
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:08,410
You're right.

1124
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:11,810
I have to buy new shoes.

1125
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,120
Is there anywhere
you'd like to go?

1126
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:26,159
Somewhere I'd like to go?

1127
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,729
I know!

1128
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:30,729
When I first met you...

1129
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:33,730
...I asked you your favorite place
and you wouldn't tell me.

1130
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,939
There.

1131
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,940
But...

1132
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:46,250
If you don't want to, we could try
the Louvre, or the Quai d'Orsay.

1133
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:51,149
Let's go.

1134
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:53,859
To my favorite place.

1135
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,860
It's not a secret or anything?

1136
01:28:57,490 --> 01:29:00,490
Well, yes...

1137
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,499
By boat?

1138
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,500
Yep. Right up to the source
of the Amazon.

1139
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:11,009
This is a sight-seeing boat!

1140
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:14,010
You're not fooled?

1141
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:57,980
Right there.
That's where we met.

1142
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,420
The passport incident.
That seems a long time ago now.

1143
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:08,090
There's Notre Dame.

1144
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,700
The day before yesterday, wasn't it?

1145
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:17,570
We've been together ever since.

1146
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:21,440
That's right.

1147
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,879
Hey, Sen...

1148
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,189
That bridge...

1149
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:33,190
...is the Pont Marie.

1150
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:36,490
If you make a wish under it,
it comes true.

1151
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,200
It only works for lovers, though.

1152
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:45,930
Limited to lovers?

1153
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,940
I don't think it's a law...

1154
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:54,470
Let's pretend to be lovers, then.

1155
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,179
Pretend?

1156
01:30:57,180 --> 01:31:00,180
Or our wishes won't come true.

1157
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,710
What did you wish for?

1158
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:37,420
Not telling.

1159
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:41,120
Maybe we were wishing for
the same thing.

1160
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:47,030
Let's just stay like this for a while.

1161
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,060
It's not fair.

1162
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,499
Who, me?

1163
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,500
Both of us.

1164
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,600
Both of us?

1165
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,680
Over there.

1166
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,489
I like that.

1167
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,789
The Eiffel Tower?

1168
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:17,159
Yeah.

1169
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:20,160
Although I'll admit
it's kind of a clichÃ©.

1170
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:25,270
No, it's not.

1171
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,200
So much has happened
since I came here...

1172
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:33,070
...but the Eiffel's always there.

1173
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:36,679
The other buildings are low...

1174
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,680
...so you can see the Eiffel Tower
from anywhere.

1175
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:46,150
So it's special to you?

1176
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:50,020
Not 'special'.

1177
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:56,130
It's just always there.

1178
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,640
People go away.

1179
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:17,780
I wish I could be your Eiffel.

1180
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:23,490
Is that a confession of love?

1181
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:28,060
Hmm...

1182
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:32,530
Don't say that when you're leaving.

1183
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:36,170
I wish I wasn't.

1184
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:40,670
Then stay.

1185
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:50,080
Sorry.

1186
01:33:59,530 --> 01:34:02,530
It's OK. I've still got him.

1187
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:10,909
Kango...

1188
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:13,910
I'm going home.

1189
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:17,580
All of a sudden?
I'm just making dinner.

1190
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,880
Kango...

1191
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:25,450
...one last request.

1192
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:30,260
Request?

1193
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:34,460
It's why I came.

1194
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,900
Look at me.

1195
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:54,850
I want you...

1196
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,860
...to marry me.

1197
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:06,330
What brought this on?

1198
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:14,730
It's like...

1199
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,240
...in the six months
since you came to Paris...

1200
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:25,580
...I can't breathe any more.
It's like the air in Tokyo...

1201
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:31,449
...is too thin.

1202
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:34,450
Can't we just go on like we are?

1203
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:38,590
I'm a spoiled brat
and I'm lonely.

1204
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:45,160
I need someone.

1205
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:48,269
You're the same.

1206
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:51,270
How?

1207
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:55,810
The way we're going, we'll fall apart.

1208
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:02,050
So marry me.

1209
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:06,850
I can come over here,
or you can come back.

1210
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,160
Whoa, whoa, wait.
How can I put this?

1211
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:17,830
There's a lot of things
you haven't thought about.

1212
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:19,799
I have.

1213
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,800
Like what?
Like how we'd both survive?

1214
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:26,939
Or how about, like...

1215
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:29,409
...my dream?

1216
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:31,079
We can do it!

1217
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,949
I think you're being naive.

1218
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:34,849
Why?

1219
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:37,850
I'm here for a reason.

1220
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:41,290
So? I'll be here, too.

1221
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:51,100
No, wait a minute...

1222
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,080
Marry me.

1223
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:17,390
Sorry.

1224
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:21,390
I can't do that.

1225
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:35,380
I'll end it.

1226
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:39,350
I'll break up with you.

1227
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:43,820
Well, if that's how it has to be...

1228
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,959
Stupid!

1229
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:54,130
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

1230
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:15,110
Kango...

1231
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,530
...be famous.

1232
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:55,520
Suzume...

1233
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:59,190
Look...

1234
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:05,030
So that's it?
Wait a minute...

1235
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:10,770
We're through?

1236
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:23,180
Work hard.

1237
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:23,040
Kango!

1238
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:39,130
Aoi-san...

1239
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:42,329
A picture.

1240
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:44,429
Of me?

1241
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:47,430
That won't be much of a picture.

1242
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:57,879
Don't!

1243
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:00,880
It's out of focus...

1244
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:19,870
Turn this way for a second.

1245
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:26,309
Stop it!

1246
01:41:26,310 --> 01:41:29,310
That was good.

1247
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,600
Let's see...

1248
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,269
Line up with it.

1249
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:01,270
With the Tower?

1250
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:05,580
You and the Eiffel Tower
are the real Paris for me.

1251
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:38,740
Was I smiling?

1252
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:42,250
Yes, you were.

1253
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:21,650
L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

1254
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:26,630
Your hotel.

1255
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:32,430
I knew it all along.

1256
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:36,670
I pretended I'd forgotten.
I'll write it down.

1257
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:07,270
There.

1258
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,980
Sorry.

1259
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,549
Hello.

1260
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:15,479
Hello. I have a package for you.

1261
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:18,480
Sign here.

1262
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:23,820
All right.

1263
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:26,830
Thank you. Have a good day.

1264
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:07,100
To Aoi-san
