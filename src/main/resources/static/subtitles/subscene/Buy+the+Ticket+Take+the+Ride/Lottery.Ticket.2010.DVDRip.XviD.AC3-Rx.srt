2
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,718
On this hot and steamy
fourth of July weekend...

3
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,049
...independence is all about the money.

4
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:22,878
Every grocery store, liquor store,
gas station and corner market...

5
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,811
...has long lines out its doors...

6
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:28,016
...as people wait to purchase their
Mondo Millions lottery tickets.

7
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,308
Tonight's jackpot:
a record $370 million...

8
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,310
...has infected this city
with lottery fever.

9
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:58,947
We asked local residents
what they'd do with all that money.

10
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:00,847
I would give haIf the money to charity.

11
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:02,416
I would get drunk as hell.

12
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,720
I'd probably feed the whole world.
Enjoy life, you know.

13
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:07,154
I'd put it in my pocket.

14
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,387
I'm gonna go ski diving.

15
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:11,326
Hello, hello, hello. This is Mutt.

16
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,994
I quit.

17
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:23,638
What would you buy for yourself?

18
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:25,741
An all-white Versace suit.

19
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,843
Would you break up with your girlfriend?

20
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,275
Yeah.

21
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:31,613
I'd do the same thing I'm doing now.

22
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:33,781
You wouldn't change a thing?

23
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,585
- I'm sorry, Mom. I wanna shop.
- I'd quit selling fruit.

24
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,199
So would you split the money fifty-fifty?

25
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,669
- Yes.
- I would change everything.

26
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:56,103
Probably a mail-order bride.

27
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:58,973
- I would paint for the rest of my life.
- I would lose my mind.

28
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:00,541
Have more fun.

29
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:03,679
"Oh, my gosh! I won!"

30
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:04,879
Okay.

31
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,477
Damn.

32
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:39,381
Is that a home-cooked meal?

33
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:41,883
Yo! Miss Carson!

34
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:45,520
If you don't come in here
like you got sense...

35
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,288
...I'm gonna knock some into you.

36
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:50,293
My bad, Miss Carson. I didn't mean
to slam that door like that.

37
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:51,993
Is Kevin ready yet?

38
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,095
He's in his room.

39
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:55,931
All right. Cool.

40
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,867
You looking exceptionally well today.

41
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:00,202
What you been using,
cocoa butter and Jesus?

42
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,206
I forgot to tell you,
there's a dude that live down the street...

43
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,906
...he was almost in
The Temptations.

44
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:08,646
You should holler at him. I'm telling you,
you're single, sexy and saved.

45
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:09,977
Get out my face, boy.

46
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:12,482
Think about it.
I'm gonna take this to Kevin.

47
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:15,653
Now, who got more swag than me?

48
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:17,486
Nobody.

49
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:18,720
You ain't got no swag.

50
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,255
- Man, look at you.
- This is so good.

51
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:23,459
Why you always come over,
eating all my food?

52
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,026
Why you so stingy?

53
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:27,030
Be nice. Come on, I'm your best friend.

54
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,798
You need to eat, man.
Gotta buff up a little bit.

55
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:32,001
Don't put it on my bed, man.

56
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:33,701
Oh, my God, Kev.

57
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:38,075
- So many smuts outside.
- What you talking about, "smuts"?

58
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:40,041
Dip-offs, scrapes, women.

59
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,713
And they're wearing booty shorts
up to here, Iooking bad.

60
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:44,480
That's why I gotta look fly.

61
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:47,251
Which brings me to my next point.
Let me rock these.

62
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:49,752
- Hell, no.
- Why not?

63
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,222
I can't look like this?
It's 10,000 degrees outside.

64
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,592
Look at me, man. Look how I look.
I look like a homeless thug.

65
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,493
- No. No. No.
- Fly.

66
00:04:57,658 --> 00:05:00,797
All right, I see how it is.
I'm telling your grandmama you stingy.

67
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:03,200
- Grown man - Man, be quiet.
Miss Carson!

68
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:06,203
Thanks for breakfast, Miss Carson.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

69
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,738
Hey, get out the way.
All right, Grandmama.

70
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,573
I love you. I'm out.

71
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,374
You're not gonna eat your breakfast?

72
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,343
No, because I'm gonna be late
for work.

73
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:16,746
Oh, but you have time
to iron your shoestrings?

74
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:19,683
I hope the little girls
you trying to impress is worth it.

75
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:22,720
"Little girls"?
Don't worry, Kevin ain't getting no pu

76
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:25,521
I mean, Kevin doesn't have a girlfriend.

77
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,157
He doesn't let these Jezebels
get near him.

78
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,561
You know the one I'd like
to see you with, huh?

79
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,362
Here we go.

80
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:34,563
Stacie.

81
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,535
Oh, she's a bright girl
and she goes to church.

82
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:40,838
Grandma, look, we are just friends,
all right? That's it.

83
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:42,038
Friends.

84
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:44,007
- All right, dear.
That would be nasty.

85
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:46,944
Suit yourself.
Now, wait a minute, here.

86
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:50,548
I want you to play my number for me
on the way home, okay?

87
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:52,982
And don't let nobody copy them
either. All right?

88
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,584
- I won't.
- Those are my numbers.

89
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,655
I dreamt them up last night.
They're out of the Holy Scripture.

90
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,854
Okay.

91
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:03,797
You know something? Last night I dreamt
that I was waiting on the number 11 bus.

92
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,898
You'll never guess who was driving
when the bus pulled up.

93
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,832
- Who?
- Jesus.

94
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:12,203
And I said, "Jesus, what are
you doing driving this bus?"

95
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:14,237
- You know what he said to me?
- No, ma'am.

96
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:19,513
He said, "Child, it's a recession.
Times is hard."

97
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,678
- That's what he said.
- You didn't ask me...

98
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,582
...but how did Jesus get a license
without a birth certificate?

99
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:26,851
- It makes no sense.
- Out. Go.

100
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,953
Gotta think about that.
Man, get your ass

101
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:30,653
Ah.

102
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,390
Sorry, Grandma.

103
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,760
I love you, though.

104
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,594
Bye, baby.

105
00:06:38,393 --> 00:06:40,332
Tell your girlfriend,
get her panties from me.

106
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,633
I'm talking about Ashley.

107
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,400
- Smell that.
- Nigga, that's Shaniqua.

108
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:44,600
Ben-Ben. Ben-Ben.

109
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:45,802
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Damn.

110
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:47,638
What's up? Y'all ain't speaking?

111
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,206
What's up, Semaj? How you doing?

112
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,974
- What y'all up to?
Going to work.

113
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,311
Going to work.
Going to the court, you know?

114
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:56,113
Sell some knickknack paddywhacks.
Give a dog a bone.

115
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,550
Why you so fidgety?
You gotta pee-pee or something?

116
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,150
You gotta pee?

117
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,986
The bathroom right inside.

118
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,988
I'm just excited about going to work.

119
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:07,593
- I'm really trying to go to work.
- Let's leave.

120
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:09,092
- Work?
- All right, Semaj.

121
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:11,896
Hey, yo, you heard
about that girl Ebony?

122
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,330
Up in Building 6?

123
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:16,167
- That big-booty chick, right?
- Yeah, big booty.

124
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,904
- That one. Okay. Yeah.
- Big booty. Big booty. All right.

125
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:20,938
- She bought 50 lottery tickets.
- Fifty?

126
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:22,307
- Fifty?
- Fifty!

127
00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:25,377
Damn, are they on sale?
- l need to work where she works.

128
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,845
Hey, hold up.
Listen to what I'm trying to say.

129
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,183
Now, you all could do yourseIf a favor,
stay up off that court.

130
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:33,985
Because your boy Lorenzo Mack,
he done got out of jail.

131
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:37,657
- He got out?
- l seen him and his boys on that court.

132
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,723
Maybe y'all ought not
be hanging out there.

133
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,959
- Semaj, it's 9:00 in the morning.
Yeah.

134
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,597
How in the hell do you get this gossip?

135
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,898
First of all, it's not gossip.

136
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,766
- It's information.
All right.

137
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,202
Give me a haircut
when you get a chance.

138
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:54,373
You ought to get it cut right about now.
Kind of nappy in the back.

139
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:56,207
Damn. Let me go to work
with you today.

140
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:57,575
- You ain't going.
- Hell, no.

141
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:59,878
Hey, young blood.
Yo.

142
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:01,612
Yo, l need some beef jerky...

143
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:04,115
...and a Cherry Coke.

144
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:05,717
Yeah, that's it?

145
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:11,690
l guess so.

146
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:13,725
Man.

147
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,896
What's up? What?

148
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:20,832
Why you gotta talk to old dude?

149
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,433
You know he's crazy.

150
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,636
There ain't nothing wrong with
Mr. Washington.

151
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:26,437
He's a lunatic, Kevin.

152
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:28,740
He been in that apartment
before my mom was born.

153
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:30,643
He still got slave dust on him, dude.

154
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:34,414
I'm telling you, man. l think
Mr. Washington a serial killer, for real.

155
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:36,582
He eats beef jerky?

156
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,984
Who the hell eats beef jerky, Kevin?

157
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,858
Telling you, he on some mass-destruction,
Osama bin Laden-type stuff. Seriously.

158
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,158
You need to stop treating people
like that.

159
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,896
You always do that.
Since we was little, you be doing that.

160
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,563
I'm not making "rest in peace" shirts.

161
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:54,065
- You ain't that creative.
- Don't call me collect from heaven.

162
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,338
Now that, bitches,
is what you call a sports car, man.

163
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,905
Man, check this thing out, man.

164
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:03,309
Yours for the low, low price of...

165
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,579
...oof, 1.4 mil!

166
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:08,280
So that's what you would get? A car?

167
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,850
Hell, yeah. I'd get a car
with that kind of money.

168
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,419
- You simple son of a bitch. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha, ha.

169
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:15,854
I'm simple, but he don't know
how to put lotion on.

170
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,957
But I'm simple, though?

171
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:20,693
Hey, get your ashy ass up out here, man.

172
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:23,196
If l won the lottery? If l won?

173
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:25,766
Boy, I'd get my ass
one of them helicopters.

174
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,202
- I'd be flying in one of them choppers.
- What, a helicopter? What the hell?

175
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,706
l hope Semaj was lying
about letting Lorenzo out.

176
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,305
He the last person l wanna see.

177
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:35,608
Keep the thugs in jail.
You know what I'm saying?

178
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,242
Stacie!

179
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:38,409
Hey!

180
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,813
Boy, you know you're late, right?

181
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,182
What, I'm supposed to wait
ror you rorever?

182
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:44,651
Why you always down my back?

183
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,986
You got a watch,
you act like you can't tell time.

184
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:50,491
Could you stop arguing? Please?
Know what I'm saying? Come down here.

185
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,290
I'll be down in a second.

186
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,497
While you sitting in bumper-to-bumper
traffic in your Brigatti

187
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,962
- Bugatti.
- Bugatti.

188
00:09:57,128 --> 00:10:00,568
Flying over that joint in all
state-of-the-art equipment...

189
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,368
...leather interior, GPS.

190
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,874
Even a PlayStation with
the plasma screen with a beat.

191
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:11,248
And l can't forget the feet up with
them 24-inch gold spinners on there.

192
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,444
It would kill y'all!

193
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,417
Nigga, you can't put rims on a helicopter.
Ain't got no damn wheels!

194
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:17,916
Broke people. Look at them.

195
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,952
What you talking about, broke?

196
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,723
There's a man that knows something.
Ask Kevin.

197
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:26,561
Tell me, if you won the lottery,
would you rather get a sports car...

198
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:28,194
...or would you get a helicopter?

199
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,962
l don't even play the lottery.

200
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,731
Don't answer that.
Why?

201
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,868
It's designed to keep poor people poor
by selling them false dreams.

202
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,403
Man, y'all know that.

203
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,673
Somebody give him a bow tie
and a bean pie.

204
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:41,241
- It's Obama in the house.
- What is wrong with you?

205
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,609
Are you serious?

206
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,777
You in Rainbow PUSH yourself?
Come on.

207
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,546
Martin Luther King,
can you pick one?

208
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,450
- Just pick it.
Just one. Not rocket science.

209
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:50,649
Helicopter.

210
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,754
- What?
- That's what I'm talking about.

211
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,590
Why make him think you can have
a helicopter in the projects?

212
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,226
- Can y'all clear the way?
We're good, we're good.

213
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,727
l am very disappointed in you.

214
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:05,134
See, there goes chocolate drop,
chocolate drop, chocolate drop.

215
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,167
Look at you, darling. Lookie.

216
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,305
- She turn 18 yet?
- Stop it. Just stop it right now.

217
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,406
- What the hell you hit me for?
- Stop it now.

218
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,140
I'm saying you don't got a job.

219
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,575
- And? What?
- l got a job.

220
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,943
- You got a job?
- Hell, yeah.

221
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,112
Benny, please.
You ain't got no daggone job.

222
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,172
God.

223
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,074
l told you the smuts was out today.

224
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,243
You need to holler at Nikki Swayze
before l do.

225
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,314
- Are y'all coming or what?
- What am I gonna say to Nikki?

226
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,351
I don't know. Ask her for her
Social Security number or something.

227
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,151
- It's your chance.
- All right.

228
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,187
Get it.

229
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,796
Hey.

230
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,196
Nikki.

231
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,834
Hey, look. Nice dog.

232
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,872
I was just wondering if, like...

233
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,306
...you wasn't doing nothing

234
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,443
Hello? So now we gotta be late to work
just so he could talk to her?

235
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,811
Yep. Stop hating.

236
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,313
Well, l saw you during graduation.

237
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,148
You might not have saw me.

238
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,352
Because l was sitting in the back.
You know? But l was there.

239
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,322
- You always got me, Stacie.
- You know what? What the hell?

240
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,389
- But l was
- Do me a favor, Devin?

241
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,727
- Yeah. What you need?
- Throw that away.

242
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,365
Thanks, Devin.

243
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,235
It's - It's Kevin.

244
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,638
- What's up, baby?
- Hey, how you doing?

245
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,373
Get in the car, baby.

246
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,241
- Come on, girl.
She gave you doo-doo.

247
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:56,513
You were supposed to get
the number, not doo-doo.

248
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,680
What's up, now?

249
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,850
Why they keep looking at us like that?
Your baby cousins?

250
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:05,087
They, like, the same size. That's so cute.

251
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:08,458
K-Ci and JoJo. Hey, man, you can't
get no girl in no Foot Locker shirt.

252
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,757
Ooh, yeah

253
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,592
Hey.

254
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,461
Go make the 'hood look good.

255
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,033
Hey, l wear size 12.

256
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:24,942
See, man, she likes this corny-ass Giovanni.
This corny ass.

257
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:26,976
Dog, there go Lorenzo.

258
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,013
- Don't even look at him. Just keep walking.
All right.

259
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,416
Ain't no thing, we got places to go.

260
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,820
Get your bitch ass over here, slim.

261
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,554
And bring Mr. Foot Locker with you.

262
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,125
- l think he saw me.
- Because you looked at him.

263
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,593
Y'all don't have to go over there.
- Come on, man.

264
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,262
Damn.

265
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:53,069
What's up, Lorenzo?
How was your vacation?

266
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:56,440
They got cell phones in prison now.
You should've hit me up.

267
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,576
You know what I'd do to
a bitch like you in my "cellie"?

268
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,952
I'll make you snuggle up with me
at night.

269
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,220
And I'll squeeze you.

270
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:12,955
I squeeze you.

271
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,388
l squeeze you.

272
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,958
And l squeeze you!

273
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,937
Next time, it's your rib cage.
You feel me?

274
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,137
All right, let's go.

275
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:31,274
- I'm sorry.
Bring your ass, let's go.

276
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:32,607
Hey, Foot Locker.

277
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,915
- What's up?
- When them new Jordans drop?

278
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,488
- They dropped Wednesday. What's good?
- Oh, word?

279
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,456
- Yeah.
- All right.

280
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:48,025
Hook us up with three pairs.

281
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:50,960
- Each.
- "Each"?

282
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:53,597
We'll be by later to pick them up.

283
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:55,330
Hook you up?

284
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:58,369
- As in, like, hook you up?
- Just spit it out, Rain Man. What?

285
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,536
- You buying them?
- If l was gonna buy them...

286
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:01,905
...what l need you for?

287
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,806
He got you. Don't worry about that.

288
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,142
Yo, think before you speak. Okay?

289
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,077
l blame the school systems, really.

290
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:10,614
No child left behind?
You left behind, Negro.

291
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:12,315
Close your mouth.

292
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,985
We got all the shoes you need.
- Get off the court.

293
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:16,618
- We out.
- We got him.

294
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:18,823
"We"? Dude, that's me.

295
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:21,024
You don't work at Foot Locker, nigga.

296
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:23,126
Where my ball at?

297
00:15:26,863 --> 00:15:27,898
You just got me killed.

298
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:31,369
You might as well grab the gun,
put it to my head and pull the trigger.

299
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:33,370
It's too hot to be picking up some shoes.

300
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:36,541
Lorenzo's a bitch.
He ain't gonna pick up them shoes.

301
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:39,077
- Free Jordans?
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

302
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:40,342
And you, you lucky.

303
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,946
You get to go off to college
while we're stuck here.

304
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:44,313
You know what? Don't start.

305
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,917
Man, you need to speak for yourself, bro.
I'll be rich.

306
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:49,219
l have my business plans
plotted out right now.

307
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:52,457
You could still apply to design school
if you really wanted to, Kevin.

308
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,726
Yeah, l can,
but design school costs money.

309
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:57,263
Besides, if l go,
who gonna watch my grandmother?

310
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:59,863
Other than Jesus, I'm all she got.

311
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:03,701
And right now Jesus ain't
paying the rent. Straight up.

312
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,402
He ain't gonna show up, Kev.

313
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,276
Fourteen minutes and 32 seconds late
there, Kevin.

314
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,645
That's coming out of your paycheck.

315
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:16,345
Yeah, I figured that.

316
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:19,584
For someone who has his aspirations
on being assistant manager...

317
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,085
...you're not showing me much.

318
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,687
There's more to the job
than just knowing about shoes.

319
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,121
Remember that.

320
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:28,825
- Man.
- You like what you see?

321
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:30,961
Man, them joints is crazy.

322
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:33,664
- How much are those?
- About 5000.

323
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,134
- Five thousand what? Dollars?
- Yep.

324
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,202
You gotta be kidding me.
For some sneakers?

325
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,471
Hold on. They're not just sneakers.

326
00:16:40,636 --> 00:16:43,308
These are Clark Kent limited-edition
Air Force 1s.

327
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:44,975
The mesh, that's all original.

328
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:47,913
From the original Air Force Highs
that dropped in 1982.

329
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:51,717
Look at the elephant print
from the original Retro Jordan Ill's.

330
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:54,052
Yeah, he put up big numbers
against Bird in those.

331
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:55,986
I'll get them one day.

332
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:58,922
Man, they're just shoes.

333
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,526
Yeah, all right. Well, maybe to you...

334
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:02,727
...but not to me.

335
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,935
Can l get some help?

336
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,536
Can somebody help me, please?

337
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,907
- Can somebody service this customer?
- I can, sir.

338
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:19,144
I can service you, sir. How...?
What can I do you for?

339
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:22,112
Not you.

340
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,147
Him.

341
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,221
- No.
- Uh, Kevin?

342
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:30,187
Come here.

343
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:32,524
Be right with you.

344
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,495
Keep your eye on them.
They look like riffraff.

345
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,897
Man, you have no idea.

346
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,001
Fellas, what can l help y'all with?
Y'all want the T-shirt?

347
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:43,600
Shut up.

348
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,778
Give me some 12s, some 13s, all right?

349
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:53,980
Black joints with the swoosh on the side.

350
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:57,885
And l know they got them because l called
to make sure when they was in stock.

351
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,787
Usually l work the register. l didn't

352
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:02,789
Will you go get the shoes? Chop-chop.

353
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,228
Hey, check it out, man.

354
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:14,133
If those don't fit, there's another
Foot Locker you can go to.

355
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:15,967
- No, they fit.
- All right.

356
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,836
You know, when l was a kid...

357
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:20,038
...if l wanted some new pairs of shoes...

358
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:23,042
...used to have to steal them
off niggas' feet. Just rob them.

359
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,312
But thanks to you,
we got new shoes fresh out the box.

360
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:27,679
That's love, man.

361
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,550
- Got it.
- So how much l owe you?

362
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:35,186
You gonna pay?

363
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:36,721
Tsh.

364
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,158
Don't you know crime don't pay?

365
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:42,260
You stupid.

366
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:46,400
Hey, man, y'all want no socks?
No bag? All right.

367
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:49,135
Just walk right out the store.

368
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,669
- Carry them all like that.
Where you going?

369
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,039
You little bitch!

370
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,543
Yo, no, l didn't do nothing!

371
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,843
Yeah, l know that.

372
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,380
Part of what you didn't do
is pay for the shoes.

373
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:04,250
Yo, yo, he gave them to us. Ask him.

374
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:06,519
Ask that brother there.
He said it was a gift.

375
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:08,121
Is that true?

376
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:14,895
Well, did you or did you not?

377
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:21,102
No. I didn't.

378
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,469
Let's go.

379
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:27,307
You're a dead man. You hear me?
You're a dead man!

380
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,750
Wait a minute. He fired you for that?

381
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:38,918
Yes. Right on the spot.

382
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,286
He didn't even hesitate.

383
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:44,390
- Kevin, I'm so sorry.
- Look, l mean, it is what it is.

384
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:47,027
l mean, who cares?

385
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:52,132
Like... It's fine.

386
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:57,236
What's it say?

387
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:59,072
- Some nonsense.
- What?

388
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:01,709
- Don't do that, it's bad luck.
- It don't even matter.

389
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:03,543
You're right.

390
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:07,080
l don't wanna spoil all the good luck
l've been having.

391
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:10,084
You know what? Just take it, okay?

392
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:11,985
Come on, Stacie.

393
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:16,556
And eat your food.

394
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:21,062
You can lean in the window a bit
more next time. Don't be scared of me.

395
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:23,095
And here you go. Appreciate it.

396
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:25,432
l can transform you

397
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:28,202
- Kev. What's happening?
- You tell me.

398
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,635
You came for the lottery too?

399
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,171
- You stood in that line?
- Yup.

400
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:33,740
- The machine just broke.
- What do you mean, it broke?

401
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,142
l just broke the machine.

402
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:39,146
I'm joking. I know your mama
would beat the black off you.

403
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:41,081
You gotta come and play them numbers.

404
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:43,350
- How many tickets you need?
- I just need one.

405
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:45,352
- Just one?
- Yeah, just one.

406
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:47,121
Ring me up for this Cherry Coke.

407
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:49,323
And let me get two beef jerkys.

408
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:52,060
Nasty combination.
Sure you wanna do that to your stomach?

409
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:55,129
And, yeah, play those numbers for me.

410
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:57,464
Give me this, give me this, give me this.

411
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:58,799
Here you go.

412
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,469
- All right.
- Enjoy this.

413
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,939
You sure you don't want one
for yourself?

414
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,307
Three hundred and seventy million.

415
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:10,946
No, man, that's not me. l don't really
do that whole lottery thing, man.

416
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,650
Three hundred-seventy million.
You can't be too cool for that.

417
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:17,585
Ticket?

418
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:19,386
- All right.
- Do it. There we go.

419
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:21,957
Give me some numbers.
I need numbers, I need numbers.

420
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:24,225
I wasn't, but...

421
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:26,894
People rushing me like I'm
taking a long time. Here you

422
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,266
Oh, and then you pull out
the fortune cookie. Okay, that's cool.

423
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,932
Get your chang-wang numbers.

424
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:34,837
If you win, you gonna put the money
in that hole in your shirt?

425
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,504
That what you gonna do? Walk safely.

426
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:40,107
Watch out for the people.

427
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,245
You gonna come here
and ruin everybody day?

428
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,682
Your vibe is just ignorance today.

429
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:50,419
That's how you spell ignorance: Y-O-U.

430
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,554
Come on.
Your house, right now.

431
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,427
Hold on. Oh, hold on.
Yo, Kevin. Kevin. Kev!

432
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:00,762
Yo, Kevin, man, you okay? You cool?

433
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:01,962
Yeah, man, what's up?

434
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:04,867
l heard what happened with Lorenzo.
The neighborhood's talking.

435
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,770
What you mean, they're?
Weren't nobody even there.

436
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:10,839
They said you set him up
and you snitched on him to the cops.

437
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:14,077
- Why'd you snitch on him?
l ain't snit

438
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:16,645
- Everybody think I'm snitching?
- That's what they said.

439
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,782
Man. Damn!

440
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:22,918
Yeah, damn.

441
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:26,355
Shake it off, you can find another job.

442
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:29,590
What up, bitches?

443
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:32,796
Who you calling "bitch"?
I'll beat your ass, man.

444
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,199
I don't play that voodoo shit.
You better get up out of here with that.

445
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:37,665
Snitch!

446
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:42,604
You just could not wait.
- Come on.

447
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,642
Y'all know l ain't no snitch.
When you ever heard me snitching?

448
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:47,241
Today.

449
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,244
This nigga about to get killed.

450
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:54,115
Yo.

451
00:22:55,316 --> 00:22:57,153
l got everything for

452
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:01,088
Man, not even a "thank you."

453
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,392
Kevin?
Yes?

454
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,062
Thank God.

455
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:09,964
I was so worried.

456
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:13,270
Let me look at your face.
Are you all right?

457
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,604
I'm okay. How'd you even hear about it?

458
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:19,042
Semaj came over.
Borrowed some toilet tissue.

459
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,645
Here you go.
I played your numbers for you.

460
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:25,013
What you gonna do?

461
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:27,650
Well, I just wanna go to bed.

462
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:42,631
- Good evening, I'm Bonnie Berry.
- Hey, Miss Bonnie.

463
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:46,670
Here's tonight's Mondo Millions
drawing for a jackpot of $370 million.

464
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:47,937
Come on, Jesus.

465
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:51,042
To win, all you have to do
is match all five white balls...

466
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,374
...plus the Mondo Ball.

467
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,476
- A whole lot of Mondo.
- Let's get started.

468
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,647
We gotta get it. Come on.
Seventeen. Seventeen.

469
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,148
The first number is...

470
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:02,284
...42.

471
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:05,622
Forty-stinking-two?
I ain't got no 42.

472
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:08,358
Oh, damn, damn, damn!

473
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:10,025
forty-five.

474
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:24,974
I'm standing with
the owner of Junior's Market...

475
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,347
...where last night's winning
Mondo Millions jackpot ticket was sold.

476
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,545
Oh, Lord Jesus.

477
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:32,249
We understand the winner
hasn't come forward yet?

478
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:35,854
That's right. No, they have not.
The thing is, it's killing me...

479
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:40,058
...because I'm supposed to get
$10.000 just for selling the ticket...

480
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,657
...you know what I'm saying?

481
00:24:41,823 --> 00:24:44,461
If you're out there watching
and got the winning ticket...

482
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:47,531
...holler at your boy Junior, man.
Daddy got bilIs to pay, baby.

483
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,934
Talking about he got bilIs to pay?
We all got bilIs to pay, huh?

484
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,072
- Also, I wanna shoutout
- Whoever does have that ticket...

485
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:59,346
a piece of paper worth $370 million.

486
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:01,211
And just in case you missed it...

487
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,915
...here's another look
at the winning numbers.

488
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,082
The first winning number is 42.

489
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:08,085
That ain't nowhere near 17.

490
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,886
followed by 33.

491
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:13,356
Next we have four.

492
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:16,560
And 32 and 45.

493
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:22,703
And the all-important Mondo 8all
number is Number 21.

494
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:27,641
Experts say the chances of winning
is 1 in 175 million.

495
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,906
- Grandma.
- You okay, boy?

496
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,709
- Get money.
Hey.

497
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:33,776
We won the lottery.

498
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:36,313
Ah. Now, come on, Kevin.

499
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,884
No, no. Grandma, look.
Grandma, we won the lottery!

500
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:42,622
Now, let me see here.
Four, 32, 33...

501
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:44,555
- ...42
- Forty-five!

502
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,990
- Twenty-one!
- You got all six numbers.

503
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:48,258
Yes. We won.

504
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:53,430
Grandma!

505
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:56,266
Grandma, we won!

506
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:06,677
Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

507
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:09,779
Just wonderful!

508
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:11,981
Jesus!

509
00:26:12,148 --> 00:26:13,183
l gotta call somebody!

510
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:15,620
Call? No! No! Don't! No!

511
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,455
No. Don't you

512
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:21,426
No. You can't call people.

513
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,795
Look, you gotta keep this between us.

514
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:26,797
Nobody can know about this, all right?

515
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:28,198
- Only me and you know.
- Okay.

516
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:31,304
- That's it. You have to promise me.
- Okay, okay, l promise.

517
00:26:31,468 --> 00:26:33,906
- I just got all excited.
- Oh, shit.

518
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,274
Wait. I can't say "shit"
in my grandmother's house.

519
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,075
- Oh, you sure can't.
- I'm sorry.

520
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,847
- Oh, Lord. Lord.
- Okay. Okay, Grandma.

521
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,146
Settle down, Grandma.

522
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:46,053
I just need to go down to Junior's
and figure out how to turn this ticket in.

523
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:48,286
No! Don't you leave that house
with this ticket.

524
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:50,722
- And why?
- Well, what if somebody was to?

525
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:52,123
What if you was to get?

526
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:53,892
- Oh, Lord Jesus. Child.
- What?

527
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,492
Spit it out.

528
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,294
I never thought I'd have to use this.

529
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,796
- You got a pistol?
- Wait on it.

530
00:26:58,962 --> 00:26:59,997
Grandma, no!

531
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:02,635
- What is it, then?
- Holy water. From the Catholic church.

532
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:06,071
- Grandma!
- The Lord here! Be with you!

533
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:08,006
- Because the Lord is with me!
- It's cold.

534
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:09,574
What you doing?

535
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:12,043
Here. No!

536
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,511
- Grandma.
- I'm sorry, baby.

537
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:17,751
Look, I just wanna go outside
and just go down to Junior's...

538
00:27:17,948 --> 00:27:20,820
- ...and just get some information.
- Okay, then. All right.

539
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:22,921
Nobody knows about this ticket.

540
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:25,123
I ain't telling nobody.
I wouldn't tell nobody.

541
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:26,658
- You promise?
- I promise.

542
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:28,693
Only me and you know this, now.

543
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:30,228
I could be asleep right now.

544
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:32,063
Just thank God you woke up.
Whatever.

545
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:34,700
That's so cliché to say that.
I wanna go to sleep.

546
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:36,667
- Whatever.
- My job is to sleep in.

547
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,271
- Damn.
Damn, she's fine.

548
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:44,343
- You wish you'd get a girl like that.
- Finer than you.

549
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:46,178
Yeah, good luck. Ha, ha.

550
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,182
This is the same white dude
poking holes in your condoms.

551
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:52,186
- Give me a second, I'll be right back.
- Excuse me, fellas.

552
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,253
Don't steal nothing.

553
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:56,422
Slow the beat down and feel it like that

554
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:58,791
Hey, man. Let me talk to you
real quick, all right?

555
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,659
- What?
Talk to me through this window?

556
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:01,893
Get your ass over there.

557
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,563
- What's the difference?
- Idon't know, let's go.

558
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:06,198
Look, man, quick question.

559
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:08,869
Right, say it's the person,
whoever wins the ticket.

560
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,635
- They come here to claim it.
- Right.

561
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:13,405
How does that work?
You write a check for the whole amount?

562
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:18,546
Okay, so you saying that
I got $370 million in here.

563
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:22,282
That's... I don't have that.
I can write you a check for $600...

564
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:26,521
and then you gotta take the Mondo Millions
ticket to the lottery district office.

565
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:27,719
Where's that? Upstate?

566
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:30,958
No, it's downtown.
It's where I get all the tickets from.

567
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:33,427
Downtown. Come on.

568
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:35,026
Fix your dreads.

569
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:36,429
Yeah.

570
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,064
You need to steal some Tic Tacs.

571
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:42,702
Kevin.

572
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:46,039
Let me ask you a question.
Why you acting all suspicious and whatnot?

573
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:48,541
Me? What? I'm not acting suspicious.

574
00:28:48,706 --> 00:28:50,409
I'm just excited.

575
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:52,812
Beep, beep, beep. What?
What are you talking about?

576
00:28:52,977 --> 00:28:54,647
Oh, man.

577
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:05,358
"Violence Erupts in Downtown."

578
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:06,926
- No.
- That's great.

579
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,330
Nosy.

580
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,548
- Oh, shi
- Shut up.

581
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:30,985
Sit down. See?
That's why I didn't

582
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:33,286
I'm sorry, ma'am.

583
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:36,056
I'm sorry, sir.

584
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,525
If I move my hands off your mouth,
will you be quiet?

585
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:40,427
You won't say a word?

586
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:42,294
Give me that.

587
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,496
Man.

588
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:47,869
- Act normal, sit up.
- You act normal. You sit up.

589
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:51,540
- Don't be telling me what to do.
- Don't tell me what to do.

590
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:56,442
- Kevin.
- What?

591
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:58,579
- If this is real, right?
- Right.

592
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:00,682
- Do you know who you are?
- Right. I know.

593
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:02,416
You like the Moses of the projects.

594
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:04,117
- Look, no more WIC cards.
- Right.

595
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:06,119
- You could take Grandma to Vegas.
- Vegas.

596
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:07,553
- Buy her a castle.
- Castle.

597
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,559
You could take your girl to Venus
and still have money left over.

598
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:13,695
Look, the sooner I turn the ticket in,
the safer I'm gonna feel.

599
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:18,598
It's on. Come on.

600
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:28,943
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Let's get this money.

601
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:31,412
I can really smell the money.

602
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:33,379
- What's up, man?
- My man?

603
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:35,082
Quit mopping for one second.

604
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:38,286
This is the lottery district office, right?

605
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:40,956
- Cool.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.

606
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,923
Where everybody at?
Everybody at lunch?

607
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:44,791
- Yeah. Where?
- Closed.

608
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:46,459
- Closed?
- Closed.

609
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,363
- What you mean?
- What you talking about?

610
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:49,898
For the Fourth of July.

611
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:51,865
Be open again Tuesday, 9 a.m.

612
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:53,901
- Tues?
- I hate Fourth of July.

613
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,735
Man, that's three whole days.

614
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:57,939
Know how much shit can happen
in three days?

615
00:30:58,104 --> 00:30:59,372
Let's just think about this.

616
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:02,044
Me, you and your grandma
are the only ones who know.

617
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,913
If they knew back home,
you'd have already been shot.

618
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:06,612
- Am l right?
- Yeah, but

619
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,717
You're making this sound real easy
right now.

620
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:11,385
Come on, Kevin.
You tell me, what can go wrong?

621
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:14,922
Oh, happy day

622
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:17,090
Drop it like it's hot for Jesus!

623
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:21,532
- Oh, happy day
- Oh, happy day

624
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:24,500
I dropped it like it was hot!

625
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:28,970
Jesus Christ

626
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,642
I'm sorry.
- What was that? You scared me.

627
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:35,844
I'm sorry.
l didn't mean to startle you.

628
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:38,212
l just was walking by,
l heard all the noise.

629
00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:42,118
- What's all the celebrating about?
- No, no celebrating.

630
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:45,755
l ain't seen you this happy since you
found out shrimp went to 2.99 a pound.

631
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:47,588
What you doing? Having a fish fry?

632
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:49,591
No.

633
00:31:49,956 --> 00:31:51,693
l don't smell nothing. What's going on?

634
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:53,529
- What you got?
- l can't say nothing.

635
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:56,031
- What's that behind your back?
- l can't say nothing.

636
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,169
- Come on, you can tell me. You can tell me.
- No.

637
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,368
Come on, come on.

638
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:04,208
You know, most of the drug dealers,
like the big ones, shit, the bosses...

639
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:05,473
...they weigh they money.

640
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:08,111
- Because they can't count it.
- l heard about that. Right.

641
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:10,445
Man. Somebody stole from them,
they'd know.

642
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:13,450
- "They tried to steal my money!"
- Stop, stop, stop.

643
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:14,950
You gonna be a boss, son.

644
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:17,018
- Stop. Damn.
- Oh, my gosh.

645
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,288
l wonder, does Oprah weigh her money?

646
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:21,323
- Kevin, where everybody at?
- Good question.

647
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:23,425
Hey, little man, where everybody at?

648
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,625
Oh, you don't know.

649
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,829
- Let's spring to my crib real quick.
- Yeah.

650
00:32:29,062 --> 00:32:32,168
- Whoa.
- There he is. There he is right there.

651
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:37,272
- Grandma?
I'm here, baby.

652
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:39,174
Get out the way! Move out the way!

653
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:41,242
Y'all move away from here!

654
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:43,713
Grandma. What's up?
You called everybody?

655
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,184
l ain't called nobody.
l ain't called nobody.

656
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:51,121
Semaj, he come over here. Then he goes out
and come backs with all these people.

657
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:54,224
Hey, come on, Kev, let's go
to the strip club. Make it rain!

658
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,393
I just wanna touch it.
I just wanna touch it.

659
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,760
Touch what?
You ain't gonna touch shit.

660
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,966
I know your daddy. He still owe me
money from a craps game in '89.

661
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:04,266
- You gotta help pay
- My medical insurance.

662
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:05,667
Damn your medical insurance.

663
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:08,103
Yo, Kevin, l got an investment idea
that can't miss.

664
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:10,940
Two words, man: massage toilet.

665
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:12,907
Now, all l need is the money.

666
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,082
Go!

667
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:28,325
Come on!

668
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:31,693
Come on! Go, go, go!

669
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:33,394
Come on!

Shit!

All right, your crib! Come on!

672
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:42,873
Kevin!

673
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:45,040
Come on, my window,
my window, my window!

674
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,343
Come on. Go, go!

675
00:33:51,914 --> 00:33:54,485
Where'd he go?
Kevin!

676
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,725
Dude. Ain't no way.

677
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,429
Ain't no way I'm making it
to Tuesday, dog. Uh-uh.

678
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,764
Damn.

679
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,241
Kevin. Get up. l got a plan.

680
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:22,848
This here is what we call
the underground railroad, Kevin.

681
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:26,284
Many slaves have used this to escape.

682
00:34:26,448 --> 00:34:27,750
We can escape, Kevin.

683
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,352
We can get out the 'hood, right?

684
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:31,555
We go through Indiana,
go through Michigan.

685
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,790
Harriet Tubman did it.
We follow the North Star.

686
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:36,361
- No.
- Then we sing Negro spirituals.

687
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:39,264
l always wanted to sing Negro spirituals.
Let me live my dream.

688
00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:42,433
We leak that, right?
Turn it into a mix tape, right?

689
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:44,635
A mix tape of Negro spirituals. Let's go!

690
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,068
No.

691
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:50,307
What's wrong with you?

692
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:52,642
Man, get off the floor.

693
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:54,678
The money's in my head.

694
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,081
- Three hundred-seventy million.
- Just listen.

695
00:34:57,246 --> 00:34:58,448
Listen!

696
00:34:58,614 --> 00:35:02,221
Look, all we need is something simple.
That's it, something simple.

697
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:04,622
We'll just pretend like
the ticket's a fake, then.

698
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:06,524
Ticket's a fake!

699
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,458
That's it. That's it.

700
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:10,260
- You could say you made it up.
- Right.

701
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:11,630
- Hell, yeah.
- Yes!

702
00:35:11,796 --> 00:35:14,465
They already think you a snitch.
They'll think you a snitch and a liar.

703
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,533
Stick to the plan.
The ticket is fake, okay?

704
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,270
Remember when Steve Harvey had hair?
It was what? Fake.

705
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,005
Kim Kardashian's ass is what?

706
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,806
- Fake. Everything, fake.
- There we go.

707
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:24,341
Kevin!

708
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,880
Back up. Back up. Everybody back up.

709
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:32,151
Back up, little mama.
That go for you too, James.

710
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:33,850
My name is Semaj. "Back up"?

711
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:35,052
Nigga, your name James.

712
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:38,490
Just because you spell it backwards
don't make it different. It's James.

713
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:40,492
Better move your hair-cutting ass back.

714
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:47,133
- No problem, bro.
- And that go for everybody else out here.

715
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:49,901
Y'all better start showing this man
some respect...

716
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,671
...and quit running around
acting like wild-ass animals.

717
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,673
Thank you.
- Like the way l handled that?

718
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,577
We was thinking that you need,
like, a entourage, yo.

719
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,546
Hell, yeah.
Hey, Kev, anything you want, man.

720
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:03,948
Hey, you ever seen
my little sister lately?

721
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:05,049
No.

722
00:36:05,114 --> 00:36:07,888
Nigga, she real cute and I hear she a freak.

723
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:11,558
Hey, Tanisha! Operation Lay Down
With a Millionaire is in effect.

724
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:13,023
Everybody listen!

725
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:15,192
Hevin! Hevin! Hevin!

726
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,862
- Wait, wait, wait.
- We love you, Kevin.

727
00:36:18,028 --> 00:36:19,296
l wanna have your baby.

728
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:21,766
l been trying to get you pregnant
for the longest.

729
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,768
l know your mama.

730
00:36:28,538 --> 00:36:31,176
Look, just the other day
everybody thought l was a snitch.

731
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:32,843
But the other day you wasn't rich.

732
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,381
- So, what you want me to do?
- l say you roll with it.

733
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:41,454
You hear that? "Kevin. Kevin. Kevin."

734
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:47,027
All right, everybody.
Everybody, please, please, please.

735
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,093
What l was trying to say...

736
00:36:50,027 --> 00:36:51,830
...was that, Fillmore,
we on now, baby!

737
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:58,937
I'm gonna get a jet!

738
00:36:59,103 --> 00:37:01,106
I'm gonna get a jet!

739
00:37:04,274 --> 00:37:05,977
I'm gonna get a jet!

740
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,146
- Kevin, l just heard. l just heard.
- Hey, hey.

741
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:12,820
Hold up. You just can't be running up
on Mr. Carson like that these days.

742
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,187
Man, what you doing?
Pointing a gun at Stacie?

743
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:17,288
You know we love Stacie.

744
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:18,856
No. Y'all wrong.

745
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,225
Stop. Stop. Stop.

746
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:22,828
I'm just saying, she might have something.

747
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:25,798
- What is all of this?
- What?

748
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,566
My entourage?

749
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:30,669
Look, it's just for protection.

750
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:33,639
HaIf these cats out here trying to kill me,
you know that.

751
00:37:33,804 --> 00:37:36,876
- True.
- Hey, look. Forget that.

752
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:39,445
You know where I got the numbers?

753
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,714
- Where?
- That fortune cookie from your job.

754
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,482
- You're lying.
- No, l swear to God.

755
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:44,949
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

756
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:49,323
Boy, how you gonna win off my fortune
cookie and not tell me? Where is my cut?

757
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:51,389
Your cut? You don't be hooking me up.

758
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:54,828
- When l come over and l get the kung pao
- l hook you up all the time.

759
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:56,028
Yeah, with the sample.

760
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:00,799
You don't even have to go
to design school.

761
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,503
You could start your own shoe company.

762
00:38:04,468 --> 00:38:05,636
Yeah, l guess l could.

763
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:10,045
That is all you been talking about since
you were 9 years old. This is it, Kevin.

764
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,714
- You okay?
- Yeah, just...

765
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:15,914
l mean...

766
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:22,190
Man, l don't know, Stacie. Man, it's a lot.
It's a lot. I'm not even gonna lie to you.

767
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:25,492
l know, but trust me, l got you.
You're good.

768
00:38:25,657 --> 00:38:27,694
- I'm worried now.
- Okay? You know.

769
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:28,860
Hey, Kevin.

770
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:34,534
Hi.

771
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:39,304
Hold on.

772
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:41,273
Okay.

773
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:44,210
What's up, Nikki?
- l owe you an apology.

774
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:49,351
l was so rude to you yesterday
and l been feeling horrible ever since.

775
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:51,083
Look, it's cool.

776
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,785
You know, l understand.

777
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:54,587
- l ain't tripping. It's all good.
- No.

778
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:56,857
l don't think you do, Kevin.

779
00:38:57,022 --> 00:38:59,527
l've always thought
that you were so fine.

780
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:02,997
Yesterday, when you came up to me,
I guess I just didn't know what to say.

781
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:04,163
What?

782
00:39:05,797 --> 00:39:08,903
I was hoping maybe you'd give me
a chance to make it up.

783
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:10,537
Are you busy tonight?

784
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:12,072
Hell, no, he ain't.

785
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,274
Good.

786
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,478
My mother's gonna be gone.
Maybe we can go out somewhere...

787
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:20,949
...and then later you can come back
and keep me company.

788
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,815
You'll let me do that?

789
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,418
l mean

790
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:27,888
Cool. Yeah, we can

791
00:39:28,154 --> 00:39:30,725
l promise, Kevin, you will never, ever...

792
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:34,862
...ever forget tonight.

793
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:40,767
See you later.

794
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:44,072
Later, if you want, you can
Ieave your panties at my house.

795
00:39:44,236 --> 00:39:45,271
My house.

796
00:39:45,437 --> 00:39:47,742
Damn, Kev. Did she touch your face?

797
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:50,277
Yeah, and my stomach.

798
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:52,145
That ass is priceless!

799
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:56,149
That's what you like?
That's what you like?

800
00:39:56,315 --> 00:39:58,653
Please tell me you did not
just fall for that.

801
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:00,488
That bitch is beyond trifling.

802
00:40:00,653 --> 00:40:02,490
- Come on, Stacie.
l smell jealousy.

803
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:06,194
- Jealousy is in the air.
- No, no, no. It is so obvious.

804
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,831
Only reason she came over,
she heard about your ticket.

805
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:10,897
Wait. You saying my boy
ain't good enough...

806
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:13,200
...to get a girl like Nikki Swayze
without money?

807
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:16,940
No. What I'm saying is yesterday
she handed you a bag of shit, right?

808
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:20,276
Today, suddenly she wants to screw you.
Is that a coincidence?

809
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:21,674
Come on.

810
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:24,613
- Whatever. Do what you wanna do.
Stace, don't be like that.

811
00:40:24,777 --> 00:40:26,914
- Stacie just being Stacie, man.
- l ain't got time for this.

812
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,617
You need to be thinking about
where you gonna take Nikki.

813
00:40:29,782 --> 00:40:32,154
- Already got it covered.
- She gonna bring her friends?

814
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,690
- l already got the spot.
- Okay, where we going?

815
00:40:35,554 --> 00:40:36,989
- Y'all ready?
Yeah.

816
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:39,060
I'm gonna take her
to that new Waffle House.

817
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:40,828
- No, man.
- Goddamn Waffle House!

818
00:40:40,994 --> 00:40:43,999
You can't take her there.
Not no ghetto spot, man. You a baller now.

819
00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:46,067
You gotta take her to a place like...

820
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:47,868
- What's that joint called?
- Dolce.

821
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,636
Dolce Vittoria.

822
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:52,440
Hey, dog.
That's where all the rich people go, man.

823
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:56,212
Y'all forgetting, l ain't got no money.
I'm just as broke now as l was yesterday.

824
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:59,248
l can't get that money until
l turn in that ticket. You know that.

825
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,350
- That's true, yeah.
- Oh, you need money?

826
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:03,684
If you need money,
l can get you some money.

827
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,452
How are you gonna get me some money?

828
00:41:05,618 --> 00:41:07,521
Man, l know a dude
that got stacks of money.

829
00:41:07,687 --> 00:41:10,058
l mean, he got packs of money.

830
00:41:10,223 --> 00:41:12,160
- Racks of money.
Y'all vouch for him?

831
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:13,560
What? That's our boy.

832
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:15,529
Let's go get this stimulus package,
nigga.

833
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:20,503
l told y'all l knew where
to get the money from.

834
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:22,804
l know Sweet Tee and them
for years.

835
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:25,507
I know all his brothers and everybody.

836
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:28,477
What's up, Jimmy?

837
00:41:30,477 --> 00:41:33,014
You, you. Come on.

838
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,449
Come on.

839
00:41:34,614 --> 00:41:37,251
- This your boy?
- Yeah.

840
00:41:38,952 --> 00:41:41,657
This better not be no bullshit, man.

841
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:45,660
Did l stutter?

842
00:41:46,092 --> 00:41:47,895
- What's up, Jimmy?
- Get off the steps.

843
00:41:48,061 --> 00:41:50,466

844
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,001
Man, tell Sweet Tee l here, Jimmy.

845
00:41:54,202 --> 00:41:57,141

00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:13,124
Hey, look, if you need me for anything,
I'll be out here chilling.

851
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,726
Hey, fellas. Over here.

852
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,675
- Do you know who l am?
- Yeah, l heard of you before.

853
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,508
What have you heard about me?

854
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:35,911
You know, just stuff like how...

855
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:39,851
...you're like the Godfather
of the projects. Stuff like that.

856
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:45,591
Well, to my friends l go by Sweet Tee.

857
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:48,091
And I'd like very much to be
your friend, Kevin.

858
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:52,730
First of all, let me say congratulations
on your newfound wealth.

859
00:42:52,894 --> 00:42:57,068
It's always a wonderful feeling
when you make your first few million.

860
00:42:57,499 --> 00:43:00,838
I'd also like you to accept this loan
as a token of my friendship.

861
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:06,578
Yeah. Just think of it
as a little business loan.

862
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,211
- How much money is this?
- A hundred G.

863
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,982
l figure that's enough for you boys
to have a good time...

864
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:13,849
...and a special night with your girl.

865
00:43:14,015 --> 00:43:15,184
Look, Mr. Tee...

866
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,885
Sweet Tee.

867
00:43:17,618 --> 00:43:20,590
Right. Sorry about that. Sweet Tee.

868
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:23,760
Look, l really do appreciate it...

869
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:25,061
...but l can't take this.

870
00:43:26,094 --> 00:43:27,896
Are you refusing my friendship?

871
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:30,265
No.

872
00:43:30,432 --> 00:43:32,202
No. No. Not at all.

873
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,604
Oh, go on, take that money
and enjoy yourself.

874
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,805
This here is Jimmy the Driver.

875
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:40,376
Now, he's gonna be your chaperone
for the weekend.

876
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:43,781
Now, just to make sure that there
are no problems, you understand?

877
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:44,981
<i><b><u>DVDQS by ForsakeN</u></b></i>

878
00:43:45,147 --> 00:43:47,751
Tee, can I talk to you for a minute, sir?

879
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,086
- Excuse me.
- Please.

880
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,322
Why are you doing this to me, man?

881
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:55,728
You didn't tell me l had to babysit
Bébé's Kids the whole damn weekend.

882
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:57,593
Laquita got her stitches out, come on.

883
00:43:57,759 --> 00:43:59,896
You just make sure
nothing happens to this kid...

884
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:03,568
...or you'll be parking cars
back at the strip club, you get it?

885
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,038
That is, if it's okay with you guys.

886
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:08,904
Deal?

887
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:14,144
- All right.
There you go.

888
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:17,947
I like that.

889
00:44:24,587 --> 00:44:26,289
Just do it.

890
00:45:36,292 --> 00:45:37,327
There go that boy.

Oh, okay, l see how it is, Kevin.

892
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:41,700
You come in with your crew,
you gonna jump me?

893
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:44,469
- What is he talking about?
I'm not afraid.

894
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:49,043
- I'm from a little town called Whup-Ass.
- Maybe you heard of my hometown.

895
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,275
I'm from the Wish-A-Nigga-Woulds.

896
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:53,445
Yeah. You ever been there?

897
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,380
- Weather is awesome.
Carl.

898
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:57,448
- Hey. How are you?
- What's up, man?

899
00:45:57,614 --> 00:45:58,716
- Everything good?
- Good.

900
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,553
- We're gonna do a little shopping today.
- All right.

901
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,054
Let me see.

902
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,091
I'm gonna take everything on this wall.
Yeah, everything.

903
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,925
And everything on this one too.

904
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:10,028
A couple size 10s.
What, you 10 and a half?

905
00:46:10,194 --> 00:46:13,166
- Ten and a half.
- And... Oh, yeah.

906
00:46:14,264 --> 00:46:16,901
- I'm taking them home with me too.
Seriously?

907
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:18,569
Oh, I'm dead serious.

908
00:46:18,736 --> 00:46:21,006
Yeah, right, Kevin.

909
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:23,542
How you gonna afford that?
You rob a bank?

910
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:26,145
- Benny.
- Look, Doug, that's the boss.

911
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,814
You disrespect him, you disrespect me.

912
00:46:28,979 --> 00:46:30,314
Now get us some shoes...

913
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:31,749
...bitch.

914
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:34,086
Make it rain!
- Let's go.

915
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,221
Let's do it. Shopping on me.

916
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:39,759
- All right, dog.
Hey, don't be a stranger.

917
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:43,262
Thanks, guys. Thank you very much.

918
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:45,430
Come on back anytime.

919
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:54,674
Let me up in this thing, man.

920
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,275
Hey, Nikki.

921
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,781
That's what I'm talking about.

922
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:05,117
Come on in.

923
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,285
- Everything okay?
- You know it.

924
00:47:23,368 --> 00:47:26,139
Well, how about you help me out
with this menu?

925
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:27,472
Sure.

926
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:30,544
Because l don't understand nothing
that's on here.

927
00:47:30,742 --> 00:47:33,046
Well, it's all pretty good.

928
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:35,882
Their chicken piccata is fantastic,
though.

929
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:38,284
- Maybe you should try that.
- You ate here before?

930
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,320
LeBron brought me here a few times.

931
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:41,520
"LeBron"?

932
00:47:43,254 --> 00:47:45,558
Le... LeBron James?

933
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:47,293
It was months ago, Kevin.

934
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:50,731
Damn. You just be doing it big, huh?

935
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:54,702
What? What you gonna tell me next,
Jay-l brought you here too?

936
00:47:54,865 --> 00:47:56,235
Please don't go there.

937
00:47:56,401 --> 00:47:58,238
Jay and I don't speak anymore.

938
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,414
Here. He can't pay for that.

939
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:08,714
- How you doing?
- Hi.

940
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,718
- I'm Benny. Nice to meet you. Pleasure.
- Yeah.

941
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,189
Hey, hey, hey. Let me get some water.

942
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:18,759
That's good.

943
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:23,931
You just stand here
till I tell you I'm thirsty.

944
00:48:26,397 --> 00:48:27,867
Let's get some lemon for that.

945
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:30,469
I like crazy girls, but not like stalker.

946
00:48:30,636 --> 00:48:32,840
I need a girl I can take to
church and strip clubs.

947
00:48:33,004 --> 00:48:34,807
- Hand me that silverware.
- The silverware?

948
00:48:34,973 --> 00:48:36,008
Nigga, are you serious?

949
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:38,812
- Hey, this is phat, baby.
We can't be doing this.

950
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:41,448
- We should go.
- You blowing up the spot.

951
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:44,018
Just take the shit
and put it in your purse.

952
00:48:44,516 --> 00:48:48,222
Chicken. I'm just gonna try
the piccotto chicken

953
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:50,022
Piccata.

954
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,693
- I'm gonna have some of that.
- Right.

955
00:48:53,091 --> 00:48:56,063
Good choice, though.
That's what Bill always gets.

956
00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:57,730
"Bill"?

957
00:48:58,129 --> 00:49:00,099
Bill who? Clinton?

958
00:49:00,266 --> 00:49:03,037
No, Kevin. Cosby.

959
00:49:03,702 --> 00:49:06,374
Thank you. Lemon in the water, please.

960
00:49:06,538 --> 00:49:08,408
Oh, and l dropped my napkin.

961
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:10,577
Watch cartoons,
Saturday morning cartoons.

962
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:12,613
- Can l have some of this?
- Yeah, of course.

963
00:49:16,948 --> 00:49:19,486
Seventy-five dollars for this?

964
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:22,624
What were you expecting,
some big old ghetto burger?

965
00:49:22,788 --> 00:49:24,658
- Well
- Just try it, Kevin.

966
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:27,462
l just thought it'd be
a big piece of chicken.

967
00:49:30,729 --> 00:49:32,499
See? Good, right?

968
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:35,303
It is good. It ain't bad.
It's all right.

969
00:49:35,734 --> 00:49:39,274
Well, if you think that's tender...

970
00:49:40,072 --> 00:49:42,309
...warm and juicy...

971
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:03,464
Damn.

972
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:07,571
Just relax and let me do all the work.

973
00:50:08,267 --> 00:50:10,004
Oh, damn.

974
00:50:18,043 --> 00:50:19,880
This condom here.

975
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:21,849
Put this on.

976
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:24,419
Get it out.

977
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:33,660
You just feisty.

978
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:36,031
Let me help you. Here we go.

979
00:50:36,196 --> 00:50:37,898
Violent.

980
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:41,336
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me put the condom on.

981
00:50:41,935 --> 00:50:44,874
- Yeah, let me
- You don't need that, baby.

982
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:49,844
Wait, we can't - We can't

983
00:50:50,011 --> 00:50:54,152
Look, it's just I don't think we should do
it. I'm not ready to be a father yet.

984
00:50:54,481 --> 00:50:57,153
You say it like it's the worst thing
in the world.

985
00:50:58,218 --> 00:51:00,655
What, you think you're too good
to give me a baby?

986
00:51:00,821 --> 00:51:02,858
No, it's not that...

987
00:51:03,024 --> 00:51:04,559
It's just, we just young!

988
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:09,599
Look, what if you get pregnant
or something?

989
00:51:09,997 --> 00:51:13,938
We should use it because
that way we won't have babies.

990
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,402
We don't need babies.

991
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:17,105
It's just a lot. It's a lot.

992
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,773
Tsh.
- What?

993
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:22,878
Goddamn it, Kevin.
Soon as y'all get that little money...

994
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:25,749
...all l ever hear is,
"Condom, condom, condom."

995
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:31,523
Every hoodrat in this project gets to be
a baby mama for some baller except me?

996
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,625
Is that why you called me up here?
So l can get you pregnant?

997
00:51:36,757 --> 00:51:40,865
Sorry to bust your bubble, sweetie,
but a bitch gotta get paid.

998
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:43,766
And this...
Over here, Kevin.

999
00:51:44,365 --> 00:51:47,237
Right here, is my lottery ticket.

1000
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:53,276
You can let yourseIf out.

1001
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:03,483
Hey, youngster.

1002
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:05,285
Come here for a minute.

1003
00:52:05,451 --> 00:52:07,655
l wanna talk to you about something.

1004
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,857
- Well, can it wait?
- No.

1005
00:52:10,057 --> 00:52:12,962
Not if you care about that lottery ticket
that's in your wallet.

1006
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:21,836
Might as well come all the way in.

1007
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:24,939
You done come this far.

1008
00:52:43,624 --> 00:52:46,295
Don't you worry about that lotto ticket.

1009
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:48,396
If l wanted it...

1010
00:52:48,662 --> 00:52:50,932
...I'd have hit you
with a four-punch combination.

1011
00:52:51,098 --> 00:52:52,801
You'd have never seen it coming.

1012
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:57,706
Come on in, man. Stop looking scared.

1013
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:00,741
l won't bite you.

1014
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:03,878
First l wanna see what you got.
What you got? Come on.

1015
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:06,248
Why you fighting me?
- Let's go. What you got?

1016
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:08,817

- Yes.

1017
00:53:08,982 --> 00:53:10,485
- At all times?
- Yes.

1018
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:11,652
Well, do it!

1019
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,198
Come on in, man.
I'm just playing with you. Damn.

1020
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,698
Come on in, man.

1021
00:53:27,768 --> 00:53:31,142
Why you looking all scared?

1022
00:53:31,304 --> 00:53:35,545
It's your ugly friend Benny the one
think I'm a serial killer. Right?

1023
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:37,045
How you know about my ticket?

1024
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,847
Oh, man, l hear everything
that go on around here.

1025
00:53:40,414 --> 00:53:45,357
If l asleep on this couch or taking a dump,
then l don't hear too much.

1026
00:53:45,752 --> 00:53:46,921
But you don't go outside.

1027
00:53:47,587 --> 00:53:49,557
l don't need to go outside.

1028
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:51,560
You see that vent right there?

1029
00:53:51,926 --> 00:53:55,365
With this vent l can hear everything
going on with y'all right here.

1030
00:53:55,529 --> 00:53:57,399
l listen for hours.

1031
00:53:57,564 --> 00:53:59,134

1032
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:01,937

where you gonna park that thing at?

1033
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:05,442
Man, I'll park it on the roof.
Why is you all in my helicopter here?

1034
00:54:05,605 --> 00:54:07,610
Y'all gonna be like my
peasants around here.

1035
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:09,478
- What?
- You gonna go get my Now and Laters.

1036
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:11,279
I'm the baller.

1037
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:14,617
- You want some red Kool-Aid?
- Yeah.

1038
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:17,952
So...

1039
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:19,489
...why not go outside?

1040
00:54:20,722 --> 00:54:22,459
l don't need to go outside.

1041
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:24,727
Go out for what?

1042
00:54:25,026 --> 00:54:29,435
Ain't nothing around here
but drug dealers shooting each other.

1043
00:54:29,797 --> 00:54:33,003
- Y'all can have it. Here you go.
- Thanks.

1044
00:54:33,234 --> 00:54:35,739
What's up with the gloves?
You used to box or something?

1045
00:54:36,137 --> 00:54:37,573
"Used to"?

1046
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:46,549
Still got a little something.

1047
00:54:47,749 --> 00:54:50,254
Man, you box anybody I know?

1048
00:54:52,987 --> 00:54:56,060
- You ever heard of Muhammad Ali?
- Have I?

1049
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:58,460
Larry Holmes.

1050
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:02,233
Earnie Shavers. Ken Norton.

1051
00:55:02,396 --> 00:55:04,533
Ronnie Lyle.

1052
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:09,008
l even knocked out, uh
What's that boy's name? Leon Spinks.

1053
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:10,974
I'm the one knocked them teeth out.

1054
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:13,309
What, you think I'm lying?

1055
00:55:13,674 --> 00:55:17,481
Look, man, l was they sparring partner.

1056
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:21,386
They used to give me $300 a round
to spar.

1057
00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:23,552
That was big money back then.

1058
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:28,025
l never got my shot, you know?

1059
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,062
l never got a real fight.

1060
00:55:32,294 --> 00:55:33,964
But hey, I'm here.

1061
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:37,001
So why they call you Thump?
Is it because you hit hard?

1062
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,605
They call me Thump
because l hit the canvas hard.

1063
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:44,975
But l always got back up.

1064
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:47,010
Damn.

1065
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:48,546
You wasn't that good, huh?

1066
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:50,981
l didn't ever say l was.

1067
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,818
You know? l just love boxing.

1068
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:57,890
As a little kid, I just wanted to be a
boxer, so I gave it a shot.

1069
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:02,059
Weren't you nervous
that you would fail?

1070
00:56:02,591 --> 00:56:06,064
Of course.
But that ain't why you don't try.

1071
00:56:07,162 --> 00:56:10,402
What if l was one of the greats? Hm?

1072
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,003
What if it was all about me?

1073
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:16,541
l wouldn't know if l didn't try.

1074
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:20,179
I know I could've looked good
on that poster too.

1075
00:56:23,378 --> 00:56:25,215
Oh, man...

1076
00:56:26,448 --> 00:56:31,424
Look, man, I wish I could stay longer,
but I gotta get going, you know?

1077
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:33,657
Hey, wait. Hey, hey.

1078
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:38,031
Them is some interesting shoes
you got right there on your feet.

1079
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,598
Man, what the hell are those?
I like them.

1080
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:41,931
- Like them, huh?
- Yes.

1081
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:46,539
Hey, look, when I first got a little money,
it wasn't 300 million...

1082
00:56:46,702 --> 00:56:49,507
...but l got a little jewelry,
you know what l mean?

1083
00:56:49,671 --> 00:56:53,612
l was sharp. l had my leather piece,
l had my Cadillac...

1084
00:56:53,776 --> 00:56:55,578
...l had some girIs out front.

1085
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,882
l had everything a man could want.

1086
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,785
Yeah, everything.

1087
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:04,388
Man. What happened to it?

1088
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:08,560
l got robbed,
right out here on this stoop.

1089
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,228
They shot me in my ass...

1090
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,800
...ended my whole career just like that.

1091
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,601
What can you do, man?

1092
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,707
You step on a tent and it bent,
and that's the way it went.

1093
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:25,679
It's the neighborhood, man.
It's this neighborhood.

1094
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,913
l just wish somebody...

1095
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:32,785
...had the courage to come along
and make a difference.

1096
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:37,888
Okay.

1097
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:41,294
l don't know, man.
l ain't gonna hold you, Kevin.

1098
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:44,296
l just wanted some company, man.
That's all.

1099
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,003
- All right, Kevin.
- Thanks, man. Thanks.

1100
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:55,009

Oh, Lord, come by here

1109
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,795
Good morning, brothers and sisters.

1110
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,667
l know that you know that miracles
happen every day.

1111
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,000
That's right.
- Yes.

1112
00:58:56,166 --> 00:59:01,544
And l pray that the heavenly Father
is listening to us right now.

1113
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,241
- Yes.
He knows what you'll do...

1114
00:59:03,408 --> 00:59:05,545
...before you do it,
what you'd do before you did it...

1115
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,846
...and what you'll do
when you leave here.

1116
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:11,717
When you hear me say "miracles"...

1117
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:15,923
...I'm not talking about Smokey Robinson
and the four brothers out of Detroit!

1118
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:18,257
That's right, I'm not talking about
those fellas.

1119
00:59:18,423 --> 00:59:20,260
I'm not talking about...

1120
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:24,032
...the delicious spread you spread on
the bread called the Miracle Whip!

1121
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,739
Go ahead, Reverend.

1122
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:36,142
I, Reverend Taylor,
have had a vision.

1123
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:37,777
What'd you see, brother?

1124
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:40,079
- For many, many years.
Yes.

1125
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:45,722
And the vision has been for me
to have a brand-new church.

1126
00:59:45,884 --> 00:59:48,789
- Yes.
- So that l can come here on Sunday...

1127
00:59:49,154 --> 00:59:51,959
...and preach the word of God!

1128
00:59:56,261 --> 00:59:58,131
For instance, hit the lights.

1129
00:59:58,663 --> 00:59:59,998
Okay, here we go.

1130
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:02,202
Let me show you all
what I'm talking about.

1131
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:03,903
Look.

1132
01:00:04,302 --> 01:00:09,213
This is the church we are currently sitting
in right now, brothers and sisters.

1133
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:10,214
Look at it.

1134
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:12,812
I had some Mexicans
working on that "chimley."

1135
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:14,747
I got four of them at the Home Depot.

1136
01:00:14,913 --> 01:00:17,083
Jumped in the van
like they was gonna do it right.

1137
01:00:17,248 --> 01:00:19,920
They end up putting masking tape
all on top of the "chimley."

1138
01:00:20,085 --> 01:00:21,288
Help us, Lord.

1139
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:23,591
Show them my next church.
Look at that! Oh, Lord.

1140
01:00:25,824 --> 01:00:28,896
This is the kind of church make you
wanna come and praise the Lord.

1141
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,598
Make you wanna put something
in the plate.

1142
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:36,304
And if we ain't got a plate, just put
what you gonna give me in my hand.

1143
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:38,539
- Yes.
- This is my home.

1144
01:00:38,703 --> 01:00:40,973
Oh, have mercy.

1145
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:46,783
Many of you brothers and sisters didn't
know that l was living so humble, did you?

1146
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,116
l sleep up here.

1147
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:52,385
ln this room right here.

1148
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:54,788
Grandma, don't you see
what's going on?

1149
01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:56,623
This is my vision. Look at that.

1150
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:02,232
T.D. Jakes. Benjamin and Long.

1151
01:01:02,394 --> 01:01:03,797
Everybody's living like this.

1152
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:05,833
Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

1153
01:01:05,998 --> 01:01:07,500
Why come l can't have a Jacuzzi?

1154
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,170
Why come l can't eat shrimps and steak?

1155
01:01:10,336 --> 01:01:11,872
Lord, why come l can't have that?

1156
01:01:12,037 --> 01:01:14,441
- Did he ask you? No.
- Where he gonna get the money?

1157
01:01:19,378 --> 01:01:20,814
- He's not asking.
- That's not right.

1158
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:25,121
Those sisters who need help,
that want to pray privately with me...

1159
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:27,455
- Private.
- Tell it, pastor.

1160
01:01:27,621 --> 01:01:30,593
My ex-wife.

1161
01:01:30,756 --> 01:01:33,528
Goat-smelling ass,
buiIt like a sack of laundry.

1162
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,962
Fake Louis Vuitton purse.

1163
01:01:36,128 --> 01:01:38,265
She done let them Chinese
trick her nine times.

1164
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:41,302
- Oh, yes.
- This is the wife God want me to have.

1165
01:01:43,903 --> 01:01:47,744
Praise the Lord.
Does she have a twin sister? Ha.

1166
01:01:48,774 --> 01:01:49,809
Tramp.

1167
01:01:49,975 --> 01:01:53,248
Do you get the vision that I'm trying
to tell you, ladies and gentlemen?

1168
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:56,352
God works in mysterious ways.

1169
01:01:56,516 --> 01:02:00,156
God might not be there when you want him,
but he's always there when you want him!

1170
01:02:00,687 --> 01:02:01,722
Hm?

1171
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:04,692
We got a miracle in the house today.

1172
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,462
Kevin, please come up here.

1173
01:02:08,662 --> 01:02:12,336
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Kevin.
Kevin, come on. Put your hands together.

1174
01:02:12,499 --> 01:02:16,206
- l don't wanna go up there.
- Go up there and talk to the preacher.

1175
01:02:19,105 --> 01:02:20,507
That's my grandbaby.

1176
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:24,112
Yeah, baby.

1177
01:02:26,546 --> 01:02:27,882
Kevin! Kevin!

1178
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:30,584
Yo.

1179
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,252
- Yo, he's coming.
- Who's coming?

1180
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:33,587
- Jesus?
- No, not Jesus!

1181
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,792
Lorenzo, he's out of jail.
He was chasing me and he's coming.

1182
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:39,361
What you want me to do?
Just stand right there.

1183
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,462
- Hey. Thank you.
- You got a gun?

1184
01:02:41,629 --> 01:02:44,200
- Y'all ready for a miracle?
- Yeah.

1185
01:02:44,364 --> 01:02:45,567
That's right.

1186
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:48,204
Pastor is always talking about a miracle.

1187
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:54,580
l wanna let y'all know the biggest sinner
of our time is coming to get saved.

1188
01:02:54,742 --> 01:02:56,211
Y'all give it up for Lorenzo.

1189
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,152
Go, go!

1190
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:07,657
Who let that nigga out of jail?

1191
01:03:08,689 --> 01:03:10,359
Get off me.

1192
01:03:11,157 --> 01:03:13,295
Next person that touch me
about to get stabbed...

1193
01:03:13,461 --> 01:03:15,231
...l swear before God!

1194
01:03:21,569 --> 01:03:23,606
No, no, no!

1195
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:25,406
Damn!

1196
01:03:25,606 --> 01:03:29,012
Look, man, I'm sorry, all right?
l didn't mean to set you up, l promise.

1197
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:31,046
- You mean that Foot Locker thing?
- Yeah.

1198
01:03:31,212 --> 01:03:33,516
No, no, no, I'm over that, man.
I'm over that.

1199
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:36,486
- You and me, we got different business.
- Okay.

1200
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:42,524
I'm gonna need that lottery ticket now.

1201
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:46,662
If you don't back up off that boy
nice and slow...

1202
01:03:46,826 --> 01:03:49,298
...I'm gonna blow your head off quick.

1203
01:03:58,774 --> 01:04:00,309
You know what l think?

1204
01:04:03,144 --> 01:04:04,613
l think you a little bitch.

1205
01:04:05,814 --> 01:04:08,351
Ain't never shot nobody
in your whole life.

1206
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:19,462
Pull a piece on me, you better use it!

1207
01:04:28,336 --> 01:04:30,541
What's happening?
- Excuse me.

1208
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,344
Yo, come back here, man.

1209
01:04:40,915 --> 01:04:42,318
Right there, right there!

1210
01:04:44,018 --> 01:04:45,521
Come on, come on!

1211
01:04:47,222 --> 01:04:48,857
- Come on!
- Hey.

1212
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:52,695
Get out my way!

1213
01:04:54,796 --> 01:04:56,766
Get out the way, get out the way.
You okay?

1214
01:04:57,466 --> 01:04:59,069
Move! Move, move, move!

1215
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:04,341
- Excuse me.
Get him, get him!

1216
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:15,784
Shit!

1217
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:30,734
Oh, shit.

1218
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,973
Leave the little man alone!

1219
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:44,180
Hey.

1220
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,315
Fuck!

1221
01:05:56,692 --> 01:05:58,796
I'll see you when l see you.

1222
01:06:08,371 --> 01:06:12,212
Look, l don't see Lorenzo and his boys,
so it look like you safe to go home now.

1223
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,077
- Safe?
- Yeah.

1224
01:06:14,243 --> 01:06:16,146
You really think we safe? Huh?

1225
01:06:16,312 --> 01:06:20,853
Kevin, look. All you gotta do is
get through the next day and a half...

1226
01:06:21,016 --> 01:06:23,154
- ...and we good.
- And then what?

1227
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:24,988
Then you get your money.

1228
01:06:26,422 --> 01:06:28,759
Is this what having money feeIs like?

1229
01:06:28,925 --> 01:06:30,461
Everybody asking me for something?

1230
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:33,598
People I ain't talked to in years
calling my phone?

1231
01:06:33,896 --> 01:06:34,999
l don't want it, man.

1232
01:06:36,098 --> 01:06:37,667
l heard this quote once:

1233
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:41,341
"Money don't change you,
it changes the people around you."

1234
01:06:41,504 --> 01:06:42,539
You understand that?

1235
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:45,911
Come on, Kev. l heard this quote too.

1236
01:06:46,075 --> 01:06:48,446
We quoting now? We quoting now?

1237
01:06:48,611 --> 01:06:50,448
l got this quote:
"People gonna be people.

1238
01:06:50,613 --> 01:06:52,951
They gonna lie,
they gonna cheat and they gonna steal.

1239
01:06:53,115 --> 01:06:55,519
As long as you get yours,
you keep it moving."

1240
01:06:55,686 --> 01:06:59,894
- So let's go home.
- It's not that easy, Benny. It's not.

1241
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:09,267
- Kev, how about this?
- What?

1242
01:07:09,432 --> 01:07:11,369
Let me hold onto it for you.

1243
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:13,904
Let you hold onto what?

1244
01:07:14,237 --> 01:07:15,707
The ticket.

1245
01:07:16,072 --> 01:07:20,848
That case, if Lorenzo catches you,
you won't get jacked.

1246
01:07:24,581 --> 01:07:26,418
You too?

1247
01:07:27,216 --> 01:07:30,823
After what l just said to you?
And you hit me with this bullshit?

1248
01:07:30,988 --> 01:07:33,760
- It ain't like that.
- What you mean, "It ain't like that"?

1249
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,927
- It is like that. It is!
- It ain't like that.

1250
01:07:36,092 --> 01:07:38,062
- You losing it, man.
- You got the wrong one.

1251
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:39,563
- You serious?
- Dead-ass serious.

1252
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:40,765
Come on, Kev.

1253
01:07:41,632 --> 01:07:44,237
- l been your best friend since fifth grade.
- Act like it.

1254
01:07:44,401 --> 01:07:45,636
- Fifth grade!
- Act like it!

1255
01:07:46,036 --> 01:07:48,674
Ain't no way I'll let this money
compromise our friendship.

1256
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:49,874
Okay.

1257
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:52,145
You can have it.
You can have this shit, Kev.

1258
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:53,611
You can have the whole thing.

1259
01:07:53,777 --> 01:07:55,280
l don't want it!

1260
01:07:55,445 --> 01:07:57,248
- l don't want none of this!
- What you got?

1261
01:07:57,414 --> 01:08:02,457
I'm up here losing my damn mind,
running up and down the streets for us!

1262
01:08:02,619 --> 01:08:05,624
- Ain't no "us" shit! Ain't no us, nigga!
- It is us, Kev! It is us!

1263
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:07,559
- It's everybody!
- What you talking about?

1264
01:08:07,724 --> 01:08:09,360
You ain't in my shoes,
you don't know.

1265
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:11,429
- Look at this, look at us.
I'm not looking.

1266
01:08:11,595 --> 01:08:15,502
Look at our circumstances, man.
Look where we from!

1267
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:17,668
I'm tired of this, man.

1268
01:08:18,402 --> 01:08:20,305
I'm sick of worrying about WIC cards!

1269
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:22,708
I'm sick of worrying
about the government

1270
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,110
l can't eat!

1271
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:27,178
I'm broke, nigga! I'm broke!

1272
01:08:27,344 --> 01:08:29,281
And you got the power
to change that, Kev.

1273
01:08:29,446 --> 01:08:31,617
Nobody else. You.

1274
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,654
Kevin, if l had the money...

1275
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:35,854
"lf."

1276
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,090
...not only would l give back...

1277
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,726
...l would change lives.

1278
01:08:41,559 --> 01:08:47,303
The sad thing is, you known me
for this long and you still don't get it.

1279
01:08:49,299 --> 01:08:51,269
Bust a move, homey.

1280
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,060
You want me to be honest?

1281
01:09:14,225 --> 01:09:15,961
That's why I'm here, right?

1282
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:19,266
Look, you know l can't even stand
Benny haIf the time...

1283
01:09:19,464 --> 01:09:22,203
...but he is not a thief, and you know it.

1284
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,337
If anything, that boy is too loyal to you.

1285
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:29,511
You probably hurt his feelings, and
I personally think you acted like an ass.

1286
01:09:29,674 --> 01:09:31,677
- And you need to tell him you're sorry.
- What?

1287
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:32,979
That's the truth.

1288
01:09:33,145 --> 01:09:34,915
Central Bank on Wednesday...

1289
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:38,452
What? You said you wanted me
to be honest, right?

1290
01:09:42,755 --> 01:09:44,758
Stacie.
- What's up?

1291
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:48,028
If you won the lottery,
what would you do?

1292
01:09:48,526 --> 01:09:49,996
Me?

1293
01:09:50,495 --> 01:09:51,731
I mean, you know...

1294
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:55,336
...take care of my family, travel...

1295
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,303
...finish school, all that good stuff.

1296
01:09:57,502 --> 01:10:00,374
But if l had your kind of money,
I'd give back.

1297
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:03,811
Give people something to live for
instead of just living, you know?

1298
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:10,286
Like, look at how some of these rappers
always talk about, "Shout out to my 'hood."

1299
01:10:10,449 --> 01:10:13,788
But what are they giving back
other than just shoutouts?

1300
01:10:13,952 --> 01:10:15,488
Thank you.

1301
01:10:17,156 --> 01:10:18,993
It's cool, it's just a grilled cheese.

1302
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:21,830
No, no. Not for the sandwich.

1303
01:10:22,628 --> 01:10:25,467
Just thanks for being there for me.

1304
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:32,673
l mean that.

1305
01:10:36,308 --> 01:10:37,877
It's cool.

1306
01:10:38,644 --> 01:10:40,046
l got you.

1307
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:42,582
l appreciate it.

1308
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:46,854
- But now l need you to tell me something.
- What's up?

1309
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,324
What happened on your little date
with Nikki Swayze?

1310
01:10:49,488 --> 01:10:52,060
Say "I told you so."
All she wanted to be was my baby mama.

1311
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:53,527
What?

1312
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:56,631
Nikki, the no-class, gold-digging bitch.

1313
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:58,498
I'm shocked.

1314
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:01,668
l mean, but at least
you got what you wanted:

1315
01:11:01,835 --> 01:11:03,537
To tell all your boys you hit that.

1316
01:11:03,702 --> 01:11:05,572
Because l didn't.

1317
01:11:05,738 --> 01:11:08,210
God on my mama,
I ain't touched that girl.

1318
01:11:09,976 --> 01:11:11,946
I'm kind of glad I didn't too.

1319
01:11:12,112 --> 01:11:13,180
What do I look like?

1320
01:11:13,345 --> 01:11:16,584
Swapping swords
with haIf of the Fortune 500.

1321
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,620
I'm straight.

1322
01:11:19,085 --> 01:11:20,387
And besides...

1323
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,892
...that's not the kind of girl
l need anyway.

1324
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,831
Oh, really? Who is the kind
of girl you need, then?

1325
01:11:30,497 --> 01:11:32,233
Can l be honest?

1326
01:11:32,397 --> 01:11:34,635
Ain't that why you came here?

1327
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,210
The kind of girl l need is you.

1328
01:11:48,748 --> 01:11:50,852
Goodbye, Kevin. Goodbye.

1329
01:11:51,017 --> 01:11:52,253
What, you gonna kick me out?

1330
01:11:52,418 --> 01:11:55,190
You know what? I'm not interested
in being your second choice.

1331
01:11:55,355 --> 01:11:57,024
How long have we known each other?

1332
01:11:57,191 --> 01:11:59,127
Why did it take you so long
to tell me this?

1333
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:02,064
After you and Nikki,
all of a sudden you wanna be with me?

1334
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:04,833
Why'd it take you so long?
I'm not that girl, okay?

1335
01:12:04,998 --> 01:12:06,534
Don't get it...

1336
01:12:09,736 --> 01:12:11,372
... twisted.

1337
01:12:33,526 --> 01:12:34,694
- Hold on, hold on.
- What?

1338
01:12:34,862 --> 01:12:35,897
- Wait, hold on.
- What?

1339
01:12:36,063 --> 01:12:37,165
Wait.

1340
01:12:39,266 --> 01:12:42,138
Tst. Damn, girl, how many dudes
you done had up in your bed?

1341
01:12:42,303 --> 01:12:44,340
What? Don't try to play me.

1342
01:12:44,571 --> 01:12:47,911
If you think we're doing this
without a condom, you're tripping.

1343
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:49,911
What?

1344
01:12:51,411 --> 01:12:52,847
Nothing.

1345
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:01,122
Stacie!

1346
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:03,458
- Oh, shit, it's my mama!
- Your mama?

1347
01:13:03,624 --> 01:13:05,761
You gotta go.
- Damn, your mama?

1348
01:13:06,493 --> 01:13:07,928
- What?
Come on.

1349
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,299
- You gotta - Get out! No!
- What? Let me go.

1350
01:13:10,464 --> 01:13:11,933
- Out where?
- Get out.

1351
01:13:12,099 --> 01:13:13,936
Out the window?
- Sorry. Yes.

1352
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:16,506
- Careful.
Goddamn.

1353
01:13:21,176 --> 01:13:22,244
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1354
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:24,246
Please be careful. Okay.

1355
01:13:24,411 --> 01:13:25,746
- What?
- l love you.

1356
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:28,117
l love you too.

1357
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:30,720
Now go. Get down.

1358
01:14:13,795 --> 01:14:15,497
Where am l?

1359
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:17,967
Morning.

1360
01:14:21,536 --> 01:14:23,539
Now, relax now, son, relax.

1361
01:14:23,705 --> 01:14:26,577
Don't worry about nothing,
you just got knocked the fuck out.

1362
01:14:28,944 --> 01:14:33,085
Put these black-eyed peas on your jaw.
Take down the swelling.

1363
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:42,159
What you talking about?
Man, are you crazy?

1364
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:45,161
Ain't nobody knock me out.

1365
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,137
Hold on.

1366
01:14:57,906 --> 01:14:59,209
Wait a minute.

1367
01:14:59,774 --> 01:15:00,942
Where's my ticket?

1368
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:04,916
l don't know. They probably stole it.

1369
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:07,485
That's why you was knocked out.

1370
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:09,085
- Yeah.
- Damn!

1371
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:11,154
Yeah, that about sums it up.

1372
01:15:14,457 --> 01:15:16,027
Wait a minute.

1373
01:15:16,591 --> 01:15:19,798
How do l know you didn't knock me out
yourseIf and stole my ticket?

1374
01:15:20,363 --> 01:15:24,872
The fact of the matter is Lorenzo
and his boys was out there walking.

1375
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:27,438
l heard them talking and laughing.

1376
01:15:27,602 --> 01:15:30,976
l get up,
l look and see you stretched out.

1377
01:15:31,741 --> 01:15:33,543
Now, it wasn't easy...

1378
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:37,549
...but l pick you up and l tote you in here
and put you on that couch.

1379
01:15:38,114 --> 01:15:39,449
And you talk to me like that?

1380
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:44,123
l ain't been out this apartment
in 22 years and l did it for you.

1381
01:15:46,589 --> 01:15:48,191
You did that?

1382
01:15:52,128 --> 01:15:55,300
What l wanna know is,
did you sign the back of the ticket?

1383
01:15:55,465 --> 01:15:57,000
Why would l sign the ticket?

1384
01:15:57,733 --> 01:16:01,072
If you didn't sign the back of the ticket,
it's not valid.

1385
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:03,508
- The cops is not gonna believe you.
- No, no.

1386
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:05,074
Man, bump that!

1387
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:07,111
Look, he stole my ticket.

1388
01:16:07,277 --> 01:16:10,349
l should be able to go right back to him
and get it back, straight up!

1389
01:16:11,515 --> 01:16:13,685
Okay, tiger. Okay.

1390
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:19,460
But look, Lorenzo's a premature
crack-baby felon, okay?

1391
01:16:19,622 --> 01:16:20,924
You gotta be careful.

1392
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:22,660
What other choice do l have?

1393
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:25,964
Well, l been thinking.

1394
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:29,534
The same thing got you into this mess...

1395
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:32,770
- ...might just get you out.
- Man, I'm not trying to hear that.

1396
01:16:32,935 --> 01:16:34,071
- Wait, wait, wait
- What?

1397
01:16:34,237 --> 01:16:36,341
- Where you going?
- I'm out, man.

1398
01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:40,043
Hold up.

1399
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:41,845
You took my sneakers?

1400
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:44,415
l was thinking about it.

1401
01:16:44,581 --> 01:16:47,019
But they wasn't on your feet
when l dragged you in here.

1402
01:16:47,818 --> 01:16:49,988
You wouldn't have did nothing.

1403
01:16:50,987 --> 01:16:52,422
Protect yourseIf at all times.

1404
01:16:52,589 --> 01:16:54,259
Whatever!

1405
01:16:56,460 --> 01:17:00,568
Protect yourseIf at all times.

1406
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:03,034
Don't do this with this boy.

1407
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,435
I'm too old for this.

1408
01:17:05,202 --> 01:17:08,441
Whoo! Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you, Jesus!

1409
01:17:08,606 --> 01:17:11,545
Thank you, Jesus!

1410
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:14,312
Where the hell you been, boy?
l been worried sick about you.

1411
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:17,050
Nobody know where you is, you didn't call.
What happened?

1412
01:17:17,214 --> 01:17:18,316
And where are your shoes?

1413
01:17:18,483 --> 01:17:20,653
- l got robbed!
- What?

1414
01:17:20,817 --> 01:17:22,352
Lorenzo took everything, all right?

1415
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,657
Look, he took my ticket,
he took my shoes...

1416
01:17:24,821 --> 01:17:26,925
No, I'm calling the police.

1417
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,526
Chill out. Don't do that.

1418
01:17:28,692 --> 01:17:31,229
What they gonna do?
l didn't sign the back of the ticket.

1419
01:17:31,395 --> 01:17:35,603
Boy, l told you. You'd given me that ticket,
I'd put it here, wouldn't nobody get to it.

1420
01:17:36,066 --> 01:17:38,738
Look, l got 24 hours to go claim
what's mine, all right?

1421
01:17:38,902 --> 01:17:41,106
And that's what I'm about to go do.

1422
01:17:41,272 --> 01:17:42,374
That's how it is.

1423
01:17:45,276 --> 01:17:47,480
Oh, hell, no. I'm calling somebody.

1424
01:17:50,314 --> 01:17:51,349
Stacie?

1425
01:17:51,516 --> 01:17:53,119
Watch it. Watch.

1426
01:17:53,284 --> 01:17:55,921
- Come on, come on. Bet back, bet back.
- What up, B?

1427
01:17:56,786 --> 01:17:58,456
Nothing.

1428
01:17:58,755 --> 01:18:01,293
Chilling with my real friends.
What's up with you?

1429
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:04,198
That ain't no dirty dice.
That's my money on the ground, fool.

1430
01:18:04,694 --> 01:18:06,899
Let me holler at you real quick, man.

1431
01:18:07,231 --> 01:18:09,936
Your drawers is dirty, not my dice.

1432
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:11,636
Come on, man.

1433
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:14,873
What's up, Kev?

1434
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,541
Look, man.

1435
01:18:16,874 --> 01:18:19,478
I'm sorry about what happened
on the roof the other day.

1436
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:21,981
l mean that, man.

1437
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:28,523
Look, Kev, l know my approach to life
might be a little off...

1438
01:18:30,388 --> 01:18:32,659
...but just know my intentions are good.

1439
01:18:38,329 --> 01:18:40,266
- We boys?
- We boys.

1440
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:41,801
All day.

1441
01:18:46,037 --> 01:18:49,143
Kevin, you got that Bobby Brown look
in your eyes, man. What you doing?

1442
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:52,079
Where the hell you been, man?
You harder to find than a job.

1443
01:18:52,243 --> 01:18:55,182
Man, like you would know.
You ain't had a job since Thriller.

1444
01:18:55,347 --> 01:18:56,816
- Where Lorenzo at?
What?

1445
01:18:56,981 --> 01:18:58,083
Lorenzo Mack?

1446
01:18:58,249 --> 01:19:02,190
l saw him yesterday when he was
racing you up and down the street.

1447
01:19:03,622 --> 01:19:07,229
Man, listen. When y'all see Lorenzo,
Iet him know I'm looking for his ass.

1448
01:19:07,392 --> 01:19:08,961
- Tell him that.
Don't say nothing.

1449
01:19:09,126 --> 01:19:10,162
Kevin...

1450
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:13,301
- Wait - Is he looking for?
- He wants to find Lorenzo?

1451
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:15,468
You seen Lorenzo?

1452
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:16,836
Calm down.
- Shut up, man.

1453
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:19,573
- Little girl, you seen Lorenzo?
My friend's crazy.

1454
01:19:19,738 --> 01:19:20,773
- This is crazy.
- Move!

1455
01:19:20,938 --> 01:19:22,174
He's not out here.

1456
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,046
- Kev, look, he's bigger than you.
- Y'all seen Lorenzo?

1457
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,546
- Don't mind him.
Hey, where you at?

1458
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,849
Man, bring your ass outside!

1459
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,887
Talking all that shit! Where you at now?

1460
01:19:33,085 --> 01:19:34,487
- Kevin, just calm down.
- Shut up!

1461
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,593
Right there.
- Don't get your ass kicked.

1462
01:19:40,959 --> 01:19:42,461
l got your ass now!

1463
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:45,632
- Boy, what the hell's wrong with you?
- All right.

1464
01:19:45,831 --> 01:19:48,635
You think because you got money,
you can just knock people down?

1465
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,070
You want ice cream?
Get in line like everybody else.

1466
01:19:51,236 --> 01:19:54,041
- l don't want no damn ice cream!
It's good. Look, good as new.

1467
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,611
- What's wrong with you? Get off me!
Kevin!

1468
01:19:56,776 --> 01:19:57,978
Damn.

1469
01:19:58,745 --> 01:19:59,746
Hey.

1470
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:03,551
Just the man l wanted to see.
Kevin, take a ride with me.

1471
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,485
Few things l wanna talk over.

1472
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,990
- It's all right if l don't?
- No, not really.

1473
01:20:10,155 --> 01:20:11,257
Get in the car.

1474
01:20:11,424 --> 01:20:13,728
- Okay, Kevin, I'm coming with you.
- Come on.

1475
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,495
Stay right there.

1476
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:23,439
First of all, let me apologize for that
incident outside the church the other day.

1477
01:20:23,636 --> 01:20:26,641
l mean, that was entirely my fault.

1478
01:20:26,806 --> 01:20:28,676
l should've never let you out of my sight.

1479
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,276
From now on...

1480
01:20:30,677 --> 01:20:31,879
...wherever you go...

1481
01:20:32,345 --> 01:20:33,780
...l go.

1482
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,182
Speaking of the church...

1483
01:20:36,783 --> 01:20:39,989
...is Jimmy the Driver gonna be all right?
Is he gonna pull through?

1484
01:20:40,153 --> 01:20:41,655
- He'll live.
- Okay.

1485
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:44,126
He won't be on solid food for a while...

1486
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:47,329
...and he probably will never
father children...

1487
01:20:47,493 --> 01:20:49,196
...but, hey, what can you do?

1488
01:20:52,532 --> 01:20:54,302
Ahem. Sweet Tee...

1489
01:20:54,701 --> 01:20:57,706
...how would you feel
if somebody owed you money

1490
01:20:58,171 --> 01:20:59,439
Not me.

1491
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:02,643
and they couldn't pay you back?

1492
01:21:02,909 --> 01:21:04,745
Off the top of my head?

1493
01:21:06,212 --> 01:21:07,848
I'd probably, uh...

1494
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:11,120
...saw his legs off at the kneecaps...

1495
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:13,321
...and then grind them
into hamburger meat.

1496
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:17,160
And then I'd feed them to
my two 100-pound bullmastiffs.

1497
01:21:17,323 --> 01:21:20,797
Then l would force that guy
to watch them eat it.

1498
01:21:24,497 --> 01:21:28,238
That's pretty gnarly shit, ain't it?
Yeah, that's dastardly, l know it.

1499
01:21:28,401 --> 01:21:31,140
l saw that in the Philippines,
that's what gave me the idea.

1500
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:37,583
Yeah, you ain't never heard a man scream
until you've heard him scream like that.

1501
01:21:37,845 --> 01:21:41,953
You've never heard a man throw up
the way I'm gonna throw up right now.

1502
01:21:42,115 --> 01:21:43,685
Not in my Bentley.

1503
01:21:43,851 --> 01:21:45,654
- Damn it, get out!
- All right.

1504
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:47,188
Close my door.

1505
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:50,156
Try to feel better.

1506
01:21:50,957 --> 01:21:53,395
I'll be around keeping my eye on you.
And remember...

1507
01:21:53,861 --> 01:21:56,933
...wherever you go, l go.

1508
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:00,167
Let's go.

1509
01:22:03,537 --> 01:22:05,140
- He's gonna kill me.
- He said that?

1510
01:22:05,305 --> 01:22:07,942
No, not exactly.
He said he was gonna cut my legs off...

1511
01:22:08,108 --> 01:22:09,743
...then feed them to the dogs.

1512
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:12,482
Don't pump it up. He said
he'd cut you off at the kneecaps.

1513
01:22:12,646 --> 01:22:15,485
Kevin, you have to give back
all his money.

1514
01:22:16,483 --> 01:22:18,153
It ain't that simple.

1515
01:22:18,619 --> 01:22:19,854
l spent it.

1516
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:22,190
- What?
- Yeah.

1517
01:22:22,356 --> 01:22:25,829
How did you spend $100,000
in one day?

1518
01:22:26,393 --> 01:22:27,929
It's not hard as you might think.

1519
01:22:28,095 --> 01:22:29,297
l got some earrings.

1520
01:22:29,463 --> 01:22:32,035
You're just gonna have to return
all that stuff you bought.

1521
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:34,036
The same way you got into this mess...

1522
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:36,973
...is the same way you're gonna
have to get yourseIf out of it.

1523
01:22:37,137 --> 01:22:38,672
What?

1524
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,845
Nothing. It's just that that's
the same thing Mr. Washington told me.

1525
01:22:42,009 --> 01:22:44,113
- Mr. Washington, the serial killer?
- Exactly.

1526
01:22:44,278 --> 01:22:46,650
Stop talking to him.
We're already in enough trouble.

1527
01:22:46,815 --> 01:22:49,787
Stop, all right?
Because he's not a serial killer.

1528
01:22:53,487 --> 01:22:55,057
Wait a minute.

1529
01:22:55,723 --> 01:22:57,626
It was Semaj.

1530
01:22:57,991 --> 01:22:59,694
- It was Semaj!
What about Semaj?

1531
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:02,298
No. That's why I'm in
this mess right now.

1532
01:23:02,464 --> 01:23:04,734
Because of him.
He told everybody about my ticket.

1533
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:07,236
I'm not following.
What does Semaj have to do with it?

1534
01:23:07,402 --> 01:23:08,937
Get up! We gotta leave, now.

1535
01:23:10,972 --> 01:23:13,911
Yo, man, if you're trying to do
what l think you gonna do...

1536
01:23:14,074 --> 01:23:15,811
...you must be out your damn mind.

1537
01:23:20,949 --> 01:23:23,254
So if the one he stole was fake...

1538
01:23:24,151 --> 01:23:27,358
...what was your whole nervous
breakdown about earlier today?

1539
01:23:28,723 --> 01:23:31,662
Running all over town,
cursing Lorenzo's name...

1540
01:23:32,059 --> 01:23:33,662
...knocking folks over...

1541
01:23:33,828 --> 01:23:36,200
...and ruining ice cream cones?

1542
01:23:40,168 --> 01:23:41,870
Had to make it look real, right?

1543
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:44,707
Even had you fooled.

1544
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,242
You.

1545
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:49,645
What?

1546
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:53,951
Slow down and tell me that
one more time.

1547
01:23:54,115 --> 01:23:55,918
He did what now?

1548
01:24:07,863 --> 01:24:09,833
Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby.

1549
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:13,638
Man, that is the aroma of the beef.
Y'all just hating.

1550
01:24:13,802 --> 01:24:15,437
Hell, no. I'm going vegetarian.

1551
01:24:15,604 --> 01:24:17,540
Did you make the potato salad too?

1552
01:24:17,706 --> 01:24:19,543
Kevin, you want something to drink?

1553
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,711
No, I'm all right. I'm cool.

1554
01:24:22,778 --> 01:24:25,683
Hey, this my mama recipe.
Y'all better back off.

1555
01:24:25,848 --> 01:24:27,751
You think you slick?

1556
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:30,822
You little bitch.
Think you gonna get over on me?

1557
01:24:33,489 --> 01:24:35,426
Oh, man. Oh, come on, Lorenzo.

1558
01:24:35,591 --> 01:24:37,394
You see how big this nigga look
right now?

1559
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,699
It's a family barbecue. Grab a plate,
get something to eat, all right?

1560
01:24:40,863 --> 01:24:44,135
We got potato salad, get you a piece
of chicken. Chill out, you know

1561
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:47,372
Oh, it's that type of party? Okay.
It's that type of party.

1562
01:24:50,472 --> 01:24:52,442
Come on, Kev, throw one on him.
What's up?

1563
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,878
First, I'm about to tell you
what's gonna go down.

1564
01:24:55,044 --> 01:24:58,418
First, I'm gonna beat your ass
till l get tired.

1565
01:24:58,581 --> 01:25:00,484
And l ain't never gonna get tired.

1566
01:25:00,983 --> 01:25:05,292
Then I'm gonna take that ticket,
the real ticket, and walk up out of here.

1567
01:25:05,454 --> 01:25:07,491
Look, I'm gonna tell you like this, man.

1568
01:25:07,656 --> 01:25:08,691
You want my ticket?

1569
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,696
You gonna have to take my ticket, dog.
Straight up.

1570
01:25:12,895 --> 01:25:15,033
Be a man. That's right. That's right, Kev.

1571
01:25:15,999 --> 01:25:18,303
You gonna have to back up, Lorenzo.

1572
01:25:18,467 --> 01:25:20,771
It ain't going down like that today.

1573
01:25:20,937 --> 01:25:24,610
You gonna have to back up, man,
before l bust a cap in your ass, man.

1574
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,344
Shoot me, "man."

1575
01:25:35,618 --> 01:25:37,188
Get over here.

1576
01:25:37,453 --> 01:25:38,488
Cognac, nigga?

1577
01:25:42,358 --> 01:25:43,928
Not the homeboy.

1578
01:25:44,526 --> 01:25:46,229
Kev, I'm gonna let you handle that.

1579
01:25:50,432 --> 01:25:51,968
Look out.

1580
01:25:53,703 --> 01:25:55,138
Oh, what now?

1581
01:25:56,372 --> 01:25:57,908
You know who l am?

1582
01:25:58,074 --> 01:26:00,412
- He don't know.
- Yeah, l know who you are.

1583
01:26:01,478 --> 01:26:03,481
Then you must know l don't play.

1584
01:26:04,047 --> 01:26:05,082
Now, this young man...

1585
01:26:05,247 --> 01:26:08,454
...happens to be my business partner
and a close personal friend of mine.

1586
01:26:08,618 --> 01:26:10,888
l think he's about tired of you
harassing him.

1587
01:26:11,054 --> 01:26:13,191
And frankly, so am l.

1588
01:26:13,723 --> 01:26:16,328
Look, l ain't got no beef with you.

1589
01:26:16,493 --> 01:26:18,028
This is between me and him.

1590
01:26:18,194 --> 01:26:19,429
But you do need to know...

1591
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:22,401
...that he's gonna get
his ass whupped today.

1592
01:26:22,866 --> 01:26:24,502
And I'm gonna leave with that ticket.

1593
01:26:25,169 --> 01:26:28,675
Now, you see, that's the problem
with young folk today.

1594
01:26:28,838 --> 01:26:30,675
Absolutely no courtesy.

1595
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:32,476
No respect!

1596
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:39,218
Damn! Took all day
to make that potato salad!

1597
01:26:39,382 --> 01:26:41,519
Now, y'all can keep on partying
or go home.

1598
01:26:41,685 --> 01:26:43,789
There ain't gonna be no fight here today.

1599
01:26:44,387 --> 01:26:46,057
That's it.

1600
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:48,260
Look at this punk ass.

1601
01:26:48,425 --> 01:26:51,264
And y'all said he was supposed to be
some kind of a tough guy.

1602
01:27:00,938 --> 01:27:03,943
You know what I'd do
with a bitch like you in my "cellie"?

1603
01:27:04,108 --> 01:27:06,111
Make you snuggle up with me at night.

1604
01:27:06,276 --> 01:27:09,048
And l squeeze your balls.

1605
01:27:09,213 --> 01:27:10,281
l squeeze.

1606
01:27:11,247 --> 01:27:13,017
And l squeeze!

1607
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,254
Oh, man!

1608
01:27:17,287 --> 01:27:20,994
Oh, hell, no. This nigga's some kind
of goddamn superthug.

1609
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:25,667
- Tee! Get up, Tee.
Go home, Lorenzo!

1610
01:27:27,565 --> 01:27:29,200
Now, where were we?

1611
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,035
Oh, snap.

1612
01:27:35,706 --> 01:27:38,878
Come on, Kev.
Yeah, man, hit him back!

1613
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:41,947
My grandmama hit harder than you.

1614
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:45,217
Get back.

1615
01:27:52,224 --> 01:27:54,361
- That's right, kid. Whup his ass.
- That's right.

1616
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:58,099
Come on, man. Come on.

1617
01:27:59,396 --> 01:28:00,598
Jesus, l can't

1618
01:28:00,765 --> 01:28:02,869
Stay down!
Just stay down.

1619
01:28:03,068 --> 01:28:04,537
l gotta give it to you.

1620
01:28:04,702 --> 01:28:06,105
You got a lot of heart.

1621
01:28:06,837 --> 01:28:08,540
But heart only gets you so far, son.

1622
01:28:09,107 --> 01:28:12,780
Don't give it to him, Kevin.
What say we do this old school?

1623
01:28:14,512 --> 01:28:15,982
Yo!

1624
01:28:17,215 --> 01:28:19,519
Pick a number between one and 10.

1625
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,257
Pick!

1626
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:28,327
Three.

1627
01:28:28,592 --> 01:28:32,499
All right. That's how many seconds you got
to hand it over before l start blasting.

1628
01:28:32,664 --> 01:28:35,368
- Come on.
- Counting down.

1629
01:28:35,533 --> 01:28:37,671
Three. Two.

1630
01:28:38,937 --> 01:28:40,339
All right.

1631
01:28:46,611 --> 01:28:49,583
Lorenzo, you should be ashamed!
- l was hoping I'd get to use this.

1632
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:02,930
You know what?
I'm gonna hold onto both of these.

1633
01:29:03,229 --> 01:29:04,764
Just in case...

1634
01:29:05,163 --> 01:29:07,066
...you got a little funny with the tickets.

1635
01:29:09,134 --> 01:29:12,841
Nice doing business with you.
Oh, before l forget...

1636
01:29:17,276 --> 01:29:18,611
Bitches didn't fit anyway.

1637
01:29:20,712 --> 01:29:22,482
Say, young blood.

1638
01:29:32,925 --> 01:29:33,960
You like that, huh?

1639
01:29:36,095 --> 01:29:37,832
That's good work.

1640
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:40,901
Somebody read him a bedtime story.

1641
01:29:41,733 --> 01:29:43,369
Mr. Washington?

1642
01:29:54,714 --> 01:29:56,450
You're the man, Mr. Washington.

1643
01:29:57,817 --> 01:29:59,486
Yeah, Mr. Washington!

1644
01:29:59,652 --> 01:30:02,423
He's a bad mother - Shut your mouth.

1645
01:30:04,056 --> 01:30:08,197
Didn't l tell you?
l hear everything. Everything.

1646
01:30:09,896 --> 01:30:13,269
Come on, out of here, Bobby Brown.
l know you got it.

1647
01:30:14,066 --> 01:30:16,838
Now, lookie here, boy.
Keep ahold of these things.

1648
01:30:17,003 --> 01:30:19,307
You put them in a safe place. You hear?

1649
01:30:19,472 --> 01:30:20,507
- All right?
- All right.

1650
01:30:20,673 --> 01:30:23,077
Safe place.
There's a lot of crazies around here.

1651
01:30:23,242 --> 01:30:24,277
All right.

1652
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:31,118
Still got it.

1653
01:30:31,285 --> 01:30:33,689
You let them know l still got it, right?
Let them know.

1654
01:30:33,853 --> 01:30:36,525
Any of you young punks
want your ass whupped, step on in.

1655
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:39,927
- They don't want none.
- No, they don't want none.

1656
01:30:40,092 --> 01:30:41,728
Let them know l still got it.

1657
01:30:49,735 --> 01:30:53,342
Damn. Mr. Washington's pretty cool
for a serial killer.

1658
01:30:53,506 --> 01:30:55,376
Baby. Kevin.

1659
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:57,845
- Unh. Stacie.
- Are you okay?

1660
01:30:58,011 --> 01:30:59,646
- Kev.
- Damn.

1661
01:30:59,812 --> 01:31:02,150
- Please sign the ticket.
- Yes.

1662
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:08,522
Well, here it go.

1663
01:31:09,689 --> 01:31:11,059
Yes, you heard right.

1664
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:13,963
He got the numbers from
a fortune cookie at the Hunan Grill.

1665
01:31:14,127 --> 01:31:16,064
So a month after graduating
high school...

1666
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:19,568
...Kevin Carson is the youngest winner
in the Mondo Millions lottery.

1667
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:21,468
Asked what he'd do with the money...

1668
01:31:21,635 --> 01:31:23,805
...he said he'd start
his own line of sneakers...

1669
01:31:23,971 --> 01:31:26,208
...and "Give a little something
to the Fillmore."

1670
01:31:27,007 --> 01:31:30,012
People not from here
may not understand.

1671
01:31:30,177 --> 01:31:33,149
This is a community.
This is our community.

1672
01:31:33,981 --> 01:31:35,350
As long as we stay together...

1673
01:31:35,515 --> 01:31:38,386
...no matter how many times
life knocks us down, we can't lose.

1674
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:42,025
See, that's why l wanna
make this park safe for all kids.

1675
01:31:42,189 --> 01:31:44,427
And to make sure
that it stays that way...

1676

the head of security:

1677
01:31:46,927 --> 01:31:49,231
Mr. Jerome "Thump" Washington.

1678
01:31:49,397 --> 01:31:50,599
Please, everybody.

1679
01:31:57,838 --> 01:32:01,345
Hey, look, any of you young punks

1680
01:32:06,214 --> 01:32:08,251
Oh, look. You wanna do the honors?

1681
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:11,688

1682
01:32:13,254 --> 01:32:14,289
There it is.

1683

It's okay, we can get it done.

1698
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,237
l don't see nothing in the Bible
about no helicopter.

1699
01:33:01,402 --> 01:33:03,840
So, wait, no, no, no. Listen.
You duck your head down.

We really have to go.

Time is money.

Let's fly, baby, fly.

1714
01:33:40,209 --> 01:33:41,477

I'm gonna see y'all Monday at work.

We don't get to ride?

1718
01:33:45,913 --> 01:33:47,383
- We love you.
It was my idea.

1719
01:33:47,549 --> 01:33:49,152
- Y'all hold it down.
It was my idea.

1720
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:51,422
All right, kid. Do your thing, man.

1721
01:33:51,587 --> 01:33:53,691

We got you. We got you.

01:34:04,699 --> 01:34:07,972
Lord Almighty, them helicopter lights
go off and on like that.

1723
01:34:08,437 --> 01:34:13,079
That's my good wig, man.
