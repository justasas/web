I HAVE TO BUY NEW SHOES

9
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,140
Hey, why don't you take a picture?

10
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,940
A picture?

11
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,940
OK...

12
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,350
Let's go over by the river.

13
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,350
Excuse me, Turn right over there
and down to the river.

14
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,520
River? What river?

15
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,590
The Seine?

16
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,230
Oh, I've heard of that.

17
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,100
You have, huh?

18
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,330
It's famous, right?

19
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,500
Paris, the Seine...

20
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,730
Yeah, it's big.

21
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,740
Here?

22
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,140
Yeah, yeah. Great.

23
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,350
This is great!

24
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,590
Yeah.

25
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,660
Let's take a picture.

26
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,390
That building's famous.

27
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,360
Notre Dame.

28
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,560
Uh-huh.

29
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,060
Get that in, too.

30
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,930
With you?

31
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,740
OK, pose...

32
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,170
Let me see.

33
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,840
I think I got it all...

34
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,840
Now we're here,
let's take a real picture.

35
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,850
With the camera you hold like this...

36
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,850
The Hasselblad?
Let's not get that out now.

37
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,050
It's OK. I'll get it.

38
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,050
What's gotten into you?

39
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,090
That's a great sky!

40
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,530
Sen, here it is!

41
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,530
It's OK, I'll get it.

42
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Let's see...

43
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,930
OK...

44
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,100
Drive!

45
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,070
Thanks for coming out, Sen!

46
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,070
Now it's time for brother and sister
to part ways! 'Bye!

47
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,150
Hey, wait! Suzume! Suzume!

48
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,420
Made it!

49
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,290
Great!

50
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,400
What is she up to?!

51
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,490
Damn it!

52
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,610
OK, I'll see you at 2, then.

53
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,110
I'm looking forward to it. See you.

54
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,110
Thanks.

55
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Are you ok?

56
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,630
I'm fine. I just tripped.

57
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,030
Japanese?

58
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,470
Yes. Hello.

59
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,470
Hello.

60
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,570
Look...

61
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,280
You're not hurt?

62
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
No, I just sort of went over.

63
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,220
I think I stepped on that.

64
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,590
It's my passport.

65
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,590
What?

66
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't look.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think I'd better.

68
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,340
It'll be OK.

69
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,340
I don't know about that.
You should check with the embassy.

70
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,580
The embassy?

71
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,580
Avenue Hoche, between Courcelles
and Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

72
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,950
I'd take you there,
but I'm in a hurry.

73
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,160
I'll write the address.

74
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,930
Do you live here?

75
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,700
Yes.

76
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,700
I've been here a while,
but I'm still not used to it.

77
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,510
There.

78
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,410
That's the address.

79
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,850
And...

80
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,780
...my card.

81
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,780
It's a free paper for Japanese.

82
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,220
You're the editor?

83
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,120
It's pretty small.

84
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,660
That's my number.

85
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Let me know what happens.

86
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,800
Or for any other problems.

87
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,070
Thank you.

88
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,070
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,540
Not at all.

90
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,540
You're in a hurry, right?

91
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,680
Excuse me!

92
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,980
You forgot this.

93
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Oh.

94
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,890
Wait...

95
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I think I have something...

96
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,210
Here.

97
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,510
Krazy Glue!

98
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,880
This should hold it.

99
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,880
For a while.

100
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Yeah.

101
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,550
Ms 'Teshigawara'?

102
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,550
Yes, but call me Aoi.
'Teshigawara' is hard to say.

103
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,490
I'm Sen Yagami. Call me Sen.

104
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,960
OK, 'Yagami' is easy.

105
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,000
Right.

106
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Is there anywhere here
you'd recommend?

107
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,570
Sorry?

108
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,570
Your favorite place in Paris.

109
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,910
Where would that be?

110
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,580
Oh...

111
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,850
Where?

112
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,320
It's nowhere special.

113
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,820
I see...

114
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Hang on...

115
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,230
That should do it.

116
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,860
Thank you.

117
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,870
Try it.

118
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,010
It fits!

119
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,010
I guess it should,
since it's my shoe.

120
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,780
Good luck with your work.

121
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,820
Right.

122
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,620
And with your passport.

123
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,620
I'll do my best.

124
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,950
My passport...

125
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,390
Next window, please.

126
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,090
Thanks.

127
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,390
Hello.

128
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,390
Chocolate eggs came in the 1 800s.

129
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,060
Before that...

130
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,060
...they were made at home...

131
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,540
...hand-painted.

132
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,540
First they were boiled very hard.

133
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,170
Or else...

134
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,170
...you take the egg...

135
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,380
...put a small hole in both ends...

136
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,180
...and blow hard.

137
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,460
Three eggs and you're red in the face.

138
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,130
Yes.

139
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,560
So...

140
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,400
...I'm not speaking too fast?

141
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,430
No, I understand.

142
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,870
May I take pictures?

143
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,870
Of course.

144
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,310
The Easter-egg hunt is a tradition.

145
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,540
Parents hide eggs outside...

146
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,320
...like gifts under a Christmas tree.

147
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,690
The children go and hunt for them.

148
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,290
I'd always take hours to find mine.

149
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,290
My father didn't want it to be easy.

150
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,360
I'd start crying...it was horrible.

151
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,970
But that's what got me into this work.

152
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,110
And here we are.

153
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,040
Want my picture?

154
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,280
Sure.

155
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Let's do it.

156
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,650
Ready.

157
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,820
Three, two...

158
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,550
Wait.

159
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,550
Three, two, one...

160
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,660
How about like this?

161
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,800
One more.

162
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,600
Great.

163
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Fantastic.

164
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,520
Thank you.

165
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,520
My pleasure.

166
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,690
Your phone.

167
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,500
Got it. Goodbye.

168
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Sayonara.

169
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,770
...leave a message after the tone.

170
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,270
Her message is all in French...

171
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Please leave a message.

172
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,210
Uh, it's Yagami.

173
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,720
The passport looks like it's OK.

174
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,890
I just thought I'd tell you.

175
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Where do you want to go please?
Just a moment please.

176
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,440
That note...

177
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Where is it?

178
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm sorry I don't know where to go.
Please let me out. Sorry.

179
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,330
This is Suzume.

180
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,870
Please leave a message after the tone.

181
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,870
Leave a message,
or you'll make me cry. 'Beep'.

182
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,010
Damn it, Suzume! You took the note
with the name of the hotel!

183
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Call me, will you?

184
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,930
What the hell do you think
you're doing, anyway?!

185
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,640
Hello?

186
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,770
Um...

187
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Yes?

188
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,010
Uh...

189
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,010
...we met earlier.

190
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Uh, yes...Aoi-san,
Aoi Teshigawara.

191
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,290
Is something wrong?

192
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,560
No, that was something else.

193
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,560
A mistake.

194
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,930
Let me explain.

195
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,930
My sister wanted to come to Paris,
and she dragged me here...

196
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,140
...then she dumped me
by the Seine.

197
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,310
So anyway...

198
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,310
...I'm here with her.
I mean, our relationship isn't...

199
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,010
...weird or anything...

200
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,120
Hey, hey, hey...

201
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,180
...calm down.

202
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,990
Yeah, OK.

203
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,620
You're with your sister...

204
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,460
Yes.

205
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,460
You got dragged here,
and got dumped by the Seine?

206
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Yeah, that's right.
Then I met you...

207
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
...and you tromped
all over my passport.

208
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
You called me, I believe...

209
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,610
Oh yeah, right. They can't
replace my passport right away...

210
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,510
...but they said
they'd give me a travel document.

211
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,650
They did?

212
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,390
Yeah. So I can...

213
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,390
...get back to Japan OK.
Thank you.

214
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Not at all. Thanks for calling.

215
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,530
Not at all.

216
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,230
Oh, is your shoe OK?

217
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,230
I'd forgotten.
It's fine, no problem at all.

218
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,810
That's good.

219
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,240
Enjoy your stay.

220
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,110
Thank you.

221
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,510
Oh, hello?

222
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,650
Yes?

223
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,650
My sister took the memo
with the name of our hotel.

224
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,990
Oh, dear.

225
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,990
I've completely forgotten
its name.

226
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,330
There was a reason
she chose it, though.

227
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,300
Yes?

228
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Hotels give you
a basket of fruit, right?

229
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,100
Yes, in your room.

230
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Well, this hotel puts out
pastries, not fruit.

231
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,340
They're popular in Paris,
'po' something.

232
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
'Po' something?

233
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,420
My sister said it evolved from
a choux cream puff.

234
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,690
'Popelini'?

235
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,690
Yeah...something like that,
I'm not sure.

236
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,230
That's probably it. A pâtissière
from Ladurée makes them.

237
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,640
'Ladurée'? I think
I've heard of that.

238
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,570
They make macaroni
or something like that, right?

239
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,610
'Macaroons', Mr Yagami.

240
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,150
Yes, that's what I meant.

241
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,290
I did an article on Popelini.

242
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,290
I'll call and ask who they supply.

243
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,490
The reservation's
in your sister's name?

244
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Yes. Her name's
Suzume Yagami.

245
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,100
'Sparrow'?

246
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
It's written with the characters
'bell' and 'love'.

247
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,640
OK. Wait there.
I'll call you back.

248
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,980
OK, thanks.

249
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,950
I found it.

250
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,280
You did?

251
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,280
'L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans'.

252
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,120
I called...

253
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,120
...and there's a reservation
under your sister's name.

254
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Great! Thanks a lot.

255
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,260
No problem.
It's near the Louvre Museum.

256
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,670
Where are you?

257
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,170
Right now I can see...

258
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,170
...the Arc de Triomphe.

259
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,770
You can probably walk from there.

260
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,440
I can?

261
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,450
Will you walk?

262
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,580
Sure, no problem.

263
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,120
I'll guide you.

264
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,090
No, I'll be fine.

265
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,090
It's no problem.
If you can see the Arc...

266
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,590
...are you on the street
the embassy's on?

267
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,330
Yes.

268
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,330
Then walk to
the Arc de Triomphe.

269
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
To the Arc...

270
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,540
Are you there?

271
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,540
I can't walk that fast.
I can't run that far, either.

272
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,580
I'm kidding. Just a bit of humor.

273
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,020
Right.

274
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,020
OK, I'm at the Arc de Triomphe.

275
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,590
There's a road that goes
right around it, isn't there.

276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,160
Yes, there is.

277
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,930
Go left there.

278
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,930
OK, I'm going left.

279
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Could you go to where
you're right in front of it?

280
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,510
Sure.

281
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
It's really something, isn't it.

282
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,990
Very powerful.

283
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,960
They really knew how to build
back then.

284
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I can see why
it's a big tourist draw.

285
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,660
Streets radiate out from it
in all directions.

286
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,340
From above they make
a star pattern.

287
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,740
That's Place de l'Étoile,
'the square of the star'.

288
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,380
'The square of the star'?
That's cool.

289
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,050
I'm almost in front of it now.

290
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,650
I'm there.

291
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,650
OK, then turn right...

292
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,720
No, I mean left.

293
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,360
Left?

294
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Now I'm facing back
the way I just came.

295
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,130
No, just turn 90 degrees.

296
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,070
90 degrees left.

297
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,700
Left...OK, I've turned left.

298
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,700
Can you see a big street
in front of you?

299
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,740
Yes, I can.

300
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,740
That's Avenue des Champs Élysées.

301
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,410
Oh...Champs Élysées.

302
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,020
Humor.

303
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,020
Right. OK, for now
go straight along that street.

304
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,730
Go straight.

305
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,730
It's a long street.

306
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,300
Yes, it's long.

307
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Shall I be your tour guide?

308
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,040
Sorry?

309
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,040
The avenue is said to be
the world's most beautiful street.

310
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
The main Louis Vuitton store...

311
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,310
...is a famous landmark.

312
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,750
People take pictures there,
and some even pray to it.

313
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,060
They do?

314
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,730
You should be coming to
the end of the avenue.

315
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,970
Yeah, I'm coming to a kind of
square or something.

316
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,040
OK, that's Place de la Concorde.

317
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Sorry, Aoi-san,
but could I take a break?

318
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Sure, go ahead.

319
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,150
Hello?

320
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,220
Yes?

321
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,220
The tour's fun, but why don't you
tell me something about yourself?

322
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,200
About me?

323
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah.

324
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
A guided tour of Aoi-san.

325
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,040
That wouldn't be much fun.
There's nothing to tell.

326
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,110
But you, Sen-san...

327
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,580
I almost called you 'Masao'.

328
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,850
Sorry.

329
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,320
That's OK.

330
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
My Mom loves Masao Sen's singing.

331
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,960
That's eccentric.

332
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Her tastes aren't all that elevated.

333
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,740
Now take your next right.

334
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,570
Right, OK.

335
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,570
Do you see a gold statue?
That's Joan of Arc.

336
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,380
A gold statue. Got it.

337
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Your hotel's on the left.
L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

338
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,620
OK, I'm walking along
some sort of gallery.

339
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,090
I just go straight?
I'm facing the statue.

340
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,700
That's right.

341
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,700
Left of the statue...

342
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Yep, there it is.
There's the hotel.

343
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,840
Thank you for taking
so much time.

344
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,610
Not at all.

345
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,050
Well, then...

346
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,050
Stay on the line as you go in.

347
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,120
Turn around.

348
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,190
Where?

349
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,190
I'm not there yet?

350
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,030
You came here?

351
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,940
I was close by.

352
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,940
Thank you.

353
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Oh, you've got luggage!
I'm sorry I made you walk.

354
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,810
It was good exercise.

355
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,810
That's the front desk?

356
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,980
I'll go check in, then.

357
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,820
Excuse me, I have a reservation.
Can I check in?

358
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,590
Hello, welcome to Regina Hotel.
What is your name, please?

359
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,030
Suzume Yagami.

360
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,030
Mr Suzume. Yes I've got your reservation, I need
to use your credit card. Thank you very much.

361
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,240
If it's all right with you...

362
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,680
...and if you're finished work...

363
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,680
...could I buy you dinner?

364
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,720
I don't know any restaurants,
and you could show me one.

365
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,360
Are you hungry?

366
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,060
I haven't eaten since lunch.

367
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Oh, dear!

368
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,510
Woof!

369
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,020
Guess who's here.

370
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,550
I was lonely.

371
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,490
Kango!

372
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,630
Welcome.

373
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,630
Cheers.

374
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,470
Welcome to Paris.

375
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,680
Thanks for the help.

376
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,680
So you're a photographer?

377
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,810
Sort of.

378
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,820
My paper's kind of dull.

379
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,690
Would you like to see it?

380
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,890
Sure. How dull can it be?

381
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,890
Nothing.

382
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,560
You can have that.
There's lots of places in it.

383
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,930
Right, it's in Japanese...

384
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,040
I wrote that one.

385
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,540
Cool.

386
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,540
I did an interview
after I met you.

387
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,950
An interview about what?

388
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,650
A restaurant?

389
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,150
Eggs.

390
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,420
Eggs?

391
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,150
Easter eggs. The painted ones.

392
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,150
Oh, those.

393
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,730
I took pictures.

394
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,730
Want to see?

395
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,340
They're beautiful.

396
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,810
So you write and take pictures?

397
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,810
Yes. I can't afford a photographer.

398
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,010
I see.

399
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,280
I'd like to see your stuff.

400
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,890
Sure.

401
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,890
Just a minute...

402
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,890
Push on the right side.

403
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,810
She's cute.

404
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,810
That's my sister.
I hate how she poses.

405
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,580
Is that what they call a 'gotcha-face'?

406
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,950
Not quite.

407
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I guess living here
it's hard to keep up with new slang.

408
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,390
You're right.
I feel like Rip van Winkle.

409
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Your sister's pretty.

410
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,360
I wonder what she's up to.

411
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,870
You can sit down.

412
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,710
OK.

413
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,710
That's my latest.

414
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,650
Why are they naked?

415
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,650
Not telling.

416
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,350
Paris is 1 0,000 kilometers
from Japan.

417
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,860
Yeah?

418
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,060
Yeah.

419
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,060
It's 1 2 hours by plane.

420
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,300
And 1 1 whole days by ship.

421
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,870
Why are you laughing?
I looked this up, so listen!

422
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,210
OK.

423
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,210
1 0,000km...

424
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,250
5,000...

425
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,350
5,000 already?

426
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,350
OK...

427
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,620
...500 meters.

428
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,360
You're getting closer...

429
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,360
OK...

430
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,340
...40 centimeters.

431
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,340
40cm...

432
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,280
4cm...

433
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,350
4cm?

434
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,350
My turn...

435
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,250
Fooled ya!

436
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,650
You're no fun!
I'm not playing with you any more.

437
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,660
Stop sulking.

438
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
Sorry.

439
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm glad you're here.

440
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,500
It was a long trip.

441
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,510
You've got to watch your step here.

442
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,780
Let's keep going!

443
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,950
Just kidding.

444
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,050
I could drink a bit more.

445
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,290
Then come with me,
if you like.

446
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,400
I treat.

447
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I will treat. I have treated before.

448
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,300
I'm forgetting Japanese.

449
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,310
Are you drunk?

450
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,540
Who, me?

451
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,780
Paris! What a place!

452
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Here?

453
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,900
Here we go again.

454
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,900
Cheers.

455
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,110
That's good.

456
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,040
Really?

457
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,340
Try it.

458
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,510
May I?

459
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,510
OK.

460
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,850
That is good.

461
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,850
Have some more.

462
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,860
Want to trade?

463
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,860
It's good, but it's too strong.

464
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,830
Tell me more about your sister.

465
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,740
You're interested in her?

466
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,740
I'm jealous that she's crazy enough
to take off like that.

467
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,840
She has the name for it.

468
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,850
If only I had a name like...

469
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,480
...'sparrow'.

470
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,820
But why did she have to bring you
to Paris and then leave you?

471
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,760
Why not just come herself?

472
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,700
I don't like talking about it...

473
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,400
Forget it, then.

474
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,400
But maybe I will.

475
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,110
Which is it?

476
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,110
She forced me to bring her.

477
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,850
You paid?

478
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,850
She's got a job.
I made her at least pay half.

479
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,690
Why did she bring you?

480
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,620
For good luck.

481
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,590
Good luck?

482
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,590
I always have to be there
when it's important.

483
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,360
University entrance exams,
job interviews, field days...

484
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,930
Or when her pet hamster
had surgery.

485
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,540
If I'm there, things go well.

486
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,540
And you're delighted to be there...

487
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,210
No, I'm not.

488
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,050
Sorry. It's just that she's so pretty.

489
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,220
There's more to it than that.

490
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,220
It started when she was born.

491
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,090
Her birth day...when she was born.
This is getting interesting.

492
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,790
It's not that special.

493
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,630
When Mom had Suzume...

494
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,630
...she needed a Cesarian.
It was touch and go.

495
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Her water had broken
long before her due date...

496
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,240
...so it was an emergency delivery.

497
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,240
It looked like things
weren't going to work out.

498
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,750
My father rushed to the hospital,
and I went to my grandmother's.

499
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,020
That's when we knew it was a girl.
Mom said the baby was calling me.

500
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Mom said to bring me from Grandma's
because the baby inside her wanted me.

501
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,070
So I was brought to the hospital
while my mother was in labor.

502
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I sat out in this kind of corridor
and waited for seven whole hours.

503
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,350
I see.

504
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,350
In the end, my sister was fine.

505
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,050
That's great.

506
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,050
So we've heard this story
over and over again...

507
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,390
Oh, thanks.

508
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,390
The story of Suzume and me.

509
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,130
We've been ground into each other.

510
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
So whenever she has something,
I have to be there.

511
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,400
Now she doesn't even tell me why.

512
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm just summoned to be there.

513
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,510
Which means she has
something important in Paris.

514
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,250
Probably.

515
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,180
What could that be, I wonder.

516
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,190
Yeah!

517
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,420
The luck brother.

518
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,090
What?

519
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,090
The brother who brings
good luck.

520
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,100
Me?

521
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,630
Yeah, it's amazing. I'm like a shrine
she visits for every big step.

522
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,100
Safe birth...

523
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,100
...success at school, a job...

524
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,580
...and love. I wonder if that's
what this is all about.

525
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,880
I feel like I'd like to pray.

526
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,790
What?

527
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,790
Would you mind?

528
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Aoi-san!

529
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,800
Aoi-san! Hey!

530
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,530
Am I drunk?

531
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,670
Did you finish this already?!

532
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,040
And this?!

533
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Time out.

534
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,280
Aoi-san?

535
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,280
I'm a bit drunk. Sorry.

536
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,750
Hey, hey, hey!

537
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,120
Don't sleep here. It's dangerous!

538
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,190
Sit up.

539
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,160
You're going again!

540
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,160
Hey! Hey! Try to focus.

541
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,030
OK, I'll carry you.

542
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,340
Climb on.

543
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,340
OK?

544
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,880
We can get a taxi over there.

545
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Right.

546
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,220
I know what you're thinking.

547
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,260
'How did I end up in a strange place
carrying a woman I don't even know?'

548
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,960
I'm not thinking that.

549
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,770
OK, then what am I thinking?

550
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:56,310
I don't know.

551
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,940
I'm thinking a person's back
is so nice and warm.

552
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,990
Sorry. I'm OK now.

553
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,990
You are? You can stand up, right?

554
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Oh, this is terrible!

555
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I'm sorry!

556
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Are you all right?

557
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,880
Yes.

558
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,880
I'm OK...for the most part.

559
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,750
Careful!

560
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,220
Careful! It's a red light!

561
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,330
Hey, look!
You can see the Eiffel Tower.

562
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Yeah. It's beautiful.

563
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,040
How do you like Paris?

564
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,440
It's awesome.

565
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,780
I want...

566
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,780
...to go back to Japan.

567
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,920
How's the Tokyo Tower?

568
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,830
Here's a taxi.

569
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,740
Aoi-san...

570
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,740
Where on Belleville?
Tell him your address?

571
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,640
Komazawa 5, Setagaya...

572
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,910
Aoi-san! This is Paris!

573
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,910
I'm kidding. Just a bit of humor.
Funny?

574
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,450
Yes. What's your address?

575
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,630
Careful! Careful!
Which one is it?

576
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,060
Here?

577
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,970
Watch it!

578
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,680
Here?

579
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I'm home!

580
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,250
Hello!

581
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,250
There's no one here.
I live alone.

582
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,950
But you said...

583
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,950
When I get home,
I say, 'I'm home!'

584
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,460
Are you sure you live here?

585
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,460
Why?

586
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,330
Which one's the key?
What if this isn't your house?

587
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,770
Great! Got it the first time.

588
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,880
You're home.

589
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,940
Welcome to my home.

590
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,950
No, no. I'm going.

591
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,250
Thank you very much.

592
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,250
Don't catch cold.
Make sure you go to bed.

593
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Good night.

594
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,060
I'm sorry, but what was the name
of my hotel again?

595
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,830
Hotel?

596
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,830
The name of the hotel
you guided me to.

597
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,170
L'hotel de...

598
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,010
Hotel le Meurice? Wow!
I'd love to stay there.

599
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,920
No, the hotel that I'm...

600
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Aoi-san?

601
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,960
Aoi-san, don't go to sleep there.

602
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,860
Excuse me...

603
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,440
OK, I'll never kiss you again!

604
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,440
But you know you will.

605
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,320
What?

606
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,320
I'm happy.

607
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,460
Huh?

608
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,730
Huh?

609
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,900
What happened last night?

610
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,210
I still have make-up on.
I did it again.

611
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,880
Huh?

612
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,860
Sorry, I got lost.
I didn't touch. Sen.

613
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,460
Oh, right!

614
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,700
'Sen-san'...

615
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,700
'Mr Yagami'...he brought me back.

616
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,550
'Sen', written with
the character for 'thousand'.

617
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,990
Excuse me...

618
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,990
Why...

619
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,690
...are you sleeping here?

620
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I see. You got me here,
but you couldn't get home yourself.

621
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,270
Were you asking me the name
of your hotel?

622
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Did I dream that?

623
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,880
It's L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

624
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,070
Close your eyes.

625
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,100
OK.

626
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,140
All right?

627
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,140
Hey...

628
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,780
What are you touching?

629
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,650
Huh?

630
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,090
Your cheek.

631
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,090
Wrong!

632
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,860
Again.

633
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,990
OK.

634
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,990
OK...

635
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,860
Here.

636
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,470
Wait...

637
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,540
I have no idea.

638
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,670
That's my heart.

639
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,010
How would I know that?

640
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,010
Ow!

641
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,310
Um...

642
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,450
Good morning.

643
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,320
Sorry. I crashed here.

644
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,820
That's OK.

645
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,820
Was I really drunk last night?

646
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,330
You don't remember?

647
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,300
Bits and pieces.

648
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,300
The restaurant, and the bar...

649
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,800
The Eiffel Tower, the taxi...

650
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,070
That's perfect.

651
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,910
Did I get out of line?

652
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,680
Not at all.

653
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,680
Good.

654
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:04,050
You're not all stiff
from sleeping in the bath?

655
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,950
I tried to find somewhere
I wouldn't be in the way.

656
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,130
Shall I do that?

657
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,030
I can do coffee.

658
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,030
OK.

659
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,370
It's hot.

660
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,240
May I?

661
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,100
Go ahead.

662
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,110
First...

663
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,710
...you pour just enough
to wet the top.

664
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,520
Let it swell up.

665
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,220
And then...

666
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,220
...pour it in gently
so it'll get drawn in.

667
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,730
These are good fresh beans.
They swell right up.

668
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,130
You're a pro?

669
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,240
I worked in a coffee shop.

670
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,970
A fancy one?

671
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,970
It's pretty well-known.
Tajimaya, in Shinjuku.

672
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,480
I've been there.
When I was a student.

673
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,620
About 20 years ago.

674
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,620
Yeah? Then maybe
I made your coffee...

675
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,360
...not.

676
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,360
I was just a kid.

677
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,730
That was humor.

678
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,730
Well, it's the truth.

679
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,700
How old are you?
As old as Tokyo Disneyland?

680
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,070
I was born the year it opened.

681
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,680
I'm Tokyo Disneyland's
slightly older sister.

682
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,580
'Slightly'?

683
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,720
Slightly.

684
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,060
Were you playing the piano?

685
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,160
Yes.

686
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,570
That's the one. I like that piece.

687
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,210
What is it?

688
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,210
Mozart's 'Minuet and Trio'.

689
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,780
So would you be a cat?

690
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,190
That's the piece of music
the world's cats like best.

691
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,560
Cat music?

692
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,200
For my cat...

693
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,200
...it meant 'food'.

694
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,670
Whenever I played it,
he'd come right home.

695
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,670
Morning or evening,
it didn't matter.

696
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,220
Then one day he didn't come home.

697
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,720
He never came back.

698
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,220
Three years ago, right around now.

699
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,390
At Easter.

700
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,730
Maybe he celebrated too much,
and went off somewhere.

701
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,340
So I play that piece a lot...

702
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,410
...hoping maybe he'll come back.

703
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,440
Sometimes they come back.

704
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,420
Did you ever have one?

705
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,980
A mongrel, when I was small.

706
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,550
Mine was a shorthair called Guru.

707
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,460
Ours was just called Tama.

708
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,220
'Tama'?

709
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,460
Like the 'Sazae-san' comic?

710
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,460
Probably.

711
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:27,010
'Sorry, but I got lost.

712
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,980
'I didn't touch.'

713
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,430
This is Suzume.

714
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,500
Please leave a message after the tone.

715
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,500
Leave a message,
or you'll make me cry.

716
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:51,830
'Beep!'

717
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Suzume, where are you?
Phone me, will you?

718
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,510
Ah, sorry.

719
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:01,510
Oh shit.

720
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,320
OK, I take it.

721
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,890
Thanks.

722
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,070
The two of you?

723
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,840
Look. I found this in Saint Pierre.

724
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,840
It's pretty.

725
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:37,110
This is my friend Joanne.
She lives on the 3rd floor.

726
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,020
Her studio's in my basement.

727
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,150
Basement?

728
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,420
Down those steps.

729
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,420
Joanne's a dress designer.

730
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,690
This is Sen Yagami.

731
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,030
He's a friend.

732
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,040
Oh, you're friends...

733
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,910
Joanne. Nice to meet you.

734
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,910
Nice to meet you too. My name is Sen Yagami

735
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,980
Sen

736
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,760
Careful of the step.

737
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,100
Ok. Wow..what a nice place.
Where should I put this?

738
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,830
Over here.
Ok.

739
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,340
Thank you.

740
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,970
Can I look around?

741
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,980
Yes, please.

742
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,120
They are very beautiful.

743
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,950
Really?

744
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,950
Look here. This dress is from 1 925.
And this one is from 1 950.

745
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,900
Sounds great. Can I take pictures?

746
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,700
Aoi!

747
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,100
Can you help me when you're done?

748
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,110
Coming.

749
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,650
Showtime!

750
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,650
Showtime?

751
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,600
Like it?

752
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,600
Great! It's beautiful material.

753
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,110
Put it on, would you?

754
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,350
Sometimes I have her
put on the dresses for me.

755
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,260
For the hem and the line so I can see it.

756
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,400
I'm thinking bacon and spinach.

757
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,570
Fine.

758
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,570
Sen, I made a bunch of dishes
and Aoi is making the kische.

759
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:54,410
So it is going to be perfect.
Because it is Easter weekend.

760
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,920
So my daughter is bringing
my grandchildren this afternoon.

761
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,290
Oh really?

762
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,760
Can you give me a hand, Joanne?

763
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,770
Sen, would you like to come to the party
with us?

764
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Can I?

765
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,400
Oh, no no. He has a plan I think.

766
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,570
Oh no no, can I join you?

767
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,540
Really?

768
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,680
Sure.

769
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,680
Of course.

770
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,690
Come over here.

771
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,430
Wow!

772
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,500
That's great.

773
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,540
No pictures!

774
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,550
This is just to see how it looks.
I'm just the dummy.

775
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,380
It suits you.

776
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,120
Don't take pictures.

777
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,120
I'll just pin it here.

778
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,100
You are a rare animal.

779
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,110
'A rare animal'?
A protected species?

780
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,750
It's the first time Aoi introduces me to a man.

781
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,360
She's been through a lot.

782
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,130
A lot?

783
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,130
it's the worst feeling in the world,
losing a child.

784
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,540
Sorry, lose a child?

785
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:02,910
Yes.

786
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,580
She had a child?

787
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,580
But you didn't know. You are her friend.

788
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,710
No, we just met.

789
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,950
I thought you were.

790
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,480
Pour it in...

791
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,490
Slowly...

792
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,190
I'll knead this.

793
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,840
More?

794
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,740
That looks good.

795
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,740
Wait...

796
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,860
One, two...

797
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,930
Got it!

798
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,930
Thanks.

799
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:50,550
Now what?

800
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,550
Here.

801
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,390
That's good.

802
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,100
Excuse me...

803
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,870
There. It's done.

804
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,480
Those are beautiful.

805
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,480
Oh...

806
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,490
...he left.

807
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,020
He left? He's gone?

808
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,830
Someone called him 20 minutes ago...

809
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,560
...and he ran out.

810
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,570
He ran out?

811
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Did he say anything?

812
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,640
No. Nothing.

813
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:02,380
I see.

814
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,780
OK?

815
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,820
We should go.

816
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,530
Sunset in Paris is romantic.

817
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,900
'Sunset in Paris is romantic.'

818
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,140
Suzume loves Kango.

819
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,510
'Suzume loves Kango.'

820
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,510
She cries when he's not there.

821
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:42,980
'She cries when he's not there.'

822
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,690
But Kango is forgetting Suzume.

823
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:51,560
What do you mean?

824
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,560
'Kango is forgetting Suzume.'
Say that in French.

825
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,400
No.

826
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,400
The translation machine
is out of order. 'Beep'.

827
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:05,110
'Beep' sounds more like
an answering machine.

828
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:09,310
Kango...

829
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,410
When my phone says 'Leave a message
after the tone,' what comes then?

830
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,820
'Beep'.

831
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,820
I say that myself.

832
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:23,290
People laugh.

833
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,430
You didn't know that.

834
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:32,070
Lately you don't phone.

835
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,270
You don't phone me much.

836
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,640
Don't get mad.

837
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,340
Meow...not.

838
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,310
The embassy called.

839
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,350
Yeah?

840
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,350
Tokyo faxed them
a copy of my family register.

841
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,720
They needed it for my travel document.
They called me...

842
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:29,590
...and I went to get it.

843
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,360
I thought you'd gone!

844
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:38,800
Oh...sorry.

845
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,800
I'll make tea.

846
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,440
You didn't go to the party?

847
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,450
I didn't feel like it.
She left some food.

848
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,590
Yeah?

849
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:58,590
It's probably in full swing now.

850
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,660
Let's have a party here, then.

851
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:08,660
Just the two of us.

852
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,800
Why not?

853
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,370
This fills you up!

854
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,040
I won't waste it.

855
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,410
It's made right.

856
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:19,740
It's good!

857
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,740
It's good.

858
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:26,320
You made it, not me.

859
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,250
But no more.

860
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,050
I'm full.

861
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:33,050
Yeah.

862
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:37,860
You have to go back...

863
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,570
To the hotel.

864
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,940
Yeah.

865
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,940
I haven't stayed there yet.

866
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:52,710
That's a waste of money.

867
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:55,710
I forget the name again.

868
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,080
Oh, right...uh...

869
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,120
I'll write it down.

870
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,540
What was it?

871
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:27,610
It's a long name. Now I forget.

872
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:33,580
Have you really forgotten?

873
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,220
Let's drink some more.

874
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:40,760
More?

875
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,060
For now, let's drink.

876
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,060
Sure.

877
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,400
Bordeaux or Medoc?

878
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:59,210
Can you play?

879
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:02,210
No.

880
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,850
Sure you can!

881
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,850
We had a band in school,
so I know a few chords.

882
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,390
A popularity ploy.

883
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,760
How did you know?

884
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,760
People who play guitar
or sing...

885
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,930
Any boy who wants to be popular
is obliged to be in a band.

886
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,100
Maybe not 'obliged'.

887
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:31,110
'Obliged to be'?
How do you say that in French?

888
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,210
I don't know. I'm Japanese.

889
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:46,460
One day I reached a turning point.

890
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,760
What?

891
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,760
I switched from guitar to camera.

892
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:52,130
And?

893
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:55,130
People liked that better.

894
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:00,270
I won a prize,
and I got too confident.

895
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,340
Like that?

896
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,340
Not quite.

897
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,010
Like that.

898
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:14,020
I thought I'd make a living at it,
so after university I just did that.

899
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,960
That was brave.

900
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,460
But...

901
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,070
...it's a cold, cruel world.

902
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,700
I ended up working part-time
at Sukiya.

903
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,380
Do you know it?

904
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:44,910
Beef-bowl?

905
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,920
A chain, like Yoshinoya.

906
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,450
Film costs money.

907
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,450
I ate rice with bean sprouts
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

908
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:59,060
With citrus sauce,
then soy, then Worcestershire.

909
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:03,030
Are you listening?

910
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,030
I tried every taste variation
I could think of.

911
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,240
But bean sprouts are bean sprouts.

912
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,910
Still OK?

913
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:17,710
I'll have some more.

914
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,480
Thanks.

915
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,480
Then one day...

916
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,190
Is that too loud?

917
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:29,360
No. Add in the music.

918
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,360
Then a pro photographer
who used me sometimes...

919
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,170
...got sick and asked me
to sub for him...

920
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,440
...for a musician's
publicity photographs.

921
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:44,140
And they loved it?

922
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:47,140
Not so much the public
as the musician herself.

923
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,410
Then what? I took lots of stuff.
Publicity stills...

924
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:55,550
...advertising, CD jackets...

925
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:59,450
Then came actresses and so on
that she knew.

926
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,790
Yeah, that can happen.

927
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,760
And before I knew it...

928
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,760
...I was the best
retouching photographer around.

929
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,200
Retouching?

930
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,040
Yeah. You know
what it's like now.

931
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,040
It's all digital.

932
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,140
Spots, wrinkles, bags under the eyes.
The three-piece set.

933
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:27,180
If everything's right, you can even
change the shape of the face.

934
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:32,990
I'm more like a Takasu Clinic
than a photographer.

935
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:42,200
Cosmetic surgery.
I know the Takasu Clinic.

936
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,370
That's not why I stopped.

937
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:46,400
I was waiting.

938
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,140
So if you ask me...

939
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,140
...what pictures
I'm most confident about...

940
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:56,510
...I'd probably say the ones I took
when I was eating bean sprouts.

941
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,720
I don't know...it's like back then
I was in charge of my photographs.

942
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,590
Now my clients are.

943
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:09,590
Really?

944
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:11,490
For example...

945
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,500
I was doing a soft-drink poster
down in Okinawa.

946
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:19,530
The sky was so blue
it made your eyes sting.

947
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,240
But they wanted me to make it blue
right up to where the sun was.

948
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:31,010
And you know, Aoi-san,
a real sky...

949
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:34,350
...isn't blue right around the sun.

950
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,090
It's white.

951
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:41,090
But they wanted me to make
the whole thing blue.

952
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,960
It's like all they knew was
'the sky is blue'.

953
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:50,430
Do they want it to look painted?
The sky isn't like that!

954
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,080
Like that?

955
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:09,350
Exactly. Just like that.

956
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,120
But...

957
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:18,130
...I wanted the work.

958
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:22,030
Whenever one of my actresses
or woman editors calls me...

959
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:26,370
...no matter when or where,
I hurry right over.

960
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,040
Like a host.

961
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,510
That's not my plan for you.

962
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,180
Sorry?

963
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:36,180
I don't have a thing for hosts
or younger men.

964
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,650
That's not what I'm saying.
Don't take it like that.

965
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,950
You're not like those people
at all.

966
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,560
You're just...

967
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:59,130
...a little bit to one side
of absolute perfection.

968
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:06,940
I'm told that a lot.
Maybe I was born that way.

969
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,350
I don't know about that...

970
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,650
Like my tuning's wonky.
Does that bother you?

971
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:19,550
You're not 'wonky'.
'Laid-back', maybe.

972
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:25,430
I shouldn't say this
about someone older, but...

973
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:29,900
...you're cute.

974
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,900
'Cute'?

975
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:38,070
Wow! I haven't heard that
for a century.

976
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,210
You aren't that old.

977
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:43,210
Sorry.

978
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,550
I'm not all that good, so if I don't
spend all my time on my work...

979
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:53,490
...I can't make ends meet.

980
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,830
So the girlfriend I'd had for years
left me.

981
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,360
That was a come-on.

982
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,730
I said I'm single.

983
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,940
Forget it.

984
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,940
So anyway, because of that
I'm basically kind of miserable.

985
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,380
I started...

986
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,380
...wanting to take pictures
only I could take.

987
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,620
Like everyone else, the dream was
to put out books and have exhibitions.

988
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,930
But right now
I'm nothing but a yes-man...

989
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,830
...running around being nice
to the people who use me.

990
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,000
Really?

991
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,770
I'm only in Paris to be...

992
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,770
What did you call it?
The 'luck brother'.

993
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,210
The luck brother.

994
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,220
That's fine as far as it goes...

995
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:57,850
...but the whole situation
just irritates me.

996
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:01,790
I was thinking I'd like to
just pack it all in...

997
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:06,690
...but when my passport got wrecked,
the first thing I thought of was work.

998
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:19,170
I've been tamed.

999
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:24,110
I can't go forward,
and I can't go back.

1000
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,920
Surely something will work out.

1001
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,400
You can still take
your own photographs.

1002
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:47,430
Someone who's tried hard once
can always do it again.

1003
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,140
I'm no expert, but I'd love to see...

1004
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:59,550
...your exhibition.

1005
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,260
Want more cheese?
And some dried raisins?

1006
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:11,590
Yeah, sure.

1007
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,800
Shall we go on to
the 2nd movement?

1008
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:27,140
What's the chord?

1009
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,310
Of what?

1010
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:32,310
The Story of Aoi-san.

1011
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,550
Forget my story.

1012
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:38,550
I can't tell it as well.

1013
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,320
Too bad.

1014
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:53,430
Good night, Sen.
I'm going to bed.

1015
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:20,230
Hey, Sen...

1016
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,270
Why are you sleeping there?

1017
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,800
I thought you'd gone.

1018
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:34,810
Come here.

1019
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,780
OK, don't.

1020
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:58,070
May I?

1021
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:01,070
Sure.

1022
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:04,870
What?

1023
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,140
Isn't this fun?

1024
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,140
When I started photography,
I took up climbing...

1025
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,280
...and bought a sleeping bag.

1026
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,280
The scenery changes
with where you sleep...

1027
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:20,450
...even in the same room.

1028
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:25,790
This isn't any fun.

1029
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Yours was my first bathtub.

1030
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,200
You're weird.

1031
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,440
My arms need to be
more than twice as long.

1032
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,480
It's like trying to hold
a sumo wrestler.

1033
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:47,350
No, thanks.

1034
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:52,150
I'm...

1035
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:58,260
No, I'm scared to say.

1036
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:05,670
I'm not scared to hear.

1037
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,240
No?

1038
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:11,240
No.

1039
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:16,850
OK.

1040
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:19,850
About me.

1041
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:28,690
I like art.

1042
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:33,730
When I finished art school,
I got a job in a gallery.

1043
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,270
The Japanese economy was still good,
and it had a branch here.

1044
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:43,540
I studied French real hard,
and got hired here.

1045
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:51,010
A man the gallery dealt with
was a local artist.

1046
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,520
French?

1047
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,220
Yeah.

1048
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,220
Maybe I was lonely in a new place.
We got married right away.

1049
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,100
But this guy had girls everywhere.

1050
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,840
I didn't like being cheated on...

1051
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:24,510
...so we got a divorce.

1052
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:41,860
And I quit the gallery, too,
and got a job with a company...

1053
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:44,870
...that published free papers.

1054
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:53,710
I had my cat.

1055
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:57,710
But he went, so it was just me.

1056
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,620
Without Guru or Shion, all alone.

1057
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,360
'Shion'?

1058
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,200
Shion was my baby.

1059
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,840
I heard about that.

1060
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,350
Joanne?

1061
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:35,350
She thought we were old friends.

1062
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,560
When I left my husband,
I was pregnant.

1063
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:56,300
I had...

1064
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:59,870
...a boy.

1065
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:04,180
The cutest little angel.

1066
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,080
But he was never healthy.

1067
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,120
He only lived five years.

1068
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:19,730
The poor thing.

1069
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:33,170
Shion named Guru.

1070
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,680
Shion played the piano.

1071
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,680
When Guru heard him playing
that Minuet and Trio...

1072
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:45,150
...he'd come straight home,
no matter where he was.

1073
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,720
Like magic.

1074
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,600
Shion found Guru
and brought him home.

1075
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:07,040
He came in with the kitten
in both his bony little hands...

1076
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:13,710
...and stood right there.

1077
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:17,950
'Mama, can we keep him?'
he said.

1078
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,660
'He'll die.

1079
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,760
'The poor cat!'

1080
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,040
Sorry.

1081
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
After he died,
I couldn't work for a long time.

1082
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,480
I couldn't move forward.

1083
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:29,260
Aoi-san...

1084
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:32,930
Yes?

1085
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:36,830
An idea.

1086
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:43,370
Come in here.

1087
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:18,770
Um...

1088
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,280
Yes?

1089
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:26,850
Closer.

1090
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:30,650
OK.

1091
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:34,990
As close as we can get.

1092
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:39,830
OK.

1093
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:07,660
Sorry. I woke you up.

1094
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:08,820
What's that?

1095
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,830
Scrambled eggs.
I thought I'd make breakfast.

1096
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:16,700
This is how you separate
the yolks from the white.

1097
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,800
You can do that?

1098
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,680
You go home tomorrow.
What are you doing today?

1099
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,120
I don't know...

1100
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,320
What are your plans?

1101
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,320
My plans are work.
My Easter egg special.

1102
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,400
I'll come with you.

1103
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:54,370
It's around here.

1104
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:57,370
Somewhere.

1105
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:03,210
Huge!

1106
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:07,750
Beautiful! That vapor trail.

1107
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:12,960
Yeah.

1108
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,960
Here it is.

1109
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,430
Hello.

1110
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:21,360
I'm from the Japanese paper.

1111
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,360
Leopaul, and my colleague Marion.

1112
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:27,370
I'm Aoi, and the photographer is Sen.

1113
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:29,000
Hello.

1114
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:31,340
You speak French well.

1115
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:33,240
'You speak French well.'

1116
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,240
These are small eggs.

1117
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,250
Made here, in different colors.

1118
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:45,290
Beautiful!

1119
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:48,290
Wow!

1120
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:58,030
Cute!

1121
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,770
What?

1122
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:05,610
I wore these again.

1123
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:08,610
You're right.

1124
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:12,010
I have to buy new shoes.

1125
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,320
Is there anywhere
you'd like to go?

1126
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,360
Somewhere I'd like to go?

1127
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,930
I know!

1128
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:30,930
When I first met you...

1129
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,930
...I asked you your favorite place
and you wouldn't tell me.

1130
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,140
There.

1131
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:42,140
But...

1132
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:46,450
If you don't want to, we could try
the Louvre, or the Quai d'Orsay.

1133
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:51,350
Let's go.

1134
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:54,060
To my favorite place.

1135
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:57,060
It's not a secret or anything?

1136
01:28:57,690 --> 01:29:00,690
Well, yes...

1137
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:04,700
By boat?

1138
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:07,700
Yep. Right up to the source
of the Amazon.

1139
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:11,210
This is a sight-seeing boat!

1140
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:14,210
You're not fooled?

1141
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:58,180
Right there.
That's where we met.

1142
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,620
The passport incident.
That seems a long time ago now.

1143
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:08,290
There's Notre Dame.

1144
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,900
The day before yesterday, wasn't it?

1145
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:17,770
We've been together ever since.

1146
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,640
That's right.

1147
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,080
Hey, Sen...

1148
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,390
That bridge...

1149
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:33,390
...is the Pont Marie.

1150
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:36,690
If you make a wish under it,
it comes true.

1151
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,400
It only works for lovers, though.

1152
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,130
Limited to lovers?

1153
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:49,140
I don't think it's a law...

1154
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:54,670
Let's pretend to be lovers, then.

1155
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:57,380
Pretend?

1156
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:00,380
Or our wishes won't come true.

1157
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:32,910
What did you wish for?

1158
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:37,620
Not telling.

1159
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,320
Maybe we were wishing for
the same thing.

1160
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:47,230
Let's just stay like this for a while.

1161
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,260
It's not fair.

1162
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:51,700
Who, me?

1163
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:54,700
Both of us.

1164
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,800
Both of us?

1165
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,880
Over there.

1166
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,690
I like that.

1167
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:14,990
The Eiffel Tower?

1168
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:17,360
Yeah.

1169
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,360
Although I'll admit
it's kind of a cliché.

1170
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:25,470
No, it's not.

1171
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,400
So much has happened
since I came here...

1172
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:33,270
...but the Eiffel's always there.

1173
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:36,880
The other buildings are low...

1174
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,880
...so you can see the Eiffel Tower
from anywhere.

1175
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:46,350
So it's special to you?

1176
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:50,220
Not 'special'.

1177
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:56,330
It's just always there.

1178
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,840
People go away.

1179
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:17,980
I wish I could be your Eiffel.

1180
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:23,690
Is that a confession of love?

1181
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:28,260
Hmm...

1182
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:32,730
Don't say that when you're leaving.

1183
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:36,370
I wish I wasn't.

1184
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:40,870
Then stay.

1185
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,280
Sorry.

1186
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:02,730
It's OK. I've still got him.

1187
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:11,110
Kango...

1188
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:14,110
I'm going home.

1189
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:17,780
All of a sudden?
I'm just making dinner.

1190
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:22,080
Kango...

1191
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:25,650
...one last request.

1192
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:30,460
Request?

1193
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:34,660
It's why I came.

1194
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:40,100
Look at me.

1195
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:55,050
I want you...

1196
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,060
...to marry me.

1197
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:06,530
What brought this on?

1198
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:14,930
It's like...

1199
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,440
...in the six months
since you came to Paris...

1200
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:25,780
...I can't breathe any more.
It's like the air in Tokyo...

1201
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:31,650
...is too thin.

1202
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:34,650
Can't we just go on like we are?

1203
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:38,790
I'm a spoiled brat
and I'm lonely.

1204
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,360
I need someone.

1205
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:48,470
You're the same.

1206
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:51,470
How?

1207
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:56,010
The way we're going, we'll fall apart.

1208
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:02,250
So marry me.

1209
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:07,050
I can come over here,
or you can come back.

1210
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,360
Whoa, whoa, wait.
How can I put this?

1211
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:18,030
There's a lot of things
you haven't thought about.

1212
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,000
I have.

1213
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Like what?
Like how we'd both survive?

1214
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:27,140
Or how about, like...

1215
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:29,610
...my dream?

1216
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:31,280
We can do it!

1217
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,150
I think you're being naive.

1218
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:35,050
Why?

1219
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:38,050
I'm here for a reason.

1220
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:41,490
So? I'll be here, too.

1221
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:51,300
No, wait a minute...

1222
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,280
Marry me.

1223
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:17,590
Sorry.

1224
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:21,590
I can't do that.

1225
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:35,580
I'll end it.

1226
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:39,550
I'll break up with you.

1227
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:44,020
Well, if that's how it has to be...

1228
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,160
Stupid!

1229
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:54,330
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

1230
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:15,310
Kango...

1231
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:28,730
...be famous.

1232
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,720
Suzume...

1233
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:59,390
Look...

1234
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:05,230
So that's it?
Wait a minute...

1235
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:10,970
We're through?

1236
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:23,380
Work hard.

1237
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:23,240
Kango!

1238
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:39,330
Aoi-san...

1239
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:42,530
A picture.

1240
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:44,630
Of me?

1241
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:47,630
That won't be much of a picture.

1242
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,080
Don't!

1243
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,080
It's out of focus...

1244
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:20,070
Turn this way for a second.

1245
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:26,510
Stop it!

1246
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:29,510
That was good.

1247
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,800
Let's see...

1248
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,470
Line up with it.

1249
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:01,470
With the Tower?

1250
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:05,780
You and the Eiffel Tower
are the real Paris for me.

1251
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:38,940
Was I smiling?

1252
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:42,450
Yes, you were.

1253
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:21,850
L'hotel de la Pucelle d'Orleans.

1254
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:26,830
Your hotel.

1255
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:32,630
I knew it all along.

1256
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:36,870
I pretended I'd forgotten.
I'll write it down.

1257
01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:07,470
There.

1258
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:54,180
Sorry.

1259
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:13,750
Hello.

1260
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:15,680
Hello. I have a package for you.

1261
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:18,680
Sign here.

1262
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:24,020
All right.

1263
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:27,030
Thank you. Have a good day.

1264
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:07,300
To Aoi-san
