00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,060
Please welcome Russell Peters!

5
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,740
Hey!

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,790
Alright!

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,270
Look at this... Look at this audience, man!

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,440
Looks like a Benetton ad! Man, this is good. This is uh...

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,670
A lot of different kinds of people here tonight.

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,870
Good evening, folks. You alright?

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,850
Well, one Indian guy's alright. The rest of you is OK. Sounds good.

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,190
Oh, that's crazy though. Alright, good, uh...

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,720
It's good to be back. I was at my parent's house about a month ago.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,190
I was watching TV with my dad, right. We're sitting in the living room watching TV.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,360
And we're... They had like... The gay pride parade was on that weekend.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,180
And we're... Well, whatever makes you happy. And um...

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,490
And they uh... And they were showing, like they have a live feed.

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,670
Not like a <i>live feed</i>, but they were showing...

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,900
They were... They were showing that parade, right? They were showing on TV, right?

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,970
So... Oh, would you grow up?

21
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,310
Alright, so we were watching them, right?

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,140
We were watching the parade, right?

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,610
And all of a sudden, these three gay Indian guys came on the screen, right?

24
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,950
I don't mean <i>came</i> on the screen. They uh... They uh...

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,290
You know, they appeared, right? So...

26
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,290
So, we were watching them, right? And these three gay Indian guys, like...

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,210
"Hey, we're Indian and we're gay!"

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,700
"We represent the gay South Asian community!"

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,560
And my dad looks at me and he goes "That is disgusting!"

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,510
"Do you know them?"

31
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,030
And what the hell would I know them?

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,310
"Because they're of the gay..."

33
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,600
"And you are in the entertainment business."

34
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,910
Then my dad started to get really irritated with them, you know, because they just kept showing them on the screen.

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,570
It really didn't bother me, you know. Because it's just, you know... it's gay pride, they're just being proud and gay, you know, so...

36
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,210
So my dad started to get really irritated with them. "This is wrong! We should not have gay Indians."

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,410
"Indian men should not be gay!"

38
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,840
But dad, we've got a population crisis over there.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,250
We could use a couple of homos in India right now, you know what I'm saying?

40
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,430
I love it when people concern themselves with stuffs that's never gonna affect their lives.

41
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,550
No, I mean, same-sex marriages. I've got bigger things to worry about than same-sex marriages.

42
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,390
'Cos I've gotta worry about an arranged marriage.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
That's...

44
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,320
...be out of control when they got a same-sex arranged marriage. 'Cos that's what gotta be out of control, you know what I mean?

45
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,480
An Indian family realize that his son is gay when he's young, you know. "We must find him a nice boy."

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,060
"Someone from a good family... and a good closet."

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,570
Arranged marriage is a big problem in my community, man.

48
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,660
You know, it's not so much a problem. It's a problem if you want it to be a problem.

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,420
I mean it's a problem for me, you know what I mean?

50
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,350
My parents tried that on me last year. They came out to me like... My mom was like "Russell...

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
...you're getting older now."

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,970
"And you're not married."

53
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,090
"What if I bring some nice girls home for you?"

54
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,010
Ma, I got to bring nice girls home all the time.

55
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,490
They just leave in the morning, you know.

56
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,770
That's a nice girl right there.

57
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,830
She said "No, no, I will pick some girls and you can choose the one you like."

58
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,900
What, are you out of your mind, man? My mom wanted to pick my wife!

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,050
I wouldn't want my mom to pick my clothes!

60
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,460
Imagine my mom walks in with this girl. "I know she's a little big now."

61
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,250
"But you'll grow into her."

62
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,700
It's a big deal in Indian community if you're not married, man.

63
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,630
I'm not married. I don't really... I'm not really big on this whole marriage thing, you know.

64
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,780
I love women too much to get married, you know what I mean?

65
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,820
If you love women and you get married, then you just love woman.

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,920
I don't know if I'm ready to do that yet, you know.

67
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,690
I'm scared of getting that disease too. You know that disease when you got married? One-gina?

68
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,890
I don't uh...

69
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,700
I don't want to get stuck with one-gina for the rest of my life, you know.

70
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,120
Oh, man.

71
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,460
I've been in a lot of traveling. I've just came back from South Africa. I was in the motherland.

72
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,990
Not my motherland, obviously, you know what I mean. It's...

73
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,910
Black people's motherland, you know.

74
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,860
I'm Indian. We have our own motherland...

75
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,570
England. You know, I was uh...

76
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,120
The night I came back from South Africa, that was funny. I was doing a show the same night I came back and I'm on stage and I go...

77
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,240
Yeah, I just came back from South Africa. Some drunk white lady in the back of the room, she was uh...

78
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,360
"Yah-man!"

79
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,940
I said <i>South Africa</i>.

80
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,280
"Yah-man!"

81
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,490
Not freakin' Jamaica!

82
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,420
She'd be better off our show than <i>[MIMICKING AFRICAN LANGUAGE]</i>

83
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,040
Some people don't like to laugh at the joke. They think it's racist.

84
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,940
You ever see that movie <i>The Gods Must Be Crazy</i>?

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,920
Yeah, remember the first time you saw an African brother does <i>[MIMICKING AFRICAN LANGUAGE]</i>?

86
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,580
You were laughing your ass off, weren't you, huh?

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,330
Of course the first time I saw it, I thought, wow, whoever wrote this is brilliant!

88
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,450
I went to South Africa, that's a real language!

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,190
I didn't know that, man. I am in an elevator at my hotel...

90
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,940
...then these three African guys get on board.

91
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,150
Then the conversations I hear coming out of their mouth is...

92
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,340
[MIMICKING AFRICAN LANGUAGE]

93
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,930
[MIMICKING AFRICAN LANGUAGE WITH LOTS OF CLICKS]

94
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,220
And I'm standing there like a jackass, laughing at them, right.

95
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,660
I can't really believe they really talk like that!

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,370
Then I was almost getting into fight with them because I was eating pop rocks and they thought I was swearing at them.

97
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,230
That's very tense in that elevator, man.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,920
Freaks me out when I went there, too.

99
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,930
If you guys ever have a chance to go to South Africa, you're gonna freak out. You know what freak me out when I went there?

100
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,740
I got off the plane, there was Indian people.

101
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,750
Not one or two.

102
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,790
Millions of us!

103
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,380
And here's the thing. Indian people has been in South Africa for like, six, seven generations now.

104
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,440
They've been in Africa longer than white people have been in Canada.

105
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,140
Well it's true that there has been six, seven generations, here's the messed up part. Indian people were taken to South Africa...

106
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,810
...as slaves!

107
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,350
Who the hell uses an Indian slave?

108
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,780
Do I look physically ready to do hard labor?

109
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,610
Our people don't work that hard. Give us a calculator, we'll do your taxes, man.

110
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,450
My people don't like doing physical labor, man. Could you...

111
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,630
We'd make shitty slaves, man.

112
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,370
Imagine how pissed off the first slave owner was?

113
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,810
Alright, Raj, here's what you're gonna do.

114
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,080
Get in that field and pick that up.

115
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,410
No.

116
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,990
No.

117
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,780
I can't do it. I can't do it.

118
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,600
I hurt my back.

119
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,240
Let me tell you what we do.

120
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,240
OK?

121
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,890
OK. You...

122
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,180
...pick the corn.

123
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,200
And I...

124
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,450
...will get the teeshirts made.

125
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,850
And together...

126
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,040
...we can wholesale.

127
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,600
We don't do hard physical work like that, man.

128
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,900
Why do you think you don't see very many Indian athletes?

129
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,700
You're not gonna see an Indian guy in the NFL.

130
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,230
OK, down, set, hike hike!

131
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,140
Go run, run!

132
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,250
Run with it!

133
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm waiting here, bro!

134
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,780
Faster, faster!

135
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,590
We're waiting.

136
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,270
Glad to see brown people in the audience. That's nice, son.

137
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,260
Of course you'd be here if the taping is free.

138
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,910
You cheap bastards!

139
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,630
Indian people don't even act like they're not cheap. We know we're cheap.

140
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,930
It's in our blood to be cheap.

141
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,090
There are people who say Jews are cheap.

142
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,200
Jews aren't actually cheap. Jews will spend the money if they think it's worthwhile.

143
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,390
A Jew will grab a shirt, "I don't know...

144
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,980
I already feel it's a good material.

145
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,760
Here's my money."

146
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,260
Where the Indian guy is, like, "I don't know..."

147
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,020
"I could probably get this made for four dollars."

148
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,220
And when you're not looking, he'll pull out a knife...

149
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,240
"How much now it's ripped?"

150
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,100
"I don't buy ripped shirts."

151
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,410
We are cheap, man. It's in our blood.

152
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,420
My dad is so good at being cheap, that he could convince you that you're wrong.

153
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,040
I took my dad to a bar, he ordered a beer.

154
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,340
The waiter was, like, "It's $4.50, sir" and my dad was, like, "OK."

155
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,800
"Here's $3."

156
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,910
She's standing, like, "Sir, what about the other $1.50?"

157
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,530
"Don't worry about it."

158
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,670
"OK."

159
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,330
She's like "You owe me $1.50."

160
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,260
"I owe you, you owe me. It's the same thing. Go ahead, don't be so cheap."

161
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,380
We're the same Asian people as good.

162
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,760
You Chinese?

163
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,370
Woo!

164
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,350
I'm saying it could be your last name. Woo! It's uh...

165
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,930

I go to the Chinese guy behind the counter. "How much?" He goes...

"Thirty five dollars."

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,300
"How about thirty?"

178

331
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,460
This is "what the fuck?" in Italian.

332
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,640
Right here. This little hand motion is "what the fuck?"

333
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,360
[MIMICKING ITALIAN LANGUAGE]
"Hey!"

334
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,040
This is "what the fuck" in Italian.

335
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,930
You know what this mean in Indian? "Do you want to eat?"

336
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,500
"You want to eat?"

337
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,000
Imagine an Italian guy walking into an Indian restaurant.

338
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,640
"Hey, what the fuck?"

339
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,180
"Hey, hey, hey! Buffet is over there."

340
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,580
"And you watch your language."

341
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,950
"Or somebody gonna get a hurt real bad."

342
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,550
Hey, Chinese friend, are you alright over there?

343
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,730
How you doing, bro?

344
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,760
Are you trying to sell me a purse over there?

345
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,370
Just kidding, just kidding.

346
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,940
What's your name?

347
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,520
No, the Chinese guy.

348
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,400
You're the black guy.

349
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,340
But you know, whatever makes you happy, you know what I mean?

350
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,800
Alright, Chinese friend, what's your name, sir?

351
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,380
Anthony. That's what I thought when I look at you.

352
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,220
Looks right down. That's an Anthony right there. That's uh...

353
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,740
Do you have a Chinese name as well, Anthony?

354
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,170
What's your Chinese name?

355
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,150
Say it, you know, properly. I want how Chinese people say your name.

356
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,190
I don't... Not "<i>nen dou go</i>, Anthony!"

357
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,150
I don't want that, you know what I mean? I want...

358
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,660
I want the proper Chinese version.

359
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,520
What's your Chinese name?

360
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,150
Tak Sam Bong?

361
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,990
Does that mean you're gonna get high?

362
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,430
Hey, you wanna Tak Some Bong?

363
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,830
That's a wicked name, man.

364
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,090
Tak Some Bong.

365
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,650
I don't know if I'm saying it wrong, you know, but...

366
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,390
...that's the way it is now, you know.

367
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,820
Sound cooler than Anthony.

368
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,610
Unless you're Anthony by day and Tak Some Bong by night.

369
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,050
You're gonna be like uh, like a Chinese superhero, man!

370
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,350
China-man! China...

371
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,960
You got two chopsticks on your shirt.

372
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,330
Shooting noodles out of his wrists.

373
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,780
Catching bad guys with stale fortune cookies.

374
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,590
Confucius says...

375
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,090
"You go to jail, bad boy!"

376
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,170
I did shows in Hong Kong. I went to Hong Kong last year, man. That was wicked.

377
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,170
Hong Kong is a wicked place.

378
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,980
I think Chinese people are the smartest people in the world, man.

379
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,410
They're tricking us all.

380
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,670
They are, man.

381
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,270
They are not dumb people.

382
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,680
They pretend to not know English.

383
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,860
I went to Hong Kong, they <i>all</i> speak English over there.

384
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,410
And even, they speak better English than we speak.

385
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,830
I'm in this guy's store, I go, "you know what, me and my friend will come back." He goes...

386
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,530
"Your friend and I."

387
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,260
Like one of you and him when he comes back too, that's right, me lad.

388
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,230
They're not dumb people, man. Don't be fooled.

389
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,030
They're toying you.

390
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,180
You know what really upsets me when I go to Hong Kong? Everybody's going around the world to perform...

391
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,360
Wherever I go they have a local comedian to open a show for us.

392
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,770
I go to South Africa, they get a South African. I go to England, they get an English comedian.

393
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,220
Went to Hong Kong, I kept picturing in my head a Chinese comedian. I get there...

394
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,600
...no Chinese comedian.

395
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,810
I was so upset.

396
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,380
'Cos I kept picturing a Chinese comedian, you know.

397
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,080
A little Chinese brother running up opening up the show.

398
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,610
"Hey! Hey!"

399
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,790
"Scuse me."

400
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,680
"Your mother is so fat..."

401
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
"...that when she jump for joy..."

402
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,690
"...she got stuck."

403
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,380
"OK, thank you."

404
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,450
Didn't have him. Didn't have him.

405
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,050
Very upsetting.

406
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,410
Oh man.

407
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,980
I'm gonna let out a secret about Indian people.

408
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,380
For all the people here, and all the people watching, wherever you are.

409
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,900
If you're not an Indian, this is a message to you on behalf of all Indian people.

410
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,940
I hope my brown people don't get upset that I'm letting out a secret.

411
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,910
But just so you guys know.

412
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,210
Indian people are fully aware...

413
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,240
...of what their accent sounds like.

414
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,920
We don't actually need you...

415
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,140
We know exactly what it sounds like.

416
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,160
We know it's not the coolest accent in the world, you know.

417
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,370
You're never gonna see two Indian guys in a club standing around going...

418
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,170
"Hey, man."

419
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,660
"Aren't we cool?"

420
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,610
"Don't... don't we sound really hip?"

421
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,610
"We are going to meet all the bitches tonight."

422
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,420
"I am pimping."

423
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,440
You know. It's not gonna happen, you know.

424
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,830
We know what it sound like, you know.

425
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,520
And don't think for one minute that we don't know that you're mocking us when we're not around.

426
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,880
It's an accent. We're not deaf.

427
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,270
Don't think when we're walking to Home Depot and go "Hello, I'm looking for paint."

428
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,280
"Yeah, it's right down that aisle over there, sir."

429
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,000
"Hey Jim, do you hear that guy looking for <i>paint</i>?"

430
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,270
[WITH INDIAN ACCENT]
"Paint!"

431
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,220
[WITH INDIAN ACCENT]
"Paiiint!"

432
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,920
"Hey, let's go have a cigarette and talk about this for half an hour. Ha ha ha!"

433
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,760
We know you're doing it, you bastards!

434
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,190
But Indian people know their accent is good for what is not good.

435
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,900
For we know its limitations.

436
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,830
You know, I mean, we know it's not good for getting laid.

437
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,020
It's not gonna help me. "Hello, baby."

438
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,950
Nothing's gonna happen for you.

439
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,600
But you know what the Indian accent is good for? Cutting tension.

440
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,380
You got a tense situation? Pop in the Indian accent.

441
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,210
The tension is gone.

442
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,270
Picture a serious courtroom drama.

443
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,640
"Your honor. My client..."

444
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,020
"...would like to plead guilty!"

445
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,840
Tension's gone.

446
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,990
But white people... Let me talk to you for a minute.

447
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,300
White Canadian people especially.

448
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,770
Canadian white people. And when I said Canadian...

449
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,950
I mean you're Canadian, your parents are Canadian, your grandparents are Canadian. You're really Canadian.

450
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,390
Canadian white people, you have an accent.

451
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,750
And they're completely oblivious to it.

452
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,740
You do? I'm not aware of it, sir.

453
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,070
You may not have it, you look like a rich Canadian white guy, I don't know. You know what I mean?

454
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,990
You're minority.

455
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,560
But Canadian people have an accent.

456
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,640
And it's funny when you watch white Canadian people talk, especially white Canadian guys.

457
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,680
They have this funny ass way of talking.

458
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,420
They talk... The way they speak, they make everything sounds like the most matter of fact thing you've ever heard in your life.

459
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,000
And when they talk to you, it looks like they can't control their head.

460
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,190
It looks like a part of bobble head when they're saying stuff to you.

461
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,770
This one comes up to you and go...

462
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,650
"Jesus Christ!"

463
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,990
"They take care a load of the jugs on that one!"

464
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,070
"Oh yeah, oh yeah."

465
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,800
They do. It's funny to watch.

466
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,940
And white people said and go "we don't have any accent. What are you talking about?"

467
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,830
I can prove to you, white folks, that you have an accent.

468
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,420
It's a pretty bold statement for a brown man.

469
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,320
But I can prove it to you.

470
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,570
White people, when you swear...

471
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,450
...you sound like donkeys.

472
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,580
You do. Cause you're saying stuff like...

473
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,270
"Fuuuck aaass!"

474
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,730
"Buuullshiiit!"

475
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,010
"Yee haw! Yee haw!"

476
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,120
You talk funny, man. It's okay.

477
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,510
This is a nice room tonight, you know.

478
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,240
It's all kind of different people here. I love that.

479
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,630
When I look at the audience, I see...

480
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,450
...black, white, Asians.

481
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,660
Everybody's having a good time hanging out.

482
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,770
Brown...

483
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,460
...you fall under Asians as well.

484
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,280
South.

485
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,450
It's nice, you know, different mix of audience like this.

486
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,750
People at home. Different kind of people enjoying this at their living room, or whatever.

487
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,440
This type of thing's not gonna be able to happen in about three hundred years from now. You realize that?

488
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,830
'Cos you realize that, if we make it, three hundred years from now...

489
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,560
You realize there's not gonna be any more white people?

490
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,290
Not gonna be any more black people.

491
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,240
Everybody's gonna be beige.

492
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,680
And I don't care. I'm already beige, you know what I mean?

493
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,800
It's not gonna affect me, you know.

494
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,840
But it's true. The whole world's mixing.

495
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,590
Nothing you can do about it.

496
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,280
Eventually, we're all gonna become a hybrid mix of Chinese and Indian.

497
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,830
It's inevitable.

498
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,040
They're the two largest population in the world.

499
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,360
So you can run from us now.

500
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,510
But sooner or later...

501
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,410
...we're gonna hump you.

502
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,860
And I think if we're all gonna be mixed anyway...

503
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,070
...we should start mixing now, you know.

504
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,610
You know, ladies, take some chances. Sleep around a bit, you know.

505
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,740
If you see that Indian comedian that you really want to have sex with, I say go for it!

506
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,110
Well, it's true the whole world's mixing, you know.

507
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,350
Eventually everybody's just gonna look the same.

508
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,320
But I think if we're all gonna mix anyway, let's start mixing people now that we've never normally mix.

509
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,470
Just to see what we'll get.

510
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,980
You know, hook up a Jamaican with an Italian.

511
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,290
They're gonna have a little <i>Pastaferian</i>, you know.

512
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,730
I'm an Indian, I can hook up with a Jewish girl. We're gonna have little <i>Hinjews</i>.

513
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,140
Get a woman from the Philippines and a guy from Holland, a little <i>Hollapinos</i>.

514
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,320
A guy from Cuba, a woman from Iceland, a little Ice Cube.

515
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,320
A French and a Greek, <i>Freek</i>.

516
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,440
A German and a Nufi, a little <i>Goofies</i>, you know what I mean?

517
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,180
It's gonna happen. We might as well help it along.

518
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,560
I used to go out with a Chinese girl. It's wicked going out with a Chinese girl.

519
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,620
You imagine if her and I have gotten serious?

520
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,850
Can you imagine that wedding?

521
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,040
Do you know how much rice would be at the wedding?

522
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,840
Nobody be allowed to throw it at the bride and groom.

523
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,660
Our parents would just freak out, "what the hell are you doing?!"

524
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,900
"You're wasting the food!"

525
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,130
"I told you not to invite white people to the wedding!"

526
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,820
"They throw the bloody food around."

527
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,980
"Let's go to their wedding and throw mashed potato at them!"

528
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,260
It's gonna happen, man.

529
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,710
May dad's been in this country for forty years now.

530
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,620
Forty years!

531
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,030
And you know what's scary? 'Cos I think my dad is turning into redneck now.

532
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,180
I swear to God, he's starting to say stuff that scares me, you know.

533
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,310
I walked into my parents' house a couple of weeks ago.

534
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,180
My dad was sitting on the phone, he had a newspaper open in front of him.

535
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,170
He had an ad circled. Somebody was selling a couch, right?

536
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,010
So my dad was on the phone, he called the ad.

537
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,290
And on the other end of the phone some Eastern European lady answered and she couldn't speak any English.

538
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,510
And all I hear was "Hello, I'm calling about your couch."

539
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,550
"Uh, hello."

540
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,470
"Hello?"

541
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,650
"I... I want to know about your couch."

542
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,790
"Hello?"

543
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,220
"OK."

544
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,820
"I've said hello twice."

545
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,050
"I would like to purchase your couch."

546
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,960
"No English."

547
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,150
"I'm sorry?"

548
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,440
"No English."

549
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,320
"Then why the hell did you answer the phone?"

550
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,870
"You don't come to my country if you can't speak the language!" Click.

551
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,090
My dad looks at me and goes "Immigrants!"

552
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,870
I go "Dad, you're an immigrant."

553
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,350
"Hey, you watch what you say to me!"

554
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,940
And they ask one thing that separates immigrant family from the regular Canadian family, you know.

555
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,770
Doesn't matter where your parents are from...

556
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,660
They weren't born in this country, they will whoop your ass when you're growing up, won't they?

557
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,930
It doesn't matter. Where your parents are from?

558
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,160
Ukraine. You know what I'm saying. They'll beat you with a cabbage roll, you know what I'm saying?

559
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,290
They'll smack a perovie up side your head.

560
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,790
They'll beat you, man! Immigrant parents will beat their kids.

561
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,940
Canadian parents they're a little too soft on their kids.

562
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
And that's fine, you know. Whatever makes you happy.

563
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,500
But you need to start beating your kids.

564
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,930
I'll tell you why.

565
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,080
Growing up... Kids now are growing up in a multi-cultural society.

566
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,830
You know, you're gonna have white kids growing up with black kids and brown kids, and Asian kids.

567
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,890
And they're all gonna be hanging out in the playground.

568
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,690
You know what I mean?

569
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,240
And they're gonna be talking about the ass whopping they got last night.

570
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,750
Do you want that little white kid to feel left out?

571
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,360
Beat that child so he's not a social outcast.

572
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,650
They're probably sitting around "Man, my daddy beat my ass!" "My dad beat my ass, too!"

573
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,870
The white kid goes "I was sent to my room."

574
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,150
They'll all be like "You've got a room?"

575
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,170
You need to beat the kids, man.

576
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,820
Indian parents will beat their kids.

577
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,840
Chinese parents will. I would hate get beaten by parents who know kung-fu and stuff, man. That's...

578
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,730
I would hate to messed up in a Chinese house, man.

579
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,370
"Hey! Kap Dis Wong!"

580
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,380
"Come here."

581
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,870
"It says you've got an F in school."

582
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,980
They wouldn't even need to beat you! Just go <i>[MIMICKING KUNG-FU SHOUT]</i>

583
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,800
No Sunny Check.

584
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,920
Indian parents will beat their... Indian parents aren't afraid to kill their kids if they have to, you know.

585
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,850
My dad's theory was "If I get rid of one I'll just make another one!"

586
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,790
"And I will tell the new one what an idiot the last one was!"

587
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,550
Jamaican parents will beat their kids for no reason sometimes.

588
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,420
"Hey, boy, come here."

589
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,880
"Yes, daddy?"

590
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,860
"What's that for?"
"Just in case."

591
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,950
White people, please beat your kids.

592
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,880
I'll tell you why. I was growing up, right?

593
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,050
I grew up around a lot of black people.

594
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,010
Which is fine, because black people never picked on me.

595
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,870
White kids, not so friendly back then.

596
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,420
But every now and then, a white kid will come and hang out with us.

597
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,590
We were like, "Wow, a white kid!"

598
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,470
"I've heard so much about you."

599
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,670
And here's what the problem is.

600
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,050
When a white kid would hang out with us, we want to be like the white kid.

601
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,800
We would want to start to do everything like the white. We want to copy the white kid so much...

602
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,640
And the problem is when we start taking the white kid's advice...

603
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,670
...on how to deal with our parents.

604
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,530
That'll get you freakin' murdered, man.

605
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,210
I remember hanging around this one little white boy, Ryan, when I was ten year old.

606
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,400
I went to his house after school one day, right?

607
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,560
His parents never beat him, and they've never even yelled at him.

608
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,110
He could do anything he wanted, and nothing was gonna happen to him.

609
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,530
But he was an angry kid.

610
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,400
We walked to his house after school and his mom was "Ryan, go clean your room."

611
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,350
"Fuck you, bitch!"

612
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,050
His mom goes "What am I gonna do with him?"

613
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,200
I go "Ryan, you can't talk to your mom like that."

614
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,020
"Yes I can. She's a jackass!"

615
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,070
"Don't say that, man. She'll hit you!"

616
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,530
"No she won't. She's not allowed to."

617
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,520
"What the hell are you talking about, man?"

618
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,780
"My parents hit me."

619
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,060
"Yeah, the next time they try it, you tell them to fuck off."

620
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,760
"Are you sure?"

621
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,310
"Trust me. It works for me."

622
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,300
So I went home...

623
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,850
...for the last time.

624
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,450
I walked into my house and my dad goes "Russell, come and do the dishes!"

625
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,170
"Fuck you, dad!"

626
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,960
"What the hell did you say to me?"

627
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,540
"Do I look like Ryan's mom?"

628
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,780
"Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad."

629
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,290
That was my dad's threat.

630
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,120
Right before he beat me. Every single time.

631
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,770
"Oi, Russell!"

632
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,650
"Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad."

633
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,220
I hated that threat. You know why?

634
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,890
'Cos he always says "somebody"...

635
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,490
...he never tell you it's you.

636
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,670
I mean, you knew it was you.

637
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,920
But he gives you this hope.

638
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,000
"Oi! Russell!"

639
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,770
"Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad."

640
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,950
"Somebody."

641
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,890
"I'm not gonna say who."

642
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,530
"Oh, I think you might know him very well."

643
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,410
I'm in the back praying, I hope it's my brother, man. Please.

644
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,420
I saw that little brat Ryan at school a few days later and I was like...

645
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,960
"Yo! Your little plan almost got me killed!"

646
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,750
He goes "Oh, sorry dude. I forgot to tell you the other part."

647
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,180
"If he's still gonna hit you, threaten to phone Children's Aid."

648
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,080
"Why?"

649
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:13,430
"Cause if you phone Children's Aid, they'll come and take your dad away, and he'll get in trouble."

650
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,070
"You won't even have to call. Just pretend. It'll scare the crap out of him."

651
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,210
You're ten years old, you figure out how to scare the crap out of your dad?

652
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,010
That's like finding kryptonite.

653
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,390
I thought I'd try it.

654
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,400
I was about to get my next beating, I stop my dad and go...

655
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,780
"Don't do it!"

656
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,960
"I'll phone Children's Aid."

657
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,960
You ever had your parents called your bluff?

658
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,580
"You'll do what?"

659
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,190
"I'll phone Children's Aid."

660
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,590
"Is that right?"

661
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,550
"Ooohhh..."

662
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,700
"Well, let me get you the phone, tough guy."

663
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,650
"Wait, what are you doing? If I phone Children's Aid, you'll get in trouble!"

664
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,170
