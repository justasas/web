1
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:43,825
You lookin' better than a Scarface starter kit

2
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:46,631
All hundreds, small faces nothin’ counterfeit

3
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,249
You want this ghetto D? Or that over the counter shit?

4
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,259
Catch you strippin’ in the kitchen, on the counter shit (damn)

5
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,038
Oh shit (sup), I guess I’ll pause for these bitches

6
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:59,797
Guess I’ll ball for these niggas, swear this my last three swishers

7
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:02,111
On my grown man shit I’m ‘bout to kill this bitches

8
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:04,563
Baby you know I got some money

9
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:07,395
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me

10
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:10,211
But when I look in your eyes

11
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:14,774
Baby you got everything money just can’t buy

12
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,285
All the things money can’t buy

13
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:20,362
All the things money can’t buy

14
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:22,289
All the things money can’t buy

15
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:23,940
All the things money can’t buy

16
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,176
Got a diamond in the back, sunroof top

17
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:30,233
Got a diamond on my hat and my sunroof off

18
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:32,800
Her mind strong but her body so soft

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,344
Tattoo on her hip read “Only for a Boss”

20
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,469
She ain’t impressed with the way I ball

21
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:41,503
She said “You seen one ghost, you seen ‘em all”

22
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:43,427
Even though that thing cold

23
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:48,631
She said “A Rolls Royce, you’re a Civic, Daddy I’mma roll with you”

24
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:53,768
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that’s how she do

25
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:56,231
I pulled up close and I tell her what’s true

26
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:59,601
Baby you know I got some money

27
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:02,331
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me

28
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,103
But when I look in your eyes

29
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:09,199
Baby you got everything money just can’t buy

30
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,369
All the things money can’t buy

31
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:14,301
All the things money can’t buy

32
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,762
All the things money can’t buy

33
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,937
All the things money can’t buy

34
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,248
Shawty where you at? Meet me at the mall

35
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:25,729
Told her “Let me buy you something”, she replied “Naw”

36
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,599
She said her love won’t be bought

37
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,587
I don’t need to spend some no money, spend some time that’s all

38
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:33,237
I told her “Daddy don’t mind spending”

39
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,398
I want to see you shine like the diamonds in my pendant

40
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:38,528
She told me she don’t care for the flash

41
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:43,940
Want affection not cash, girl I ain’t even mad at you

42
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,866
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that’s how she do

43
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:51,265
I pulled up close and I tell her what’s true

44
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:54,531
Baby you know I got some money

45
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:57,166
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me

46
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,888
But when I look in your eyes

47
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:04,895
Baby you got everything money just can’t buy

48
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:06,200
All the things money can’t buy

49
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,747
All the things money can’t buy

50
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:11,595
All the things money can’t buy

51
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:13,745
All the things money can’t buy

52
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,934
What’s happening with it baby? Hope you don’t think that I’m crazy

53
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:19,611
Say me and you, get us some practice makin' a baby

54
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:22,368
I will take some out the stash and buy you that new Mercedes

55
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,073
Then be all up in that ass in the back of that new Mercedes

56
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,922
You call for the protectin', yeah, send me your issues

57
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:30,812
They ain’t ‘bout to be playing with her, me and these pistols

58
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:33,319
See that thirty-six for D’Usse, I’m the provider

59
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,073
Come scoop me in that 458, you be the rider

60
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:39,250
(Yeah) Oh well, that’s that, back to the party

61
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,079
Bet you niggas anything I’m leaving here with shawty

62
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,246
Got a feeling that she fuckin’ with me for me

63
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,941
She got me feeling like I got a million on me

64
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,354
Baby you know I got some money

65
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,982
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me

66
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,840
But when I look in your eyes

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,636
Baby you got everything money just can’t buy

68
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,115
All the things money can’t buy

69
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,224
All the things money can’t buy

70
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,496
All the things money can’t buy

71
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,618
All the things money can’t buy
