Every grocery store, liquor store,

4
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,811
...has long lines out its doors...

5

KEVIN: Ahem.
-l mean, Kevin doesn't have a girlfriend.

77
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,157
He doesn't let these Jezebels

-All right, dear.
BENNY: That would be nasty.

Suit yourself.
Now, wait a minute, here.

l want you to play my number for me
on the way home, okay?

And don't let nobody copy them

88
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,584
-l won't.
-Those are my numbers.

89
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,655

Okay.

91
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:03,797
You know something? Last night l dreamt

92
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,898
You'll never guess who was driving
when the bus pulled up.

93
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,832
-Who?
-Jesus.

94
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:12,203
And l said, ''Jesus, what are
you doing driving this bus?''

95
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:14,237
-You know what he said to me?
-No, ma'am.

96
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:19,513
He said, ''Child, it's a recession.
Times is hard.''

97
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,678
-That's what he said.
-You didn't ask me...

98
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,582
...but how did Jesus get a license
without a birth certificate?

99
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:26,851
-lt makes no sense.
-Out. Go.

100
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,953

How in the hell do you get this gossip?

134
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,898
First of all, it's not gossip.

You know he's crazy.

There ain't nothing wrong with
Mr. Washington.

You need to stop treating people

That's why l'm here, right?

1334
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:19,266
Look, you know l can't even stand
Benny half the time...

1335
01:09:19,464 --> 01:09:22,203
...but he is not a thief, and you know it.

1336
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,337
lf anything, that boy is too loyal to you.

1337
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:29,511
You probably hurt his feelings,
and l personally think you acted like an ass.

1338
01:09:29,674 --> 01:09:31,677
-And you need to tell him you're sorry.
-What?

1339
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:32,979
That's the truth.

1340

MAN [ON TV]:
- Central Bank on Wednesday....

1341
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:38,452
What? You said you wanted me
to be honest, right?

1342
01:09:42,755 --> 01:09:44,758
KEVIN: Stacie.
-What's up?

1343
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:48,028
lf you won the lottery,
what would you do?

1344
01:09:48,526 --> 01:09:49,996
Me?

1345
01:09:50,495 --> 01:09:51,731

...take care of my family, travel...

1347

...finish school, all that good stuff.

1348
01:09:57,502 --> 01:10:00,374
But if l had your kind of money,
l'd give back.

1349
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:03,811
Give people something to live for
instead of just living, you know?

1350
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:10,286
Like, look at how some of these rappers
always talk about, ''Shout out to my 'hood.''

1351
01:10:10,449 --> 01:10:13,788
But what are they giving back
other than just shoutouts?

1352
01:10:13,952 --> 01:10:15,488
Thank you.

-But now l need you to tell me something.
-What's up?

1361
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,324
What happened on your little date
with Nikki Swayze?

1362
01:10:49,488 --> 01:10:52,060
Say ''l told you so.''
All she wanted to be was my baby mama.

1363
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:53,527
Wow, what?

1364
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:56,631
Nikki, the no-class, gold-digging bitch.

1365
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:58,498
l'm shocked.

1366
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:01,668
l mean, but at least
you got what you wanted:

1367
01:11:01,835 --> 01:11:03,537
To tell all your boys you hit that.

1368
01:11:03,702 --> 01:11:05,572
Because l didn't.

1369
01:11:05,738 --> 01:11:08,210
God on my mama,
l ain't touched that girl.

1370

Mm-hm.

1371

And besides...

1376
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,892
...that's not the kind of girl
l need anyway.

1377
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,831
Oh, really? Who is the kind
of girl you need, then?

1378
01:11:30,497 --> 01:11:32,233
Can l be honest?

1379
01:11:32,397 --> 01:11:34,635
Ain't that why you came here?

1380
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,210
The kind of girl l need is you.

1381
01:11:48,748 --> 01:11:50,852
Goodbye, Kevin. Goodbye.

in being your second choice.

How long have we known each other?

1385
01:11:57,191 --> 01:11:59,127
Why did it take you so long
to tell me this?

1386
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:02,064
Oh. After you and Nikki,
all of a sudden you wanna be with me?

1387
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:04,833
Why'd it take you so long?
l'm not that girl, okay?
