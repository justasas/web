1
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,560
I knew Harvey Dent.

2
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,890
I was his friend.

3
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,780
And it will be a very long time before

4
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,230
someone inspires us the way he did.

5
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,570
I believed in Harvey Dent.

6
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,430
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

7
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,640
He wasn't alone.

8
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,850
- Uh, you don't get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

9
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Don't worry, no charge for them.

10
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,650
And why would I want them?

11
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,980
They were trying to grab your prize.

12
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,820
They work for the mercenary.

13
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,860
The masked man.

14
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,900
- Bane?
- Aye.

15
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,660
Get them onboard. I'll call it in.

16
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,580
The flight plan I just
filed with the agency

17
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,960
lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here

18
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,340
but only one of you!

19
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,640
First one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft!

20
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,230
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,370
He didn't fly so good!

22
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,540
Who wants to try next?

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,120
Tell me about Bane!

24
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,790
Why does he wear the mask?

25
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,960
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

26
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,800
Well, perhaps he's wondering
why someone would shoot a man

27
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,090
before throwing him out of a plane.

28
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,770
At least you can talk.

29
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,060
Who are you?

30
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,690
It doesn't matter who we are.

31
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,310
What matters is our plan.

32
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,070
No one cared who I was
till I put on the mask.

33
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,660
If I pull that off, will you die?

34
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,000
It would be extremely painful.

35
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,330
You're a big guy.

36
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,710
For you.

37
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,880
Was getting caught part of your plan?

38
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,550
Of course.

39
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,020
Dr. Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours.

40
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,280
We had to find out what he told you...

41
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,690
Nothing. I said nothing.

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,620
Well, congratulations,
you got yourself caught!

43
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,210
- Sir?
- Now what's the next step of your master plan?

44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,790
Crashing this plane

45
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,630
with no survivors.

46
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,030
Mayday, Mayday!

47
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,460
Aah! What you doing to me? Let me out!

48
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,790
No!

49
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,090
No, no, no! No!

50
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,560
No! They expect one of us
in the wreckage, brother.

51
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,190
Have we started the fire?

52
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,940
Yes, the fire rises.

53
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,460
Calm down, doctor. Now
is not the time for fear.

54
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,830
That comes later.

55
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,240
Harvey Dent Day may not be
our oldest public holiday

56
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,450
but we're here tonight because
it's one of the most important.

57
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,750
Harvey Dent's uncompromising
stand against organized crime

58
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,450
had made Gotham a safer place

59
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,040
than it was at the time of
his death, eight years ago.

60
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,380
This city has seen a
historic turnaround.

61
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,130
No city is without crime,

62
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,610
but this city is without organized crime

63
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,510
because the Dent Act
gave law enforcement teeth

64
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,260
in its fight against the mob.

65
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,100
Now people are talking
about repealing the Dent Act

66
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,270
and to them I say, "Not on my watch."

67
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,520
I want to thank the Wayne
Foundation for hosting this event.

68
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,080
I'm told Mr. Wayne
couldn't be here tonight.

69
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,820
I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

70
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,740
And now I'm gonna give
way to an important voice

71
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,370
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?

72
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,240
No one has. Not in years.

73
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,840
people put their faith

74
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,290
in a murderous thug
in a mask and a cape.

75
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,000
A thug who showed his true nature

76
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,630
when he betrayed the
trust of this great man

77
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,300
and murdered him in cold blood.

78
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,380
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

79
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,550
- Shrimp balls?
- Thank you.

80
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,880
Jim Gordon can tell you
the truth about Harvey Dent.

81
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,180
I'll let him tell you himself.

82
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,810
Commissioner Gordon.

83
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,610
The truth?

84
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,830
I have

85
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,750
written a speech

86
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,750
telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

87
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,880
Maybe the time isn't right.

88
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,260
Maybe right now

89
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,450
all you need to know is that

90
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,520
there are 1000 inmates
in Blackgate Prison

91
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,020
as a direct result of the Dent Act.

92
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,050
These are violent criminals,

93
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,110
essential cogs in the
organized- crime machine.

94
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,490
Maybe, for now, all I should say

95
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,200
about the death of Harvey Dent is this:

96
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,700
It has not been for nothing.

97
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,970
You see the guy who owns the house?

98
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,360
No. I heard he never
leaves the east wing.

99
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,840
I heard he had an accident.

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,760
- Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a...
- Mr. Till?

101
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,640
Why are your people
using the main staircase?

102
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,140
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

103
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,020
Uh, she's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

104
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,390
The east drawing room.

105
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,350
Unlock the door, put
the tray on the table,

106
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,560
lock the door again. Nothing more.

107
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,990
I'm sorry, Miss Tate. I
tried, but he won't see you.

108
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,160
And you mustn't take it personally.

109
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,420
Everyone knows that
Wayne's holed up in there

110
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,160
with 8- inch nails
peeing into Mason jars.

111
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,710
It's very good of you
to let me on the grounds.

112
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,390
Why are you wasting your
time trying to talk to a man

113
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,020
who threw away your

114
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,270
investment on some
save- the- world vanity project?

115
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,690
He can't get your money back. I can.

116
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,920
I could try explaining

117
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,060
that a save- the- world
project,

118
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,450
vain or not is worth
investing in, Mr. Daggett.

119
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,780
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys

120
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,910
so why waste my time indeed?

121
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,950
Second shift reports in?

122
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,210
You should spend more
time with the mayor.

123
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,250
Well, that's your department.

124
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,040
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

125
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,140
He goes by his gut and it bothers him,

126
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,510
no matter what the numbers.

127
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,280
Must be popular with his wife.

128
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,550
Not really. She took
the kids to Cleveland.

129
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
He'll have plenty of time for visits.

130
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,930
The mayor's gonna
dump him in the spring.

131
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,640
Really?

132
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,690
- But he's a hero.
- A war hero. This is peacetime.

133
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,220
Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm so
terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

134
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,350
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

135
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,810
Although you don't
have the long nails or,

136
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,190
heh, the facial scars, sir.

137
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,190
Is that what they say about me?

138
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,450
It's just that no one ever sees you.

139
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,440
That's a beautiful necklace.

140
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,830
Reminds me of one that
belonged to my mother.

141
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,080
It can't be the same one

142
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,750
because her pearls are in this safe

143
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:03,590
the manufacturer clearly
explained is uncrackable.

144
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,980
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

145
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,150
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

146
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,770
Look, you wouldn't
beat up a woman any more

147
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,280
than I would beat up a cripple.

148
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,160
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

149
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

150
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,050
Can I have a ride?

151
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
You read my mind.

152
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,060
Let's go.

153
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,850
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.

154
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,650
She's very persistent.

155
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,150
And quite lovely, in
case you were wondering.

156
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,490
- I wasn't.
- What are you doing?

157
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,950
Examining print dust. We've been robbed.

158
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,070
And this is your idea of,
uh, sounding the alarm, is it?

159
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,410
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

160
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,870
- She?
- One of the maids.

161
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,660
Perhaps you should stop letting
them in this side of the house.

162
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,290
Perhaps you should start
learning to make your own bed.

163
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,380
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't.

164
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,720
She was.

165
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,060
Sir. Congressman Gilly's
wife has been calling in.

166
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,160
The congressman never made it home

167
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,100
after the Wayne Foundation event.

168
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,440
That's a job for the police?

169
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,440
When you and Dent cleaned the
streets, you cleaned them good.

170
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,400
Pretty soon we'll be chasing
down, uh, overdue library books.

171
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,320
And yet here you are,
like we're still at war.

172
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,540
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

173
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,500
You have something you want to ask me?

174
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,790
It's about that night.

175
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,090
This night, eight years
ago. The night Dent died.

176
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,210
The last confirmed
sighting of the Batman.

177
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,470
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams

178
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,390
breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?

179
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,180
I'm not hearing a question, son.

180
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,310
Don't you want to know who he was?

181
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,600
I know exactly who he was.

182
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,570
He was the Batman.

183
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,530
Let's go see about
the congressman's wife.

184
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,830
Master Wayne?

185
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,590
Master Wayne?

186
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,830
You haven't been down
here in a long time.

187
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,540
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

188
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,500
Unless she's lost a lot of weight

189
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,130
she was wearing someone
else's fingerprints.

190
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,420
She's good.

191
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,130
She may be, but we have
a trace on the necklace.

192
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,490
We do. I cross- referenced
the address she went back

193
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,680
to with police data on
high- end B- and- E's, and, um

194
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,930
Selina Kyle.

195
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,940
The databases are full of
close- calls, tips from fences.

196
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,110
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

197
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,030
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

198
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,410
She won't. She likes them too much.

199
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,370
And they weren't what she was after.

200
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,620
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

201
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,790
It was printer toner mixed
with graphite on the safe.

202
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,540
It gives a good pull
and it's untraceable.

203
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,540
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

204
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,000
You're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

205
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,720
At this point, I'd set
you up with a chimpanzee,

206
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,630
if it brought you back to the world.

207
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,050
There's nothing out there for me.

208
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,810
And that's the problem.

209
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,520
You hung up your cape and your
cowl but you didn't move on.

210
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,980
You never went to find
a life. To find someone.

211
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,520
Alfred

212
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,310
I did find someone.

213
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,900
I know, and you lost them.

214
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,030
But that's all part of living, sir.

215
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,500
But you're not living,
you're just waiting,

216
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,320
hoping for things to go bad again.

217
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,990
Remember when you left Gotham?

218
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Before all this, before Batman?

219
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,950
You were gone seven years.

220
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,710
Seven years I waited, hoping
that you wouldn't come back.

221
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,500
Every year, I took a
holiday. I went to Florence.

222
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,920
There's this cafe on
the banks of the Arno.

223
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,340
Every fine evening I'd sit
there and order a Fernet Branca.

224
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,390
I had this fantasy

225
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,180
that I would look across the tables

226
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,310
and I'd see you there, with a wife.

227
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,310
Maybe a couple of kids.

228
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,280
You wouldn't say anything
to me, nor me to you.

229
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,280
But we'd both know that you'd made it.

230
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,790
That you were happy.

231
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,380
I never wanted you to
come back to Gotham.

232
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,480
I always knew there was
nothing here for you,

233
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,050
except pain and tragedy.

234
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,090
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

235
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,430
I still do.

236
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,520
They wash up here a
couple of times a month.

237
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,150
More when it gets colder.

238
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,280
Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels.

239
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,680
We pulled him from the basin,

240
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,080
but other than that we didn't touch him.

241
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,080
- What?
- Name's Jimmy.

242
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,660
He's from St. Swithin's.

243
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,210
It's the boys' home
where I coach some ball.

244
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,710
Jimmy hadn't been around for months.

245
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,380
- No? Why?
- Blake, you know why.

246
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,770
He aged out. We don't

247
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,390
have the resources to
keep boys on after 16.

248
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,640
I thought the Wayne
Foundation gave money for that.

249
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,890
Not for the past couple of years.

250
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,900
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

251
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,070
I'd like to, if that's all right.

252
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,280
You know what he was
doing in the tunnels?

253
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,280
Lot of guys been going down
the tunnels when they age out.

254
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,660
Say you can live down there.

255
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,870
Say there's work down there.

256
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,540
Work?

257
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,500
What kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers?

258
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,300
More than you can find up here, I guess.

259
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,420
So you know about him?

260
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,840
Of course.

261
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,340
Do you think he's coming back?

262
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,850
I don't know.

263
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,240
You brought a date?

264
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,620
I like having someone
around to open doors for me.

265
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,750
Right hand. No partials.

266
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,130
Very nice.

267
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,010
Not so fast, handsome.

268
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,550
You got something for me?

269
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,630
Ah, yes.

270
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,310
I don't know what you're planning
to do with Mr. Wayne's prints,

271
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,280
but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

272
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,150
You don't count so good, huh?

273
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,570
I count fine.

274
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,160
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

275
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,660
Okay.

276
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,460
My friend's outside. Just hit "Send."

277
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,560
This place is a little dead.

278
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,980
It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.

279
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,690
Is everything okay?

280
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,860
Great. Catch you later.

281
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,240
It would have been a lot easier
to just give me what we agreed.

282
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,830
We can't have loose ends.

283
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,830
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.

284
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
No.

285
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,540
But my friend over there?

286
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,880
Every cop in the city's missing him.

287
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,380
That's cute.

288
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,260
But they're not gonna be
looking in a place like this.

289
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,350
I don't know. You did
just use his cell phone.

290
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,940
- Go!
- Go!

291
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,920
Police! Get down now!

292
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,340
Help me! Help me!

293
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,550
Help me, please! Please help me!

294
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,350
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

295
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,070
Call me?

296
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,320
- You okay, miss?
- He's bleeding. You gotta help him.

297
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,700
I got the congressman.

298
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,940
Clear!

299
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,030
Manhole! Get this up!
Get the DWP down here!

300
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,540
You three, down with me.

301
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,120
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

302
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,140
What, they went down there?

303
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,240
We're gonna go down there, right?

304
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,760
That was a gas explosion, kid.

305
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,170
Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.

306
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,180
No one goes in till
we know what's there.

307
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,180
We know, sir. The police commissioner.

308
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,180
Someone get this hothead out of here?

309
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,850
And where's that DWP guy?

310
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,440
Why are you here?

311
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,770
Answer him.

312
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,360
I was asking you.

313
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,280
It's the police commissioner.

314
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,540
And you brought him down here?

315
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,790
- We didn't know what to do.
- You panicked.

316
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,290
And your weakness has cost
the lives of three others.

317
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,590
No, he's alone.

318
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,010
Search him.

319
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,720
Then I will kill you.

320
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,170
- He's dead.
- So show me his body.

321
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,750
The water runs to any one of the
outflows. We'd never find him.

322
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,970
- Follow him!
- Follow him?

323
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,530
You okay? You okay?

324
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,620
Hey, hey, you awake?

325
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,870
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

326
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't
take unscheduled calls.

327
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,460
Even from a police officer.

328
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,920
And if I go get a warrant

329
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,300
for the investigation
of Harvey Dent's murder?

330
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,680
That still count as unscheduled?

331
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,890
What can I do for you, officer?

332
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,310
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

333
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,690
He chased a gunman down into the sewers.

334
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,190
When I pulled him out, he was
babbling about an underground army.

335
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,190
A masked man called Bane.

336
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,360
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?

337
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,620
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

338
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,790
He needs you.

339
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,660
He needs the Batman.

340
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,340
If Commissioner Gordon thinks...

341
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,210
he doesn't know or care who you are.

342
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,960
But we've met before.

343
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,220
It was a long time ago. I
was a kid. Uh, St. Swithin's.

344
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,600
It used to be funded by the Wayne
Foundation. It's an orphanage.

345
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,070
My mom died when I was small.

346
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,690
It was a car accident, I
don't really remember it.

347
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:39,490
But my dad got shot a couple
years later over a gambling debt

348
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,990
and I remember that one just fine.

349
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,240
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

350
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,960
To be angry in your bones.

351
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,670
I mean, they understand.

352
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,670
Foster parents.

353
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Everybody understands

354
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,630
for a while.

355
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,260
And then they want the angry little kid

356
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,100
to do something he knows he can't do.

357
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,760
Move on.

358
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,310
So after a while, they
stop understanding.

359
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,350
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

360
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,520
I figured it out too late. You
gotta learn to hide the anger.

361
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,570
Practice smiling in a mirror.

362
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,900
It's like putting on a mask.

363
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,700
So you showed up this
one day, in a cool car.

364
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,700
Pretty girl on your arm.

365
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,580
We were so excited.

366
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,460
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

367
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,670
I mean, we used to make up
stories about you, man. Legends.

368
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,610
And, you know, with the other kids,

369
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,630
that's all it was, just stories, but

370
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,510
Right when I saw you, I
knew who you really were.

371
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,770
I'd seen that look on your face before.

372
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,940
It's the same one I taught myself.

373
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,770
I don't know why you took
the fall for Dent's murder

374
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,690
but I'm still a believer in the Batman

375
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,200
even if you're not.

376
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,860
Why did you say that your boys'

377
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,830
home used to be funded
by the Wayne Foundation?

378
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,750
Because the money stopped.

379
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,960
Might be time to get some fresh air.

380
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,130
Start paying attention to the details.

381
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,380
Some of those details
might need your help.

382
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,510
You check that name? Bane?

383
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,340
He's a mercenary. No other known names.

384
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,970
Him and his men were
behind a coup in West Africa

385
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,640
that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

386
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,150
- Now Daggett's brought them here.
- Or so it seems.

387
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,360
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

388
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,700
Alfred, why did the Wayne

389
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,780
Foundation stop funding
boys' homes in the city?

390
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:57,040
The foundation is funded by the
profits of Wayne Enterprises.

391
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,920
There have to be some.

392
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,420
- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get him on the phone.

393
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,590
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

394
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,630
Yes. One or two.

395
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I need an appointment at
the hospital for my leg.

396
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,720
- Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

397
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,900
- I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
- That's good.

398
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,570
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

399
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,070
And not much of any use in
your elbows or your shoulders.

400
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,610
Between that and the scar
tissue on your kidneys

401
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,450
the residual concussive
damage to your brain tissue

402
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,290
and the general scarred- over
quality of your body

403
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,370
- I cannot recommend that
you go heli- skiing. - Right.

404
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,350
We were in this together

405
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,020
then you were gone.

406
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,310
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.

407
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,610
- We won.
- Based on a lie.

408
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:13,120
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.

409
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,790
The Batman has to come back.

410
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,410
What if he doesn't exist anymore?

411
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,040
He must.

412
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,600
You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?

413
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,640
- You f... You took my wallet!
- No, I

414
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,560
- Get out.
- She took my... Ah!

415
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,320
- Now.
- Creep!

416
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,120
I don't know what he's so upset about.

417
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,400
There's only 60 bucks in here.

418
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,320
Probably the watch.

419
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,630
Who's that?

420
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,920
A stiff can barely climb
out of his sports car.

421
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,220
- No, that's Bruce Wayne!
- Mr. Wayne, over here!

422
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,640
I'm not sure if my assistant...
- Right through here.

423
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,310
Thank you so much.

424
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,360
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.

425
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,280
Miss Tate, isn't it?

426
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,330
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

427
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,160
The proceeds go to the big fat
spread. It's not about charity.

428
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,670
It's about feeding the ego of
whichever society hag laid this on.

429
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,590
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

430
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,310
And the proceeds will
go where they should,

431
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,930
because I paid for the
big fat spread myself.

432
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,720
That's very generous of you.

433
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,810
You have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world.

434
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,730
Take our clean- energy project.

435
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,900
Sometimes the investment
doesn't pay off.

436
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,360
- I'm sorry.
- You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

437
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,480
But a man who doesn't care about

438
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,660
the world doesn't spend
half his fortune to save it.

439
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,660
And isn't so wounded when it fails

440
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,710
that he goes into hiding.

441
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,250
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

442
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,960
Mind if I cut in?

443
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,880
Thank you.

444
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,280
You don't seem happy to see me.

445
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,930
You were supposed to be a shut- in.

446
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,980
I felt like some fresh air.

447
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,890
Why didn't you call the police?

448
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,900
I have a powerful friend who
deals with things like this.

449
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,360
That's a brazen costume
for a cat burglar.

450
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,490
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

451
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,370
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

452
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,450
- Who's your date?
- His wife's in Ibiza.

453
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,420
She left her diamonds behind,
though. Worried they might get stolen.

454
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,630
It's pronounced "Ibiza."

455
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,610
You wouldn't want these folks

456
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,880
realizing you're a crook,
not a social climber.

457
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,180
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

458
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,180
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

459
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,060
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.

460
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,900
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
here from your walk- up in Old Town.

461
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,900
A modest place for a master jewel thief.

462
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,360
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement

463
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,070
or you're in deep with the wrong people.

464
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,960
You don't get to judge me because

465
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,370
you were born in the master
bedroom of Wayne Manor.

466
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,900
Actually, I was born
in the Regency Room.

467
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,870
I started out doing what I had to.

468
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,590
Once you've done what you had to,

469
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,420
they never let you do what you want to.

470
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,840
Start fresh.

471
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,220
Ugh. There's no fresh
start in today's world.

472
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,430
Any 12- year- old with a cell
phone could find out what you did.

473
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,390
Everything we do is collated and
quantified. Everything sticks.

474
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,970
Is that how you justify stealing?

475
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,730
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

476
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,190
I don't stand on the
shoulders of people with less.

477
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,400
Robin Hood?

478
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,330
I think I'd do more to help someone

479
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,690
than most of the people
in this room. Than you.

480
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,740
You think maybe you're
assuming a little too much?

481
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,580
Maybe you're being unrealistic about

482
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,950
what's really in your pants
other than your wallet.

483
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,160
Ouch.

484
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,750
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

485
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,690
You and your friends better
batten down the hatches,

486
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,880
because when it hits you're all
gonna wonder how you ever thought

487
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,410
you could live so large

488
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,890
and leave so little for the rest of us.

489
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,680
You sound like you're
looking forward to it.

490
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,690
I'm adaptable.

491
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,110
Those pearls do look better on
you than they did in my safe.

492
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,070
But I still can't let you keep them.

493
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,910
You... You scared her off!

494
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,370
Not likely.

495
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,880
Must have lost my ticket.

496
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,800
- Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
- My wife?

497
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,270
Just you, sir?

498
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,350
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

499
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,150
Takes a little time to get
back in the swing of things.

500
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,570
Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe.

501
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,740
What brings you out of
cryo- sleep, Mr. Wayne?

502
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,660
You haven't lost your sense of humor.

503
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,330
Even if you have lost most of my money.

504
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,000
Actually, you did that.

505
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,880
If you funnel your entire R and D budget

506
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,960
into a fusion project
that you then mothball

507
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,470
your company is unlikely to thrive.

508
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,670
What are my options?

509
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,220
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine

510
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,930
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

511
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,060
Well, then sit tight.

512
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,480
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay while

513
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,780
we figure out a future

514
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,100
for the energy program
with Miranda Tate.

515
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,900
She has supported the
project all the way.

516
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,490
She's smart. And quite lovely.

517
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,530
We all just want what's
best for you, Bruce.

518
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,030
Show her the machine.

519
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,250
I'll think it over.

520
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,750
Anything else?

521
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,170
Nope. Why?

522
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,380
These conversations used to
end with an unusual request.

523
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,550
I retired.

524
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,930
Mm- hm. Well, let me show
you some stuff anyway.

525
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,560
Just for old times' sake.

526
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,060
I figured you'd have
shut this place down.

527
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,900
Oh, it was always shut down, officially.

528
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,150
All this new stuff.

529
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,960
After your father died, Wayne

530
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,950
Enterprises set up 14
different defense subsidiaries.

531
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,780
For years, I've been
shuttering and consolidating

532
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,330
all the different
prototypes under one roof.

533
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,200
- My roof.
- Why?

534
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,170
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

535
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,420
Oh, now you're just showing off.

536
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,510
Defense Department projects

537
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,220
for tight geometry urban pacification.

538
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,230
Rotors are configured to

539
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,310
maneuver between buildings
without recirculation.

540
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,270
What's it called?

541
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:42,110
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.

542
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,650
I just took to calling it the Bat.

543
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,200
And, yes, Mr. Wayne,
it does come in black.

544
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,950
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

545
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,330
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

546
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,870
Better mind?

547
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,420
Well, I was trying to be modest.

548
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,710
A less busy mind.

549
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,420
Yours.

550
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,430
- Is it really painful?
- You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

551
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,310
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

552
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,850
Not bad.

553
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,320
Not bad at all.

554
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,910
If you're seriously
considering going back out there

555
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,200
you should hear the
rumors surrounding Bane.

556
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,410
I'm all ears.

557
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,420
There is a prison in a more
ancient part of the world.

558
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,800
A pit where men are
thrown to suffer and die.

559
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,720
But sometimes a man
rises from the darkness.

560
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,100
Sometimes the pit sends something back.

561
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,390
- Bane.
- Bane.

562
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,730
Born and raised in hell on earth.

563
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,820
- Born in a prison?
- No one knows why, or how he escaped.

564
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,570
But they do know that once he did

565
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,910
he was trained by Ra's
Al Ghul, your mentor.

566
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,080
Bane was a member of
the League of Shadows?

567
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,410
And then he was excommunicated.

568
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,220
And any man who is too extreme

569
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,580
for Ra's Al Ghul is
not to be trifled with.

570
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,000
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

571
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,920
That was then.

572
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,180
And you can strap up your
leg and put your mask back on

573
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,930
but that doesn't make you what you were.

574
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,090
If this man is everything
that you say he is,

575
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,720
then the city needs me.

576
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,850
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

577
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,150
Your resources. Your knowledge.

578
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,400
It doesn't need your body, or your life.

579
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,360
That time's past.

580
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,910
You're afraid that if I go
back out there, I'll fail.

581
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,320
No.

582
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,790
I'm afraid that you want to.

583
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,470
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

584
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,220
Wayne coming back is change.

585
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,480
- Change is either good or bad.
- I vote bad.

586
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,930
On what basis?

587
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,640
I flipped a coin.

588
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,690
It says rye... I said no rye, man.

589
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,070
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.

590
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,040
Come on. Let's go scalping.

591
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,520
Come on.

592
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,460
Everybody down, now!

593
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,480
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

594
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,030
Really? Then why are you people here?

595
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,540
Everybody,

596
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,250
stay back! Go down to
the end of the block!

597
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,380
We have an emergency situation!

598
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,260
You gotta get in there!

599
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,010
This is a hostage situation.

600
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,210
No, this is a robbery.

601
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,600
They have direct access
to the online trading desk.

602
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,560
I'm not risking my men for your money.

603
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,150
We have to ask you to
move. We have a situation.

604
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,360
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

605
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,610
Really? Mine's in my mattress.

606
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,230
You don't put these guys down,

607
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,280
that stuffing in your mattress
might be worth a whole lot less.

608
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,700
Cut the fiber cable and
take out that cell tower.

609
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,370
- Thank you.
- That'll slow them down.

610
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,080
Move back!

611
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,920
All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!

612
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,000
They cut the fiber.

613
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,260
Cell's working.

614
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,760
For now.

615
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,180
Get all these barriers
up. All of them up.

616
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,100
No one gets in or out
of any of these streets.

617
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,890
Where am I supposed to move it?

618
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,350
Back it up.

619
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,150
All right, just stay
in your vehicle, okay?

620
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,120
How much longer does the program need?

621
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,870
Eight minutes.

622
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,710
Time to go mobile.

623
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,210
Everybody, up!

624
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,840
You two, move!

625
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,970
Thank you.

626
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,390
Steady.

627
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,480
Steady.

628
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,450
I've got something.

629
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,080
Hold your fire, they've got hostages.

630
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,500
Hold your fire!

631
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,970
Go, go!

632
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,350
Please! Just let me go!

633
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,310
Hey, please! Hey!

634
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,740
Shoot the tires.

635
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,360
There's no shot.

636
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,910
Now back off. Back off,
they've got hostages.

637
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,040
P.D. Are pursuing the four suspects through
downtown in response to a hostage situation.

638
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,210
What's going on with the lights?

639
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,600
It can't be.

640
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,140
What the hell was that?

641
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,140
Oh, boy, you are in
for a show tonight, son.

642
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,650
Please! Help, help, help!

643
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,540
Sorry.

644
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,460
Put that thing away before
you hurt yourself. Get in!

645
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:49,760
Let's go. You, get in the car.
They've spotted the Batman.

646
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,190
Call everyone in. Every car
patrol, beat cop, off- duty too.

647
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,070
Pull them in now. I'm gonna
do what Jim Gordon never could.

648
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,450
- What's that?
- I'm gonna take down the Batman.

649
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,660
four suspects are carrying two hostages

650
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,870
kidnapped from the
Gotham Stock Exchange.

651
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,660
Reports from the eyewitnesses...

652
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,330
Scott, dead center of your screen.

653
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,920
- What do you see?
- I see Batman.

654
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,980
Hard to believe,

655
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,960
but the suspects are now
being pursued by what appears

656
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,880
to be the Batman.

657
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,130
Well, what do you know?

658
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,260
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

659
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,640
Please! Just let me go! Please!

660
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,780
One bike's pulled off. No
hostage. Should we pursue?

661
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,870
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

662
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,580
- He's getting away.
- Who do you wanna catch?

663
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,300
Some robber, or the son of a
bitch who killed Harvey Dent?

664
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,010
...the entire upper west hill...

665
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,220
Central Heights and
East Park Side areas.

666
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,310
Eight years, and he has to pick tonight.

667
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,730
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

668
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,530
Please! Just let me go!

669
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,070
Please!

670
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,730
We lost him.

671
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,650
How could you lose him?

672
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,410
He's got a lot of firepower.

673
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:58,660
What, and you don't?

674
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,200
He's heading back downtown.

675
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,420
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

676
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,630
Close it off, gentlemen.

677
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,450
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.

678
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,750
You might have the
wrong animal there, sir.

679
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,310
You sure it was him?

680
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,570
Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.

681
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,360
What about the men they arrested?

682
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:21,610
He said, and I quote, "They
would die before talking."

683
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,120
Where does he find these guys?

684
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,450
Open the champagne.

685
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,000
And can we get some girls in here?

686
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:34,590
Careful what you wish for.

687
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,930
Cat got your tongue?

688
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,310
You dumb bitch.

689
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,560
Nobody ever accused me of being dumb.

690
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,650
You're dumb for coming here tonight.

691
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,730
I want what you owe me.

692
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,490
Want doesn't get.

693
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,030
Nice outfit. Those heels
make it tough to walk?

694
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,410
I don't know.

695
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,410
Do they?

696
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,330
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

697
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,870
The program. The "Clean slate."

698
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,340
The ultimate tool for a
master thief with a record.

699
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,630
Hold it right there!

700
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,190
Where is it?

701
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,310
The clean slate?

702
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,110
Where you type in someone's
name, date of birth

703
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,450
in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?

704
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,780
- Sound a little too good to be true?
- You're lying!

705
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,540
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.

706
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,660
That's why I bought them.

707
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,460
But they had nothing.

708
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,580
It was a gangland myth.

709
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,100
Stay back!

710
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,100
I'm not bluffing!

711
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,400
They know.

712
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,230
They just don't care.

713
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,870
You've gotta be kidding me.

714
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,590
- No guns. No killing.
- Where's the fun in that?

715
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,520
My mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men.

716
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:02,730
This isn't a car.

717
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,450
See you around.

718
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,580
You're welcome.

719
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,330
I had it under control.

720
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,830
Those weren't street thugs.

721
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,080
They were trained killers.

722
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,920
I saved your life.

723
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,830
In return, I need to know

724
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,880
what you did with Bruce
Wayne's fingerprints.

725
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,590
Wayne wasn't kidding
about a powerful friend.

726
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,690
I sold his prints to
Daggett for something

727
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,060
that doesn't even exist.

728
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,450
I doubt many people
get the better of you.

729
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,060
Hey, when a girl's desperate

730
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,570
- What's he gonna do with them?
- I don't know

731
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,050
but Daggett seemed pretty

732
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:29,110
interested in that mess
at the stock market.

733
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,830
Miss Kyle?

734
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,960
So that's what that feels like.

735
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,060
I see from the television coverage

736
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,810
that you got your taste
for wanton destruction back.

737
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,940
I retrieved this.

738
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,570
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?

739
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,530
They don't have the tools to analyze it.

740
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,160
They would if you gave them to them.

741
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,820
One man's tool is another man's weapon.

742
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,920
In your mind, perhaps.

743
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,330
But there aren't many things
you can't turn into a weapon.

744
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,620
Alfred, enough. The police
weren't getting it done.

745
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,980
Perhaps they might have

746
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,170
if you hadn't made a
sideshow of yourself.

747
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,020
You thought I didn't have it in me.

748
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,130
You led a bloated
police force on a chase

749
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,880
with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

750
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,890
What about when you come
up against him? What then?

751
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:37,120
I'll fight harder. I always have.

752
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,850
Look. His speed, his
ferocity, his training.

753
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,680
I see the power of belief.

754
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,770
I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

755
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,400
You said he was excommunicated.

756
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,440
By Ra's Al Ghul.

757
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,570
Who leads them now?

758
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,320
Ra's Al Ghul was the League
of Shadows and I beat him.

759
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,240
Bane is a mercenary. We need
to find out what he's up to.

760
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,990
Trades of some kind. Coded.

761
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:04,620
And my fingerprint,
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

762
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:05,870
Get this to Fox.

763
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,450
He can crack the code

764
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,380
and tell us what trades
they were executing.

765
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,720
I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more.

766
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,930
I've sewn you up, I've set your
bones, but I won't bury you.

767
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,480
I've buried enough members
of the Wayne family.

768
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:32,610
- You'll leave me?
- You see only one end to your journey.

769
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:37,660
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

770
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,450
You're not Batman anymore.
You have to find another way.

771
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,510
You used to talk about finishing,

772
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,580
about a life beyond that awful cave.

773
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:49,460
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.

774
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:53,510
That was my life beyond the
cave. I can't just move on.

775
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,800
She... She didn't. She couldn't.

776
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,010
What if she had?

777
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,640
She... I can't change that.

778
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,810
What if before she
died she wrote a letter

779
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,440
saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?

780
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:16,070
And what if to spare you pain,

781
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,780
I burnt that letter?

782
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,830
How dare you use Rachel
to try to stop me?

783
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,460
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

784
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,530
Maybe it's time we all stopped
trying to outsmart the truth

785
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,000
and let it have its day.

786
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:37,760
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

787
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,640
You expect to destroy my world

788
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:45,390
and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

789
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,230
No, no, no.

790
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,560
I know what this means.

791
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:51,810
What does it mean?

792
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,400
It means your hatred.

793
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:59,690
And it also means losing
someone that I have cared

794
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:05,660
for since I first heard his
cries echo through this house.

795
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,250
But it might also mean saving your life.

796
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,960
And that is more important.

797
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,220
Goodbye, Alfred.

798
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,200
Alfred?

799
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,000
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

800
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,710
Page three.

801
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,740
Seems you made a series of

802
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,250
large put options on
the futures exchange

803
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,710
verified by thumbprint.

804
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,550
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

805
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,300
Long- term, we may be
able to prove fraud.

806
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,760
But for now, you're completely broke

807
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,210
and Wayne Enterprises is

808
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,350
about to fall into the
hands of John Daggett.

809
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,230
The weapons.

810
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,350
We can't let Daggett get his
hands on Applied Sciences.

811
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,480
Applied Sciences is all
locked up and off the books.

812
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:19,860
The energy project, however,
is a different story.

813
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,530
Miranda Tate.

814
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,550
Let's convince the
board to get behind her.

815
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,820
Let's show her the reactor.

816
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:29,490
We're meeting her there in 35
minutes, so you better get dressed.

817
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:33,370
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

818
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,540
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

819
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,720
Please keep hands and feet
inside the car at all times.

820
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,100
This is it, isn't it?

821
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,270
The reactor is beneath the river

822
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,210
so it can be instantly

823
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:57,560
flooded in the event
of a security breach.

824
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:01,190
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

825
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,650
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

826
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,460
I thought you might like to
see what your investment built.

827
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,290
No fossil fuels.

828
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,040
Free clean energy for an entire city.

829
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,760
Three years ago, a Russian
scientist published a paper

830
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,220
on weaponized fusion reactions.

831
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:29,300
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

832
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,180
I think this machine works.

833
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,300
Miranda, if it were operational,

834
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,980
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

835
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,360
Would it make you feel better to know

836
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,200
that the Russian scientist died
in a plane crash six months ago?

837
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,870
Someone will work out
what Dr. Pavel did.

838
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,360
Someone will figure out a way

839
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,210
to make this power source
into a nuclear weapon.

840
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:02,630
I need you to take control of
Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.

841
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,170
To do what with it?

842
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,840
Nothing.

843
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,550
Until we can guarantee its safety.

844
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,930
And if we can't?

845
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,760
Decommission it. Flood it.

846
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:15,730
Destroy the world's best
chance for a sustainable future?

847
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,520
If the world's not ready, yes.

848
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,060
Bruce, if you want to save the world,

849
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,980
you have to start trusting it.

850
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,730
I'm trusting you.

851
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,860
Doesn't count. You have no choice.

852
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,950
I could have flooded
this chamber at any time.

853
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,160
I'm choosing to trust you.

854
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,240
Please.

855
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,420
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

856
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,590
This meeting will now come to order.

857
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,920
I'd like to point out that we
have a non- board member here

858
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,450
which is highly irregular,

859
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,430
even if his family
name is above the door.

860
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,850
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

861
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,770
And he himself has run it.

862
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,580
Into the ground, sir!
Does anybody disagree?

863
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,690
Check the share price this morning.

864
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,110
Crazy gambling on futures has
not only cost Mr. Wayne his seat

865
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,570
it's cost us all a lot of money.

866
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,570
And he has to go.

867
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,450
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

868
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,540
Now, back to business.

869
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,270
Mr. Wayne, over here!

870
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:26,460
How's it feel to be one of the people?

871
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,400
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car!

872
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,680
I didn't know what to
do, they had paperwork.

873
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,140
Looks like you need a ride, huh?

874
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,520
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

875
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,470
How the hell did Miranda Tate

876
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,980
get the inside track on the Wayne board?

877
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,310
She been meeting with
him? Sleeping with him?

878
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,440
- Not that we know of.
- You don't know much of anything, do you?

879
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,530
- Where's Bane?
- We told him it was urgent.

880
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,320
- Where is that masked...?
- Speak of the devil

881
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,740
and he shall appear.

882
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,370
What the hell is going on?

883
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:00,370
- The plan is proceeding as expected.
- Oh, really?

884
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,330
Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

885
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:08,170
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.

886
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,810
And now you have my construction crews

887
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,470
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

888
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:18,560
How exactly is that supposed to
help my company absorb Wayne's?

889
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,520
- Leave us.
- No. You stay here.

890
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:25,270
I'm in charge.

891
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,440
Do you feel in charge?

892
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,240
I've paid you a small fortune.

893
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:38,370
And this gives you power over me?

894
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,370
What is this?

895
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:45,500
Your money and infrastructure
have been important

896
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,000
till now.

897
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,630
What are you?

898
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,630
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

899
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,680
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.

900
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,850
You're pure evil.

901
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,310
I'm necessary evil.

902
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,390
No. No, no, no!

903
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,440
When you started, why the mask?

904
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,110
To protect the people closest to me.

905
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,280
But you were a loner, right?

906
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:14,730
You didn't have any family?

907
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,570
There are always people you care about.

908
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,660
You just don't realize how
much until they're gone.

909
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,960
The idea was to be a symbol.

910
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,250
Batman could be anybody.

911
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,340
That was the point.

912
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,920
- Well, it was damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

913
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,130
They'll figure that out in the end.

914
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,340
You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

915
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:41,100
Yeah. I got 500 pages of
tunnel records and a flashlight.

916
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,350
I could use some help, actually.

917
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,230
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.

918
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,440
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!

919
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:53,780
- That's the way this works!
- I don't think so!

920
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,200
- That is the way...
- He's not a mark.

921
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,030
And he doesn't have a
cent to his name, anyway.

922
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:03,830
Yeah, it's not much. But it's
more than you've got right now.

923
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,410
Actually, they're
letting me keep the house.

924
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,170
The rich don't even go broke
the same as the rest of us, huh?

925
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,300
My powerful friend might hope to
change your mind about leaving.

926
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:16,090
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

927
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,930
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

928
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,350
He wants to meet tonight.

929
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,560
Why?

930
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,640
He needs to find Bane.
Says you'd know how.

931
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,190
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay.

932
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,230
I like your place.

933
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,820
Mr. Wayne?

934
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,700
I'm sorry they took all your money.

935
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,080
No, you're not.

936
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,000
- Can we help you, officer?
- Uh, yeah.

937
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,400
John Daggett's body was

938
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,710
just found in a Dumpster
about an hour ago.

939
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,840
- Thought you might want to know.
- Why?

940
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,510
His name's all over these
permits I just pulled to,

941
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,130
uh, map the tunnels under Gotham.

942
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,790
That's MTA maintenance, uh,

943
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,180
sewer construction,
couple of other things.

944
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,350
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

945
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,390
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.

946
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,730
We've had teams down
there. It's a huge network.

947
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,230
Well, get more men. Work
a grid. I want him found.

948
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,730
Yeah, the, uh, masked man. We're on it.

949
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,650
Lose the uniform, you're
working for me now.

950
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,240
We could use some
hotter heads around here.

951
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,770
Sir, that could also be a coincidence.

952
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,540
You're a detective now, son.

953
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,830
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore.

954
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:41,550
Nobody's answering.

955
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,090
No.

956
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,930
I'm on my own now.

957
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,180
Do you have keys?

958
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,560
Never needed them.

959
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,980
Hope you didn't like me for my money.

960
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,320
Suffering builds character.

961
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,910
I'll take care of your
parents' legacy, Bruce.

962
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,420
Who's this?

963
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,590
Where's Alfred?

964
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:25,760
He left

965
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,390
taking everything.

966
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:54,750
What's that?

967
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,840
My power's been shut off.

968
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,800
You're good at that.

969
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:08,850
When I was a child,
we had almost nothing.

970
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:13,810
But on the nights when we had a
fire, we felt very rich indeed.

971
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:18,610
I assumed your family was wealthy.

972
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,900
Not always.

973
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,440
Not when I was young.

974
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:25,950
An old mistake.

975
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:28,950
I've made a few myself.

976
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,830
More than a few.

977
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,580
We could leave.

978
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,130
Tonight.

979
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,050
Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted.

980
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,630
Someday, perhaps.

981
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,050
Not tonight.

982
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,080
Don't be shy.

983
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,670
Wayne says you can
get me the clean slate.

984
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,760
- That depends.
- On what?

985
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,550
On what you want it for.

986
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,640
I acquired it to keep it
out of the wrong hands.

987
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:33,180
Still don't trust me, huh?

988
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:36,350
How can we change that?

989
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,310
Start by taking me to Bane.

990
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,940
You asked.

991
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,280
From here, Bane's men
patrol the tunnels.

992
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,070
And they're not your average brawlers.

993
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,080
Neither am I.

994
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,960
- He's behind you.
- Who?

995
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,170
Me.

996
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,300
What do you think you're...?

997
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,650
Just a little further.

998
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:33,410
I had to find a way to
stop them trying to kill me.

999
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,990
You made a serious mistake.

1000
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:41,500
Not as serious as yours, I fear.

1001
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,210
Bane.

1002
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:49,470
Let's not stand on ceremony here

1003
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,050
Mr. Wayne.

1004
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,440
Peace has cost you your strength.

1005
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,440
Victory has defeated you.

1006
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:15,840
Theatricality and deception,
powerful agents to the uninitiated.

1007
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:18,810
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?

1008
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,560
Members of the League of Shadows.

1009
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,940
And you betrayed us.

1010
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:33,400
"Us"? You were excommunicated
by a gang of psychopaths.

1011
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:40,790
I am the League of Shadows.

1012
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:44,080
And I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

1013
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,720
You fight like a younger man.

1014
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:02,180
Nothing held back.

1015
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:05,560
Admirable, but mistaken.

1016
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:13,570
Oh, you think darkness is your ally?

1017
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,450
But you merely adopted the dark.

1018
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,160
I was born in it.

1019
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,870
Molded by it.

1020
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,120
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

1021
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:29,540
By then, it was nothing
to me but blinding!

1022
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:36,510
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

1023
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:45,100
I will show you where
I have made my home

1024
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:48,600
whilst preparing to bring justice.

1025
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:53,020
Then I will break you.

1026
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,660
Your precious armory.

1027
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,660
Gratefully accepted. We will need it.

1028
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:20,180
Ah, yes. I was wondering
what would break first.

1029
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,720
Your spirit

1030
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,860
or your body.

1031
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,030
Get me Commissioner Gordon.

1032
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,990
I got a line on the
congressman's kidnapping.

1033
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,250
- Excuse me, miss.
- Uh, yes?

1034
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:37,590
I'm gonna need to see your
ticket and identification, please.

1035
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,800
Oh. Do you mind?

1036
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,730
I showed your picture to
the congressman. Guess what.

1037
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:58,570
Don't tell me. Still in love?

1038
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,280
Oh, head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.

1039
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,200
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.

1040
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,330
- Girl's gotta eat.
- And you have an appetite.

1041
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,910
Why would you run? You can't
hide with a record like this.

1042
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,120
Maybe it's not you I'm running from.

1043
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:16,170
Who then? Bane?

1044
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,790
What do you know about him?

1045
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,300
That you should be as
afraid of him as I am.

1046
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:24,340
We can offer you protection.

1047
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,680
Okay.

1048
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:34,660
When I spotted you, I was

1049
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,850
looking for a friend
of mine. Bruce Wayne.

1050
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:41,230
Did they kill him?

1051
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,610
I'm not sure.

1052
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,050
Why didn't you just

1053
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,220
kill me?

1054
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:12,850
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

1055
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:16,140
Your punishment must be more severe.

1056
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,480
Torture?

1057
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:19,900
Yes.

1058
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,730
But not of your body.

1059
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,860
Of your soul.

1060
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,450
Where am I?

1061
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:32,030
Home.

1062
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:35,910
Where I learned the truth about despair.

1063
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,250
As will you.

1064
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,460
There is a reason why this
prison is the worst hell on earth:

1065
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,630
Hope.

1066
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,930
Every man who has rotted
here over the centuries

1067
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:51,510
has looked up to the light and
imagined climbing to freedom.

1068
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,100
So easy. So simple.

1069
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,900
And like shipwrecked men

1070
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,650
turning to seawater from
uncontrollable thirst

1071
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,690
many have died trying.

1072
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:11,280
I learned here there can be
no true despair without hope.

1073
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,830
So as I terrorize Gotham

1074
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,960
I will feed its people
hope to poison their souls.

1075
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,920
I will let them believe
that they can survive

1076
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:25,390
so that you can watch them

1077
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:29,050
clambering over each
other to stay in the sun.

1078
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:35,010
You can watch me torture an entire city.

1079
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:39,310
And then when you have truly
understood the depth of your failure

1080
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,560
we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

1081
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:48,150
We will destroy Gotham.

1082
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,910
And then, when it is done

1083
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,200
and Gotham is ashes

1084
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,630
then you have my permission to die.

1085
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,440
You're locking her up in here?

1086
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,440
The Dent Act allows non- segregation
based on extraordinary need.

1087
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:28,690
First time she broke out of
women's correctional, she was 16.

1088
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,030
Little closer, baby.

1089
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,280
Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?

1090
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,370
She's gonna be fine.

1091
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,450
I still don't see the need

1092
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,410
of a board meeting
for the energy project.

1093
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,160
Bruce got a lot of things right.

1094
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:43,830
Keeping the board in the
dark was not one of them.

1095
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,880
How good of you to join us.

1096
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,220
Chair. President.

1097
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:55,050
All I need now is one
more ordinary board member.

1098
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:58,640
Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?

1099
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:00,060
No.

1100
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,730
I will volunteer.

1101
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:03,810
Where are you taking us?

1102
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:17,280
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?

1103
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,660
What happened?

1104
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:20,950
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

1105
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,040
He let most of them go, but
he took three into the sewers.

1106
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:26,540
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1107
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:29,420
Get every available cop
down there and smoke him out!

1108
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:31,130
The mayor won't want panic.

1109
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,470
So it's a training exercise.

1110
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:38,300
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1111
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,140
Not you.

1112
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:42,680
You're telling me the Batman's gone

1113
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:47,560
so you chase up the Daggett
leads any way you can.

1114
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,940
Yes, sir.

1115
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:04,830
He asks how much you would
pay us to let you die.

1116
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I told him. I told him you have nothing.

1117
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,000
Do it for the pleasure.

1118
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,460
They pay me more than
that to keep you alive.

1119
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:22,100
He will try the climb.

1120
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:39,030
Has anyone ever made it?

1121
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:41,410
Of course not.

1122
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,300
He says there is one who did.

1123
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,800
A child.

1124
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:00,090
A child born in this hell.

1125
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:02,600
Bane.

1126
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:05,890
An old legend. Nothing more.

1127
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:10,850
Don't.

1128
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:15,400
Whatever it is they want you
to see, it's happening soon.

1129
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,800
Fire in the hole!

1130
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,040
Turn it on.

1131
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,320
I only need one other board member.

1132
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,590
There are eight others waiting.

1133
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,220
I won't do it.

1134
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,760
All right, stop.

1135
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:29,220
Lucius, you'll kill
this man, and yourself

1136
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:31,190
and you'll barely slow them down.

1137
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,010
Go on, then. Do your work.

1138
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:05,140
Take them up to the surface.

1139
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,180
People of their status

1140
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:12,600
deserve to experience the next
era of western civilization.

1141
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:19,470
I've been to half of Daggett's
cement plants and locations

1142
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:20,730
they poured underground.

1143
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,280
Anything strange about the pourings?

1144
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:24,960
Honestly, commissioner,

1145
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,240
I don't know anything
about civil engineering.

1146
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:30,330
But you know about
patterns. Keep looking.

1147
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:36,880
It's done.

1148
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:41,380
This is now a 4- megaton nuclear bomb.

1149
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:45,380
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1150
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:48,800
No, you cannot.

1151
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,810
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1152
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:57,060
If you move it, the core will
decay in a matter of months.

1153
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:59,400
Five, by my calculations.

1154
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:01,230
And then it will go off!

1155
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:09,410
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel indeed I hope it does.

1156
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:17,830
That was you in front of the
stock exchange, wasn't it?

1157
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,130
- When?
- When?

1158
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,690
When cops were trying to
pull onto Castle Street

1159
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:24,590
and your truck was shutting them out.

1160
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,300
- Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
- Detective now.

1161
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:29,880
And, uh, as a detective,

1162
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,470
we're not allowed to
believe in coincidence.

1163
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,240
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1164
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,290
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1165
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:59,000
I got two dead witnesses and a
lot of questions. Call me whenev

1166
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,750
Wait a minute. I'm looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene.

1167
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:06,800
That looks like motor
oil right next to it.

1168
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:10,180
Jesus, they're not making
cement. They're making explosives.

1169
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:18,830
Patch me in to Foley.

1170
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:20,650
Foley's overseeing the operation.

1171
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,150
They're heading into a trap!

1172
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,030
We're seeing thousands of
police heading into the sewers.

1173
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:27,780
Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.

1174
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,660
It's a training exercise, that's all.

1175
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,080
Now if you'll excuse me,

1176
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,870
I've got tickets to watch
our boys thrash Rapid City.

1177
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:37,790
- Foley.
- It's a trap! Pull everyone out!

1178
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,150
Bane has been pouring
concrete laced with explosives!

1179
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:41,630
Where?

1180
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:51,390
Oh, say, can you see By
the dawn's early light

1181
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:57,930
What so proudly we
hailed At the twilight's

1182
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,860
There's a ring around the tunnels!

1183
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,020
They'll blow it and trap
the cops underground!

1184
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:05,940
Pull them out. Pull them out now!

1185
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:10,200
Through the perilous fight

1186
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:14,490
O'er the ramparts we watched

1187
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:19,080
Were so gallantly streaming

1188
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:23,290
And the rockets' red glare

1189
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:27,710
The bombs bursting in air

1190
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:29,970
Gave proof through

1191
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:32,340
That's a lovely, lovely voice.

1192
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:36,640
that our flag was still there

1193
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:46,270
Oh, say does that
star- spangled banner Yet wave

1194
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:52,700
O'er the land of the free

1195
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:59,700
And the home of the brave

1196
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,930
Let the games begin.

1197
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,300
Everybody okay?

1198
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:35,970
- Let's move! Move, move!
- Go, go!

1199
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,480
Gotham

1200
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,440
take control.

1201
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,610
Take control of your city.

1202
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:06,710
- Foley.
- Jesus, Blake.

1203
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,790
Every cop in the
city's in those tunnels.

1204
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,250
Not every cop.

1205
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:27,180
Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer.

1206
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:28,390
I need your car right now.

1207
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:21,530
Clear the corners, rookie.

1208
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:23,910
Get my coat, son.

1209
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,830
This

1210
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:29,790
This is the instrument
of your liberation.

1211
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:35,290
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1212
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:38,420
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1213
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:46,140
Identify yourself to the world.

1214
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:51,890
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1215
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:54,600
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1216
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:58,320
Plane crash on an agency
pull out of Uzbekistan, but

1217
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,440
It looks like it's him.

1218
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,990
And what...? What is this?

1219
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:08,030
It's a fully primed neutron bomb

1220
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,580
with a blast radius of six miles.

1221
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:14,790
And who is capable of
disarming such a device?

1222
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,170
Only me.

1223
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,550
Only you.

1224
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:23,840
Thank you, good doctor!

1225
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:29,720
Now, this bomb is armed!

1226
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:32,480
And this bomb is mobile!

1227
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:37,190
And the identity of the
triggerman is a mystery.

1228
01:33:37,730 --> 01:33:42,570
For one of you holds the detonator!

1229
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:46,110
Now, we come here not as conquerors

1230
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,060
but as liberators,

1231
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:51,870
to return control of
this city to the people.

1232
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,790
And at the first sign of
interference from the outside world

1233
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:02,300
or from those people attempting to flee

1234
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:11,890
this anonymous Gothamite, this
unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.

1235
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:16,690
For now, martial law is in effect.

1236
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:22,190
Return to your homes,
hold your families close

1237
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:24,900
and wait.

1238
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:29,070
Tomorrow, you claim
what is rightfully yours.

1239
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:37,000
Pull back the fighters.

1240
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:40,420
Start high- level
reconnaissance flights.

1241
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:43,170
Get the president on the line.

1242
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:05,170
Tanks and

1243
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:08,320
planes cannot stop us
from detonating our device.

1244
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:10,710
Send an emissary to discuss

1245
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:14,080
terms of access for
supplies and communication.

1246
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,040
How many of you are there, son?

1247
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:24,050
You don't have enough men to

1248
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:26,460
stop 12 million people
from leaving this island.

1249
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,680
No. No, we don't.

1250
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,890
But you do.

1251
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,890
Now, why the hell would I try
to help you keep your hostages?

1252
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:39,060
If one person crosses this bridge

1253
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:41,020
Gotham gets blown to hell.

1254
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:49,740
The people of our greatest
city are resilient.

1255
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:54,370
They have proven this before,
and they will prove it again.

1256
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:59,330
We do not negotiate with terrorists

1257
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:02,040
but we do recognize realities.

1258
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:05,250
As this situation develops

1259
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,920
one thing must be
understood above all others.

1260
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:14,010
People of Gotham, we
have not abandoned you.

1261
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:15,510
What does that mean?

1262
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:18,430
It means we're on our own.

1263
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:20,640
I have to get in front of a camera.

1264
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:23,350
They will kill you the
second you show your face.

1265
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:26,460
Bane says he's giving
Gotham back to the people.

1266
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:27,980
They need to know I could lead.

1267
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:29,740
Bane's not gonna let that happen.

1268
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:31,450
Then he'll show his true colors.

1269
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:33,240
And you'll be dead.

1270
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:56,970
Behind you stands a
symbol of oppression.

1271
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,060
Blackgate Prison

1272
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,810
where a thousand men have languished

1273
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:06,480
under the name of this man:

1274
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:08,730
Harvey Dent.

1275
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:16,740
Who has been held up to you as
the shining example of justice!

1276
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:18,030
We're just gonna keep moving

1277
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:19,910
you till we can get you
in front of the camera.

1278
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:24,040
You have been supplied with
a false idol to stop you

1279
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:26,630
tearing down this corrupt city!

1280
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:28,420
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1281
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:32,220
Let me tell you the
truth about Harvey Dent.

1282
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:37,220
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner

1283
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:39,760
James Gordon:

1284
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:43,690
"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent.

1285
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:45,770
He saved my boy

1286
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:50,400
then took the blame for
Harvey's appalling crimes

1287
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:53,190
so that I could, to my shame

1288
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:59,870
build a lie around this fallen idol.

1289
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:07,080
I praised the madman who
tried to murder my own child.

1290
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:11,050
Well, I can no longer live with my lie.

1291
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:14,970
It is time to trust the
people of Gotham with the truth

1292
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:19,220
and it is time for me to resign."

1293
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:23,520
And do you accept
this man's resignation?

1294
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:29,520
And do you accept the
resignation of all of these liars?

1295
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,360
Of all the corrupt?

1296
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:37,410
Those men locked up for
eight years in Blackgate

1297
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:41,830
and denied parole under the
Dent Act, it was based on a lie.

1298
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:44,500
Gotham needed a hero.

1299
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:46,640
Well, it needs it now more than ever,

1300
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:48,880
but you betrayed
everything you stood for.

1301
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:52,360
There's a point

1302
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:56,470
far out there when
the structures fail you

1303
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:59,510
when the rules aren't weapons anymore

1304
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:03,680
they're shackles, letting
the bad guy get ahead.

1305
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:10,610
One day, you may face
such a moment of crisis.

1306
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:14,070
And in that moment, I hope
you have a friend like I did

1307
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:17,570
to plunge their hands into the filth,

1308
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:19,910
so that you can keep yours clean!

1309
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:24,120
Your hands look plenty
filthy to me, commissioner.

1310
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:29,250
We take Gotham from the corrupt!

1311
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:32,630
The rich!

1312
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:35,510
The oppressors of generations

1313
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:39,840
who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity.

1314
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:43,050
And we give it back to you

1315
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,890
the people.

1316
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:48,890
Gotham is yours!

1317
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,690
None shall interfere. Do as you please.

1318
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:58,440
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

1319
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:00,320
Open it!

1320
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:11,290
Step forward, those who would serve

1321
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,630
for an army will be raised.

1322
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,470
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests

1323
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:33,690
and cast out into the cold
world that we know and endure!

1324
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,360
Courts will be convened.

1325
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,330
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1326
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:56,750
Blood will be shed!

1327
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:02,760
The police will survive

1328
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:07,350
as they learn to serve true justice.

1329
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:10,980
This great city

1330
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,650
it will endure.

1331
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:21,110
Gotham will survive!

1332
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,340
He says you must first fix your back.

1333
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:46,720
How does he know?

1334
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:48,300
He was the prison doctor.

1335
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:54,040
He's a morphine addict who incurred
the displeasure of powerful people,

1336
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,440
including your masked friend.

1337
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,860
How?

1338
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:04,400
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1339
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:09,080
Some of the other
prisoners attacked Bane.

1340
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:14,790
The doctor's fumbling
attempts to repair the damage

1341
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:17,210
left him in perpetual agony.

1342
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:20,550
The mask holds the pain at bay.

1343
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:24,050
Bane was the child you spoke of?

1344
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,510
He was born here?

1345
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:28,940
The legend is that there was a mercenary

1346
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:30,930
who worked for a local warlord.

1347
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,020
He fell in love with
the warlord's daughter.

1348
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,100
They were married in secret.

1349
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:38,270
When the warlord found out

1350
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:42,610
the mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1351
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:45,440
But then he exiled him instead.

1352
01:42:45,610 --> 01:42:47,140
The mercenary understood that

1353
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:49,660
it was the daughter who
had secured his release.

1354
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:54,700
But what he could not know was
the true price of his freedom.

1355
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,540
She took his place in the pit.

1356
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:04,300
And she was with child,
the mercenary's child.

1357
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,090
lnnocence cannot flower underground.
It has to be stamped out.

1358
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:18,690
One day, the doctor
forgot to lock the cell.

1359
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:30,300
But the child had a friend.
A protector who showed the

1360
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:33,700
others that this innocence
was their redemption.

1361
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:35,580
It was to be prized.

1362
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,500
The mother was not so lucky.

1363
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:44,340
This is Bane's prison now. He
wouldn't want this story told.

1364
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:59,440
There's a vertebra
protruding from your back.

1365
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:01,900
It has to be put back.

1366
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,700
Stay like this until you stand.

1367
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:22,630
Did you not think I
would return, Bruce? Hmm?

1368
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:29,920
I told you I was immortal.

1369
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:34,600
I watched... I watched you die.

1370
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:37,720
Oh, there are many forms of immortality.

1371
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,100
Once, I had a wife

1372
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,360
my great love.

1373
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:49,110
- She was taken from me.
- You were the mercenary.

1374
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,120
Bane is your child.

1375
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:57,790
Your heir.

1376
01:44:57,950 --> 01:45:01,340
An heir to ensure the League
of Shadows fulfills its duty

1377
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,500
to restore balance to civilization.

1378
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:04,710
No.

1379
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,300
You yourself fought the
decadence of Gotham for years

1380
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:12,490
with all your strength,
all your resources,

1381
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,970
all your moral authority.

1382
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:18,720
And the only victory you
could achieve was a lie.

1383
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:22,230
Now you understand.
Gotham is beyond saving.

1384
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:23,520
No.

1385
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:25,810
- And must be allowed to die.
- No!

1386
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,740
Yeah, just lift your head.

1387
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:36,570
Oh, that's good.

1388
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:43,460
No, no!

1389
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:21,160
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1390
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:23,250
And now it's everyone's home.

1391
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,080
There's a storm coming,
remember? This is what you wanted.

1392
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,990
It's for the bus, in case
there's a chance to evacuate.

1393
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,700
Any news? Is the commissioner...?

1394
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:05,200
The less you know, Father.
How are the boys doing?

1395
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:08,170
Well, we've had more power
on, so they've got some TV.

1396
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,670
It's good to see you.

1397
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,280
Blake, you be careful out there.

1398
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:14,420
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1399
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:21,430
Why build yourself?

1400
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:25,980
I'm not meant to die in here.

1401
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:28,730
Here, there. What's the difference?

1402
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:33,790
I told you it could not be done.

1403
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,590
You told me a child did it.

1404
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,260
But no ordinary child.

1405
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:42,220
A child born in hell.

1406
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,020
Forged from suffering.

1407
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:52,440
Hardened by pain.

1408
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:56,610
Not a man from privilege.

1409
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:17,630
We got boots on the ground, sir.

1410
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:19,510
Just waiting on intel.

1411
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:26,260
You have ID?

1412
01:49:26,970 --> 01:49:28,010
Of course not.

1413
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:30,720
- Well, how can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

1414
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,940
Commissioner Gordon. Captain
Jones, Special Forces.

1415
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:35,650
Captain. Glad to have you here.

1416
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:38,480
It's our job, sir. Now, uh,
how many of you are there?

1417
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:41,570
Well, there's dozens. I'd
rather not say exactly.

1418
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:44,990
But the men trapped
underground number almost 3000.

1419
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:47,070
- Condition?
- Getting food and water.

1420
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:49,540
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1421
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:52,040
Take out the mercenaries
south of Ackerman Park.

1422
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,920
Blow the rubble, make a hole
big enough for 10 at a time.

1423
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,270
I'm in contact with my
partner who's down there.

1424
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:58,290
They're just waiting.

1425
01:49:58,460 --> 01:50:00,470
Men who haven't seen daylight in months?

1426
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:02,720
Officers who haven't
seen daylight in months.

1427
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:05,550
What about the bomb? Satellite
can't pick up radiation hot spots.

1428
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:09,470
They keep it on a truck. It
must have a lead- lined roof.

1429
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,310
- They move it constantly.
- Good. So you know the truck?

1430
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,810
Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.

1431
01:50:16,190 --> 01:50:17,230
Decoy.

1432
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:20,780
You don't really think he's coming back?

1433
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:22,190
Doesn't matter what I think.

1434
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,290
Actually, it does.

1435
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:26,240
You should put your faith in
something a little more real.

1436
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:27,720
The routes don't vary much.

1437
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,620
Okay. What about the triggerman?

1438
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:30,970
No leads. It's a bluff.

1439
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:33,830
Bane wouldn't give control
of that bomb to someone else.

1440
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,350
We can't take that chance.

1441
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:38,210
Until we have the triggerman,
we just track the device.

1442
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:40,950
And meanwhile, Gotham
lives under a warlord,

1443
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:42,300
like some failed state?

1444
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:45,340
Dial it back, officer. This
situation is unprecedented.

1445
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:48,280
We can't do anything to
risk millions of lives.

1446
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:50,760
You gonna tell him
what's really going on?

1447
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:54,020
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1448
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:56,390
There's someone you need to meet.

1449
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:58,690
Came upstairs looking
for a vantage point.

1450
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:00,610
Found the people who
run the corporation.

1451
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:01,940
What corporation?

1452
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:04,490
Wayne Enterprises. You good?

1453
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:15,700
Mr. Fox, would you like
to brief the captain?

1454
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:18,500
Miss Tate's fully
aware of the situation.

1455
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:20,740
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,

1456
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:23,130
I have to take responsibility for it.

1457
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,300
- Why?
- We built it.

1458
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:26,970
You built the bomb?

1459
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:31,300
It was built as a fusion
reactor. First of its kind.

1460
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:34,850
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

1461
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:36,340
Here's the important part.

1462
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:38,390
As the device's fuel cells deteriorate

1463
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:42,190
it becomes increasingly unstable
to the point of detonation.

1464
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:44,110
This bomb is a time bomb.

1465
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:48,880
And it will go off in 23 days, regardless
of Bane's revolution or what we,

1466
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,160
or the outside world, choose to do.

1467
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,910
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

1468
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:55,940
Could you disarm it?

1469
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:58,910
I could reconnect it to
the reactor. Stabilize it.

1470
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:02,210
- Let's move from this location and call it in.
- Right. Let's go.

1471
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:03,890
No, no, we'll take it from here.

1472
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:05,590
You stay and look after these folks.

1473
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:14,180
Someone sold us out.

1474
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:17,270
Go, go, go!

1475
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:40,660
I'll die before I talk.

1476
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:43,630
I'm on your schedule, captain.

1477
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:52,430
There were people living upstairs.

1478
01:52:52,930 --> 01:52:55,050
Round them up for judgment

1479
01:52:58,890 --> 01:53:03,770
and hang them where the world can see.

1480
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:22,540
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

1481
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,960
My body makes the jump.

1482
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:29,340
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1483
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:35,220
My soul is as ready
to escape as my body.

1484
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:38,390
Fear is why you fail.

1485
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:40,220
No, I'm not afraid.

1486
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:43,390
I'm angry.

1487
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:14,090
Bruce.

1488
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:16,390
Why do we fall?

1489
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:24,310
You do not fear death.

1490
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:29,900
You think this makes you
strong. It makes you weak.

1491
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:31,480
Why?

1492
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:33,900
How can you move faster than possible

1493
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,660
fight longer than possible

1494
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:40,530
without the most powerful
impulse of the spirit?

1495
01:54:41,790 --> 01:54:43,410
The fear of death.

1496
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,000
I do fear death.

1497
01:54:47,790 --> 01:54:49,750
I fear dying in here

1498
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,460
while my city burns.

1499
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:55,420
There's no one there to save it.

1500
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,300
Then make the climb.

1501
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:04,680
How?

1502
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:07,980
As the child did

1503
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:14,360
without the rope.

1504
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:19,320
Then fear will find you again.

1505
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:28,580
Ah, supplies for your journey?

1506
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:32,310
Oh, that's wonderful.

1507
01:55:32,310 --> 01:55:37,010
That's What does that mean?

1508
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:38,800
Rise.

1509
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:41,180
No.

1510
01:57:11,140 --> 01:57:13,060
No, there's been a mistake!

1511
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:15,230
Take me to Bane!

1512
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:19,480
I want to see Bane!

1513
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,820
Order!

1514
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:26,740
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?

1515
01:57:26,910 --> 01:57:29,040
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.

1516
01:57:29,410 --> 01:57:31,830
You are Philip Stryver

1517
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,500
executive vice president
of Daggett lndustries

1518
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:39,300
who for years has been
living off the blood and sweat

1519
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:41,670
of people less powerful than him.

1520
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:44,930
Call Bane. I am one of you.

1521
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:48,720
Bane has no authority here. This
is merely a sentencing hearing.

1522
01:57:48,890 --> 01:57:51,020
Now, the choice is yours.

1523
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:53,600
Exile or death!

1524
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:59,650
Order!

1525
01:58:00,230 --> 01:58:01,530
Exi... Exile.

1526
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:03,700
Sold.

1527
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:05,610
To the man in the cold sweat.

1528
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,410
You follow the thick ice.

1529
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,710
You try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1530
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:18,460
Has anyone made it?

1531
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:34,310
Where are they? It's not
like we have a lot of time.

1532
01:58:34,770 --> 01:58:35,890
How long?

1533
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,900
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1534
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:40,890
We have about 18 hours to do something.

1535
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:41,320
To do what?

1536
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:43,090
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it

1537
01:58:43,090 --> 01:58:45,490
so we can start to figure
out how to bring it down.

1538
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:53,450
That's it?

1539
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:57,040
Foley.

1540
01:58:58,580 --> 01:59:01,200
Where's Foley, damn it?

1541
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,500
You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1542
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:08,810
Jim, he's not here.

1543
01:59:08,810 --> 01:59:10,140
You let your wife come to the door?

1544
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:13,350
- When the city's under occupation?
- Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1545
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,140
What did you do, bury your
uniform in the backyard?

1546
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:18,440
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1547
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:20,940
Have you forgotten all the
years we were out on patrol?

1548
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:22,290
When every gangbanger wanted

1549
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:24,230
to plant one as soon as
our backs were turned?

1550
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:25,690
That was different. And you know it.

1551
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:26,590
These guys run the city.

1552
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:28,530
The government's done a deal with them.

1553
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:31,240
Bane's got their balls in
a vice. That's not a deal.

1554
01:59:31,410 --> 01:59:34,700
You move on Bane, the triggerman
is gonna hit the button.

1555
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:38,830
You think he's given control of
that bomb to one of the people?

1556
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
You think this is part
of some revolution?

1557
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:44,000
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

1558
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:47,260
Look, we've all got to keep our
heads down till they can fix this.

1559
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:49,290
If you still had a family here...

1560
01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:52,800
This only gets fixed
from inside the city!

1561
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:54,140
Look, Peter.

1562
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:58,770
I'm not asking you to walk
down Grand in your dress blues,

1563
01:59:58,770 --> 02:00:00,350
but something has to be done.

1564
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,010
Sorry, Jim. I gotta...

1565
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:02,560
Keep your head down?

1566
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:04,900
What good's that gonna
do when that thing blows?

1567
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:07,530
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1568
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:13,990
I hear you're looking
for men, commissioner.

1569
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:15,410
How about me instead?

1570
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:18,160
Miss Tate, I, uh, can't
ask you to do that.

1571
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:20,170
Please.

1572
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:23,920
You little punk! What'd you take?

1573
02:00:24,090 --> 02:00:26,380
Nothing! I didn't take anything!

1574
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:29,840
You steal from us, you little bastard?

1575
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:31,860
Now, you boys know you can't

1576
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:34,430
come into my neighborhood
without asking politely.

1577
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:43,610
Never steal anything from
someone you can't outrun, kid.

1578
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:52,320
You're pretty generous for a thief.

1579
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,750
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1580
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:06,050
If you're expecting an apology, I...

1581
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,250
It wouldn't suit you.

1582
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:09,710
I need your help.

1583
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:11,720
And why would I help you?

1584
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:13,890
For this. Clean slate.

1585
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:16,050
You'd trust me with that?

1586
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:18,270
After what I did to you?

1587
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:21,350
I'll admit, I was a little let down.

1588
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,680
But I still think there's more to you.

1589
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:26,110
In fact, I think that for you

1590
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:27,860
this isn't just a tool.

1591
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:31,240
It's an escape route. You
want to disappear. Start fresh.

1592
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:33,960
I can't even get off this island.

1593
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,080
I can give you a way off

1594
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,830
once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1595
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:39,790
Find out where they're
holding him and take me in.

1596
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:44,620
Why do you need Fox?

1597
02:01:44,790 --> 02:01:47,290
- To save the city.
- Who says it needs saving?

1598
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:49,050
Maybe I like it this way.

1599
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:50,840
Maybe you do

1600
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:54,550
but tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1601
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:58,850
Got your powerful friend on the case?

1602
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,350
I'm trying

1603
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:02,810
but I need Fox.

1604
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:04,730
As it approaches

1605
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,690
flip the switch.

1606
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:09,080
The needle hits 200,
you give me the signal,

1607
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:10,400
I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1608
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:13,400
Heads up, heads up.

1609
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:31,800
- I got it.
- Mercenaries on your 6.

1610
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:35,090
Stand still! Keep your
hands where we can see them!

1611
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,350
Commissioner Gordon,
you are under arrest.

1612
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:41,220
On whose authority?

1613
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:42,600
The people of Gotham.

1614
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,170
No lawyer? No witnesses?

1615
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:48,520
What sort of due process is this?

1616
02:02:48,690 --> 02:02:50,170
Your guilt has been determined,

1617
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:51,900
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1618
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:53,900
Now, what will it be?

1619
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:57,820
Death or exile?

1620
02:02:57,990 --> 02:02:59,180
Crane,

1621
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:02,740
if you think we're going
out onto that ice willingly

1622
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:04,500
you have another thing coming.

1623
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,330
Death, then.

1624
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:10,710
- Looks that way.
- Very well.

1625
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,380
Death

1626
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:15,420
by exile.

1627
02:03:18,010 --> 02:03:19,470
Bring her to me.

1628
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:30,190
Hey, we're going now. Blake says
they're ready! Get your gear on!

1629
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:33,400
Hey, you hear me? We're
going now. Let's do it.

1630
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:39,780
Find this one a spot,
got a big day tomorrow.

1631
02:03:39,950 --> 02:03:40,810
We all do.

1632
02:03:40,810 --> 02:03:43,120
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

1633
02:03:45,370 --> 02:03:46,750
- Bruce.
- You okay?

1634
02:03:46,910 --> 02:03:49,290
Picked a hell of a time to
go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

1635
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:51,130
How long until that core ignites?

1636
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:52,930
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.

1637
02:03:52,930 --> 02:03:55,130
- Unless we can reconnect
it to the reactor.

1638
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:57,820
Can you get Miranda out of here?

1639
02:03:57,820 --> 02:03:59,010
Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1640
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:02,050
- Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1641
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:04,640
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1642
02:04:04,810 --> 02:04:06,600
Sorry to spoil things, boys,

1643
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:08,980
but Bane wants these guys to himself.

1644
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:14,400
- I won't forget about you, Miranda.
- I know.

1645
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:25,490
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

1646
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:27,500
He should be so lucky.

1647
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:36,000
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb

1648
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:38,050
the triggerman sets it off.

1649
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:41,010
Well, they won't use radio or
cell. Too much interference.

1650
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:42,840
lnfrared doesn't have the range.

1651
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:45,760
It'll have to be a microburst. Longwave.

1652
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:47,720
- Could you block it?
- Yes.

1653
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:51,520
But I'll need the EMP cannon
guidance mount from the Bat.

1654
02:04:52,690 --> 02:04:54,310
Remember where you parked?

1655
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:10,160
She fly okay?

1656
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:13,920
Yeah, even without the autopilot.

1657
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:14,930
Thanks.

1658
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:17,050
Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

1659
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:59,590
Okay. It's clear. Come
on, quick. One at a time.

1660
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:04,840
Wait, wait!

1661
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:07,640
Ross!

1662
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,180
Ross?

1663
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:11,890
Lock it up.

1664
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,140
Get down!

1665
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:17,020
Who are you?

1666
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:47,720
Light it up.

1667
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:08,870
- Dad, check it out.
- Honey, come take a look.

1668
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:20,960
Impossible.

1669
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:23,500
Keep her close.

1670
02:07:24,170 --> 02:07:25,840
He'll come for her.

1671
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,930
Where's Miranda Tate?

1672
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:30,050
Bane took her.

1673
02:07:30,260 --> 02:07:33,560
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1674
02:07:33,850 --> 02:07:36,350
This blocks the remote
detonator signal to the bomb.

1675
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,070
Get it onto it before sunrise.

1676
02:07:38,070 --> 02:07:40,190
They might hit the
button when it starts.

1677
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:42,270
When what starts?

1678
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:43,980
War.

1679
02:08:19,850 --> 02:08:20,980
You missed a spot.

1680
02:08:24,570 --> 02:08:26,750
If you're working alone, wear a mask.

1681
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:29,450
I'm not afraid to be
seen standing up to them.

1682
02:08:29,610 --> 02:08:30,780
The mask is not for you.

1683
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:32,820
It's to protect the
people you care about.

1684
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,490
Count to five, then throw.

1685
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:49,550
No offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1686
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:03,100
- What now? - All- out
assault on Bane.

1687
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:05,520
But you need to get
people across the bridge.

1688
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:06,380
Why?

1689
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:07,940
In case we fail.

1690
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:10,820
Lead an exodus. Save as
many lives as you can.

1691
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:12,280
You don't need me here?

1692
02:09:12,450 --> 02:09:13,990
You've given me an army.

1693
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,320
Now go.

1694
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:17,160
Hey, thanks.

1695
02:09:17,330 --> 02:09:18,660
Don't thank me yet.

1696
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:20,870
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1697
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,430
You shouldn't have.

1698
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:39,560
The midtown tunnel's blocked by debris

1699
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:43,100
but the cannons have enough
firepower to make a path for people.

1700
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:45,100
Wait until the fighting begins.

1701
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:47,980
You're gonna wage a war to
save your stuck- up girlfriend?

1702
02:09:48,150 --> 02:09:49,190
To start it, throttle

1703
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:51,760
I got it.

1704
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:54,160
We have 45 minutes to save this city.

1705
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:57,070
No, I've got 45 minutes to
get clear of the blast radius.

1706
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:59,360
You don't stand a chance
against these guys.

1707
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:00,540
With your help, I might.

1708
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:03,080
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

1709
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:05,750
There's more to you than that.

1710
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:11,510
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1711
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:19,600
Come with me. Save yourself.

1712
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:24,560
You don't owe these people any more.

1713
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:26,850
You've given them everything.

1714
02:10:27,020 --> 02:10:28,480
Not everything.

1715
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:30,150
Not yet.

1716
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:11,860
Disperse!

1717
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:14,240
Disperse or be fired upon!

1718
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:18,030
There's only one police in this town.

1719
02:11:57,030 --> 02:11:58,700
Open fire.

1720
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,620
- Here it comes!
- Get ready!

1721
02:13:21,490 --> 02:13:25,570
So you came back to die with your city.

1722
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:29,700
No. I came back to stop you.

1723
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:41,800
Now!

1724
02:13:54,730 --> 02:13:56,360
That's impossible.

1725
02:13:58,230 --> 02:13:59,860
Cut over to Fifth!

1726
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:15,920
Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.

1727
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:18,670
You, come with me. You too.

1728
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:21,920
Hey, you, you, and you,
come here, come here.

1729
02:14:22,090 --> 02:14:23,920
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

1730
02:14:24,090 --> 02:14:26,760
You guys, you go knock on
doors and spread the word, okay?

1731
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:28,160
The bomb is gonna go off.

1732
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:30,810
Get out by the South Street
tunnel or over the bridge.

1733
02:14:30,970 --> 02:14:33,680
You do two blocks and you get
back to the bus, all right?

1734
02:14:33,850 --> 02:14:35,730
Go, go, go!

1735
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,270
Is he back?

1736
02:14:38,650 --> 02:14:39,980
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.

1737
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:04,150
Cover the doors!

1738
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:08,860
Where's your trigger?!

1739
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:10,820
Where is it?!

1740
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:14,580
You'd never give it
to an ordinary citizen!

1741
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:17,370
Where is it? Where's your trigger?

1742
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:21,460
Where is it?! Where is it?!

1743
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:31,390
Tell me where the trigger is.

1744
02:16:31,890 --> 02:16:35,470
Then you have my permission to die.

1745
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:49,320
I broke you.

1746
02:16:50,610 --> 02:16:52,490
How have you come back?

1747
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:54,310
You think you're the only

1748
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:57,160
one who could learn
the strength to escape?

1749
02:16:57,330 --> 02:16:58,620
Where's the trigger?

1750
02:16:59,290 --> 02:17:01,620
But I never escaped.

1751
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:04,040
But the child.

1752
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:07,880
The child of Ra's Al
Ghul made the climb.

1753
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:10,420
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1754
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:15,680
I am.

1755
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:18,560
And though I'm not ordinary

1756
02:17:19,890 --> 02:17:21,600
I am a citizen.

1757
02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:42,370
Miranda?

1758
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:46,290
Why?

1759
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:48,380
Thalia.

1760
02:17:49,210 --> 02:17:52,260
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed

1761
02:17:53,090 --> 02:17:58,010
the way I would have been killed,
if not for my protector, Bane.

1762
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:07,150
Goodbye.

1763
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:11,530
I climbed out of the pit.

1764
02:18:17,490 --> 02:18:19,290
I found my father

1765
02:18:22,250 --> 02:18:25,370
and brought him back to
exact terrible vengeance.

1766
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:28,000
But by that time

1767
02:18:29,130 --> 02:18:32,880
the prisoners and doctor had
done their work to my friend.

1768
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:34,260
My protector.

1769
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:41,680
The League took us in. Trained us.

1770
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:44,850
But my father could not accept Bane.

1771
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,670
He saw only a monster.
His very existence

1772
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:53,190
was a reminder of the hell
he'd left his wife to die in.

1773
02:18:53,610 --> 02:18:56,740
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

1774
02:18:56,910 --> 02:19:01,450
His only crime was that he loved me.

1775
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:06,170
I could not forgive my father.

1776
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,460
Until you murdered him.

1777
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:35,780
He was trying to kill
millions of innocent people.

1778
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:39,700
Innocent is a strong word to
throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1779
02:19:42,330 --> 02:19:45,370
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1780
02:19:57,550 --> 02:20:00,110
Vengeance against the man who killed him

1781
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:02,430
is simply a reward for my patience.

1782
02:20:03,930 --> 02:20:05,020
You see

1783
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:10,690
it's the slow knife the
knife that takes its time.

1784
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:20,110
The knife that waits
years without forgetting

1785
02:20:20,410 --> 02:20:23,700
then slips quietly between the bones.

1786
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:28,710
That's the knife that cuts deepest.

1787
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:30,000
Please.

1788
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:42,140
Maybe your knife was too slow.

1789
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:43,720
The truck is under attack.

1790
02:20:43,890 --> 02:20:47,640
Gordon. You gave him a
way to block my signal.

1791
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:48,850
No matter.

1792
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:53,480
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1793
02:20:57,860 --> 02:20:59,360
Come on!

1794
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:01,410
This way!

1795
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,410
Stay there! What are you doing?

1796
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:10,760
Blake, MCU!

1797
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:13,210
I'm getting these boys to safety!

1798
02:21:13,380 --> 02:21:14,710
You'll get us all killed!

1799
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,630
If anyone crosses this bridge,

1800
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:17,880
they'll blow the city!

1801
02:21:18,050 --> 02:21:21,430
It's gonna blow anyway! We
need to open this bridge, now!

1802
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:24,760
Detective, if you take one
step forward we will shoot you!

1803
02:21:24,930 --> 02:21:28,520
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!

1804
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:33,030
Okay, go back by the bus
and wait for me, all right?

1805
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:33,900
Go back and wait.

1806
02:21:37,150 --> 02:21:38,320
Prepare a convoy.

1807
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:41,110
We must secure the
bomb until it detonates.

1808
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:46,160
Don't kill him, I want
him to feel the heat.

1809
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:51,790
Feel the fire of 12
million souls you failed.

1810
02:21:57,710 --> 02:21:59,250
Goodbye, my friend.

1811
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:08,720
Goodbye.

1812
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:12,770
Keep moving forward!
Flank them at the stairs!

1813
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:22,740
Shoot them.

1814
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:24,860
Shoot them all.

1815
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:37,710
We both know that I
have to kill you now.

1816
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:42,840
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1817
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:52,720
About the whole no- guns thing

1818
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:56,730
I'm not sure I feel as
strongly about it as you do.

1819
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:11,740
Pull up.

1820
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:15,870
Stay level.

1821
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:31,560
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.

1822
02:23:33,390 --> 02:23:36,390
I need you on the ground,
I'll be in the air. Go.

1823
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:39,900
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out of date.

1824
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:44,070
I'm a cop, like you, and
I'm walking out there.

1825
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:46,990
Please do not shoot me!

1826
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:50,070
Shoot at his feet.

1827
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:02,420
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1828
02:24:02,590 --> 02:24:08,340
Detective! Please stop!
Please, detective! Stop!

1829
02:24:08,510 --> 02:24:13,930
Stop walking! Blow it! Do it!

1830
02:24:25,230 --> 02:24:27,610
You have to get that bomb
here. You've got 10 minutes.

1831
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:40,870
They're pushing us to the
entrance of the reactor.

1832
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,500
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.

1833
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,340
You idiots!

1834
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:50,340
You sons of bitches! You're killing us!

1835
02:24:50,510 --> 02:24:52,140
Yeah, follow your orders!

1836
02:24:52,510 --> 02:24:54,810
All right, boys. Get in
a circle. Bow your heads.

1837
02:24:57,730 --> 02:24:59,520
It's on my side.

1838
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:50,010
Hey, Father! Let's get
everyone back on the bus, okay?

1839
02:25:50,010 --> 02:25:52,230
Go, go, go! Back on the bus!

1840
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:53,950
There's nowhere to go.

1841
02:25:54,490 --> 02:25:55,530
On the bus!

1842
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:54,550
You've got to turn the truck east!

1843
02:26:59,470 --> 02:27:01,220
Stay straight!

1844
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:36,340
Give me a hand! We
can get a cable on it!

1845
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:45,930
Fox showed me how to
override the reactor.

1846
02:27:49,690 --> 02:27:50,940
Oh, dear.

1847
02:27:54,650 --> 02:27:57,990
lncluding the emergency flood.

1848
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:20,890
There's no way this
bomb will be stopped.

1849
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:23,220
What are you doing?

1850
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:24,620
Protection from the blast.

1851
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:25,770
We're gonna be all right!

1852
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:27,230
It's an atom bomb!

1853
02:28:27,390 --> 02:28:28,620
Think they need to hear that?

1854
02:28:28,630 --> 02:28:30,060
Let them die without hope? Come on!

1855
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:32,650
Prepare yourselves.

1856
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:39,320
My father's work is done.

1857
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:48,040
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay!

1858
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:50,710
Set it to fly out over
the water, then eject?

1859
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:52,500
No autopilot.

1860
02:28:54,130 --> 02:28:55,530
You could've gone anywhere,

1861
02:28:55,530 --> 02:28:57,510
been anything. But you came back here.

1862
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:58,800
So did you.

1863
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:01,300
I guess we're both suckers.

1864
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:11,810
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

1865
02:29:11,980 --> 02:29:14,560
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1866
02:29:14,730 --> 02:29:15,900
A hero can be anyone.

1867
02:29:16,070 --> 02:29:19,520
Even a man doing something
as simple and reassuring as

1868
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:22,480
putting a coat around
a young boy's shoulders

1869
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:24,990
to let him know the world hadn't ended.

1870
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:44,180
Bruce Wayne?

1871
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:59,480
Come on! There you go! Okay, you too.

1872
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:00,400
Come on, Father.

1873
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:21,550
Hey, heads down! This is it!

1874
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:24,800
- No.
- No, that's Batman!

1875
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:14,310
That's detonation!

1876
02:31:21,780 --> 02:31:23,690
It's out over the
bay! Clear of the city!

1877
02:31:43,550 --> 02:31:46,380
"I see a beautiful city

1878
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:50,930
and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss.

1879
02:31:52,140 --> 02:31:56,140
I see the lives for
which I lay down my life

1880
02:31:56,560 --> 02:32:01,770
peaceful useful, prosperous and happy.

1881
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:07,860
I see that I hold a
sanctuary in their hearts

1882
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:12,870
and in the hearts of their descendants

1883
02:32:13,700 --> 02:32:15,410
generations hence.

1884
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:22,340
It is a far, far better thing that I do

1885
02:32:23,210 --> 02:32:25,170
than I have ever done.

1886
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:30,720
It is a far, far
better rest that I go to

1887
02:32:33,640 --> 02:32:35,350
than I have ever known."

1888
02:32:53,700 --> 02:32:55,120
I'm so sorry.

1889
02:32:55,490 --> 02:32:57,200
I failed you.

1890
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:00,870
You trusted me

1891
02:33:02,460 --> 02:33:03,590
and I failed you.

1892
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:09,510
Can I change your mind

1893
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:13,760
about quitting the force?

1894
02:33:14,680 --> 02:33:18,520
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?

1895
02:33:18,890 --> 02:33:22,440
You were right, and I can't
take it. The injustice.

1896
02:33:22,650 --> 02:33:26,940
I mean, no one's ever gonna
know who saved an entire city.

1897
02:33:27,150 --> 02:33:28,230
They know.

1898
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:31,860
It was the Batman.

1899
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:51,640
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended

1900
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:53,510
to reflect his more modest estate.

1901
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:57,510
Nonetheless, there are
considerable assets to dispose of.

1902
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:59,600
The contents of the house are to be sold

1903
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:01,140
to settle the estate's accounts

1904
02:34:01,310 --> 02:34:02,970
and the remainder is left

1905
02:34:02,970 --> 02:34:05,650
in its entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1906
02:34:07,110 --> 02:34:10,670
The house and grounds are
left to the city of Gotham

1907
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:13,970
on condition that they
never be demolished, altered

1908
02:34:13,970 --> 02:34:15,870
or otherwise interfered with

1909
02:34:16,030 --> 02:34:19,830
and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

1910
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:25,750
The housing and care of the city's
at- risk and orphaned children.

1911
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:27,800
My clerk can help with

1912
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:30,800
the smaller correspondences
and instructions.

1913
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:32,380
Blake, John.

1914
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:35,930
- Nothing here.
- Uh, try my legal name.

1915
02:34:39,350 --> 02:34:42,140
You should use your full
name. I like that name.

1916
02:34:42,310 --> 02:34:44,190
- Robin.
- Thanks.

1917
02:34:44,350 --> 02:34:46,520
Why worry about the
stabilization software?

1918
02:34:46,690 --> 02:34:48,690
This entire autopilot
system's completely obsolete.

1919
02:34:48,860 --> 02:34:52,650
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1920
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:53,620
But, Mr. Fox,

1921
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:56,060
it's already been fixed. Software patch.

1922
02:34:56,060 --> 02:34:56,950
Six months ago.

1923
02:34:57,120 --> 02:34:58,700
Check the ID on the patch.

1924
02:35:01,790 --> 02:35:03,370
Bruce Wayne.

1925
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:06,540
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

1926
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:08,130
They better leave no stone unturned.

1927
02:35:08,290 --> 02:35:11,710
We can't leave a string of
pearls on the manifest as lost.
