"Criminal Psychology"
For you, boss. Mr. Cornelius.

20
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:04,535
Oh, my gosh!

21
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,635
The clairvoyant character. Get rid of him.

22
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:11,877
Think about it. He helped us solve
that prostitute murder case.

23
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:16,950
Inspector Kras.

24
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:19,347
This is Cornelius.

25
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:22,326
You may still be in time to prevent something
terrible from happening.

26
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:25,287
I had a vision.

27
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,724
And?

28
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:32,669
Two cars right next to each other
in the middle of traffic.

29
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:35,730
A street sign: "Hansaring."

30
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,902
I don't know the people involved,
I don't know the circumstances...

31
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:40,741
but I sense an impending disaster.

32
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:42,474
A crime.

33
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,846
Murder!

34
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,630
"Television Station"
Where on earth is Barter?

35
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,869
The broadcast begins in 30 seconds.

36
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:14,174
He should be here any minute. He called
about 15 minutes ago, all excited.

37
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:17,306
- He has some big scoop.
- Broadcast time is still the same.

38
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:18,816
Hurry up, hurry up.

39
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:21,045
Silence in the studio!

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,144
In two seconds.

41
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,416
Ladies and gentlemen...

42
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,893
unfortunately we must cancel our news report.

43
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:34,092
We just received the horrible news
that our reporter Peter Barter...

44
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,932
died on his way to the studio
behind the wheel of his car...

45
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,835
presumably of heart failure.

46
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,566
Doctor!

47
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,665
Mission accomplished.

48
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:46,678
Good. Change the license plate on the car.

49
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:48,509
Remove the transmitter.

50
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,106
Have the car painted immediately
and disposed of in Holland.

51
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:55,076
Have you ever seen the doctor?

52
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:58,612
What concern is that of yours?
Aren't you satisfied with your salary?

53
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:00,488
I'm just asking.

54
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:03,323
I'd like to know what he looks like.

55
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:06,832
Then you might as well order
a coffin for yourself.

56
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,460
Do you remember the American?

57
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:13,369
He too wanted to speak to the doctor in person.

58
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,930
They found him a few hours later.

59
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,075
His throat had been cut.

60
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,214
But I really want to know what
the doctor looks like.

61
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:27,912
That I don't know.

62
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:31,889
Don't expect me to explain
clairvoyance to you, Inspector.

63
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,689
Magic powers defy rational thought.

64
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:40,255
I feel the disaster looming.
I see it as if in horrible daydreams.

65
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:43,460
I myself suffer terribly from it,
for I can't stop it...

66
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:48,132
because, like a dark cloud,
some hostile force of black magic...

67
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:51,540
obscures my view at the decisive moment.

68
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,341
Thus leaving a little bit of
work for the police.

69
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,714
By the way, did you know
the reporter, this Barter?

70
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:02,985
About a year ago, shortly
after I settled here...

71
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:05,387
he visited me once or twice.

72
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,858
He was always looking for the sensational...

73
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,828
and he was a skeptic, like you.

74
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:13,888
That's a professional proclivity,
my dear Cornelius.

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,029
Unfortunately, a policeman can't afford
to mess around with magical powers...

76
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:21,232
and I rarely have anything
to do with dark clouds.

77
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:24,103
lf, like me, you had grown up in Ireland...

78
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:27,077
where people still believe in the
elementary powers of nature...

79
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:29,706
you might think differently.

80
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:33,811
But perhaps the blind see more
than those who have sight.

81
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:38,016
Possibly, but in the Barter case
this vision has failed you.

82
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,718
Maybe you were also thrown
off by your dark cloud.

83
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:45,295
This was no murder, my dear Cornelius.

84
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:48,026
It was a simple heart attack.

85
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,073
For you, Inspector.

86
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:08,614
Take it to the lab right away!
I'll be back in an hour.

87
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:11,419
You were right.

88
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:15,150
The autopsy revealed that Barter
didn't die of a heart attack...

89
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:19,260
but of a steel needle in his brain.

90
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:21,999
Material: the finest iridium steel.

91
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:25,059
Length: 38.4 millimeters.

92
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:29,130
The steel needle smoothly penetrated
the victim's skull bone...

93
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:33,372
and entered the brain without leaving
any visible trace on the outside.

94
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,676
We're not going to find anything here either.

95
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:49,417
"To my dearest Peter, with much love...

96
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:51,486
on the occasion of our first Christmas together.

97
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:53,088
Corinna."

98
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,758
His girlfriend.

99
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,769
Poor guy.

100
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,470
"TV Journal - Peter Barter"

101
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:09,845
Not a shred of paper left.

102
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:17,212
They even took the blotter.

103
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:20,315
- The audiotapes were also taken.
- Of course.

104
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:25,790
They were searching for evidence
of Barter's sensational scoop.

105
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,725
And if there was anything here,
I'm sure they found it.

106
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:40,673
You won't find any fingerprints.
These were no beginners.

107
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:47,217
All we have is a small, deadly steel needle.

108
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:49,413
An incredible weapon, gentlemen.

109
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:53,424
An air gun that shoots steel
needles absolutely silently.

110
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,427
It's a new infantry weapon...

111
00:07:56,495 --> 00:08:00,659
tested at Fort Benning in the United States.

112
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:04,402
But here's something strange:

113
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,406
Before the weapon could go
into full-scale production...

114
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:10,465
the blueprints disappeared.

115
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,476
They were stolen.

116
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:16,503
U.S. military intelligence found the thief--

117
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:19,173
a U.S. soldier in Germany--

118
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:22,311
in a deserted bunker with his throat cut.

119
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:24,754
He had been gruesomely mutilated
and apparently tortured.

120
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,882
The blueprints were, of course,
nowhere to be found.

121
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,292
- When did this happen?
- About a year ago.

122
00:08:30,362 --> 00:08:34,389
There's no doubt that it was this steel needle
gun that caused Barter's death.

123
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:35,956
I don't know.

124
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:39,801
This Barter murder case reminds me of
something that happened long ago.

125
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:41,396
Gentlemen...

126
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:44,567
does the name Dr. Mabuse mean anything to you?

127
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:46,076
- Never heard of him.
- No.

128
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:47,976
A criminal genius.

129
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:51,483
He wanted to shock the world
with terrorist acts...

130
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,212
undermining governments...

131
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:58,154
and establishing a fantastic reign of crime.

132
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,321
He ended up in an insane asylum,
where he wrote a kind of last will...

133
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:05,192
instructions for the crimes he was planning.

134
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:07,994
In 1932 he died, insane.

135
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:12,800
But if you talk to old-time criminals...

136
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,998
they all say that Dr. Mabuse isn't dead.

137
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:16,769
He can't die.

138
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:18,469
Cock-and-bull stories!

139
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:22,173
How could you even think of this--
What was the name again?

140
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:24,772
Dr. Mabuse.

141
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,876
In those days, I was a young assistant
on the homicide squad...

142
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:30,046
and we had a similar case there.

143
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:34,684
A man was shot behind the wheel
of his car from another vehicle.

144
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,457
The Barter case strikes me as an exact
copy of Dr. Mabuse's methods.

145
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,521
You said he was no longer alive.

146
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,861
Well...

147
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:45,233
I have seen his dead body
with my own eyes, but--

148
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:47,204
Why haven't we heard anything about this case?

149
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:48,933
The case never made criminal history...

150
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,998
because Hitler appeared on the scene,
and the whole Nazi nightmare.

151
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:54,273
But there must be files on the Mabuse case.

152
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,197
This is number eight.

153
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,106
Switch it on.

154
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:28,773
Decoding is active. Write it down.

155
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,781
This is Dr. Mabuse speaking.

156
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:38,886
Four days ago...

157
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:41,949
the American Henry W. Taylor arrived in town.

158
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:46,122
The British foreign office just agreed.

159
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:47,859
Good.

160
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:53,730
- Gentlemen?
- We accept.

161
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,706
Just a question of principle:

162
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:58,538
When you take over the entire stock
holdings of Taran Nuclear Works...

163
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,601
is this happening under the auspices
of the United States...

164
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,704
or are you signing as a private citizen?

165
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:04,874
In practice, it's irrelevant.

166
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,885
When I evaluate the secret
models of your rockets...

167
00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:10,387
on my U.S. testing grounds...

168
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,356
I will be under government supervision anyway.

169
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:15,723
And how do you envision the
financial transaction?

170
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:18,228
As soon as my lawyers have
examined the contract...

171
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:20,527
you will receive the full amount by check.

172
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:23,159
The name Taylor is an alias.

173
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:27,695
Departments B and C are to follow
Taylor's each and every step...

174
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:31,436
and give a detailed report every 12 hours.

175
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,944
Taylor is staying in a luxury suite...

176
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:37,448
on the 14th floor of the Luxor Hotel.

177
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,814
A radio message from Inspector Kras.

178
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:42,786
"Before he was murdered on
his way to the TV studio...

179
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:45,346
the reporter Peter Barter had
been at the Luxor Hotel...

180
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:48,257
according to a statement by the
vehicle maintenance man."

181
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,159
Please call a short staff meeting
for 20 minutes from now.

182
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:55,166
In the meantime, I will notify
the president of Interpol.

183
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,795
We have been struggling for a while...

184
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,931
with a series of strange, unsolved crimes.

185
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,975
It all began two years ago.

186
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:07,170
On May 15, 1958...

187
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:11,444
a passenger airplane crashed at
the Dutch airport of Schiphol...

188
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,178
following an act of sabotage.

189
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:15,049
The perpetrators are still unknown.

190
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,783
Among the dead was the French
bank president Luchard.

191
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:23,351
His death caused a significant drop
on the Paris stock exchange.

192
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:25,862
During his trip to Germany...

193
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:30,334
Luchard had stayed at the Luxor Hotel.

194
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:33,200
On November 2, 1958...

195
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:37,333
Mr. Delano, an attorney for the
steel corporation PCA...

196
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:42,039
was murdered in a sleeping car on a
train traveling from Oslo to Paris.

197
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:44,642
Two weeks before the murder...

198
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:48,277
Mr. Delano spent three evenings
in the casino of the Luxor Hotel.

199
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:51,584
On May 12, 1959...

200
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:56,026
the Algerian-born arms dealer Hussein
fell victim to a bomb blast...

201
00:12:56,094 --> 00:13:00,929
in his car shortly after crossing
the Belgian border.

202
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,093
Previously, Hussein had once met
with a well-known call girl...

203
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:06,660
at the Luxor Hotel.

204
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:08,433
And the list goes on.

205
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:12,637
Serious capital offenses, murder,
stock fraud, kidnapping.

206
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:15,805
Each case is different, and
each remains unsolved.

207
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,281
But they all have one thing in common.

208
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,047
The victims in all these cases were at some
point guests at the Luxor Hotel.

209
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,611
That's why we have set up one of
our best special agents there.

210
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,487
His identity is known only...

211
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,492
to the chief of the Federal Crime
Bureau and myself...

212
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,088
to avoid any kind of leak to
subordinate organizations.

213
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:35,861
He has been staying at the
Luxor for some time now.

214
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:41,065
His sole mission is to find out what's
going on at the Luxor Hotel.

215
00:13:57,522 --> 00:13:59,422
I can't watch this!

216
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:02,187
The firefighters should be spreading
out their sheet by now!

217
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,091
She's about to jump!

218
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:16,938
Come back inside!

219
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,570
Madam, please don't cause any trouble.
We don't want a scandal.

220
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:24,082
Should you have financial difficulties,
the hotel will help, of course.

221
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:27,910
Ladies and gentlemen, you can't possibly
enter here. Please be reasonable.

222
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:30,750
- After all, a human life is at stake.
- Our jobs are on the line!

223
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:32,790
Don't give us a hard time. We need pictures.

224
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:34,485
I'm afraid that's impossible.

225
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,187
- Is it someone from the 14th floor?
- What's her name?

226
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:39,992
- I'm sorry.
- Menil is her name.

227
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:41,794
Marion Menil.

228
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:44,961
She is staying here at the hotel. I was
going to insure her only yesterday.

229
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:47,232
Sometimes you get lucky, huh?

230
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:08,253
Don't be alarmed.

231
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:11,086
Why would you want to do something so futile...

232
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:13,290
from which there is no return?

233
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:16,895
You are young and your whole
life lies ahead of you.

234
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,799
It might just be wonderful.

235
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,428
Think it over.

236
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,800
You might not die right away.

237
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:27,208
You may suffer horrible pain
before it's all over.

238
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:33,143
Or you might survive-- as a cripple.
Think about it.

239
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:37,953
I'm scared. So very scared.

240
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:40,184
Give me your hand.

241
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:44,387
Trust me. I'll hold on to you.

242
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:47,361
- She moved!
- He took her hand.

243
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:58,399
Thank God! I wouldn't have enjoyed my dinner.

244
00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:02,507
Drink this. It'll do you good.

245
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:04,572
This is the hotel manager. Open the door.

246
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:07,277
- Please don't let anybody in.
- No, no.

247
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:09,721
Open the door! This is the police!

248
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:10,880
Please!

249
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:13,720
Perhaps you should go in the other room.
I'll talk to these people.

250
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,161
Come in, gentlemen-- just the two of you.

251
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:27,330
No, no, please. Don't push, gentlemen.

252
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,464
- We want to see the woman.
- We've got a right to see her.

253
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,476
Please, don't cause trouble. Mr. Taylor
is a guest from the United States.

254
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:34,637
What did he say? What's his name?

255
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,845
Nonsense! Wait, it's--

256
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:44,951
Of course. I've seen him in the newspapers.
He did look familiar.

257
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:54,330
Get to the office right away so your
picture makes the evening edition.

258
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,698
In the meantime, I'm going to
file my report by phone.

259
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:04,431
Excuse me, gentlemen.

260
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:08,309
Who do you think the noble rescuer is?

261
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,344
Mistelzweig. Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.

262
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,078
The "B" stands for "belly."

263
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,245
General insurance: life, accident,
baggage loss, health...

264
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,221
fire, hail, theft, and burglary.

265
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,657
Only lovesickness and a chronic
shortage of cash are excluded.

266
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:25,124
Well, if you insure that guy, you can retire.

267
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:28,166
Why? Is he that well-off?

268
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,964
Billions. Mr. Travers is one of the
richest men from overseas.

269
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:33,026
And a bachelor.

270
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:35,470
Mrs. Menil is apparently wealthy.

271
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,872
She owns fabulous jewelry and expensive furs.

272
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:40,503
She flew here from Paris five days ago.

273
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,774
But our house detective may
know more about her.

274
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:45,612
- Then please ask him to come here.
- With pleasure.

275
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:49,652
Are you sure the woman won't do
anything else foolish?

276
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,889
My secretary is with her.

277
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:59,488
Gentlemen, please visit the bar--
on the house, of course.

278
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:05,429
I promise I'll give you all the
information you need later.

279
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:07,664
Mrs. Menil has lived very quietly
in this establishment.

280
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:09,764
She most certainly does not
belong to the demimonde.

281
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:12,036
I suspect the whole thing has
to do with a telegram...

282
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,101
that she received about three hours ago.

283
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,113
- Do you know what it said?
- No...

284
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:18,877
but according to the receptionist...

285
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,145
Mrs. Menil grew visibly nervous
while reading the telegram...

286
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,278
and she retired to her room immediately.

287
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:25,289
Then I will question her personally.

288
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:28,485
Above all, I must insist that the
lady leave the hotel at once.

289
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,257
- And I must insist--
- This won't work, gentlemen.

290
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,731
You can't save a person from
committing suicide...

291
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,598
only to leave her to her own devices.

292
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,694
Give her time to get over this shock.

293
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:43,707
Who will guarantee she won't
attempt suicide again?

294
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:46,175
I believe I can accept that responsibility.

295
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:48,872
Perhaps Mr.-- What was the name again?

296
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:50,073
Berg.

297
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:53,174
- Mr. Berg can keep an eye on her.
- Of course.

298
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:01,990
The gentlemen are all gone.

299
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:06,555
For the moment, no one is going to bother you.

300
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:09,366
If I can help you in any way--

301
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:12,002
No one can help me.

302
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,231
Why didn't you let me--

303
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:16,774
Everything would have been over now.

304
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:19,105
Death is such a finite thing.

305
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:21,645
People often think they are
facing a catastrophe...

306
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:25,240
and despair descends like a dark cloud.

307
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:28,650
In every situation there is a way out.

308
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,517
Not for me.

309
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,054
Do you have financial worries?

310
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:36,359
Romantic troubles?

311
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:40,694
You trusted me when you were standing
out there on the ledge.

312
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,863
I should probably be grateful to you.

313
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,861
But I'm not.

314
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,805
Do you have any family I can notify?

315
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:52,974
I don't want to see anyone.

316
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,536
I want to go to my room.

317
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,480
I don't want you to be alone now.

318
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,750
Yes, I understand.

319
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:04,115
Then please notify my doctor, Dr. Jordan.

320
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,597
- Where is he? In the lobby?
- No, in the other room.

321
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:23,563
Forgive me. I was told that Mrs. Menil
was in your suite.

322
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:27,143
Sister Agnes heard a radio broadcast at
my clinic about this terrible incident.

323
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:29,908
Mrs. Menil is my patient. May I see her?

324
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:33,075
I was just about to send for you.

325
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,352
Marion!

326
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:42,255
How could you do such a thing?
You've got to pull yourself together.

327
00:20:42,494 --> 00:20:45,395
I'm going to take you to your room
and give you a little shot...

328
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,330
and then you'll have a nice sleep.

329
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,868
I'll leave you in Sister Agnes's care overnight.

330
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:52,994
She's a familiar face, right?

331
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:56,670
Please don't think I'm ungrateful, but--

332
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,173
I think complete rest is the best remedy now.

333
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:04,571
If you don't mind, I will take
the lady to her room now.

334
00:21:08,186 --> 00:21:11,622
Professor, is Mrs. Menil permanently
in your care?

335
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,316
No, absolutely not.

336
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:16,622
But she had a nervous breakdown
once before, about a year ago.

337
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:19,288
She was a patient at my clinic
for almost two months.

338
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:23,391
And she's got no husband, no boyfriend?

339
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:28,237
As a doctor, I can't make statements
about Mrs. Menil's private life.

340
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:32,299
Certainly. But I am of course interested
in this woman's situation now.

341
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:35,210
She is a very lonely person, very guarded.

342
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,714
It's not easy to win her trust.

343
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:39,443
You--

344
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:41,951
You must exert a strong influence on her.

345
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,250
I mean, on her subconscious...

346
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:48,122
in that you succeeded in
saving her from suicide.

347
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:50,423
I'm somewhat surprised...

348
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:52,486
but very happy about it.

349
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:53,826
Good-bye now.

350
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:57,026
"Multimillionaire Thwarts
Suicide at Luxor Hotel"

351
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,798
Not exactly a pleasant advertisement
for our hotel.

352
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:05,302
- Good evening, Inspector. The usual?
- Yes, the usual.

353
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:07,241
A lot of action around here.

354
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:11,612
Are your rates so high that your guests
must jump out the window?

355
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:15,244
It may be a joke to you, Inspector, but
unfortunately the joke is on me...

356
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,084
as if I were everybody's baby-sitter.

357
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:21,148
These disgusting reporters. May they go to hell.

358
00:22:21,226 --> 00:22:24,787
Yes, these reporters with their scribbling--

359
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:28,094
To think what my friend Barter would
have done with a thing like this.

360
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,795
Oh, well. Since his death I haven't
been watching TV anymore.

361
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,963
Was he the one who died of
a heart attack in his car?

362
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,565
Yes. A great guy, Inspector.
Generous in every way.

363
00:22:37,642 --> 00:22:39,303
- Mr. Berg?
- Yes.

364
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:43,143
Mr. Travers' secretary would like
to speak to you on the phone.

365
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:45,910
Excuse me for a moment, please.

366
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:47,781
Did you know this Barter well?

367
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:51,049
He always asked me for tips on special guests.

368
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:52,987
Especially the female ones, I bet.

369
00:22:53,057 --> 00:22:57,517
You will laugh, Inspector, but I had pointed
out Mrs. Menil to Mr. Barter.

370
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,460
Actually, it was the day she arrived.

371
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:02,125
She sat over there, while Barter
drank his whiskey over there.

372
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,135
Things must have worked out...

373
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:07,967
because a little later they
went upstairs together.

374
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,507
Interesting.

375
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:20,481
Would you kindly let Mrs. Menil
know that I'd like to see her?

376
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:23,487
I'm afraid that's impossible.
She just took a sleeping pill.

377
00:23:23,855 --> 00:23:25,413
- Is she asleep yet?
- No, but--

378
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,458
- Then I'd like to see her.
- Can't it wait until tomorrow?

379
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:29,015
Unfortunately, it can't.

380
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:31,027
My name is Kras.

381
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:33,529
Inspector Kras.

382
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:43,200
A man by the name of Inspector Kras
insists he must see you.

383
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:45,902
Is this necessary? Why do people torture me so?

384
00:23:46,377 --> 00:23:48,242
Please...

385
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:51,714
but take the lady's health into consideration.

386
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,386
Please forgive the late visit,
but I'm afraid it's quite urgent.

387
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:58,945
Please make it quick. I feel faint.

388
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:02,322
Do you remember a man by the name of Barter?

389
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:04,520
Barter? No.

390
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:06,120
A TV reporter.

391
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:08,529
This is the first time I've heard his name.

392
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,835
Perhaps this will refresh your memory.

393
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:14,565
Oh, that guy! Yes, I know him.

394
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:18,942
He introduced himself downstairs in the bar.

395
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:23,978
I hadn't quite caught his name.
He wanted an interview.

396
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:26,482
I refused. After all, I'm not some movie star.

397
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:28,212
He was awfully pushy.

398
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:30,914
And yet you brought him upstairs to your room.

399
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:33,924
I didn't want to make a scene in the bar.

400
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:37,450
I brought him here upstairs,
but he got quite aggressive.

401
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:41,055
It got so bad that I had to ask
him to stop bothering me.

402
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:43,259
He's not going to bother you anymore.

403
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:47,369
Shortly after visiting you, Mr. Barter...

404
00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:49,303
died.

405
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:52,709
But that's awful!

406
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,274
And when a person wants to die,
they won't let her!

407
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:01,711
"Return immediately or you must bear
the consequences of your actions.

408
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:04,152
I have proof of your guilt."

409
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:09,421
Mrs. Menil, three hours after receiving
this telegram from Paris...

410
00:25:09,494 --> 00:25:11,894
you attempted suicide.

411
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:13,954
How did you get that telegram?

412
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:15,897
My personal life is nobody's business.

413
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:19,664
When the police are interested in something,
there is no personal life.

414
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:22,103
Why are you torturing me like this?

415
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:23,902
Leave me alone!

416
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:25,966
That's enough. Can't you see?

417
00:25:26,878 --> 00:25:29,847
But I must talk to you again about Barter.

418
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:34,146
I received a very strange phone call.

419
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,614
For the time being, please don't leave town.

420
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:40,317
Good night.

421
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:52,962
"H. B. Mistelzweig Insurance"

422
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:55,631
Tough times, tough business.

423
00:25:56,574 --> 00:25:59,099
Mars has entered the house of
death of too many people.

424
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:02,510
- Who has entered what?
- Mars is in the house of death.

425
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,515
As a modern businessman, I work
solely on the basis of astrology.

426
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:10,077
There is no point in insuring people if
you know that they won't live long.

427
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:12,554
Imagine if I had insured your friend Barter.

428
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:13,954
He looked as chipper as life itself.

429
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:16,255
He would have just paid his first
premium, and then-- wham!

430
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:18,852
A heart attack! What an awful
loss that would have been.

431
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,297
No, no. One must look at the stars
of these insurance candidates.

432
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:25,097
- Very interesting.
- What do you mean?

433
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,502
- Did you have Barter's horoscope?
- This is Inspector Kras.

434
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:31,508
Please, allow me: Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.

435
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:33,168
"B" stands for "belly."

436
00:26:33,244 --> 00:26:35,109
General insurance:
Life, accident, baggage loss...

437
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:36,874
health, fire, hail, theft, burglary.

438
00:26:36,948 --> 00:26:40,349
Only lovesickness and a chronic
shortage of cash are excluded.

439
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:43,748
Impressive. What companies do you work for?

440
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:45,789
Lloyd's of London, Assurance la Paix Paris...

441
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:48,519
Seguros de Madrid, Kontor Hamburg
National and Overseas.

442
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:50,891
Mistelzweig has worldwide connections.

443
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:53,396
A lucrative business, isn't it?

444
00:26:53,464 --> 00:26:55,762
One doesn't talk about that. One gets by.

445
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:59,167
Allow me, gentlemen. Another round.

446
00:26:59,537 --> 00:27:01,767
A little schnapps with your beer
can't hurt, Inspector.

447
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,501
Besides, it's all tax-deductible.

448
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:06,940
Karl, one more.

449
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:08,774
The hotel engineer is, of course, included.

450
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:10,677
I'm sorry, Mr. Mistelzweig.
Perhaps later, though.

451
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:12,739
The freezer for the kitchen
downstairs is on the blink.

452
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:16,150
Most likely it's a short. Do you have
the key to the machine room?

453
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,381
No, but there must be a spare downstairs.

454
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:20,754
I can't find it. Please come with me.

455
00:27:20,825 --> 00:27:23,726
Go ahead and pour my drink. I'll be right back.

456
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,098
Do you have an office here at the hotel?

457
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,396
My office? No, no.

458
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:33,130
My office is here-- in my head.

459
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:35,263
I do my business at the Luxor...

460
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,830
but I wouldn't take a permanent office
here if they gave it to me for free.

461
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,809
What don't you like about the hotel?

462
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:42,710
Just between you and me:
It's not under a lucky star...

463
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,874
like anything the Nazis started
near the end of the war.

464
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,578
What does that have to do with the Luxor?

465
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:53,249
People aren't the only ones influenced
by the constellations upon their birth.

466
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:55,554
- A building is too.
- Come on now!

467
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:58,421
- A building isn't born!
- Oh, yes, it is, Inspector.

468
00:27:58,496 --> 00:28:02,830
The placement of its cornerstone
is its birth hour...

469
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,700
and the cornerstone for the Luxor
was laid by the Nazis in May '44...

470
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:09,740
when they still believed in final victory.

471
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:13,265
The bigwigs in the SS wanted
to build a few grand hotels...

472
00:28:13,344 --> 00:28:15,369
for politicians and diplomats...

473
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:19,280
all in one huge cluster, so they
could spy on everybody.

474
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,217
No, the Luxor has a negative aura.

475
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:24,379
But your business is thriving here nevertheless.

476
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:26,855
Well, in a hotel like this there are always
people with a lot of money.

477
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:31,759
There's jewelry or baggage to insure,
or travel insurance to write.

478
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,559
My wife has always wanted
me to buy life insurance.

479
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:37,032
It all depends on the stars, Inspector.

480
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:39,228
It's all in the stars.

481
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:42,338
Considering your profession...

482
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:45,068
you could be dead tomorrow, right?

483
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,303
I mean, since you're always
in dangerous situations.

484
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:49,676
Criminals never sleep, do they?

485
00:28:49,747 --> 00:28:51,874
But perhaps we could work something out.

486
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:54,349
Call me at the office in the morning.

487
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:56,579
It's pretty quiet there these days.

488
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:59,919
I'd also like to talk about Mr. Barter.

489
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:02,186
He wanted insurance too.

490
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,388
I received a very strange phone call.

491
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:08,759
To your health, Mr. Mistelzweig.

492
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,926
Cheers, Inspector.

493
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,208
- It was nice to meet you.
- The pleasure was all mine.

494
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:22,769
I'll be sure to call you.

495
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,292
No harm done...

496
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:48,202
but if you could take me to the other
side, I'd appreciate that very much.

497
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:50,740
May I give you a lift somewhere?

498
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:52,799
That's very kind of you.

499
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:57,512
If you can find room for my dog too--

500
00:29:57,582 --> 00:29:59,914
Of course.

501
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,192
In Ireland we also have this cold, wet weather.

502
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:13,492
I can feel it on my skin like damp wool.

503
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,589
I don't know.

504
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:19,235
Careful! Don't take the turn so fast!

505
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:21,168
Danger!

506
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,178
Damn! That was close.

507
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,408
- Thanks for the warning.
- How did you know that?

508
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:34,508
Sometimes I can see things coming.

509
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:37,918
You don't believe me.

510
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:41,119
This morning at the hotel...

511
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:43,183
you dropped a glass while brushing your teeth.

512
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,491
In picking up the shards, you cut the
middle finger of your right hand.

513
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:48,625
But that's--

514
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:50,530
No one was there to see it when it happened.

515
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,092
This morning, around 11:00...

516
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,162
you signed a check drawn on an English bank...

517
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,471
but the business transaction you're
planning will not materialize.

518
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:03,070
The part about the check is true too,
but how do you know the rest?

519
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:07,049
I told you before: Sometimes
I can see things coming.

520
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:09,484
If you can predict future events...

521
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:13,717
how come you didn't see that we
would almost run you over?

522
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,919
The hour of my death has not yet come.

523
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:21,861
- Who are you?
- My name is Cornelius.

524
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,205
Good evening...

525
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,041
Inspector.

526
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:38,906
Why did you turn on the light?

527
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:41,247
So that you may see better, Inspector.

528
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:43,718
I could have been a burglar.

529
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:46,222
No, my dog growled and barked.

530
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,781
This means that there's someone
in the room whom he knows.

531
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:53,489
He would have behaved differently
with a stranger.

532
00:31:53,564 --> 00:31:54,963
And then...

533
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:57,125
I also smelled your pipe tobacco.

534
00:31:57,201 --> 00:31:59,863
The odor clings to your clothing.

535
00:31:59,937 --> 00:32:03,168
Then I knew it was you waiting
for me in the dark.

536
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:07,166
The blind have keener senses
than people who see.

537
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:11,238
But how did you get in?
My attendant has the night off.

538
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:14,478
I was so bold as to let myself
in, Mr. Cornelius.

539
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:17,749
Please accept my apologies,
but I must talk to you.

540
00:32:17,822 --> 00:32:20,188
There's a new twist in the Barter case.

541
00:32:20,257 --> 00:32:22,452
Did they find something in his car?

542
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,591
No.

543
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:28,097
In his head.

544
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,569
A small, unfriendly thing

545
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:35,735
Let me be frank, Mr. Cornelius.

546
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:38,232
I'm not making much progress in this matter.

547
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:41,176
You know I'm a skeptic...

548
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:44,180
but when you're stuck, beggars
can't be choosers.

549
00:32:47,284 --> 00:32:49,980
If you concentrate on this object...

550
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:52,420
what do you see...

551
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,015
that might help me?

552
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:02,397
A man.

553
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:06,699
His face is a blur.

554
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:10,597
Now, nothing!

555
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:13,675
The cloud again. The dark cloud.

556
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:18,137
It covers everything. It's stronger than I am.

557
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:21,184
It threatens me personally. I can feel it.

558
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,747
That's why I would be grateful to you...

559
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:28,383
if you kept me informed about the Barter case.

560
00:33:30,628 --> 00:33:34,189
We have maintained absolute
silence with the press...

561
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:37,029
regarding the fact that Barter
met a violent death.

562
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:40,669
Nevertheless, this afternoon I received
a very strange phone call.

563
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:43,767
A man was willing...

564
00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:46,901
in exchange for immunity from
prosecution and a reward...

565
00:33:46,977 --> 00:33:50,879
to give me information about this steel needle.

566
00:33:52,082 --> 00:33:56,109
We immediately determined the call
originated from a public phone.

567
00:33:56,187 --> 00:33:58,178
But the guy
was much too smart.

568
00:33:58,255 --> 00:34:01,656
When the patrol car arrived, he was long gone.

569
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:07,095
But before he hung up, he said
I should think about it.

570
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:09,291
He would call me again tomorrow.

571
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:13,397
What are we doing here?

572
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:17,566
The bunker where they found the American.

573
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:20,166
You know, the American!

574
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:24,472
- And why are we here?
- To make a phone call.

575
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:28,676
- You're so fond of making phone calls.
- Me? What do you mean?

576
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:31,778
You know. I warned you.

577
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:34,518
- The doctor doesn't like it.
- What doesn't he like?

578
00:34:34,592 --> 00:34:36,958
- That you make phone calls.
- But I didn't--

579
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:40,319
I didn't!

580
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:45,202
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Morning.

581
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,929
It got pretty late last night. Any news?

582
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,802
Nothing at all. Everything was quiet.

583
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:52,809
The telephone didn't work, but it's been fixed.

584
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:55,204
- A man from the phone company--
- Don't pick up!

585
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:20,467
I'd be willing to purchase it.

586
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:23,802
Would you accept 45,000 marks?

587
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,708
- But it's worth much more!
- Let's say 50,000.

588
00:35:27,778 --> 00:35:31,646
- All right.
- Would you like a check or cash?

589
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:35,674
Cash. I may need to leave today,
and the banks are already closed.

590
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:40,584
Nexit.

591
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:42,751
You were lucky, Inspector.

592
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:45,624
If it weren't for that cabinet,
you'd be dead as a rat now.

593
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,765
It would serve me right.

594
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:57,434
His wife is expecting their first child.

595
00:36:01,145 --> 00:36:05,081
You slowly get used to the fact that people
bite the dust in our profession.

596
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:07,782
It's all business as usual.

597
00:36:09,486 --> 00:36:11,477
And it's my fault.

598
00:36:11,555 --> 00:36:13,853
Your fault? Why?

599
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,051
Yesterday I set out three pieces of bait...

600
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:18,924
but the response came faster than I expected.

601
00:36:18,996 --> 00:36:21,157
But from whom?

602
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:23,358
The psychic?

603
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,561
The insurance agent?

604
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:27,126
Or the woman?

605
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:30,339
Why aren't you honest with me?

606
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:32,500
I don't know what you mean.

607
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:35,204
You sold this piece of jewelry today.

608
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:39,776
- You had me followed?
- I feel responsible for you.

609
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:44,380
You booked flights today with
four different airlines...

610
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:47,424
for four consecutive dates...

611
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:49,618
to four different cities...

612
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:51,718
under four different names...

613
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,524
none of them your real one.

614
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:56,865
- Why?
- Please, don't ask!

615
00:36:59,436 --> 00:37:01,336
What is threatening you, Marion?

616
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:04,169
What were you so afraid of that
you wanted to end your life?

617
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:06,869
Please don't ask. Please, please, don't ask!

618
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,436
I don't want to cause you pain, Marion,
but why don't you let me help you?

619
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:13,779
I don't want to owe anybody anything.

620
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:18,220
- I won't accept any money from you.
- Then at least take this back.

621
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:23,492
I know what it means to a woman
to give up her jewelry.

622
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:27,491
Then I have no other choice but to keep it.

623
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:30,192
Perhaps chance will unite us once again.

624
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:32,758
In the meantime, this piece
will remind me of you.

625
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:35,100
My plane is leaving tomorrow.

626
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,197
Tomorrow, already?

627
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,101
Will you do me a big favor before we part?

628
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:42,077
If I can, gladly, of course.

629
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:44,444
Then spend our last evening with me.

630
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:47,416
You must distract yourself
to regain your zest for life.

631
00:37:47,484 --> 00:37:49,475
You need to get out and see happy people.

632
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:51,544
You need to hear laughter and music.

633
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:22,010
To the next lucky coincidence
that will bring us together.

634
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:26,554
Everyday worries and concerns must
be checked in with your coat.

635
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:28,716
All right. To the next lucky coincidence.

636
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,854
Terrific music, isn't it? It gets in your blood.

637
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:37,162
I'm a Scorpio. They burn with passion.

638
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:39,464
What are you, madam? A Libra?

639
00:38:39,536 --> 00:38:42,232
No, I'm a Sagittarius.

640
00:38:42,506 --> 00:38:43,973
Straight to the heart!

641
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,874
- Would you like to dance?
- Oh, yes!

642
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:53,683
Do you like to dance?

643
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,242
I used to love to dance, a long time ago.

644
00:38:58,388 --> 00:39:02,654
You know, I believe you are a
cheerful person by nature.

645
00:39:02,726 --> 00:39:05,126
I used to be very happy and cheerful.

646
00:39:05,195 --> 00:39:09,029
- I loved to laugh.
- Why don't you try it again?

647
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:15,169
See? Much better. Come and dance with me.

648
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:27,747
Wasn't I right to drag you out of
your end-of-the-world mood?

649
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:29,410
Yes, perhaps.

650
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:38,587
You dance beautifully.

651
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:41,724
See? You are a different person now.

652
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,231
Marion, come to Paris with me tomorrow.

653
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:49,606
To Paris? I can't go to Paris.

654
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:51,932
Don't get me wrong. I'm not a prude.

655
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:53,909
I would love to do it.

656
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,740
But I can't leave now.

657
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,370
Why not?

658
00:39:57,915 --> 00:40:00,213
I'm not free.

659
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:02,081
I'm married.

660
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,017
Do you love your husband?

661
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:06,419
I hate him.

662
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,055
When the lady who just stepped out returns...

663
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:47,653
please tell her I'll be right back.

664
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:06,709
He carries a gun in a shoulder holster.

665
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:08,751
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

666
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:11,413
I'm all black and blue from pressing against it.

667
00:41:11,488 --> 00:41:14,389
Have you never considered divorce?

668
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:17,586
Yes, often, but my husband will never let me go.

669
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:20,687
Money can overcome many obstacles.

670
00:41:20,764 --> 00:41:22,391
Not in my case.

671
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:24,331
Money can't help me.

672
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:26,801
But let's not talk about me.

673
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,464
Tell me about yourself, about your life.

674
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:32,804
It's not very interesting.
Business, conferences.

675
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,501
-And women?
- Yes.

676
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,444
But only in passing.

677
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:40,745
You know, when someone lives
for his work as much as I do--

678
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:43,342
board meetings, staff meetings,
business meetings--

679
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,516
I practically live in planes
and conference halls.

680
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:51,027
There's only room for brief pleasures...

681
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:53,824
and not much more.

682
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:58,459
- That's very sad.
- One can't have everything.

683
00:41:58,535 --> 00:42:02,130
Mr. Travers? Excuse me. We just received this.

684
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:08,034
- What about the check?
- The lawyers still have it.

685
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,045
- Cancel it right away.
- Yes, sir.

686
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:14,114
You see? You can't relax either.

687
00:42:14,184 --> 00:42:16,414
A few minutes ago, when we were dancing...

688
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,886
I believed that I could run away from myself.

689
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:21,287
But I can't. No one can.

690
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:23,383
We've all got to follow our path.

691
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:27,696
No, I would only bring you bad luck.

692
00:42:27,764 --> 00:42:30,927
If only all this had happened
three years ago, fine.

693
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:32,992
But now it's only self-deception.

694
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,405
I'm sorry to spoil this lovely evening for you.

695
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:41,941
Please forgive me and forget me.
It's better that way.

696
00:42:42,012 --> 00:42:44,412
Do you really want me to forget you?

697
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:48,717
Yes.

698
00:43:03,066 --> 00:43:05,466
"Radio London announces nuclear power plant...

699
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:08,470
run by the Taran Plutonium Corporation
was blown up today.

700
00:43:08,538 --> 00:43:11,473
Plant completely destroyed by fire.
Many casualties.

701
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:15,170
Population within 10-mile radius
evacuated for safety reasons."

702
00:43:15,245 --> 00:43:19,841
The catastrophe itself I did not foresee.

703
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:23,909
I only felt there was a dark shadow
hovering over your plans.

704
00:43:23,987 --> 00:43:26,285
First, the broken glass in the bathroom...

705
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,018
then the truck we nearly collided with...

706
00:43:29,092 --> 00:43:30,582
and now this Taran Corporation matter.

707
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,959
What's the rational explanation for all this?

708
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,295
Fate allowed me to cross your path.

709
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,268
Perhaps I'm to protect you from future harm.

710
00:43:40,337 --> 00:43:43,670
The explosion in the Taran plant
is hardly harmful to me.

711
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,402
A business transaction that didn't materialize.

712
00:43:46,476 --> 00:43:47,966
That's all.

713
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:52,440
I mean your personal life.

714
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:02,681
Although I'm blind, light that's
too bright is bothersome.

715
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:05,091
It scatters your thoughts.

716
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:09,194
You must now focus on me.

717
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:17,564
You should go away. Leave this town.

718
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:22,041
Something has crossed your path...

719
00:44:22,345 --> 00:44:26,372
and a dark cloud hangs over you.

720
00:44:29,686 --> 00:44:32,655
I see a figure.

721
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:35,549
It's very blurred.

722
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:37,818
An animal.

723
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:39,054
And a woman?

724
00:44:39,696 --> 00:44:41,425
Perhaps.

725
00:44:41,631 --> 00:44:44,998
I can't quite penetrate the darkness.

726
00:44:47,003 --> 00:44:49,403
But one thing I do see.

727
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,669
You saved a life...

728
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:57,312
and it is precisely this life that
threatens you with danger...

729
00:44:57,814 --> 00:44:59,475
and death.

730
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:03,883
She can't just be making up the fact
she reserved four airplane tickets...

731
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:06,286
even if she did it under false names.

732
00:45:06,356 --> 00:45:08,221
I don't get it.

733
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:12,227
Take a note: Interpol inquiry.

734
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:15,662
Does this insurance agent Mistelzweig
really work for Lloyd's of London...

735
00:45:15,732 --> 00:45:18,360
and Assurance la Paix Paris and
all the other companies?

736
00:45:21,104 --> 00:45:26,838
Inspector, Mrs. Menil just canceled
all four flight reservations.

737
00:45:28,512 --> 00:45:30,946
Interesting.

738
00:45:31,615 --> 00:45:33,640
She goes out with the American...

739
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:36,049
and the next morning she cancels her flights.

740
00:45:36,753 --> 00:45:39,813
Yet she didn't look too happy
when she went upstairs.

741
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:42,253
Interesting.

742
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:43,690
I have something else for you.

743
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,753
Get hold of this Cornelius character's latest
tax return. Be discreet about it.

744
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:59,698
Hello, Mr. Cornelius? This is Kras.

745
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:02,874
No. No news, really.

746
00:46:04,648 --> 00:46:08,448
Did the man who wanted to give you
the confidential information call you?

747
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:11,010
He couldn't call me, Mr. Cornelius.

748
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:13,612
You see, my phone exploded yesterday.

749
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,681
A little assassination attempt against me.

750
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:20,629
A man from the phone company
supposedly repaired it earlier.

751
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:24,064
What did the man look like?
Can you please describe him for me?

752
00:46:24,634 --> 00:46:27,694
The only person who could
do that is my assistant...

753
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:30,103
but, unfortunately, he's dead.

754
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:32,639
Why didn't you warn me before it happened?

755
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,108
What is that supposed to mean?

756
00:46:34,177 --> 00:46:37,704
Are you saying you wanted me to
predict your death? You're alive!

757
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:41,949
- But in the Barter case you did!
- Well, he's truly dead.

758
00:46:42,018 --> 00:46:45,886
Inspector, I sense your mistrust.
You are skeptical.

759
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:48,049
That's why I would like to convince you.

760
00:46:48,124 --> 00:46:50,854
Please attend a telepathic séance
at my house tonight.

761
00:46:50,927 --> 00:46:53,657
Choose for yourself the people
you want to witness it.

762
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,630
Bring whomever you wish.

763
00:46:56,299 --> 00:46:57,994
Do you really believe in this humbug?

764
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:01,526
Michael, you know I'm a skeptical man.
Always have been.

765
00:47:01,605 --> 00:47:04,403
Now, for the first time in my life...

766
00:47:04,474 --> 00:47:06,465
I wish I were able to believe in someone.

767
00:47:06,543 --> 00:47:09,341
The psychic or the woman?

768
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:11,642
You should know me better, Michael.

769
00:47:11,715 --> 00:47:14,548
I do what I think is right.

770
00:47:14,618 --> 00:47:16,848
No psychic can change that.

771
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,788
- So you are staying here?
- Yes. You fly to London alone today.

772
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:23,417
Get information on all the repercussions
of the catastrophe...

773
00:47:23,493 --> 00:47:27,520
especially whether the secret plans
for the rockets were saved.

774
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:30,430
And something else, Michael.
This you can do right away.

775
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,459
Pick out fifty roses in the flower
shop downstairs...

776
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:37,472
and have them sent to Mrs. Menil,
with this note.

777
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,030
Certainly.

778
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,053
Excuse me, Mr. Travers.

779
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:54,784
May I perhaps have a word with you in private?

780
00:47:54,858 --> 00:47:56,758
What is this about?

781
00:47:58,194 --> 00:48:00,059
It's about Mrs. Menil.

782
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,135
It's not my custom to intrude in the
private affairs of our guests...

783
00:48:09,205 --> 00:48:13,767
but I know you are interested in anything
that concerns Mrs. Menil.

784
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:17,108
Our access to her for surveillance purposes...

785
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,842
is unfortunately very restricted.

786
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:23,610
She spends most of the day in her suite.

787
00:48:23,687 --> 00:48:27,521
She speaks on the phone a great
deal and receives visitors too.

788
00:48:28,425 --> 00:48:30,290
But I may be able to reveal something...

789
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,557
of great interest to you.

790
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:36,030
How much do you want?

791
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:38,590
That's entirely up to you, of course.

792
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:42,365
But it must be absolutely confidential.
I could lose my job.

793
00:48:48,044 --> 00:48:49,306
Well, then?

794
00:48:50,046 --> 00:48:52,708
Forgive me, but it's something
that I can only show you...

795
00:48:52,782 --> 00:48:55,080
if I may trouble you to come with me.

796
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:57,210
It won't take long.

797
00:49:37,627 --> 00:49:39,788
It's right here.

798
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:44,198
This suite is adjacent to the rooms
occupied by Mrs. Menil.

799
00:49:54,544 --> 00:49:56,876
This room was once occupied
by a very jealous husband...

800
00:49:56,946 --> 00:49:58,971
whose wife was staying right next door.

801
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:01,881
He was never sure whether she
was faithful to him or not...

802
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:05,944
so I helped him out with this little setup.

803
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:10,952
One fine day, he caught her in the act.

804
00:50:13,863 --> 00:50:17,458
Here you can see and hear everything,
but from the other side, you can't.

805
00:50:18,334 --> 00:50:20,962
I'm going to turn on the loudspeaker.

806
00:50:35,218 --> 00:50:38,483
Unbelievable, no? On the other side,
it's just a normal mirror.

807
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:42,656
Please help me get dressed.

808
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:53,197
Please see who it is.

809
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:57,498
These roses are for the lady.

810
00:51:15,024 --> 00:51:17,151
Beautiful roses.

811
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:19,557
I'll get a vase right away.

812
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,525
Well, did I promise too much, Mr. Travers?

813
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:00,262
Turn it off! It's despicable to eavesdrop
on people like that.

814
00:52:00,703 --> 00:52:03,001
Turn it off!

815
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:07,065
Don't worry, Mr. Berg.
I will pay you for this secret.

816
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:12,380
So that no one else may misuse it,
reserve this suite for me.

817
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:15,417
Tell the receptionist that it's for some
business partners I'm expecting.

818
00:52:15,485 --> 00:52:17,316
Of course, Mr. Travers.

819
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:30,289
Yes?

820
00:52:30,366 --> 00:52:33,927
May I remind you that we still
have an appointment?

821
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:38,469
I would like you to attend a 
telepathic séance with me.

822
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:40,740
Yes, ma'am.

823
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,643
With a psychic, at 8:30 p.m.

824
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:46,004
I would very much appreciate seeing you there.

825
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:50,018
Hello, Inspector. Is this a bad time?
Shall l--

826
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:53,946
Don't leave the hotel. I'll call you later.

827
00:52:56,292 --> 00:52:59,784
Is this place all right?
It looks so-- so dilapidated.

828
00:52:59,862 --> 00:53:02,922
You were right the other day, Mr. Mistelzweig.

829
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:05,627
Someone planned to dispatch me to heaven.

830
00:53:06,736 --> 00:53:09,364
- Maybe I should--
- No, no, no.

831
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:11,930
You couldn't have come at a
better time. Have a seat.

832
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:14,635
You are interested in astrology
and such, aren't you?

833
00:53:14,711 --> 00:53:17,145
Yes, as a business principle. You know--

834
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,615
- Is this your wife?
- Yes, yes.

835
00:53:20,683 --> 00:53:25,382
Would you like to attend an interesting
séance with a psychic?

836
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:27,855
I'm flattered! When?

837
00:53:27,924 --> 00:53:30,085
Tonight at 8:30.

838
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:32,923
Perhaps we can talk business too.
I'll bring my wife.

839
00:53:32,996 --> 00:53:35,692
May I introduce my wife? Mr. Cornelius.

840
00:53:35,765 --> 00:53:37,562
Very pleased to meet you, madam.

841
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:39,624
This is my assistant, Mr. Kaiser,
and Mr. Mistelzweig.

842
00:53:39,702 --> 00:53:42,466
Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.
The "B" stands for "belly."

843
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,560
General insurance: life, accident,
baggage loss, health...

844
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:47,461
fire, hail, theft, and burglary.

845
00:53:47,462 --> 00:53:49,962
Only lovesickness and a chronic
shortage of cash are excluded.

846
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:53,504
He's very much interested in the
occult, especially astrology.

847
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:57,534
Only in a very amateurish way.
I'm an absolute dilettante.

848
00:53:57,612 --> 00:54:00,206
But, in fact, today the sun is in
conjunction with Neptune.

849
00:54:00,282 --> 00:54:02,375
That means water, so we're
due for a thunderstorm.

850
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,817
I should have brought an umbrella, right?

851
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:11,855
That's a splendid animal you've got there.

852
00:54:13,161 --> 00:54:17,097
Come on, doggie. Uncle has
got something for you.

853
00:54:17,165 --> 00:54:20,396
Quiet, Ferro. Be quiet.

854
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,802
He's not interested. He won't take
anything from a stranger.

855
00:54:37,786 --> 00:54:40,152
This is Mr. Cornelius, my wife...

856
00:54:40,222 --> 00:54:42,213
Mr. Kaiser, and you already
know Mr. Mistelzweig.

857
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,316
- I hope I'm not late.
- Not at all, madam.

858
00:54:45,393 --> 00:54:48,829
Please, let's all take a seat.
It's very informal.

859
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:05,871
Please...

860
00:55:05,947 --> 00:55:09,348
concentrate on me now.

861
00:55:17,893 --> 00:55:21,158
I'm having difficulty concentrating.

862
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,594
Something is interfering with me.

863
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:27,191
It's not the thunderstorm.

864
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:30,301
- Inspector.
- Yes?

865
00:55:30,972 --> 00:55:33,600
Would you mind if we traded places?

866
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:35,836
Not at all.

867
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:39,472
- Excuse me!
- No problem.

868
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:41,982
I hope my cigars survived intact.

869
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,847
I suspected as much:

870
00:55:43,919 --> 00:55:47,286
Saturn in the 11th house-- a small
accident among friends.

871
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,888
Excuse me.

872
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:57,495
Let us begin.

873
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:15,340
Someone among us has come here
with the intent to deceive.

874
00:56:16,885 --> 00:56:20,753
I see a woman's hand and a ring.

875
00:56:20,822 --> 00:56:23,757
A ring that doesn't belong on that hand.

876
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:30,029
A tragic fate tore from this woman
the man she loved.

877
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:33,893
A dark cloud hangs over the man.

878
00:56:34,903 --> 00:56:36,530
The image is blurring.

879
00:56:37,072 --> 00:56:41,475
A car, with the man at the wheel.

880
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:43,977
He is dead.

881
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:46,809
Peter Barter.

882
00:56:47,048 --> 00:56:52,543
One person here saw him before he died...

883
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:57,146
and one person here will avenge his death.

884
00:56:58,994 --> 00:57:02,020
It won't be an easy task.

885
00:57:02,097 --> 00:57:05,396
The dark cloud is all-powerful.

886
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:09,100
It gathers and approaches...

887
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,104
ever closer!

888
00:57:11,673 --> 00:57:15,006
No, it's not a cloud.

889
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,808
It's a face.

890
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,347
The face of a dead man.

891
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:25,714
No, he's alive.

892
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:30,852
Mabuse. Dr. Mabuse.

893
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:36,258
Now it's gone. The dark cloud has returned.

894
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:38,993
Close, very close.

895
00:57:39,935 --> 00:57:43,462
It is here! It is hanging over--

896
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:45,936
Kras!

897
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:47,497
Get away from the window!

898
00:57:50,779 --> 00:57:52,804
Turn the lights off!

899
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:12,258
The shot came from either the roof
or the attic of that house.

900
00:58:12,334 --> 00:58:14,393
Kaiser, maybe we can still catch the guy!

901
00:58:17,238 --> 00:58:19,069
I'm not staying here any longer.

902
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,199
Would you please take me back to the hotel?

903
00:58:21,276 --> 00:58:23,267
Please don't leave me here alone.

904
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:25,643
The danger has passed.

905
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:27,682
I regret this turn of events.

906
00:58:27,749 --> 00:58:31,981
Perhaps some refreshments will help
you recover from the shock.

907
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:41,252
Mr. Cornelius...

908
00:58:44,032 --> 00:58:45,761
I admire your psychic gift.

909
00:58:45,834 --> 00:58:48,860
Really, it was fabulous! Amazing!

910
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:53,170
By the way, what was that strange
name you mentioned?

911
00:58:57,012 --> 00:59:00,504
I don't remember.
I have no control in this state.

912
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:02,482
It doesn't really matter.

913
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,814
By the way-- just between you and me--

914
00:59:04,886 --> 00:59:09,346
does this Inspector Kras have a
chance of living much longer?

915
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:12,120
I'm not omniscient, Mr. Mistelzweig.

916
00:59:12,193 --> 00:59:14,218
Well, he wants to buy life insurance from me...

917
00:59:14,295 --> 00:59:16,923
and I would appreciate certain tips.

918
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:20,832
I don't do business with the
lives of other people.

919
00:59:20,902 --> 00:59:22,802
Of course not. Please forgive me.

920
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:24,736
It was just a thought.

921
00:59:24,806 --> 00:59:29,209
By the way, did you notice
that the shot rang out...

922
00:59:29,277 --> 00:59:33,270
just as your grandfather clock
struck for the first time.

923
00:59:34,149 --> 00:59:37,607
- Is it accurate?
- I would assume it is.

924
00:59:37,685 --> 00:59:40,745
No, the clock is exactly one minute fast.

925
00:59:40,822 --> 00:59:42,847
Here, you see?

926
00:59:44,092 --> 00:59:45,855
Please forgive me. I forgot.

927
00:59:46,361 --> 00:59:48,591
You are blind.

928
00:59:48,663 --> 00:59:51,689
But don't you think that this
delay of one minute...

929
00:59:51,766 --> 00:59:54,667
may have saved the inspector's life?

930
00:59:55,503 --> 00:59:57,994
Well, Inspector? What did you find?

931
00:59:58,073 --> 00:59:59,540
Nothing.

932
00:59:59,607 --> 01:00:02,440
My assistant is still looking for clues...

933
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,603
but the man is long gone, of course.

934
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:07,409
Cornelius, I haven't had a chance to thank you.

935
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:09,814
But for your warning, I would be dead now.

936
01:00:09,884 --> 01:00:12,318
The bullet hit the chair exactly in the spot...

937
01:00:12,387 --> 01:00:14,651
where my head had been.

938
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:18,692
Strange.

939
01:00:19,627 --> 01:00:23,028
This is the second assassination attempt
directed at me in the last 48 hours.

940
01:00:23,098 --> 01:00:25,157
You are mistaken, Inspector.

941
01:00:25,233 --> 01:00:26,393
Why is that?

942
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:30,404
You forget that I had been sitting
in that chair earlier.

943
01:00:30,472 --> 01:00:33,441
This murder attempt was directed at me.

944
01:00:38,213 --> 01:00:41,114
I loved your roses so very much.

945
01:00:43,017 --> 01:00:46,043
- How did you get--
- I felt so alone in my room.

946
01:00:46,955 --> 01:00:50,948
Perhaps it's childish, but I'm always
so scared of thunderstorms.

947
01:00:51,025 --> 01:00:53,152
I hope you don't mind that I simply came by.

948
01:00:53,228 --> 01:00:56,026
- Your door was open.
- Please, come in.

949
01:00:58,266 --> 01:01:00,632
Am I really the reason you extended your stay?

950
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:05,139
I wanted to ask you one more thing
before I dive back into my work.

951
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:07,268
Yes?

952
01:01:07,342 --> 01:01:09,572
Do you prefer whiskey or cognac?

953
01:01:09,644 --> 01:01:12,670
Whiskey, please. Straight up.

954
01:01:13,515 --> 01:01:15,847
- Was that the question?
- No.

955
01:01:22,023 --> 01:01:24,389
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

956
01:01:25,693 --> 01:01:27,160
And the question?

957
01:01:27,228 --> 01:01:30,288
If you were available, would you marry me?

958
01:01:33,635 --> 01:01:36,160
I want to tell you the truth now, Henry.

959
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:39,036
The whole truth.

960
01:01:39,107 --> 01:01:41,974
In reality, my marriage is sheer hell.

961
01:01:42,877 --> 01:01:47,678
My husband has always been driven
by an almost pathological jealousy.

962
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,183
He has a physical disability.

963
01:01:50,852 --> 01:01:54,515
It's just a problem with his foot.
It never bothered me.

964
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:58,457
But it seems to be the main
reason for his jealousy.

965
01:01:59,694 --> 01:02:02,891
He is convinced that I'm cheating on him.

966
01:02:03,364 --> 01:02:06,731
Sometimes he would beat me
to extract a confession...

967
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:08,632
but there was nothing to confess.

968
01:02:08,703 --> 01:02:11,035
That's grounds for divorce!

969
01:02:12,674 --> 01:02:16,542
I have often suggested separation
to him. Very often.

970
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,808
He said he would rather kill
me than set me free.

971
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,148
Last year, I simply ran away.

972
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:28,987
I was a nervous wreck.

973
01:02:29,057 --> 01:02:31,457
That's when I ended up at Dr. Jordan's clinic.

974
01:02:31,526 --> 01:02:34,051
An old friend of our family.

975
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:38,292
When I recovered somewhat,
my husband took me back home...

976
01:02:38,366 --> 01:02:42,200
and the torture, threats and abuse
began all over again.

977
01:02:43,204 --> 01:02:46,435
Ten days ago, I completely lost control.

978
01:02:46,507 --> 01:02:48,737
I didn't care about anything.

979
01:02:49,544 --> 01:02:53,605
I obtained some poison and
intended to kill him...

980
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:57,146
but he found out and nearly beat me to death.

981
01:02:57,685 --> 01:03:01,553
I didn't know what to do, so I ran away again.

982
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:05,616
Just to get away from him.
That's how I ended up at the Luxor.

983
01:03:08,696 --> 01:03:10,527
But he tracked me down again.

984
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:13,931
He sent a telegram saying if I
didn't return immediately...

985
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:16,027
he would report me.

986
01:03:16,104 --> 01:03:18,038
So that's the story behind it all.

987
01:03:18,106 --> 01:03:22,167
I saw no other way out but to kill myself.

988
01:03:23,678 --> 01:03:25,873
So now you know the whole story.

989
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:28,515
Do you still want to marry me...

990
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,949
a woman who tried to poison her husband?

991
01:03:37,725 --> 01:03:41,821
Is Mrs. Menil there, Mr. Travers?
There's no answer in her room.

992
01:03:42,664 --> 01:03:45,098
It's for you. Professor Jordan.

993
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:46,963
The professor?

994
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,134
Yes? This is Marion.

995
01:03:51,472 --> 01:03:54,441
What? When?

996
01:03:54,909 --> 01:03:57,469
Oh, my God! Ten minutes ago?

997
01:04:00,782 --> 01:04:02,682
You'll stay at the clinic.

998
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,218
Yes, okay. Thank you.

999
01:04:05,286 --> 01:04:06,947
What's going on?

1000
01:04:07,488 --> 01:04:09,388
My husband is on his way to the hotel.

1001
01:04:09,457 --> 01:04:12,756
He'll be here any minute.
He mustn't find me in your room.

1002
01:04:12,827 --> 01:04:14,818
Stay here. You are safe with me.

1003
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:17,387
I can't drag you into this.
You don't know Roberto.

1004
01:04:17,465 --> 01:04:19,524
Please let me go!

1005
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,967
If I don't call you in half an hour,
come to my room.

1006
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:26,473
- Is it still raining?
- I'll call a bellboy--

1007
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:29,669
No, thanks. I'll take care of it myself.

1008
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:09,578
What is it? I've already gone to bed.

1009
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:12,346
Open the door if you don't want a scandal.

1010
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,285
Come back tomorrow.

1011
01:05:14,355 --> 01:05:16,880
If you don't open up, I'll kick in the door.

1012
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,892
That's it, darling. Why resist?

1013
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:31,800
I'm sorry if my sudden appearance...

1014
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:34,671
rattles your tender nerves.

1015
01:05:34,742 --> 01:05:37,370
A woman who loves her husband should
welcome him more joyfully.

1016
01:05:37,945 --> 01:05:39,879
More tenderly.

1017
01:05:40,648 --> 01:05:42,445
What do you want from me?

1018
01:05:42,517 --> 01:05:45,042
I'm not sure yet myself.

1019
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,053
We'll see.

1020
01:05:47,121 --> 01:05:50,056
It was quite stupid of you to run away again...

1021
01:05:50,124 --> 01:05:53,457
and to believe I wouldn't find you.

1022
01:05:53,528 --> 01:05:56,019
Just as stupid as your attempt to poison me.

1023
01:05:56,397 --> 01:05:59,560
You thought no one would miss
me if you succeeded.

1024
01:06:00,201 --> 01:06:05,298
Now, one word from me and you'll land in jail.

1025
01:06:05,373 --> 01:06:08,501
But this time you won't get
off the hook so easily.

1026
01:06:10,144 --> 01:06:12,169
Beautiful roses.

1027
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,145
From him, right?

1028
01:06:14,215 --> 01:06:16,479
Since your dramatic suicide attempt...

1029
01:06:16,551 --> 01:06:18,519
you've been in all the newspapers...

1030
01:06:18,586 --> 01:06:20,019
you and your new lover.

1031
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:23,556
You must be grateful to your savior.

1032
01:06:23,624 --> 01:06:25,455
That's best expressed...

1033
01:06:25,526 --> 01:06:30,020
with a few tender caresses, right?

1034
01:06:30,097 --> 01:06:32,088
You animal!

1035
01:06:38,406 --> 01:06:39,964
There!

1036
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,908
Does this pain your little heart?
You love him, don't you?

1037
01:06:42,977 --> 01:06:44,239
Yes, I love him!

1038
01:06:44,312 --> 01:06:46,974
I love him as much as I hate you. You hear me?

1039
01:06:47,048 --> 01:06:49,744
I don't regret for a second
that I wanted to kill you.

1040
01:06:49,817 --> 01:06:52,377
You're not human. You're a beast!

1041
01:06:54,589 --> 01:06:57,285
No so fast, my sweetheart. Not so fast.

1042
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:00,226
Let's see if the gentleman from America...

1043
01:07:00,294 --> 01:07:03,593
will still want you in bed
with your face cut up.

1044
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,245
Shoot him!

1045
01:07:34,495 --> 01:07:36,656
- How did you get in here?
- Through the mirror.

1046
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:39,165
The detective-- I'll explain everything.

1047
01:07:44,171 --> 01:07:47,299
Do you think anyone heard the shooting?

1048
01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:49,701
Wait.

1049
01:08:05,092 --> 01:08:08,118
- There's nobody outside.
- I'm going to call Dr.Jordan.

1050
01:08:08,195 --> 01:08:11,255
He must come right away.
Perhaps he can still save Roberto.

1051
01:08:19,006 --> 01:08:21,702
This is Marion, Professor.
Please come over right away.

1052
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:23,767
Something terrible has happened.

1053
01:08:25,446 --> 01:08:29,007
Perhaps you can still help him. Thank you.

1054
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,744
He's on his way.

1055
01:08:34,722 --> 01:08:38,055
- Where is my cognac?
- Here. I didn't know if you'd be back.

1056
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:40,992
An insurance agent always comes back.

1057
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:45,598
It's raining cats and dogs.

1058
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:52,432
You wouldn't kick a dog out in this weather.

1059
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:12,215
Dr. Jordan. Thank God you're here.

1060
01:09:13,127 --> 01:09:15,595
- I shot him.
- I must tell you, Professor--

1061
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,121
Believe me, it was self-defense.

1062
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:20,463
The knife is still lying there on the ground.

1063
01:09:47,695 --> 01:09:49,492
He's dead.

1064
01:09:49,563 --> 01:09:52,088
I didn't mean to kill him!

1065
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,530
Please help me, Professor.

1066
01:09:54,602 --> 01:09:57,765
You've got to help me out of this mess!

1067
01:09:57,838 --> 01:10:00,500
Please, Marion, calm down. Let me think.

1068
01:10:00,574 --> 01:10:02,667
Professor, I'm partially to blame--

1069
01:10:02,743 --> 01:10:04,938
I too am to blame, Mr. Travers.

1070
01:10:05,012 --> 01:10:07,344
I knew how dangerous this man was.

1071
01:10:07,415 --> 01:10:09,576
Perhaps if I had come right away--

1072
01:10:12,653 --> 01:10:16,589
The most important thing now is that
the police don't find out about this.

1073
01:10:16,657 --> 01:10:21,822
I had the ambulance park on a side
street, to avoid drawing attention.

1074
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:26,129
If we could just get the corpse
out of the hotel--

1075
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,634
A massive heart attack must be treated
in the hospital immediately.

1076
01:10:28,703 --> 01:10:33,299
Later, I could fill out the death certificate
to read "heart attack."

1077
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:36,775
But how do we get him out of the hotel?

1078
01:10:36,844 --> 01:10:40,974
The hotel detective will do anything for money.
Besides, he owes me one.

1079
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:44,479
And now it's time to go sleep in my empty bed.

1080
01:10:49,724 --> 01:10:51,851
Would you have an extra raincoat? I forgot mine.

1081
01:10:51,926 --> 01:10:54,793
I have an old one over there.
I'll get it for you.

1082
01:11:02,636 --> 01:11:05,969
- Here. Will this do?
- Yes, thank you.

1083
01:11:06,407 --> 01:11:09,342
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- That's okay.

1084
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,310
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Mistelzweig.

1085
01:11:11,378 --> 01:11:13,846
It's just a minor heart attack, madam.

1086
01:11:13,914 --> 01:11:16,212
Please don't be alarmed.

1087
01:11:16,283 --> 01:11:20,413
A few days of rest in my clinic
and he'll recover.

1088
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:22,479
Initially he will need to take
it easy, of course.

1089
01:11:22,556 --> 01:11:25,218
Nothing upsetting. No business.

1090
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:27,624
He'll need to put himself first now.

1091
01:11:27,695 --> 01:11:30,289
$5,000 in cash if you help us, Mr. Berg.

1092
01:11:30,364 --> 01:11:32,355
We don't want any commotion in the newspapers.

1093
01:11:32,433 --> 01:11:34,492
Naturally, Mr. Travers.

1094
01:11:34,568 --> 01:11:36,559
It's not in the interest of the hotel...

1095
01:11:36,637 --> 01:11:39,800
to create a stir in case of sudden illness.

1096
01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:43,105
How can we get Mr. Menil to the
ambulance without being seen?

1097
01:11:43,177 --> 01:11:45,338
That's easy. We use the freight elevator.

1098
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:47,073
And the broken mirror?

1099
01:11:47,148 --> 01:11:50,117
I'll have that fixed within the hour.
I'll wake up the maintenance man.

1100
01:11:50,184 --> 01:11:52,175
He lives in the hotel. He's my closest friend.

1101
01:12:35,095 --> 01:12:38,258
No sirens, no flashing lights.
We don't want any attention.

1102
01:12:39,033 --> 01:12:40,694
I'll follow in the car.

1103
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:43,236
I've known Professor Jordan since I was a child.

1104
01:12:43,304 --> 01:12:45,101
I knew he would do anything for me.

1105
01:12:45,172 --> 01:12:47,299
But if we had said that you fired the gun--

1106
01:12:47,374 --> 01:12:49,740
To think that I'm hiding behind a woman--

1107
01:12:50,578 --> 01:12:52,876
I always took responsibility for my actions.

1108
01:12:52,947 --> 01:12:55,814
If he hadn't been so quick,
I would have fired the shots.

1109
01:12:55,883 --> 01:13:00,013
But isn't this all beside the point?
You saved my life for the second time.

1110
01:13:00,354 --> 01:13:02,254
Even so.

1111
01:13:06,026 --> 01:13:09,655
Two hours ago, in this room...

1112
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:12,790
you asked me whether I would
marry you if I were free.

1113
01:13:14,301 --> 01:13:16,861
And now I am free.

1114
01:13:27,047 --> 01:13:32,110
This worked out fine once again,
just as the doctor predicted.

1115
01:13:32,186 --> 01:13:34,780
Precisely.

1116
01:13:35,122 --> 01:13:36,783
No!

1117
01:13:48,435 --> 01:13:51,529
What? What is it?

1118
01:13:51,605 --> 01:13:53,800
Patrol car 8 has detected a fire...

1119
01:13:53,874 --> 01:13:55,967
on the top floor of a bombed-out house.

1120
01:13:56,043 --> 01:13:57,943
There's a dead body in one of the rooms.

1121
01:13:58,012 --> 01:13:59,570
You wake me up for that?

1122
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:02,445
Franke is on night duty now. Let me sleep.

1123
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:05,282
What's that?

1124
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:09,414
A secret transmitter?

1125
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:12,186
Police files on Dr. Mabuse?

1126
01:14:21,502 --> 01:14:24,869
Strange place. No sign on the door. Nothing.

1127
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:27,134
When we saw the fire from the street...

1128
01:14:27,207 --> 01:14:30,301
my partner said, "No one lives there."

1129
01:14:30,811 --> 01:14:33,575
Then we found the body.

1130
01:14:41,789 --> 01:14:44,849
Shot in the chest, apparently
straight through the heart.

1131
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:47,723
First they killed him, and then they
tried to burn the place down.

1132
01:14:47,795 --> 01:14:50,559
We pulled down the curtains and
doused the sofa with water.

1133
01:14:50,631 --> 01:14:53,099
We were able to stomp out the rest.

1134
01:14:54,501 --> 01:14:57,197
- Any ID? Any papers?
- Nothing.

1135
01:15:10,684 --> 01:15:12,675
Nice of you to make time for me...

1136
01:15:12,753 --> 01:15:14,880
so early in the morning, Mr. Cornelius.

1137
01:15:14,955 --> 01:15:18,823
I was in the neighborhood and
thought I'd just drop by.

1138
01:15:19,293 --> 01:15:23,354
Isn't the little doggie here today?

1139
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:26,422
A routine checkup at the veterinarian.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

1140
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,525
What can I do for you, Mr. Mistelzweig?

1141
01:15:28,602 --> 01:15:33,062
Well, I thought, "Maybe you can
do business with Mr. Cornelius."

1142
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,040
With me? Business?

1143
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:38,237
Don't worry. I don't want to insure you.

1144
01:15:38,312 --> 01:15:40,212
I just want--

1145
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,941
- Mind if I smoke?
- Please.

1146
01:15:42,016 --> 01:15:44,780
I know it's a bad habit of mine, but--

1147
01:15:46,653 --> 01:15:49,019
Did I startle you?

1148
01:15:49,356 --> 01:15:53,224
I unseated you, so to speak, in this charade.

1149
01:15:53,293 --> 01:15:57,252
You know, this blind-man ploy is really great.

1150
01:15:57,331 --> 01:15:59,128
Yes, really.

1151
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:03,633
When you take off the sunglasses
and stare into the distance--

1152
01:16:03,804 --> 01:16:05,465
Very attractive.

1153
01:16:05,539 --> 01:16:07,234
Really stylish.

1154
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:11,139
And the contact lenses-- like
in an American horror film.

1155
01:16:12,112 --> 01:16:14,205
Come now!

1156
01:16:14,515 --> 01:16:16,574
Don't do anything stupid.

1157
01:16:17,951 --> 01:16:19,885
The phone is going to ring soon.

1158
01:16:19,953 --> 01:16:21,648
A friend of mine.

1159
01:16:21,722 --> 01:16:24,316
I took the liberty of giving him
your phone number...

1160
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:27,189
just as a precaution so that nothing happens.

1161
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:32,291
What do you want from me?

1162
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:37,633
I want to go into business
with you. Fifty-fifty.

1163
01:16:37,704 --> 01:16:41,572
During the séance the day before
yesterday, I had this idea.

1164
01:16:41,642 --> 01:16:46,079
You know, people are so scared
when it comes to insurance.

1165
01:16:46,547 --> 01:16:50,677
If you, with your clairvoyance, advise
them to protect their families...

1166
01:16:50,751 --> 01:16:53,720
then they'll all come running to me, you see?

1167
01:16:54,421 --> 01:16:56,048
That's him.

1168
01:16:57,357 --> 01:16:59,018
Yes, I'm still here.

1169
01:16:59,093 --> 01:17:01,789
No, not much longer. A few more minutes.

1170
01:17:02,396 --> 01:17:05,024
I'll be in touch, yes.

1171
01:17:05,432 --> 01:17:07,491
No police-- don't worry.

1172
01:17:07,701 --> 01:17:09,726
By the way, this Kras character--

1173
01:17:09,803 --> 01:17:14,069
Didn't you wonder why he would
drag me to your séance?

1174
01:17:14,308 --> 01:17:16,674
He wants to keep an eye on me.

1175
01:17:16,743 --> 01:17:19,439
I've done time. Five years.

1176
01:17:20,514 --> 01:17:24,780
Insurance fraud. I've learned a lot since then.

1177
01:17:24,852 --> 01:17:28,879
And the two of us will come out
on top of that Kras guy, right?

1178
01:17:28,956 --> 01:17:32,119
Think it over, Cornelius. Fifty-fifty.

1179
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:36,261
The projectile that hit the psychic's chair...

1180
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,321
and the bullet in the corpse...

1181
01:17:38,398 --> 01:17:40,662
are of the same caliber and have
the same rifling marks.

1182
01:17:40,734 --> 01:17:43,532
They clearly come from the same gun.

1183
01:17:44,404 --> 01:17:46,463
Very interesting.

1184
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,371
Thank you very much.

1185
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:53,073
- Any word from Mistelzweig?
- No, he was asked to come at 11:00 p.m.

1186
01:17:53,147 --> 01:17:55,138
But Interpol's answer just came in.

1187
01:17:55,215 --> 01:17:57,012
Mistelzweig, Hieronymus Balthazar.

1188
01:17:57,084 --> 01:17:58,949
Insurance agent with many years of experience.

1189
01:17:59,019 --> 01:18:01,817
Best references from Lloyd's of London.
No prior convictions.

1190
01:18:02,089 --> 01:18:04,887
I still don't like his mug.

1191
01:18:07,194 --> 01:18:09,492
The embodiment of promptness, right?

1192
01:18:13,567 --> 01:18:15,535
What happened to your right hand?

1193
01:18:15,602 --> 01:18:18,036
A small scuffle ending in death, perhaps?

1194
01:18:18,105 --> 01:18:22,804
Inspector! A peace-loving man like me?

1195
01:18:22,876 --> 01:18:25,344
- Have you ever been bitten by a dog?
- No.

1196
01:18:25,412 --> 01:18:28,609
Good for you. It hurts terribly,
let me tell you.

1197
01:18:28,682 --> 01:18:33,176
Last night I was going home when
a huge dog jumped at me...

1198
01:18:33,253 --> 01:18:35,585
and wouldn't let go.

1199
01:18:35,656 --> 01:18:39,456
And this should happen to me, a real dog lover!

1200
01:18:41,295 --> 01:18:44,389
You left me a message, Inspector.
You wanted to talk to me.

1201
01:18:44,998 --> 01:18:46,829
Was it because of the séance last night?

1202
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,492
No.

1203
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:51,431
But I want to show you something.

1204
01:18:59,246 --> 01:19:02,909
Well, that's life.

1205
01:19:02,983 --> 01:19:06,817
"Yesterday on a steed abreast,
today a bullet in the chest."

1206
01:19:06,887 --> 01:19:09,082
- How did you know that?
- What?

1207
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:11,954
That the man was shot in the heart.
You couldn't see that.

1208
01:19:12,025 --> 01:19:15,085
Inspector, I was just quoting an old song...

1209
01:19:15,162 --> 01:19:17,027
and right away you're suspicious again.

1210
01:19:17,097 --> 01:19:19,725
Shot through the heart. Awful.

1211
01:19:20,334 --> 01:19:22,996
One moment a man is running
around alive and well...

1212
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:25,630
and twelve hours later he's dead.

1213
01:19:25,839 --> 01:19:28,069
- Stone-dead.
- So you know him then.

1214
01:19:28,141 --> 01:19:31,372
That would be pushing it.
I saw him last night at the Luxor.

1215
01:19:31,445 --> 01:19:34,539
I noticed him because of his clubfoot.
He has one, doesn't he?

1216
01:19:35,148 --> 01:19:36,308
Just what I thought.

1217
01:19:36,383 --> 01:19:39,546
He went up to the third floor
where Mrs. Menil is staying.

1218
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,487
By the way, it's strange.
Did you know that she checked out?

1219
01:19:42,556 --> 01:19:44,547
She's leaving with the American today.

1220
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,684
Let's say good-bye to the professor
and then we'll go.

1221
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,749
What's the number?

1222
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:49,796
4-2-5...

1223
01:19:49,863 --> 01:19:51,956
5-2-7.

1224
01:19:54,234 --> 01:19:56,031
Say...

1225
01:19:56,103 --> 01:19:59,971
last night when you called him,
you only dialed three digits.

1226
01:20:00,607 --> 01:20:02,438
- Three?
- Yes.

1227
01:20:03,343 --> 01:20:06,744
You must be mistaken.
I've known Jordan's number for years.

1228
01:20:06,813 --> 01:20:09,008
It's 425-527.

1229
01:20:09,082 --> 01:20:10,640
And there's something else.

1230
01:20:10,717 --> 01:20:13,550
How could the professor get
here so quickly last night...

1231
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,713
just five minutes after your call...

1232
01:20:15,789 --> 01:20:17,347
and with an ambulance?

1233
01:20:17,424 --> 01:20:20,359
For God's sake, don't say anything now.
They can hear and see everything.

1234
01:20:20,427 --> 01:20:22,554
- Who can hear and see everything?
- Later, later!

1235
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:25,996
We must leave this hotel as soon
as possible, or it's all over!

1236
01:20:26,066 --> 01:20:28,762
What are you talking about?
What are you afraid of?

1237
01:20:28,835 --> 01:20:31,065
There! Look!

1238
01:20:31,138 --> 01:20:33,038
And there are more over there! And over there!

1239
01:20:33,106 --> 01:20:34,937
Everywhere in this hotel.

1240
01:20:35,008 --> 01:20:37,306
In the bar, in every room, in the nightclub.

1241
01:20:37,377 --> 01:20:39,607
They can observe everything.

1242
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,580
- We must leave immediately.
- But--

1243
01:20:41,648 --> 01:20:43,980
Please! Please believe me!

1244
01:20:44,284 --> 01:20:46,582
Listen, Henry. I lied to you.

1245
01:20:46,653 --> 01:20:48,587
I was lying the whole time!

1246
01:20:48,655 --> 01:20:52,113
But now you have to believe me, just this once.

1247
01:20:52,192 --> 01:20:54,990
- Please! Before it's too late.
- Why?

1248
01:20:55,062 --> 01:20:57,360
For God's sake, don't ask any
more questions now.

1249
01:20:57,431 --> 01:21:00,332
Come on, before it's too late. Come on!

1250
01:21:17,984 --> 01:21:19,178
Twelve...

1251
01:21:19,252 --> 01:21:20,446
eleven...

1252
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,784
ten, nine.

1253
01:21:22,856 --> 01:21:25,950
I'd like to know if Mrs. Menil is
still staying at the hotel...

1254
01:21:26,026 --> 01:21:28,358
or if she and Mr. Travers have already left.

1255
01:21:28,428 --> 01:21:31,261
They must still be here, probably
in Mr. Travers suite.

1256
01:21:31,331 --> 01:21:33,993
- I can call to check for you.
- Thanks, but no need. I'll go up.

1257
01:21:34,534 --> 01:21:36,195
- But tell me--
- Don't speak.

1258
01:21:36,269 --> 01:21:38,931
They can hear us here too.
First we have to get out of here.

1259
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:43,839
You slut.

1260
01:22:02,262 --> 01:22:04,321
Go on!

1261
01:22:11,638 --> 01:22:15,438
No, no. You know this place.
You've been here often enough.

1262
01:23:20,307 --> 01:23:22,172
Mrs. Menil?

1263
01:23:32,252 --> 01:23:33,719
Let him search all he likes.

1264
01:23:33,787 --> 01:23:36,722
The woman will bleed to death without a doctor.

1265
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:38,781
Don't worry. The doctor will be here shortly.

1266
01:23:38,859 --> 01:23:41,259
But if she's lucky, she'll croak
before he gets here.

1267
01:23:46,032 --> 01:23:47,829
Let's go.

1268
01:23:58,078 --> 01:24:00,603
We're in deep trouble, thanks to this bitch.

1269
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,739
She would have jumped ship in America anyway.

1270
01:24:02,816 --> 01:24:05,910
She loves him. A blind man could see it.

1271
01:24:06,419 --> 01:24:08,148
A blind man.

1272
01:24:08,355 --> 01:24:10,585
Do you realize we're the last ones...

1273
01:24:10,657 --> 01:24:12,648
to know about this control room?

1274
01:24:12,726 --> 01:24:16,059
Aside from him, of course.
Doesn't that make you a bit uneasy?

1275
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:19,494
I don't know. I have a strange feeling.

1276
01:24:19,566 --> 01:24:21,830
When that reporter Barter surprised you...

1277
01:24:21,902 --> 01:24:24,336
as you were replacing the defective
camera in her room...

1278
01:24:24,404 --> 01:24:26,634
he was stone-dead within the hour.

1279
01:24:26,706 --> 01:24:28,196
Number 11 -- dead.

1280
01:24:28,275 --> 01:24:30,209
Last night, when the clubfoot
had completed his mission...

1281
01:24:30,277 --> 01:24:32,040
and was no longer needed-- gone.

1282
01:24:32,145 --> 01:24:35,581
And now that this thing with the
American has failed completely...

1283
01:24:35,649 --> 01:24:37,981
do you think we're still useful to him?

1284
01:24:38,051 --> 01:24:40,747
Who built this whole system for him? I did.

1285
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:44,347
Who obtained the old Gestapo plans
and switched it all over to TV? I did.

1286
01:24:44,424 --> 01:24:46,358
He made millions with this thing.

1287
01:24:46,426 --> 01:24:49,589
- He won't just get rid of me.
- He's capable of anything.

1288
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:54,658
From here he saw and heard everything...

1289
01:24:55,335 --> 01:24:57,769
and could play the role of the psychic.

1290
01:24:59,606 --> 01:25:02,700
Then he blackmailed his victims.

1291
01:25:04,911 --> 01:25:07,209
My suicide attempt--

1292
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,113
The clubfoot and l-- It was all a sham.

1293
01:25:10,383 --> 01:25:13,477
There was nothing but blanks in my revolver.

1294
01:25:14,688 --> 01:25:16,349
You didn't kill anyone.

1295
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:19,315
But why? Why all this?

1296
01:25:19,392 --> 01:25:22,589
To create a bond between us.

1297
01:25:23,496 --> 01:25:28,661
In America, after our wedding,
they would have killed you.

1298
01:25:32,172 --> 01:25:37,132
I would have inherited everything--
your fortune, your industrial plants--

1299
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:39,940
and then he would have come.

1300
01:25:40,013 --> 01:25:43,244
His desire for power knows no limits.

1301
01:25:47,053 --> 01:25:49,112
I had to do what he wanted...

1302
01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:52,352
but I would have told you everything
once we boarded the plane.

1303
01:25:54,594 --> 01:25:57,188
But now it's too late.

1304
01:25:57,263 --> 01:25:59,493
I love you.

1305
01:25:59,566 --> 01:26:02,592
I know you can't believe me anymore.

1306
01:26:03,803 --> 01:26:06,601
It's too late now. Too late.

1307
01:26:06,673 --> 01:26:08,868
They simply disappeared, Inspector.

1308
01:26:08,942 --> 01:26:11,604
Mr. Berg believes they must have
sneaked out of the hotel...

1309
01:26:11,678 --> 01:26:15,045
but neither the concierge nor
the two bellboys saw them.

1310
01:26:15,115 --> 01:26:17,777
Also, they haven't yet settled their bill...

1311
01:26:17,851 --> 01:26:19,910
and some of Travers' belongings
are still in his room.

1312
01:26:19,986 --> 01:26:22,614
Don't call an alarm just yet.
I'll come over myself.

1313
01:26:36,302 --> 01:26:38,327
- What's new?
- The autopsy report.

1314
01:26:38,405 --> 01:26:40,396
The clubfoot that came in last night.
No internal bleeding.

1315
01:26:40,473 --> 01:26:43,067
When he was shot in the heart, he had
already been dead for a while.

1316
01:26:43,143 --> 01:26:45,805
The true cause of death was
a steel needle in his brain.

1317
01:27:10,303 --> 01:27:12,066
Open up.

1318
01:27:18,044 --> 01:27:21,036
Close the door behind me.
Send the elevator upstairs.

1319
01:27:25,518 --> 01:27:28,646
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Travers...

1320
01:27:28,722 --> 01:27:31,350
that you found out about my plans.

1321
01:27:37,197 --> 01:27:39,427
You and I have both lost.

1322
01:27:39,499 --> 01:27:42,935
I lost a big game and you lost your life.

1323
01:27:43,002 --> 01:27:44,697
Do you want to push your infamy...

1324
01:27:44,771 --> 01:27:47,399
to the point of letting this
woman bleed to death?

1325
01:27:47,474 --> 01:27:49,533
A painless death, Mr. Travers...

1326
01:27:50,443 --> 01:27:53,173
and faster than the death she
could have expected from me.

1327
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,475
This woman brought both of us down:

1328
01:27:56,549 --> 01:27:59,279
You, because you believed in her love...

1329
01:27:59,352 --> 01:28:01,149
and me, because I didn't believe...

1330
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:04,657
this love could break my hypnotic control.

1331
01:28:04,724 --> 01:28:06,749
Marion was hypnotized?

1332
01:28:06,826 --> 01:28:10,284
Do you think she could have pulled off
that little suicide farce otherwise...

1333
01:28:10,363 --> 01:28:12,058
without falling?

1334
01:28:12,732 --> 01:28:15,633
Do you believe, even if you had
indeed gained control...

1335
01:28:15,702 --> 01:28:17,533
of my enterprises through Marion...

1336
01:28:17,604 --> 01:28:20,767
you would have become the sole owner
of all my financial assets?

1337
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,070
Who said anything about money?

1338
01:28:23,143 --> 01:28:26,271
Having gained control of your nuclear plant...

1339
01:28:26,346 --> 01:28:28,576
I would have thrown the world into chaos...

1340
01:28:28,648 --> 01:28:30,980
with the rockets from your experimental plant.

1341
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,450
The famous push of a button.

1342
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,010
I would have done it.

1343
01:28:35,088 --> 01:28:38,251
- You are insane.
- Maybe.

1344
01:28:38,324 --> 01:28:40,952
But where's the line?

1345
01:28:41,027 --> 01:28:42,722
Insane.

1346
01:28:42,796 --> 01:28:45,287
That's what they said about Dr. Mabuse...

1347
01:28:45,365 --> 01:28:50,029
who died 25 years ago and whose
name and plans I used.

1348
01:28:50,403 --> 01:28:54,965
His arrogant contemporaries
considered him a criminal.

1349
01:28:55,942 --> 01:28:58,809
But to me he was a genius...

1350
01:28:58,878 --> 01:29:02,473
who wanted to throw this rotten
world into a reign of chaos...

1351
01:29:02,549 --> 01:29:05,177
that could only be controlled by the one man...

1352
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:08,414
who knows how to harness
it for his own gain-- me!

1353
01:29:14,894 --> 01:29:17,226
All your plans end with my death.

1354
01:29:19,065 --> 01:29:23,297
What can I offer you to at least
save the life of this woman?

1355
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:25,838
Name your price.

1356
01:29:26,773 --> 01:29:30,800
I'm not speaking on my own behalf.
I know you can't let me live.

1357
01:29:32,745 --> 01:29:35,509
I admire your keen intelligence, Mr. Travers.

1358
01:29:35,582 --> 01:29:37,573
- Then name your price.
- Police officers!

1359
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,744
Act rationally, now that your
plans have fallen through.

1360
01:29:42,021 --> 01:29:44,114
You underestimate me, Mr. Travers.

1361
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:47,216
A check signed by you would be my undoing...

1362
01:29:48,328 --> 01:29:51,024
and that's what you're hoping
to achieve, isn't it?

1363
01:29:54,267 --> 01:29:56,701
Their things are still sitting here.

1364
01:30:03,443 --> 01:30:05,377
- Did you touch anything?
- Of course not.

1365
01:30:05,445 --> 01:30:06,935
Everything's empty next door.

1366
01:30:07,013 --> 01:30:09,538
They are searching for you already,
but they won't find you...

1367
01:30:09,616 --> 01:30:12,414
or at least not until it's too late-- for you.

1368
01:30:23,997 --> 01:30:27,524
I have no more time to chat with you.

1369
01:30:28,268 --> 01:30:29,860
Here...

1370
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:33,933
just in case you want to act logically...

1371
01:30:34,007 --> 01:30:35,804
to escape a slow death from starvation.

1372
01:30:47,353 --> 01:30:49,048
By the way...

1373
01:30:49,555 --> 01:30:52,547
this room is soundproof.

1374
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,228
- Wait here for further instructions.
- Yes, sir.

1375
01:31:03,303 --> 01:31:05,965
We must systematically search
the entire hotel...

1376
01:31:06,039 --> 01:31:07,666
from the basement to the top floor.

1377
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:10,800
The exits are being watched.
Kaiser, you stay here.

1378
01:31:35,702 --> 01:31:38,762
The hotel is surrounded. Two officers
in front, a patrol car in back.

1379
01:31:40,006 --> 01:31:43,772
There's the main entrance and the
hallway, back there on the right.

1380
01:31:49,882 --> 01:31:51,577
Professor Jordan! Cornelius!

1381
01:31:59,692 --> 01:32:01,455
Go get him!

1382
01:32:03,629 --> 01:32:05,563
The blond man there is Dr. Mabuse!

1383
01:32:06,199 --> 01:32:07,689
Freeze!

1384
01:32:11,237 --> 01:32:13,501
Three men come with me. The rest of you,
don't let anyone through!

1385
01:32:19,512 --> 01:32:21,707
Get away from the wheel!

1386
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,300
Cuff him!

1387
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:53,037
It was about time. He almost killed me.

1388
01:32:53,112 --> 01:32:55,637
- Goddamn it, who are you really?
- Interpol.

1389
01:32:55,715 --> 01:32:57,205
- But why?
- Later!

1390
01:32:57,283 --> 01:32:58,944
I know where Mrs. Menil and the American are.

1391
01:32:59,018 --> 01:33:02,010
- Send them after the car!
- Get the patrol car!

1392
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,219
A large gray sedan...

1393
01:33:09,962 --> 01:33:11,930
an American car...

1394
01:33:11,998 --> 01:33:15,798
GX 737.

1395
01:33:31,017 --> 01:33:33,349
Kras, homicide squad. Start search immediately.

1396
01:33:33,419 --> 01:33:37,879
A large gray sedan, American-made,
license number GX 737.

1397
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,294
Turn on the police radio.

1398
01:33:43,596 --> 01:33:46,360
All patrol cars and road
blocks are instructed...

1399
01:33:46,432 --> 01:33:49,094
to stop the suspect vehicle...

1400
01:33:49,168 --> 01:33:51,398
and arrest the passengers.

1401
01:33:51,471 --> 01:33:53,496
Exercise caution. The suspects
have machine guns.

1402
01:33:53,573 --> 01:33:57,703
I repeat: a large gray sedan, license GX 737--

1403
01:33:57,777 --> 01:33:59,711
Change the license plate.

1404
01:34:03,316 --> 01:34:06,911
A large American car, license plate unknown...

1405
01:34:06,986 --> 01:34:09,386
exceeding the posted speed limit...

1406
01:34:09,455 --> 01:34:12,322
has just left Mühlendamm Street
and is now heading south.

1407
01:34:12,859 --> 01:34:17,592
This is Kras. Close all southbound
roads, if it's not too late.

1408
01:34:17,663 --> 01:34:19,528
He most likely wants to get on the freeway.

1409
01:34:19,599 --> 01:34:24,161
Then send a coded message that
Route 16 will be closed.

1410
01:34:24,237 --> 01:34:26,865
In case those guys are listening, send
a false, unencoded message...

1411
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:29,635
saying that we expect them to
break through at Neustadt.

1412
01:34:29,709 --> 01:34:32,041
Send four motor cycles for backup.

1413
01:34:32,111 --> 01:34:34,045
- We'll meet at Südstern.
- Understood.

1414
01:34:34,113 --> 01:34:36,843
And ask them at the Luxor whether
the damn Interpol guy...

1415
01:34:36,916 --> 01:34:38,713
found the American and that darn female.

1416
01:34:38,784 --> 01:34:40,581
Come on, get in.

1417
01:34:44,957 --> 01:34:46,618
The key!

1418
01:34:47,193 --> 01:34:48,990
The key for down below!

1419
01:34:51,697 --> 01:34:54,029
Open up!

1420
01:35:02,308 --> 01:35:03,673
Police!

1421
01:36:00,233 --> 01:36:03,202
Double K, EKZ 302.

1422
01:36:03,269 --> 01:36:05,703
Reached square sequence. Over.

1423
01:36:06,272 --> 01:36:10,038
Good nose! Freeway southeast. Come on, let's go!

1424
01:36:10,109 --> 01:36:12,202
A large American car, license plate unknown...

1425
01:36:12,278 --> 01:36:14,712
has just passed a checkpoint,
apparently bound for Neustadt.

1426
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,873
All roads to Neustadt have been closed.

1427
01:36:16,949 --> 01:36:18,940
Let 'em look for us! That's 35 miles away.

1428
01:36:19,018 --> 01:36:21,111
It could be a ruse. We've been
on the freeway too long.

1429
01:36:21,187 --> 01:36:22,518
Hold on!

1430
01:36:30,863 --> 01:36:34,264
Double K, FKA 7 is running. Over.

1431
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:37,769
Damn! The freeway reports no contact,
but they should have passed it.

1432
01:36:37,837 --> 01:36:41,796
They must have broken through
between mile 135 and mile 140.

1433
01:36:44,977 --> 01:36:47,309
At the next crossing, get off
onto the old highway.

1434
01:36:51,717 --> 01:36:53,844
There they are! Faster! Get ready.

1435
01:36:56,656 --> 01:36:59,352
A patrol car and four motor
cycles are following us.

1436
01:36:59,425 --> 01:37:02,485
- Distance?
- About 300 yards.

1437
01:37:02,628 --> 01:37:04,858
Don't shoot yet. Let them get closer.

1438
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:06,454
I'm slowing down.

1439
01:37:06,532 --> 01:37:08,693
150.

1440
01:37:08,768 --> 01:37:10,235
100.

1441
01:37:10,303 --> 01:37:11,827
Now!

1442
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:32,890
Shoot at the tires!

1443
01:37:34,627 --> 01:37:37,095
Damn! I need to put in a new magazine.

1444
01:37:47,807 --> 01:37:50,367
Leave him there! Let's go!
