by the name of Caligari

111
00:59:21,227 --> 00:59:26,073
toured the fairs of numerous villages
in northern Italy,

112
00:59:26,274 --> 00:59:32,037
accompanied by a somnambulist
named Cesare...

113
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:44,592
For month he sowed panic amongst
village folks through a series

114
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:52,308
of foul murders committed under
almost identical circumstances.

115
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:17,583
He had entirely subjugated to his mill
a somnambulist named Cesare,

116
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:23,589
whom he did compel to carry out
his nefarious schemes.

A puppet, the exact likeness of Cesare,
and which took his place in a cabinet,

118
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:42,796
allowed him to divert any suspicion
that might fall on the somnambulist.

<i>to perform acts that in a waking state
he would never commit</i>

128
01:03:23,928 --> 01:03:27,148
<i>and would be repugnant to him.</i>

129
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:35,349
<i>Whether it is true that a sleepwalker
can be led to commit... even murder!</i>

130
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:53,549
An obsession.

131
01:04:23,771 --> 01:04:30,587
"I must know everything...
I must penetrate his secrets...

132
01:04:30,788 --> 01:04:35,308

"... and from that day on,
the madman never again left his cell."

140
01:12:23,093 --> 01:12:26,270
"Look! There's Cesare...

141
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:34,236
Never allow him to tell your fortune
...or you're dead..."

142
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:13,317
"Jane, I love you...

143
01:13:13,518 --> 01:13:18,948
won't you be my wife at last?"

144
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:35,741
"We queens are not free to
answer the call of our heart..."

145
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:22,503
"You all think that I'm insane!
It isn't true...

146
01:14:22,704 --> 01:14:27,458
It's the director who's insane!!"

147
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:36,025
"He is Caligari...
