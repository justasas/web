HOMICIDE EMERGENCY SQUAD

8
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:15,864
Homicide squad,
Neuber speaking.

00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:18,839
"Criminal Psychology"
For you, boss. Mr. Cornelius.

10
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:21,035
Oh, my gosh!

11
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,135
The clairvoyant character.
Get rid of him.

12
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:28,377
Think about it. He helped us solve
that prostitute murder case.

13
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:33,450
Inspector Kras.

14
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,847
This is Cornelius.

15
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:38,826
You may still be in time to prevent
something terrible from happening.

16
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:41,787
I had a vision.

17
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,224
And?

18
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:49,169
Two cars right next to each other
in the middle of traffic.

19
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:52,230
A street sign: " Hansaring."

20
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:55,402
I don't know the people involved,
I don't know the circumstances...

21
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:57,241
but I sense an impending disaster.

22
00:02:57,313 --> 00:02:58,974
A crime.

23
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:01,346
Murder!

24
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,130
"Television Station"
Where on earth is Barter?

25
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,369
The broadcast begins
in 30 seconds.

26
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:30,674
He should be here any minute. He called
about 1 5 minutes ago, all excited.

27
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,806
- He has some big scoop.
- Broadcast time is still the same.

28
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:35,316
Hurry up, hurry up.

29
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:37,545
Silence in the studio!

30
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,644
In two seconds.

31
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:40,916
Ladies and gentlemen...

32
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,393
unfortunately we must cancel
our news report.

33
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:50,592
We just received the horrible news
that our reporter Peter Barter...

34
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,432
died on his way to the studio
behind the wheel of his car...

35
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,335
presumably of heart failure.

36
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,066
Doctor!

37
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,165
Mission accomplished.

38
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:03,178
Good. Change the license plate
on the car.

39
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,009
Remove the transmitter.

40
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:07,606
Have the car painted immediately
and disposed of in Holland.

41
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:11,576
Have you ever seen
the doctor?

42
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:15,112
What concern is that of yours?
Aren't you satisfied with your salary?

43
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,988
I'm just asking.

44
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:19,823
I'd like to know
what he looks like.

45
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:23,332
Then you might as well order
a coffin for yourself.

46
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,960
Do you remember
the American?

47
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:29,869
He too wanted to speak
to the doctor in person.

48
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,430
They found him
a few hours later.

49
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:35,575
His throat had been cut.

50
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,714
But I really want to know
what the doctor looks like.

51
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:44,412
That I don't know.

52
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:48,389
Don't expect me to explain
clairvoyance to you, Inspector.

53
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,189
Magic powers
defy rational thought.

54
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:56,755
I feel the disaster looming.
I see it as if in horrible daydreams.

55
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:59,960
I myself suffer terribly from it,
for I can't stop it...

56
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:04,632
because, like a dark cloud,
some hostile force of black magic...

57
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:08,040
obscures my view
at the decisive moment.

58
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,841
Thus leaving a little bit of work
for the police.

59
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,214
By the way, did you know
the reporter, this Barter?

60
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:19,485
About a year ago,
shortly after I settled here...

61
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:21,887
he visited me once or twice.

62
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,358
He was always looking
for the sensational...

63
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:27,328
and he was a skeptic, like you.

64
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:30,388
That's a professional proclivity,
my dear Cornelius.

65
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,529
Unfortunately, a policeman can't afford
to mess around with magical powers...

66
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:37,732
and I rarely have anything to do
with dark clouds.

67
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:40,603
lf, like me, you had grown up
in Ireland...

68
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:43,577
where people still believe
in the elementary powers of nature...

69
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:46,206
you might think differently.

70
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:50,311
But perhaps the blind see more
than those who have sight.

71
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:54,516
Possibly, but in the Barter case
this vision has failed you.

72
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,218
Maybe you were also thrown off
by your dark cloud.

73
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:01,795
This was no murder,
my dear Cornelius.

74
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:04,526
It was a simple heart attack.

75
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,573
For you, Inspector.

76
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,114
Take it to the lab right away!
I'll be back in an hour.

77
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:27,919
You were right.

78
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:31,650
The autopsy revealed that
Barter didn't die of a heart attack...

79
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:35,760
but of a steel needle
in his brain.

80
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:38,499
Material: the finest iridium steel.

81
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:41,559
Length: 1 .5 1 inches.

82
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:45,630
The steel needle smoothly penetrated
the victim's skull bone...

83
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:49,872
and entered the brain without leaving
any visible trace on the outside.

84
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:53,176
We're not going to find
anything here either.

85
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:05,917
"To my dearest Peter,
with much love...

86
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:07,986
on the occasion
of our first Christmas together.

87
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:09,588
Corinna."

88
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:13,258
His girlfriend.

89
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,269
Poor guy.

90
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,970
"TV Journal - Peter Barter"

91
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:26,345
Not a shred of paper left.

92
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,712
They even took the blotter.

93
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,815
- The audiotapes were also taken.
- Of course.

94
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:42,290
They were searching for evidence
of Barter's sensational scoop.

95
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:46,225
And if there was anything here,
I'm sure they found it.

96
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:57,173
You won't find any fingerprints.
These were no beginners.

97
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:03,717
All we have is
a small, deadly steel needle.

98
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:05,913
An incredible weapon, gentlemen.

99
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:09,924
An air gun that shoots steel needles
absolutely silently.

100
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,927
It's a new infantry weapon...

101
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:17,159
tested at Fort Benning
in the United States.

102
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,902
But here's something strange:

103
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,906
Before the weapon could go
into full-scale production...

104
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,965
the blueprints disappeared.

105
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,976
They were stolen.

106
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:33,003
U.S. military intelligence
found the thief--

107
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:35,673
a U.S. soldier in Germany--

108
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,811
in a deserted bunker
with his throat cut.

109
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:41,254
He had been gruesomely mutilated
and apparently tortured.

110
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:43,382
The blueprints were, of course,
nowhere to be found.

111
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:46,792
- When did this happen?
- About a year ago.

112
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:50,889
There's no doubt that it was this steel
needle gun that caused Barter's death.

113
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,456
I don't know.

114
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:56,301
This Barter murder case reminds me
of something that happened long ago.

115
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:57,896
Gentlemen...

116
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:01,067
does the name Dr. Mabuse
mean anything to you?

117
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:02,576
- Never heard of him.
- No.

118
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:04,476
A criminal genius.

119
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:07,983
He wanted to shock the world
with terrorist acts...

120
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,712
undermining governments...

121
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:14,654
and establishing
a fantastic reign of crime.

122
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,821
He ended up in an insane asylum,
where he wrote a kind of last will...

123
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:21,692
instructions for the crimes
he was planning.

124
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:24,494
In 1 932 he died, insane.

125
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:29,300
But if you talk
to old-time criminals...

126
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,498
they all say
that Dr. Mabuse isn't dead.

127
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,269
He can't die.

128
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:34,969
Cock-and-bull stories!

129
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:38,673
How could you even think of this--
What was the name again?

130
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:41,272
Dr. Mabuse.

131
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,376
In those days, I was a young assistant
on the homicide squad...

132
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,546
and we had a similar case there.

133
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:51,184
A man was shot behind the wheel
of his car from another vehicle.

134
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,957
The Barter case strikes me as
an exact copy of Dr. Mabuse's methods.

135
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,021
You said he was
no longer alive.

136
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:58,361
Well...

137
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:01,733
I have seen his dead body
with my own eyes, but--

138
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:03,704
Why haven't we heard anything
about this case?

139
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,433
The case never made
criminal history...

140
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:07,498
because Hitler appeared on the scene,
and the whole Nazi nightmare.

141
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:10,773
But there must be files
on the Mabuse case.

142
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:39,697
This is number eight.

143
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,606
Switch it on.

144
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:45,273
Decoding is active.
Write it down.

145
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:50,281
This is Dr. Mabuse speaking.

146
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:55,386
Four days ago...

147
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:58,449
the American Henry W. Taylor
arrived in town.

148
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,622
The British foreign office
just agreed.

149
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:04,359
Good.

150
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:10,230
- Gentlemen?
- We accept.

151
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:12,206
Just a question of principle:

152
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:15,038
When you take over the entire stock
holdings of Taran Nuclear Works...

153
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,101
is this happening under the auspices
of the United States...

154
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:19,204
or are you signing
as a private citizen?

155
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:21,374
In practice, it's irrelevant.

156
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,385
When I evaluate the secret models
of your rockets...

157
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:26,887
on my U.S. testing grounds...

158
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:28,856
I will be under government supervision
anyway.

159
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:32,223
And how do you envision
the financial transaction?

160
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:34,728
As soon as my lawyers
have examined the contract...

161
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:37,027
you will receive
the full amount by check.

162
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,659
The name Taylor is an alias.

163
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:44,195
Departments B and C are to follow
Taylor's each and every step...

164
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:47,936
and give a detailed report
every 1 2 hours.

165
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,444
Taylor is staying
in a luxury suite...

166
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:53,948
on the 14th floor
of the Luxor Hotel.

167
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,314
A radio message
from Inspector Kras.

168
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:59,286
"Before he was murdered
on his way to the TV studio...

169
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:01,846
the reporter Peter Barter
had been at the Luxor Hotel...

170
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:04,757
according to a statement
by the vehicle maintenance man."

171
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,659
Please call a short staff meeting
for 20 minutes from now.

172
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,666
In the meantime, I will notify
the president of Interpol.

173
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,295
We have been struggling
for a while...

174
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,431
with a series
of strange, unsolved crimes.

175
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:20,475
It all began two years ago.

176
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,670
On May 1 5, 1 958...

177
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:27,944
a passenger airplane crashed
at the Dutch airport of Schiphol...

178
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,678
following an act of sabotage.

179
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:31,549
The perpetrators
are still unknown.

180
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,283
Among the dead was
the French bank president Luchard.

181
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:39,851
His death caused a significant drop
on the Paris stock exchange.

182
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,362
During his trip to Germany...

183
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:46,834
Luchard had stayed
at the Luxor Hotel.

184
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:49,700
On November 2, 1958...

185
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:53,833
Mr. Delano, an attorney
for the steel corporation PCA...

186
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:58,539
was murdered in a sleeping car
on a train traveling from Oslo to Paris.

187
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:01,142
Two weeks before the murder...

188
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:04,777
Mr. Delano spent three evenings
in the casino of the Luxor Hotel.

189
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:08,084
On May 1 2, 1 959...

190
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:12,526
the Algerian-born arms dealer
Hussein fell victim to a bomb blast...

191
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:17,429
in his car shortly after crossing
the Belgian border.

192
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:20,593
Previously, Hussein had once met
with a well-known call girl...

193
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,160
at the Luxor Hotel.

194
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:24,933
And the list goes on.

195
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:29,137
Serious capital offenses,
murder, stock fraud, kidnapping.

196
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:32,305
Each case is different,
and each remains unsolved.

197
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:34,781
But they all have
one thing in common.

198
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,547
The victims in all these cases were
at some point guests at the Luxor Hotel.

199
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,111
That's why we have set up
one of our best special agents there.

200
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,987
His identity is known only...

201
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:44,992
to the chief of the Federal Crime Bureau
and myself...

202
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,588
to avoid any kind of leak
to subordinate organizations.

203
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:52,361
He has been staying at the Luxor
for some time now.

204
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:57,565
His sole mission is to find out
what's going on at the Luxor Hotel.

205
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,922
I can't watch this!

206
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,687
The firefighters should be
spreading out their sheet by now!

207
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,591
She's about to jump!

208
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:33,438
Come back inside!

209
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,070
Madam, please don't cause any trouble.
We don't want a scandal.

210
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:40,582
Should you have financial difficulties,
the hotel will help, of course.

211
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:44,410
Ladies and gentlemen, you can't possibly
enter here. Please be reasonable.

212
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:47,250
- After all, a human life is at stake.
- Our jobs are on the line!

213
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,290
Don't give us a hard time.
We need pictures.

214
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,985
I'm afraid that's impossible.

215
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,687
- Is it someone from the 14th floor?
- What's her name?

216
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,492
- I'm sorry.
- Menil is her name.

217
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:58,294
Marion Menil.

218
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,461
She is staying here at the hotel. I was
going to insure her only yesterday.

219
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,732
Sometimes you get lucky, huh?

220
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:24,753
Don't be alarmed.

221
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,586
Why would you want to do
something so futile...

222
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,790
from which there is no return?

223
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:33,395
You are young and your whole life
lies ahead of you.

224
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,299
It might just be wonderful.

225
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,928
Think it over.

226
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,300
You might not die right away.

227
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:43,708
You may suffer horrible pain
before it's all over.

228
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:49,643
Or you might survive-- as a cripple.
Think about it.

229
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:54,453
I'm scared. So very scared.

230
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:56,684
Give me your hand.

231
00:15:57,793 --> 00:16:00,887
Trust me.
I'll hold on to you.

232
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:03,861
- She moved!
- He took her hand.

233
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:14,899
Thank God!
I wouldn't have enjoyed my dinner.

234
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,007
Drink this.
It'll do you good.

235
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,072
This is the hotel manager.
Open the door.

236
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,777
- Please don't let anybody in.
- No, no.

237
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:26,221
Open the door!
This is the police!

238
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:27,380
Please!

239
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:30,220
Perhaps you should go in the other room.
I'll talk to these people.

240
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,661
Come in, gentlemen--
just the two of you.

241
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:43,830
No, no, please.
Don't push, gentlemen.

242
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,964
- We want to see the woman.
- We've got a right to see her.

243
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,976
Please, don't cause trouble. Mr. Taylor
is a guest from the United States.

244
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:51,137
What did he say?
What's his name?

245
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,345
Nonsense! Wait, it's--

246
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,451
Of course. I've seen him
in the newspapers. He did look familiar.

247
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,830
Get to the office right away so your
picture makes the evening edition.

248
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:14,198
In the meantime, I'm going to file
my report by phone.

249
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:20,931
Excuse me, gentlemen.

250
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:24,809
Who do you think
the noble rescuer is?

251
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:28,844
Mistelzweig.
Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.

252
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,578
The " B" stands for "belly."

253
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:32,745
General insurance: life, accident,
baggage loss, health...

254
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:34,721
fire, hail, theft, and burglary.

255
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,157
Only lovesickness and a chronic shortage
of cash are excluded.

256
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:41,624
Well, if you insure that guy,
you can retire.

257
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:44,666
Why?
Is he that well-off?

258
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:48,464
Billions. Mr. Travers is one
of the richest men from overseas.

259
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:49,526
And a bachelor.

260
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,970
Mrs. Menil is apparently wealthy.

261
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,372
She owns fabulous jewelry
and expensive furs.

262
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:57,003
She flew here from Paris
five days ago.

263
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,274
But our house detective
may know more about her.

264
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:02,112
- Then please ask him to come here.
- With pleasure.

265
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:06,152
Are you sure the woman won't do
anything else foolish?

266
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,389
My secretary is with her.

267
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:15,988
Gentlemen, please visit the bar--
on the house, of course.

268
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:21,929
I promise I'll give you
all the information you need later.

269
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:24,164
Mrs. Menil has lived very quietly
in this establishment.

270
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,264
She most certainly does not belong
to the demimonde.

271
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:28,536
I suspect the whole thing
has to do with a telegram...

272
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,601
that she received
about three hours ago.

273
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,613
- Do you know what it said?
- No...

274
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:35,377
but according to the receptionist...

275
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,645
Mrs. Menil grew visibly nervous
while reading the telegram...

276
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,778
and she retired
to her room immediately.

277
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:41,789
Then I will question her
personally.

278
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,985
Above all, I must insist that the lady
leave the hotel at once.

279
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,757
- And I must insist--
- This won't work, gentlemen.

280
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,231
You can't save a person
from committing suicide...

281
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,098
only to leave her
to her own devices.

282
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:57,194
Give her time
to get over this shock.

283
00:18:57,272 --> 00:19:00,207
Who will guarantee she won't
attempt suicide again?

284
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:02,675
I believe I can accept
that responsibility.

285
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:05,372
Perhaps Mr.--
What was the name again?

286
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:06,573
Berg.

287
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:09,674
- Mr. Berg can keep an eye on her.
- Of course.

288
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:18,490
The gentlemen are all gone.

289
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:23,055
For the moment,
no one is going to bother you.

290
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:25,866
If I can help you in any way--

291
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:28,502
No one can help me.

292
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,731
Why didn't you let me--

293
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:33,274
Everything would have been
over now.

294
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:35,605
Death is such a finite thing.

295
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:38,145
People often think they are facing
a catastrophe...

296
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:41,740
and despair descends
like a dark cloud.

297
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:45,150
In every situation
there is a way out.

298
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,017
Not for me.

299
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,554
Do you have financial worries?

300
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:52,859
Romantic troubles?

301
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:57,194
You trusted me when you were
standing out there on the ledge.

302
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,363
I should probably
be grateful to you.

303
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:03,361
But I'm not.

304
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:06,305
Do you have any family
I can notify?

305
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,474
I don't want to see anyone.

306
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:12,036
I want to go to my room.

307
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:14,980
I don't want you
to be alone now.

308
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,250
Yes, I understand.

309
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:20,615
Then please notify
my doctor, Dr.Jordan.

310
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,097
- Where is he? In the lobby?
- No, in the other room.

311
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:40,063
Forgive me. I was told that
Mrs. Menil was in your suite.

312
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:43,643
Sister Agnes heard a radio broadcast at
my clinic about this terrible incident.

313
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:46,408
Mrs. Menil is my patient.
May I see her?

314
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:49,575
I was just about
to send for you.

315
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,852
Marion!

316
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:58,755
How could you do such a thing?
You've got to pull yourself together.

317
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:01,895
I'm going to take you to your room
and give you a little shot...

318
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:04,830
and then you'll have
a nice sleep.

319
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,368
I'll leave you
in Sister Agnes's care overnight.

320
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:09,494
She's a familiar face, right?

321
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:13,170
Please don't think
I'm ungrateful, but--

322
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,673
I think complete rest
is the best remedy now.

323
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:21,071
If you don't mind, I will take
the lady to her room now.

324
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:28,122
Professor, is Mrs. Menil
permanently in your care?

325
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:29,816
No, absolutely not.

326
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:33,122
But she had a nervous breakdown
once before, about a year ago.

327
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,788
She was a patient at my clinic
for almost two months.

328
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:39,891
And she's got no husband,
no boyfriend?

329
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:44,737
As a doctor, I can't make statements
about Mrs. Menil's private life.

330
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:48,799
Certainly. But I am of course interested
in this woman's situation now.

331
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:51,710
She is a very lonely person,
very guarded.

332
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,214
It's not easy to win her trust.

333
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:55,943
You--

334
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:58,451
You must exert
a strong influence on her.

335
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,750
I mean, on her subconscious...

336
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:04,622
in that you succeeded
in saving her from suicide.

337
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,923
I'm somewhat surprised...

338
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,986
but very happy about it.

339
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:10,326
Good-bye now.

340
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,526
" Multimillionaire Thwarts Suicide
at Luxor Hotel"

341
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,298
Not exactly a pleasant advertisement
for our hotel.

342
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:21,802
- Good evening, Inspector. The usual?
- Yes, the usual.

343
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,741
A lot of action around here.

344
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:28,112
Are your rates so high that your guests
must jump out the window?

345
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:31,744
It may be a joke to you, Inspector,
but unfortunately the joke is on me...

346
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,584
as if I were everybody's baby-sitter.

347
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:37,648
These disgusting reporters.
May they go to hell.

348
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:41,287
Yes, these reporters
with their scribbling--

349
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:44,594
To think what my friend Barter
would have done with a thing like this.

350
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,295
Oh, well. Since his death
I haven't been watching TV anymore.

351
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,463
Was he the one who died
of a heart attack in his car?

352
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:54,065
Yes. A great guy, Inspector.
Generous in every way.

353
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:55,803
- Mr. Berg?
- Yes.

354
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:59,643
Mr. Travers' secretary would like
to speak to you on the phone.

355
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:02,410
Excuse me for a moment, please.

356
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,281
Did you know this Barter well?

357
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:07,549
He always asked me for tips
on special guests.

358
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,487
Especially the female ones,
I bet.

359
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:14,017
You will laugh, Inspector, but I had
pointed out Mrs. Menil to Mr. Barter.

360
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:15,960
Actually, it was
the day she arrived.

361
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:18,625
She sat over there, while Barter
drank his whiskey over there.

362
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,635
Things must have worked out...

363
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:24,467
because a little later
they went upstairs together.

364
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,007
Interesting.

365
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:36,981
Would you kindly let Mrs. Menil
know that I'd like to see her?

366
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:39,987
I'm afraid that's impossible.
She just took a sleeping pill.

367
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:41,913
- Is she asleep yet?
- No, but--

368
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,958
- Then I'd like to see her.
- Can't it wait until tomorrow?

369
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,515
Unfortunately, it can't.

370
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:47,527
My name is Kras.

371
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:50,029
Inspector Kras.

372
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:59,700
A man by the name of Inspector Kras
insists he must see you.

373
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:02,402
Is this necessary?
Why do people torture me so?

374
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,742
Please...

375
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:08,214
but take the lady's health
into consideration.

376
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,886
Please forgive the late visit,
but I'm afraid it's quite urgent.

377
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:15,445
Please make it quick.
I feel faint.

378
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:18,822
Do you remember a man
by the name of Barter?

379
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,020
Barter? No.

380
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:22,620
A TV reporter.

381
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:25,029
This is the first time
I've heard his name.

382
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,335
Perhaps this will refresh
your memory.

383
00:24:28,403 --> 00:24:31,065
Oh, that guy!
Yes, I know him.

384
00:24:32,507 --> 00:24:35,442
He introduced himself
downstairs in the bar.

385
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:40,478
I hadn't quite caught his name.
He wanted an interview.

386
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:42,982
I refused. After all,
I'm not some movie star.

387
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:44,712
He was awfully pushy.

388
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:47,414
And yet you brought him upstairs
to your room.

389
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:50,424
I didn't want to make
a scene in the bar.

390
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:53,950
I brought him here upstairs,
but he got quite aggressive.

391
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:57,555
It got so bad that I had to ask him
to stop bothering me.

392
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:59,759
He's not going to bother you
anymore.

393
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:03,869
Shortly after visiting you,
Mr. Barter...

394
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:05,803
died.

395
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:09,209
But that's awful!

396
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,774
And when a person wants to die,
they won't let her!

397
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:18,211
" Return immediately or you must bear
the consequences of your actions.

398
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:20,652
I have proof
of your guilt."

399
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:25,921
Mrs. Menil, three hours after receiving
this telegram from Paris...

400
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:28,394
you attempted suicide.

401
00:25:28,463 --> 00:25:30,454
How did you get
that telegram?

402
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:32,397
My personal life
is nobody's business.

403
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:36,164
When the police are interested
in something, there is no personal life.

404
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:38,603
Why are you torturing me
like this?

405
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:40,402
Leave me alone!

406
00:25:40,475 --> 00:25:42,466
That's enough.
Can't you see?

407
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:46,347
But I must talk to you again
about Barter.

408
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:50,646
I received
a very strange phone call.

409
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:54,114
For the time being,
please don't leave town.

410
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:56,817
Good night.

411
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:09,462
" H. B. Mistelzweig
Insurance"

412
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:12,131
Tough times, tough business.

413
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:15,599
Mars has entered the house of death
of too many people.

414
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:19,010
- Who has entered what?
- Mars is in the house of death.

415
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,015
As a modern businessman, I work
solely on the basis of astrology.

416
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:26,577
There is no point in insuring people
if you know that they won't live long.

417
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:29,054
Imagine if I had insured
your friend Barter.

418
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:30,454
He looked as chipper
as life itself.

419
00:26:30,525 --> 00:26:32,755
He would have just paid
his first premium, and then-- wham!

420
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:35,352
A heart attack!
What an awful loss that would have been.

421
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,797
No, no. One must look at the stars
of these insurance candidates.

422
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:41,597
- Very interesting.
- What do you mean?

423
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:45,002
- Did you have Barter's horoscope?
- This is Inspector Kras.

424
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:48,008
Please, allow me:
Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.

425
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:49,668
" B" stands for "belly."

426
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:51,609
General insurance:
Life, accident, baggage loss...

427
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,374
health, fire, hail, theft, burglary.

428
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:56,849
Only lovesickness and a chronic shortage
of cash are excluded.

429
00:26:57,552 --> 00:27:00,248
Impressive.
What companies do you work for?

430
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:02,289
Lloyd's of London,
Assurance la Paix Paris...

431
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:05,019
Seguros de Madrid,
Kontor Hamburg National and Overseas.

432
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:07,391
Mistelzweig has
worldwide connections.

433
00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:09,896
A lucrative business, isn't it?

434
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:12,262
One doesn't talk about that.
One gets by.

435
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:15,667
Allow me, gentlemen.
Another round.

436
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,267
A little schnapps with your beer
can't hurt, Inspector.

437
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,001
Besides, it's all tax-deductible.

438
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:23,440
Karl, one more.

439
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:25,274
The hotel engineer is,
of course, included.

440
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:27,177
I'm sorry, Mr. Mistelzweig.
Perhaps later, though.

441
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:29,239
The freezer for the kitchen
downstairs is on the blink.

442
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:32,650
Most likely it's a short. Do you have
the key to the machine room?

443
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,881
No, but there must be
a spare downstairs.

444
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:37,254
I can't find it.
Please come with me.

445
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:40,226
Go ahead and pour my drink.
I'll be right back.

446
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,598
Do you have an office
here at the hotel?

447
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,896
My office? No, no.

448
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:49,630
My office is here--
in my head.

449
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:51,763
I do my business at the Luxor...

450
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,330
but I wouldn't take a permanent office
here if they gave it to me for free.

451
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:56,309
What don't you like
about the hotel?

452
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:59,210
Just between you and me:
It's not under a lucky star...

453
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,374
like anything the Nazis started
near the end of the war.

454
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,078
What does that have to do
with the Luxor?

455
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:09,749
People aren't the only ones influenced
by the constellations upon their birth.

456
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:12,054
- A building is too.
- Come on now!

457
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:14,921
- A building isn't born!
- Oh, yes, it is, Inspector.

458
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:19,330
The placement of its cornerstone
is its birth hour...

459
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,200
and the cornerstone for the Luxor
was laid by the Nazis in May '44...

460
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:26,240
when they still believed
in final victory.

461
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:29,765
The bigwigs in the SS wanted
to build a few grand hotels...

462
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:31,869
for politicians and diplomats...

463
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:35,780
all in one huge cluster,
so they could spy on everybody.

464
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,717
No, the Luxor has a negative aura.

465
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,879
But your business is thriving here
nevertheless.

466
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:43,355
Well, in a hotel like this there are
always people with a lot of money.

467
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:48,259
There's jewelry or baggage to insure,
or travel insurance to write.

468
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:51,059
My wife has always wanted me
to buy life insurance.

469
00:28:51,132 --> 00:28:53,532
It all depends on the stars,
Inspector.

470
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:55,728
It's all in the stars.

471
00:28:55,937 --> 00:28:58,838
Considering your profession...

472
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:01,568
you could be dead tomorrow,
right?

473
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:03,803
I mean, since you're always
in dangerous situations.

474
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:06,176
Criminals never sleep,
do they?

475
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,374
But perhaps we could
work something out.

476
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,849
Call me at the office
in the morning.

477
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:13,079
It's pretty quiet there
these days.

478
00:29:13,154 --> 00:29:16,419
I'd also like to talk
about Mr. Barter.

479
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:18,686
He wanted insurance too.

480
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,888
I received
a very strange phone call.

481
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:25,259
To your health,
Mr. Mistelzweig.

482
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,426
Cheers, Inspector.

483
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,708
- It was nice to meet you.
- The pleasure was all mine.

484
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:39,269
I'll be sure to call you.

485
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,792
No harm done...

486
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:04,702
but if you could take me to the other
side, I'd appreciate that very much.

487
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:07,240
May I give you
a lift somewhere?

488
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:09,299
That's very kind of you.

489
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:14,012
If you can find room
for my dog too--

490
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:16,414
Of course.

491
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,692
In Ireland we also have
this cold, wet weather.

492
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:29,992
I can feel it on my skin
like damp wool.

493
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:32,089
I don't know.

494
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:35,735
Careful!
Don't take the turn so fast!

495
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:37,668
Danger!

496
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,678
Damn! That was close.

497
00:30:44,745 --> 00:30:47,908
- Thanks for the warning.
- How did you know that?

498
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:51,008
Sometimes I can see
things coming.

499
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:54,418
You don't believe me.

500
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:57,619
This morning at the hotel...

501
00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:59,683
you dropped a glass
while brushing your teeth.

502
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,991
In picking up the shards, you cut
the middle finger of your right hand.

503
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:05,125
But that's--

504
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,030
No one was there to see it
when it happened.

505
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:09,592
This morning, around 1 1:00...

506
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,662
you signed a check
drawn on an English bank...

507
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,971
but the business transaction
you're planning will not materialize.

508
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:19,570
The part about the check is true too,
but how do you know the rest?

509
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:23,549
I told you before:
Sometimes I can see things coming.

510
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:25,984
If you can predict
future events...

511
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:30,217
how come you didn't see that
we would almost run you over?

512
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:33,419
The hour of my death
has not yet come.

513
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:38,361
- Who are you?
- My name is Cornelius.

514
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,705
Good evening...

515
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,541
Inspector.

516
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,406
Why did you turn on the light?

517
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:57,747
So that you may see better,
Inspector.

518
00:31:57,818 --> 00:32:00,218
I could have been a burglar.

519
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:02,722
No, my dog growled and barked.

520
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,281
This means that there's someone
in the room whom he knows.

521
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,989
He would have behaved differently
with a stranger.

522
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:11,463
And then...

523
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:13,625
I also smelled
your pipe tobacco.

524
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:16,363
The odor clings
to your clothing.

525
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:19,668
Then I knew it was you
waiting for me in the dark.

526
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:23,666
The blind have keener senses
than people who see.

527
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:27,738
But how did you get in?
My attendant has the night off.

528
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:30,978
I was so bold as to let myself in,
Mr. Cornelius.

529
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:34,249
Please accept my apologies,
but I must talk to you.

530
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:36,688
There's a new twist
in the Barter case.

531
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:38,952
Did they find something
in his car?

532
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,091
No.

533
00:32:42,163 --> 00:32:44,597
In his head.

534
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,069
A small, unfriendly thing

535
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,235
Let me be frank,
Mr. Cornelius.

536
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:54,732
I'm not making much progress
in this matter.

537
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,676
You know I'm a skeptic...

538
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:00,680
but when you're stuck,
beggars can't be choosers.

539
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:06,480
If you concentrate
on this object...

540
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:08,920
what do you see...

541
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,515
that might help me?

542
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:18,897
A man.

543
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:23,199
His face is a blur.

544
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:27,097
Now, nothing!

545
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:30,175
The cloud again.
The dark cloud.

546
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:34,637
It covers everything.
It's stronger than I am.

547
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:37,684
It threatens me personally.
I can feel it.

548
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:41,247
That's why I would be
grateful to you...

549
00:33:41,322 --> 00:33:44,883
if you kept me informed
about the Barter case.

550
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:50,689
We have maintained absolute silence
with the press...

551
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:53,529
regarding the fact that Barter
met a violent death.

552
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:57,169
Nevertheless, this afternoon I received
a very strange phone call.

553
00:33:58,072 --> 00:34:00,267
A man was willing...

554
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:03,401
in exchange for immunity
from prosecution and a reward...

555
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:07,379
to give me information
about this steel needle.

556
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:12,609
We immediately determined the call
originated from a public phone.

557
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:14,678
But the guy
was much too smart.

558
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:18,156
When the patrol car arrived,
he was long gone.

559
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:23,595
But before he hung up,
he said I should think about it.

560
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:25,791
He would call me again
tomorrow.

561
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:29,897
What are we doing here?

562
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:34,066
The bunker
where they found the American.

563
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,666
You know, the American!

564
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:40,972
- And why are we here?
- To make a phone call.

565
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:45,176
- You're so fond of making phone calls.
- Me? What do you mean?

566
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:48,278
You know. I warned you.

567
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:51,018
- The doctor doesn't like it.
- What doesn't he like?

568
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:53,458
- That you make phone calls.
- But I didn't--

569
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:56,819
I didn't!

570
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,702
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Morning.

571
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,429
It got pretty late last night.
Any news?

572
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:06,302
Nothing at all.
Everything was quiet.

573
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:09,309
The telephone didn't work,
but it's been fixed.

574
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:11,704
- A man from the phone company--
- Don't pick up!

575
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:36,967
I'd be willing
to purchase it.

576
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:40,302
Would you accept
45,000 marks?

577
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:44,208
- But it's worth much more!
- Let's say 50,000.

578
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:48,146
- All right.
- Would you like a check or cash?

579
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:52,174
Cash. I may need to leave today,
and the banks are already closed.

580
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:57,084
Nexit.

581
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:59,251
You were lucky, Inspector.

582
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:02,124
If it weren't for that cabinet,
you'd be dead as a rat now.

583
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,265
It would serve me right.

584
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:13,934
His wife is expecting
their first child.

585
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:21,581
You slowly get used to the fact that
people bite the dust in our profession.

586
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:24,282
It's all business as usual.

587
00:36:25,986 --> 00:36:27,977
And it's my fault.

588
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,353
Your fault? Why?

589
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,551
Yesterday I set out
three pieces of bait...

590
00:36:32,626 --> 00:36:35,424
but the response
came faster than I expected.

591
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:37,657
But from whom?

592
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:39,858
The psychic?

593
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:42,061
The insurance agent?

594
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,626
Or the woman?

595
00:36:44,405 --> 00:36:46,839
Why aren't you honest
with me?

596
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:49,000
I don't know
what you mean.

597
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,704
You sold this piece
of jewelry today.

598
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:56,276
- You had me followed?
- I feel responsible for you.

599
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,880
You booked flights today
with four different airlines...

600
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:03,924
for four consecutive dates...

601
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:06,118
to four different cities...

602
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:08,218
under four different names...

603
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,024
none of them your real one.

604
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:13,365
- Why?
- Please, don't ask!

605
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:17,836
What is threatening you,
Marion?

606
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:20,669
What were you so afraid of
that you wanted to end your life?

607
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:23,369
Please don't ask.
Please, please, don't ask!

608
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:26,936
I don't want to cause you pain, Marion,
but why don't you let me help you?

609
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:30,279
I don't want to owe
anybody anything.

610
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:34,720
- I won't accept any money from you.
- Then at least take this back.

611
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:39,992
I know what it means to a woman
to give up her jewelry.

612
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:43,991
Then I have no other choice
but to keep it.

613
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,692
Perhaps chance will unite us
once again.

614
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,258
In the meantime,
this piece will remind me of you.

615
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:51,600
My plane is leaving tomorrow.

616
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:53,697
Tomorrow, already?

617
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,601
Will you do me a big favor
before we part?

618
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:58,577
If I can, gladly, of course.

619
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:00,944
Then spend our last evening
with me.

620
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:03,916
You must distract yourself
to regain your zest for life.

621
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:05,975
You need to get out
and see happy people.

622
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:08,044
You need to hear laughter
and music.

623
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:38,510
To the next lucky coincidence
that will bring us together.

624
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:43,054
Everyday worries and concerns
must be checked in with your coat.

625
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:45,216
All right.
To the next lucky coincidence.

626
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,354
Terrific music, isn't it?
It gets in your blood.

627
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:53,662
I'm a Scorpio.
They burn with passion.

628
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:55,964
What are you, madam?
A Libra?

629
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:58,732
No, I'm a Sagittarius.

630
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,473
Straight to the heart!

631
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:03,374
- Would you like to dance?
- Oh, yes!

632
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:10,183
Do you like to dance?

633
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,742
I used to love to dance,
a long time ago.

634
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:19,154
You know, I believe you are
a cheerful person by nature.

635
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:21,626
I used to be
very happy and cheerful.

636
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:25,529
- I loved to laugh.
- Why don't you try it again?

637
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:31,669
See? Much better.
Come and dance with me.

638
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:44,247
Wasn't I right to drag you out
of your end-of-the-world mood?

639
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:45,910
Yes, perhaps.

640
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,087
You dance beautifully.

641
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:58,224
See? You are
a different person now.

642
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,731
Marion, come to Paris
with me tomorrow.

643
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:06,106
To Paris?
I can't go to Paris.

644
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:08,432
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not a prude.

645
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,409
I would love to do it.

646
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,240
But I can't leave now.

647
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:13,870
Why not?

648
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:16,713
I'm not free.

649
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,581
I'm married.

650
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:20,517
Do you love your husband?

651
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,919
I hate him.

652
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,555
When the lady
who just stepped out returns...

653
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,153
please tell her
I'll be right back.

654
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:23,209
He carries a gun
in a shoulder holster.

655
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:25,251
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

656
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,913
I'm all black and blue
from pressing against it.

657
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,889
Have you never considered
divorce?

658
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:34,086
Yes, often, but my husband
will never let me go.

659
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,187
Money can overcome
many obstacles.

660
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:38,891
Not in my case.

661
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:40,831
Money can't help me.

662
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:43,301
But let's not talk about me.

663
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,964
Tell me about yourself,
about your life.

664
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:49,304
It's not very interesting.
Business, conferences.

665
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,001
-And women?
- Yes.

666
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,944
But only in passing.

667
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:57,245
You know, when someone lives
for his work as much as I do--

668
00:41:57,317 --> 00:41:59,842
board meetings, staff meetings,
business meetings--

669
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,016
I practically live in planes
and conference halls.

670
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:07,527
There's only room
for brief pleasures...

671
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:10,324
and not much more.

672
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:14,959
- That's very sad.
- One can't have everything.

673
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:18,630
Mr. Travers? Excuse me.
We just received this.

674
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,534
- What about the check?
- The lawyers still have it.

675
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:26,545
- Cancel it right away.
- Yes, sir.

676
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:30,614
You see?
You can't relax either.

677
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:32,914
A few minutes ago,
when we were dancing...

678
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:35,386
I believed that I could
run away from myself.

679
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:37,787
But I can't.
No one can.

680
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,883
We've all got to follow
our path.

681
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:44,196
No, I would only bring you
bad luck.

682
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:47,427
If only all this had happened
three years ago, fine.

683
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:49,492
But now it's only self-deception.

684
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,905
I'm sorry to spoil
this lovely evening for you.

685
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:58,441
Please forgive me and forget me.
It's better that way.

686
00:42:58,512 --> 00:43:00,912
Do you really want me
to forget you?

687
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,217
Yes.

688
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:21,966
"Radio London announces
nuclear power plant...

689
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:24,970
run by the Taran Plutonium
Corporation was blown up today.

690
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:27,973
Plant completely destroyed by fire.
Many casualties.

691
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:31,670
Population within 1 0-mile radius
evacuated for safety reasons."

692
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:36,341
The catastrophe itself
I did not foresee.

693
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:40,409
I only felt there was a dark shadow
hovering over your plans.

694
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:42,785
First, the broken glass
in the bathroom...

695
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:45,518
then the truck
we nearly collided with...

696
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:47,082
and now this
Taran Corporation matter.

697
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,459
What's the rational explanation
for all this?

698
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,795
F ate allowed me
to cross your path.

699
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:56,768
Perhaps I'm to protect you
from future harm.

700
00:43:56,837 --> 00:44:00,170
The explosion in the Taran plant
is hardly harmful to me.

701
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,902
A business transaction
that didn't materialize.

702
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:04,466
That's all.

703
00:44:05,345 --> 00:44:08,940
I mean your personal life.

704
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:19,181
Although I'm blind,
light that's too bright is bothersome.

705
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:21,591
It scatters your thoughts.

706
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:25,694
You must now focus on me.

707
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:34,064
You should go away.
Leave this town.

708
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:38,541
Something has crossed
your path...

709
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:42,872
and a dark cloud
hangs over you.

710
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:49,155
I see a figure.

711
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:52,049
It's very blurred.

712
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:54,318
An animal.

713
00:44:54,394 --> 00:44:55,554
And a woman?

714
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,925
Perhaps.

715
00:44:58,131 --> 00:45:01,498
I can't quite penetrate
the darkness.

716
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:05,903
But one thing I do see.

717
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,169
You saved a life...

718
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:13,812
and it is precisely this life
that threatens you with danger...

719
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:15,975
and death.

720
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:20,383
She can't just be making up the fact
she reserved four airplane tickets...

721
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:22,786
even if she did it
under false names.

722
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,721
I don't get it.

723
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:28,727
Take a note:
Interpol inquiry.

724
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:32,162
Does this insurance agent Mistelzweig
really work for Lloyd's of London...

725
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:34,860
and Assurance la Paix Paris
and all the other companies?

726
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:43,338
Inspector, Mrs. Menil just canceled
all four flight reservations.

727
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:47,446
Interesting.

728
00:45:48,115 --> 00:45:50,140
She goes out
with the American...

729
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:52,549
and the next morning
she cancels her flights.

730
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,313
Yet she didn't look too happy
when she went upstairs.

731
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:58,753
Interesting.

732
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:00,190
I have something else for you.

733
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,253
Get hold of this Cornelius character's
latest tax return. Be discreet about it.

734
00:46:13,673 --> 00:46:16,198
Hello, Mr. Cornelius?
This is Kras.

735
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:19,374
No. No news, really.

736
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:24,948
Did the man who wanted to give you
the confidential information call you?

737
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:27,510
He couldn't call me,
Mr. Cornelius.

738
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:30,112
You see, my phone
exploded yesterday.

739
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,181
A little assassination attempt
against me.

740
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:37,129
A man from the phone company
supposedly repaired it earlier.

741
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:40,564
What did the man look like?
Can you please describe him for me?

742
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:44,194
The only person who could do that
is my assistant...

743
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:46,603
but, unfortunately, he's dead.

744
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:49,139
Why didn't you warn me
before it happened?

745
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:50,608
What is that supposed to mean?

746
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:54,204
Are you saying you wanted me
to predict your death? You're alive!

747
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:58,449
- But in the Barter case you did!
- Well, he's truly dead.

748
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:02,386
Inspector, I sense your mistrust.
You are skeptical.

749
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:04,549
That's why I would like
to convince you.

750
00:47:04,624 --> 00:47:07,354
Please attend a telepathic sance
at my house tonight.

751
00:47:07,427 --> 00:47:10,157
Choose for yourself
the people you want to witness it.

752
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,130
Bring whomever you wish.

753
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:14,494
Do you really believe
in this humbug?

754
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:18,026
Michael, you know I'm a skeptical man.
Always have been.

755
00:47:18,105 --> 00:47:20,903
Now, for the first time
in my life...

756
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:22,965
I wish I were able
to believe in someone.

757
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:25,841
The psychic or the woman?

758
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:28,142
You should know me better,
Michael.

759
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:31,048
I do what I think is right.

760
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:33,348
No psychic can change that.

761
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,288
- So you are staying here?
- Yes. You fly to London alone today.

762
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:39,917
Get information on all the repercussions
of the catastrophe...

763
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:44,020
especially whether the secret plans
for the rockets were saved.

764
00:47:44,097 --> 00:47:46,930
And something else, Michael.
This you can do right away.

765
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,959
Pick out fifty roses
in the flower shop downstairs...

766
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:53,972
and have them sent to Mrs. Menil,
with this note.

767
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,530
Certainly.

768
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,553
Excuse me, Mr. Travers.

769
00:48:08,622 --> 00:48:11,284
May I perhaps have a word
with you in private?

770
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:13,258
What is this about?

771
00:48:14,694 --> 00:48:16,559
It's about Mrs. Menil.

772
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,635
It's not my custom to intrude
in the private affairs of our guests...

773
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:30,267
but I know you are interested
in anything that concerns Mrs. Menil.

774
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:33,608
Our access to her
for surveillance purposes...

775
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,342
is unfortunately very restricted.

776
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:40,110
She spends most of the day
in her suite.

777
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:44,021
She speaks on the phone a great deal
and receives visitors too.

778
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,790
But I may be able
to reveal something...

779
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:50,057
of great interest to you.

780
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,530
How much do you want?

781
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:55,090
That's entirely up to you,
of course.

782
00:48:55,168 --> 00:48:58,865
But it must be absolutely confidential.
I could lose my job.

783
00:49:04,544 --> 00:49:05,806
Well, then?

784
00:49:06,546 --> 00:49:09,208
Forgive me, but it's something
that I can only show you...

785
00:49:09,282 --> 00:49:11,580
if I may trouble you
to come with me.

786
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:13,710
It won't take long.

787
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:56,288
It's right here.

788
00:49:57,297 --> 00:50:00,698
This suite is adjacent to the rooms
occupied by Mrs. Menil.

789
00:50:11,044 --> 00:50:13,376
This room was once occupied
by a very jealous husband...

790
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:15,471
whose wife was staying
right next door.

791
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:18,381
He was never sure whether
she was faithful to him or not...

792
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:22,444
so I helped him out
with this little setup.

793
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:27,452
One fine day,
he caught her in the act.

794
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:33,958
Here you can see and hear everything,
but from the other side, you can't.

795
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,462
I'm going to turn on
the loudspeaker.

796
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,983
Unbelievable, no? On the other side,
it's just a normal mirror.

797
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:59,156
Please help me get dressed.

798
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:09,697
Please see who it is.

799
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:13,998
These roses are for the lady.

800
00:51:31,524 --> 00:51:33,651
Beautiful roses.

801
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:36,057
I'll get a vase right away.

802
00:52:10,864 --> 00:52:13,025
Well, did I promise
too much, Mr. Travers?

803
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:16,762
Turn it off! It's despicable
to eavesdrop on people like that.

804
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:19,501
Turn it off!

805
00:52:19,572 --> 00:52:23,565
Don't worry, Mr. Berg.
I will pay you for this secret.

806
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:28,880
So that no one else may misuse it,
reserve this suite for me.

807
00:52:28,948 --> 00:52:31,917
Tell the receptionist that it's for some
business partners I'm expecting.

808
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,816
Of course, Mr. Travers.

809
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:46,789
Yes?

810
00:52:46,866 --> 00:52:50,427
May I remind you that
we still have an appointment?

811
00:52:50,703 --> 00:52:54,969
I would like you to attend
a telepathic sance with me.

812
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:57,240
Yes, ma'am.

813
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:00,143
With a psychic, at 8:30 p.m.

814
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:02,504
I would very much appreciate
seeing you there.

815
00:53:02,582 --> 00:53:06,518
Hello, Inspector. Is this a bad time?
Shall l--

816
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:10,446
Don't leave the hotel.
I'll call you later.

817
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:16,284
Is this place all right?
It looks so-- so dilapidated.

818
00:53:16,362 --> 00:53:19,422
You were right the other day,
Mr. Mistelzweig.

819
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:22,127
Someone planned to dispatch me
to heaven.

820
00:53:23,236 --> 00:53:25,864
- Maybe I should--
- No, no, no.

821
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:28,430
You couldn't have come
at a better time. Have a seat.

822
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:31,135
You are interested in astrology
and such, aren't you?

823
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:33,645
Yes, as a business principle.
You know--

824
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,115
- Is this your wife?
- Yes, yes.

825
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:41,882
Would you like to attend
an interesting sance with a psychic?

826
00:53:41,955 --> 00:53:44,355
I'm flattered! When?

827
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:46,585
Tonight at 8:30.

828
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:49,423
Perhaps we can talk business too.
I'll bring my wife.

829
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:52,192
May I introduce my wife?
Mr. Cornelius.

830
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:54,062
Very pleased to meet you,
madam.

831
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:56,124
This is my assistant, Mr. Kaiser,
and Mr. Mistelzweig.

832
00:53:56,202 --> 00:53:58,966
Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.
The " B" stands for "belly."

833
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:02,304
He's very much interested
in the occult, especially astrology.

834
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:06,334
Only in a very amateurish way.
I'm an absolute dilettante.

835
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:09,006
But, in fact, today the sun is
in conjunction with Neptune.

836
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:11,175
That means water,
so we're due for a thunderstorm.

837
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,617
I should have brought
an umbrella, right?

838
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:20,655
That's a splendid animal
you've got there.

839
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:25,897
Come on, doggie.
Uncle has got something for you.

840
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:29,196
Quiet, Ferro. Be quiet.

841
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:32,602
He's not interested.
He won't take anything from a stranger.

842
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:56,952
This is Mr. Cornelius,
my wife...

843
00:54:57,022 --> 00:54:59,013
Mr. Kaiser, and you already know
Mr. Mistelzweig.

844
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,116
- I hope I'm not late.
- Not at all, madam.

845
00:55:02,193 --> 00:55:05,629
Please, let's all take a seat.
It's very informal.

846
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:22,671
Please...

847
00:55:22,747 --> 00:55:26,148
concentrate on me now.

848
00:55:34,693 --> 00:55:37,958
I'm having difficulty
concentrating.

849
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,394
Something is interfering
with me.

850
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,991
It's not the thunderstorm.

851
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:47,101
- Inspector.
- Yes?

852
00:55:47,772 --> 00:55:50,400
Would you mind
if we traded places?

853
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:52,636
Not at all.

854
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:56,272
- Excuse me!
- No problem.

855
00:55:56,348 --> 00:55:58,782
I hope my cigars
survived intact.

856
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,647
I suspected as much:

857
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,086
Saturn in the 11th house--
a small accident among friends.

858
00:56:06,925 --> 00:56:08,688
Excuse me.

859
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:14,295
Let us begin.

860
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:32,140
Someone among us has come here
with the intent to deceive.

861
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:37,553
I see a woman's hand
and a ring.

862
00:56:37,622 --> 00:56:40,557
A ring that doesn't belong
on that hand.

863
00:56:41,459 --> 00:56:46,829
A tragic fate tore from this woman
the man she loved.

864
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:50,693
A dark cloud
hangs over the man.

865
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:53,330
The image is blurring.

866
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:58,275
A car, with the man
at the wheel.

867
00:56:58,843 --> 00:57:00,777
He is dead.

868
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:03,609
Peter Barter.

869
00:57:03,848 --> 00:57:09,343
One person here saw him
before he died...

870
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:13,946
and one person here
will avenge his death.

871
00:57:15,794 --> 00:57:18,820
It won't be an easy task.

872
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:22,196
The dark cloud
is all-powerful.

873
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:25,900
It gathers and approaches...

874
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:27,904
ever closer!

875
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:31,806
No, it's not a cloud.

876
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,608
It's a face.

877
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,147
The face of a dead man.

878
00:57:39,317 --> 00:57:42,514
No, he's alive.

879
00:57:43,955 --> 00:57:47,652
Mabuse. Dr. Mabuse.

880
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:53,058
Now it's gone.
The dark cloud has returned.

881
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:55,793
Close, very close.

882
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:00,262
It is here!
It is hanging over--

883
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,736
Kras!

884
00:58:02,807 --> 00:58:04,297
Get away from the window!

885
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:09,604
Turn the lights off!

886
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:29,058
The shot came from either
the roof or the attic of that house.

887
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:31,193
Kaiser, maybe we can still
catch the guy!

888
00:58:34,038 --> 00:58:35,869
I'm not staying here
any longer.

889
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,999
Would you please take me
back to the hotel?

890
00:58:38,076 --> 00:58:40,067
Please don't leave me
here alone.

891
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:42,443
The danger has passed.

892
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:44,482
I regret this turn of events.

893
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:48,781
Perhaps some refreshments
will help you recover from the shock.

894
00:58:56,027 --> 00:58:58,052
Mr. Cornelius...

895
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:02,561
I admire your psychic gift.

896
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:05,660
Really, it was fabulous!
Amazing!

897
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:09,970
By the way, what was that strange name
you mentioned?

898
00:59:13,812 --> 00:59:17,304
I don't remember.
I have no control in this state.

899
00:59:17,382 --> 00:59:19,282
It doesn't really matter.

900
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:21,614
By the way--
just between you and me--

901
00:59:21,686 --> 00:59:26,146
does this Inspector Kras
have a chance of living much longer?

902
00:59:26,224 --> 00:59:28,920
I'm not omniscient,
Mr. Mistelzweig.

903
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:31,018
Well, he wants to buy
life insurance from me...

904
00:59:31,095 --> 00:59:33,723
and I would appreciate
certain tips.

905
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:37,632
I don't do business
with the lives of other people.

906
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:39,602
Of course not.
Please forgive me.

907
00:59:39,671 --> 00:59:41,536
It was just a thought.

908
00:59:41,606 --> 00:59:46,009
By the way, did you notice
that the shot rang out...

909
00:59:46,077 --> 00:59:50,070
just as your grandfather clock
struck for the first time.

910
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:54,407
- Is it accurate?
- I would assume it is.

911
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:57,545
No, the clock is exactly
one minute fast.

912
00:59:57,622 --> 00:59:59,647
Here, you see?

913
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:02,655
Please forgive me.
I forgot.

914
01:00:03,161 --> 01:00:05,391
You are blind.

915
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:08,489
But don't you think
that this delay of one minute...

916
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:11,467
may have saved
the inspector's life?

917
01:00:12,303 --> 01:00:14,794
Well, Inspector?
What did you find?

918
01:00:14,873 --> 01:00:16,340
Nothing.

919
01:00:16,407 --> 01:00:19,240
My assistant is still looking
for clues...

920
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,403
but the man is long gone,
of course.

921
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:24,209
Cornelius, I haven't had a chance
to thank you.

922
01:00:24,282 --> 01:00:26,614
But for your warning,
I would be dead now.

923
01:00:26,684 --> 01:00:29,118
The bullet hit the chair
exactly in the spot...

924
01:00:29,187 --> 01:00:31,451
where my head had been.

925
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:35,492
Strange.

926
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:39,828
This is the second assassination attempt
directed at me in the last 48 hours.

927
01:00:39,898 --> 01:00:41,957
You are mistaken, Inspector.

928
01:00:42,033 --> 01:00:43,193
Why is that?

929
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:47,204
You forget that I had been sitting
in that chair earlier.

930
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:50,241
This murder attempt
was directed at me.

931
01:00:55,013 --> 01:00:57,914
I loved your roses
so very much.

932
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:02,843
- How did you get--
- I felt so alone in my room.

933
01:01:03,755 --> 01:01:07,748
Perhaps it's childish, but I'm always
so scared of thunderstorms.

934
01:01:07,825 --> 01:01:09,952
I hope you don't mind
that I simply came by.

935
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:12,826
- Your door was open.
- Please, come in.

936
01:01:15,066 --> 01:01:17,432
Am I really the reason
you extended your stay?

937
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:21,939
I wanted to ask you one more thing
before I dive back into my work.

938
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:24,068
Yes?

939
01:01:24,142 --> 01:01:26,372
Do you prefer
whiskey or cognac?

940
01:01:26,444 --> 01:01:29,470
Whiskey, please.
Straight up.

941
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:32,647
- Was that the question?
- No.

942
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:41,189
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

943
01:01:42,493 --> 01:01:43,960
And the question?

944
01:01:44,028 --> 01:01:47,088
If you were available,
would you marry me?

945
01:01:50,435 --> 01:01:52,960
I want to tell you
the truth now, Henry.

946
01:01:53,538 --> 01:01:55,836
The whole truth.

947
01:01:55,907 --> 01:01:58,774
In reality,
my marriage is sheer hell.

948
01:01:59,677 --> 01:02:04,478
My husband has always been driven
by an almost pathological jealousy.

949
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:06,983
He has a physical disability.

950
01:02:07,652 --> 01:02:11,315
It's just a problem with his foot.
It never bothered me.

951
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:15,257
But it seems to be
the main reason for his jealousy.

952
01:02:16,494 --> 01:02:19,691
He is convinced
that I'm cheating on him.

953
01:02:20,164 --> 01:02:23,531
Sometimes he would beat me
to extract a confession...

954
01:02:23,601 --> 01:02:25,432
but there was nothing
to confess.

955
01:02:25,503 --> 01:02:27,835
That's grounds for divorce!

956
01:02:29,474 --> 01:02:33,342
I have often suggested
separation to him. Very often.

957
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,608
He said he would rather kill me
than set me free.

958
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,948
Last year, I simply ran away.

959
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:45,787
I was a nervous wreck.

960
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:48,257
That's when I ended up
at Dr. Jordan's clinic.

961
01:02:48,326 --> 01:02:50,851
An old friend of our family.

962
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,092
When I recovered somewhat,
my husband took me back home...

963
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:59,000
and the torture, threats and abuse
began all over again.

964
01:03:00,004 --> 01:03:03,235
Ten days ago,
I completely lost control.

965
01:03:03,307 --> 01:03:05,537
I didn't care about anything.

966
01:03:06,344 --> 01:03:10,405
I obtained some poison
and intended to kill him...

967
01:03:10,681 --> 01:03:13,946
but he found out
and nearly beat me to death.

968
01:03:14,485 --> 01:03:18,353
I didn't know what to do,
so I ran away again.

969
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:22,416
Just to get away from him.
That's how I ended up at the Luxor.

970
01:03:25,496 --> 01:03:27,327
But he tracked me down again.

971
01:03:27,398 --> 01:03:30,731
He sent a telegram saying
if I didn't return immediately...

972
01:03:30,802 --> 01:03:32,827
he would report me.

973
01:03:32,904 --> 01:03:34,838
So that's the story
behind it all.

974
01:03:34,906 --> 01:03:38,967
I saw no other way out
but to kill myself.

975
01:03:40,478 --> 01:03:42,673
So now you know
the whole story.

976
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:45,315
Do you still want
to marry me...

977
01:03:45,383 --> 01:03:47,749
a woman who tried
to poison her husband?

978
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:58,621
Is Mrs. Menil there, Mr. Travers?
There's no answer in her room.

979
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:01,898
It's for you.
Professor Jordan.

980
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:03,763
The professor?

981
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,934
Yes? This is Marion.

982
01:04:08,272 --> 01:04:11,241
What? When?

983
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:14,269
Oh, my God!
Ten minutes ago?

984
01:04:17,582 --> 01:04:19,482
You'll stay at the clinic.

985
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:22,018
Yes, okay. Thank you.

986
01:04:22,086 --> 01:04:23,747
What's going on?

987
01:04:24,288 --> 01:04:26,188
My husband is on his way
to the hotel.

988
01:04:26,257 --> 01:04:29,556
He'll be here any minute.
He mustn't find me in your room.

989
01:04:29,627 --> 01:04:31,618
Stay here.
You are safe with me.

990
01:04:31,696 --> 01:04:34,187
I can't drag you into this.
You don't know Roberto.

991
01:04:34,265 --> 01:04:36,324
Please let me go!

992
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,767
If I don't call you in half an hour,
come to my room.

993
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:43,273
- Is it still raining?
- I'll call a bellboy--

994
01:04:43,341 --> 01:04:46,469
No, thanks.
I'll take care of it myself.

995
01:05:24,649 --> 01:05:26,378
What is it?
I've already gone to bed.

996
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,146
Open the door
if you don't want a scandal.

997
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,085
Come back tomorrow.

998
01:05:31,155 --> 01:05:33,680
If you don't open up,
I'll kick in the door.

999
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,692
That's it, darling.
Why resist?

1000
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:48,600
I'm sorry
if my sudden appearance...

1001
01:05:48,673 --> 01:05:51,471
rattles your tender nerves.

1002
01:05:51,542 --> 01:05:54,170
A woman who loves her husband
should welcome him more joyfully.

1003
01:05:54,745 --> 01:05:56,679
More tenderly.

1004
01:05:57,448 --> 01:05:59,245
What do you want from me?

1005
01:05:59,317 --> 01:06:01,842
I'm not sure yet myself.

1006
01:06:01,919 --> 01:06:03,853
We'll see.

1007
01:06:03,921 --> 01:06:06,856
It was quite stupid of you
to run away again...

1008
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:10,257
and to believe
I wouldn't find you.

1009
01:06:10,328 --> 01:06:12,819
Just as stupid as your attempt
to poison me.

1010
01:06:13,197 --> 01:06:16,360
You thought no one would miss me
if you succeeded.

1011
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:22,098
Now, one word from me
and you'll land in jail.

1012
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:25,301
But this time you won't
get off the hook so easily.

1013
01:06:26,944 --> 01:06:28,969
Beautiful roses.

1014
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,945
From him, right?

1015
01:06:31,015 --> 01:06:33,279
Since your dramatic
suicide attempt...

1016
01:06:33,351 --> 01:06:35,319
you've been
in all the newspapers...

1017
01:06:35,386 --> 01:06:36,819
you and your new lover.

1018
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:40,356
You must be grateful
to your savior.

1019
01:06:40,424 --> 01:06:42,255
That's best expressed...

1020
01:06:42,326 --> 01:06:46,820
with a few tender caresses,
right?

1021
01:06:46,897 --> 01:06:48,888
You animal!

1022
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:56,764
There!

1023
01:06:56,841 --> 01:06:59,708
Does this pain your little heart?
You love him, don't you?

1024
01:06:59,777 --> 01:07:01,039
Yes, I love him!

1025
01:07:01,112 --> 01:07:03,774
I love him as much as I hate you.
You hear me?

1026
01:07:03,848 --> 01:07:06,544
I don't regret for a second
that I wanted to kill you.

1027
01:07:06,617 --> 01:07:09,177
You're not human.
You're a beast!

1028
01:07:11,389 --> 01:07:14,085
No so fast, my sweetheart.
Not so fast.

1029
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:17,026
Let's see if the gentleman
from America...

1030
01:07:17,094 --> 01:07:20,393
will still want you in bed
with your face cut up.

1031
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:41,045
Shoot him!

1032
01:07:51,295 --> 01:07:53,456
- How did you get in here?
- Through the mirror.

1033
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:55,965
The detective--
I'll explain everything.

1034
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:04,099
Do you think anyone
heard the shooting?

1035
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:06,501
Wait.

1036
01:08:21,892 --> 01:08:24,918
- There's nobody outside.
- I'm going to call Dr.Jordan.

1037
01:08:24,995 --> 01:08:28,055
He must come right away.
Perhaps he can still save Roberto.

1038
01:08:35,806 --> 01:08:38,502
This is Marion, Professor.
Please come over right away.

1039
01:08:38,576 --> 01:08:40,567
Something terrible
has happened.

1040
01:08:42,246 --> 01:08:45,807
Perhaps you can still help him.
Thank you.

1041
01:08:45,883 --> 01:08:47,544
He's on his way.

1042
01:08:51,522 --> 01:08:54,855
- Where is my cognac?
- Here. I didn't know if you'd be back.

1043
01:08:54,925 --> 01:08:57,792
An insurance agent
always comes back.

1044
01:09:00,498 --> 01:09:02,398
It's raining cats and dogs.

1045
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,232
You wouldn't kick a dog out
in this weather.

1046
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:29,015
Dr.Jordan.
Thank God you're here.

1047
01:09:29,927 --> 01:09:32,395
- I shot him.
- I must tell you, Professor--

1048
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,921
Believe me,
it was self-defense.

1049
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:37,263
The knife is still lying there
on the ground.

1050
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:06,292
He's dead.

1051
01:10:06,363 --> 01:10:08,888
I didn't mean to kill him!

1052
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:11,330
Please help me, Professor.

1053
01:10:11,402 --> 01:10:14,565
You've got to help me
out of this mess!

1054
01:10:14,638 --> 01:10:17,300
Please, Marion, calm down.
Let me think.

1055
01:10:17,374 --> 01:10:19,467
Professor, I'm partially
to blame--

1056
01:10:19,543 --> 01:10:21,738
I too am to blame,
Mr. Travers.

1057
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:24,144
I knew how dangerous
this man was.

1058
01:10:24,215 --> 01:10:26,376
Perhaps if I had come
right away--

1059
01:10:29,453 --> 01:10:33,389
The most important thing now is that
the police don't find out about this.

1060
01:10:33,457 --> 01:10:38,622
I had the ambulance park on a side
street, to avoid drawing attention.

1061
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:42,929
If we could just get the corpse
out of the hotel--

1062
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,434
A massive heart attack must be treated
in the hospital immediately.

1063
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:50,099
Later, I could fill out the death
certificate to read "heart attack."

1064
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:53,575
But how do we get him
out of the hotel?

1065
01:10:53,644 --> 01:10:57,774
The hotel detective will do anything
for money. Besides, he owes me one.

1066
01:10:58,082 --> 01:11:01,279
And now it's time to go sleep
in my empty bed.

1067
01:11:06,524 --> 01:11:08,651
Would you have an extra raincoat?
I forgot mine.

1068
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:11,593
I have an old one over there.
I'll get it for you.

1069
01:11:19,436 --> 01:11:22,769
- Here. Will this do?
- Yes, thank you.

1070
01:11:23,207 --> 01:11:26,142
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- That's okay.

1071
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,110
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Mistelzweig.

1072
01:11:28,178 --> 01:11:30,646
It's just a minor heart attack,
madam.

1073
01:11:30,714 --> 01:11:33,012
Please don't be alarmed.

1074
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:37,213
A few days of rest in my clinic
and he'll recover.

1075
01:11:37,288 --> 01:11:39,279
Initially he will need
to take it easy, of course.

1076
01:11:39,356 --> 01:11:42,018
Nothing upsetting.
No business.

1077
01:11:42,092 --> 01:11:44,424
He'll need to put himself
first now.

1078
01:11:44,495 --> 01:11:47,089
$5,000 in cash if you help us,
Mr. Berg.

1079
01:11:47,164 --> 01:11:49,155
We don't want any commotion
in the newspapers.

1080
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:51,292
Naturally, Mr. Travers.

1081
01:11:51,368 --> 01:11:53,359
It's not in the interest
of the hotel...

1082
01:11:53,437 --> 01:11:56,600
to create a stir
in case of sudden illness.

1083
01:11:56,674 --> 01:11:59,905
How can we get Mr. Menil
to the ambulance without being seen?

1084
01:11:59,977 --> 01:12:02,138
That's easy.
We use the freight elevator.

1085
01:12:02,212 --> 01:12:03,873
And the broken mirror?

1086
01:12:03,948 --> 01:12:06,917
I'll have that fixed within the hour.
I'll wake up the maintenance man.

1087
01:12:06,984 --> 01:12:08,975
He lives in the hotel.
He's my closest friend.

1088
01:12:51,895 --> 01:12:55,058
No sirens, no flashing lights.
We don't want any attention.

1089
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:57,494
I'll follow in the car.

1090
01:12:58,102 --> 01:13:00,036
I've known Professor Jordan
since I was a child.

1091
01:13:00,104 --> 01:13:01,901
I knew he would do
anything for me.

1092
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:04,099
But if we had said
that you fired the gun--

1093
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:06,540
To think that I'm hiding
behind a woman--

1094
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:09,676
I always took responsibility
for my actions.

1095
01:13:09,747 --> 01:13:12,614
If he hadn't been so quick,
I would have fired the shots.

1096
01:13:12,683 --> 01:13:16,813
But isn't this all beside the point?
You saved my life for the second time.

1097
01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:19,054
Even so.

1098
01:13:22,826 --> 01:13:26,455
Two hours ago, in this room...

1099
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:29,590
you asked me whether
I would marry you if I were free.

1100
01:13:31,101 --> 01:13:33,661
And now I am free.

1101
01:13:43,847 --> 01:13:48,910
This worked out fine once again,
just as the doctor predicted.

1102
01:13:48,986 --> 01:13:51,580
Precisely.

1103
01:13:51,922 --> 01:13:53,583
No!

1104
01:14:05,235 --> 01:14:08,329
What? What is it?

1105
01:14:08,405 --> 01:14:10,600
Patrol car 8
has detected a fire...

1106
01:14:10,674 --> 01:14:12,767
on the top floor
of a bombed-out house.

1107
01:14:12,843 --> 01:14:14,743
There's a dead body
in one of the rooms.

1108
01:14:14,812 --> 01:14:16,370
You wake me up for that?

1109
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:19,245
Franke is on night duty now.
Let me sleep.

1110
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:22,082
What's that?

1111
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:26,214
A secret transmitter?

1112
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,986
Police files on Dr. Mabuse?

1113
01:14:38,302 --> 01:14:41,669
Strange place. No sign on the door.
Nothing.

1114
01:14:41,739 --> 01:14:43,934
When we saw the fire
from the street...

1115
01:14:44,007 --> 01:14:47,101
my partner said,
" No one lives there."

1116
01:14:47,611 --> 01:14:50,375
Then we found the body.

1117
01:14:58,589 --> 01:15:01,649
Shot in the chest, apparently
straight through the heart.

1118
01:15:01,725 --> 01:15:04,523
First they killed him, and then
they tried to burn the place down.

1119
01:15:04,595 --> 01:15:07,359
We pulled down the curtains
and doused the sofa with water.

1120
01:15:07,431 --> 01:15:09,899
We were able
to stomp out the rest.

1121
01:15:11,301 --> 01:15:13,997
- Any ID? Any papers?
- Nothing.

1122
01:15:27,484 --> 01:15:29,475
Nice of you
to make time for me...

1123
01:15:29,553 --> 01:15:31,680
so early in the morning,
Mr. Cornelius.

1124
01:15:31,755 --> 01:15:35,623
I was in the neighborhood
and thought I'd just drop by.

1125
01:15:36,093 --> 01:15:40,154
Isn't the little doggie
here today?

1126
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:43,222
A routine checkup at the veterinarian.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

1127
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,325
What can I do for you,
Mr. Mistelzweig?

1128
01:15:45,402 --> 01:15:49,862
Well, I thought, " Maybe you can
do business with Mr. Cornelius."

1129
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,840
With me? Business?

1130
01:15:51,909 --> 01:15:55,037
Don't worry.
I don't want to insure you.

1131
01:15:55,112 --> 01:15:57,012
I just want--

1132
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,741
- Mind if I smoke?
- Please.

1133
01:15:58,816 --> 01:16:01,580
I know it's
a bad habit of mine, but--

1134
01:16:03,453 --> 01:16:05,819
Did I startle you?

1135
01:16:06,156 --> 01:16:10,024
I unseated you, so to speak,
in this charade.

1136
01:16:10,093 --> 01:16:14,052
You know, this blind-man ploy
is really great.

1137
01:16:14,131 --> 01:16:15,928
Yes, really.

1138
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:20,433
When you take off the sunglasses
and stare into the distance--

1139
01:16:20,604 --> 01:16:22,265
Very attractive.

1140
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:24,034
Really stylish.

1141
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:27,939
And the contact lenses--
like in an American horror film.

1142
01:16:28,912 --> 01:16:31,005
Come now!

1143
01:16:31,315 --> 01:16:33,374
Don't do anything stupid.

1144
01:16:34,751 --> 01:16:36,685
The phone is going to ring soon.

1145
01:16:36,753 --> 01:16:38,448
A friend of mine.

1146
01:16:38,522 --> 01:16:41,116
I took the liberty of giving him
your phone number...

1147
01:16:41,191 --> 01:16:43,989
just as a precaution
so that nothing happens.

1148
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:49,091
What do you want from me?

1149
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:54,433
I want to go into business with you.
Fifty-fifty.

1150
01:16:54,504 --> 01:16:58,372
During the sance the day before
yesterday, I had this idea.

1151
01:16:58,442 --> 01:17:02,879
You know, people are so scared
when it comes to insurance.

1152
01:17:03,347 --> 01:17:07,477
If you, with your clairvoyance,
advise them to protect their families...

1153
01:17:07,551 --> 01:17:10,520
then they'll all come running
to me, you see?

1154
01:17:11,221 --> 01:17:12,848
That's him.

1155
01:17:14,157 --> 01:17:15,818
Yes, I'm still here.

1156
01:17:15,893 --> 01:17:18,589
No, not much longer.
A few more minutes.

1157
01:17:19,196 --> 01:17:21,824
I'll be in touch, yes.

1158
01:17:22,232 --> 01:17:24,291
No police-- don't worry.

1159
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:26,526
By the way,
this Kras character--

1160
01:17:26,603 --> 01:17:30,869
Didn't you wonder why he would
drag me to your sance?

1161
01:17:31,108 --> 01:17:33,474
He wants to keep an eye on me.

1162
01:17:33,543 --> 01:17:36,239
I've done time.
Five years.

1163
01:17:37,314 --> 01:17:41,580
Insurance fraud.
I've learned a lot since then.

1164
01:17:41,652 --> 01:17:45,679
And the two of us will come out
on top of that Kras guy, right?

1165
01:17:45,756 --> 01:17:48,919
Think it over, Cornelius.
Fifty-fifty.

1166
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:53,061
The projectile that hit
the psychic's chair...

1167
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:55,121
and the bullet in the corpse...

1168
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:57,462
are of the same caliber
and have the same rifling marks.

1169
01:17:57,534 --> 01:18:00,332
They clearly come
from the same gun.

1170
01:18:01,204 --> 01:18:03,263
Very interesting.

1171
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,171
Thank you very much.

1172
01:18:07,177 --> 01:18:09,873
- Any word from Mistelzweig?
- No, he was asked to come at 1 1:00 p.m.

1173
01:18:09,947 --> 01:18:11,938
But Interpol's answer
just came in.

1174
01:18:12,015 --> 01:18:13,812
Mistelzweig, Hieronymus Balthazar.

1175
01:18:13,884 --> 01:18:15,749
Insurance agent
with many years of experience.

1176
01:18:15,819 --> 01:18:18,617
Best references from Lloyd's of London.
No prior convictions.

1177
01:18:18,889 --> 01:18:21,687
I still don't like his mug.

1178
01:18:23,994 --> 01:18:26,292
The embodiment of promptness,
right?

1179
01:18:30,367 --> 01:18:32,335
What happened
to your right hand?

1180
01:18:32,402 --> 01:18:34,836
A small scuffle
ending in death, perhaps?

1181
01:18:34,905 --> 01:18:39,604
Inspector!
A peace-loving man like me?

1182
01:18:39,676 --> 01:18:42,144
- Have you ever been bitten by a dog?
- No.

1183
01:18:42,212 --> 01:18:45,409
Good for you. It hurts terribly,
let me tell you.

1184
01:18:45,482 --> 01:18:49,976
Last night I was going home
when a huge dog jumped at me...

1185
01:18:50,053 --> 01:18:52,385
and wouldn't let go.

1186
01:18:52,456 --> 01:18:56,256
And this should happen to me,
a real dog lover!

1187
01:18:58,095 --> 01:19:01,189
You left me a message, Inspector.
You wanted to talk to me.

1188
01:19:01,798 --> 01:19:03,629
Was it because of
the sance last night?

1189
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,292
No.

1190
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:08,231
But I want
to show you something.

1191
01:19:16,046 --> 01:19:19,709
Well, that's life.

1192
01:19:19,783 --> 01:19:23,617
"Yesterday on a steed abreast,
today a bullet in the chest."

1193
01:19:23,687 --> 01:19:25,882
- How did you know that?
- What?

1194
01:19:25,956 --> 01:19:28,754
That the man was shot in the heart.
You couldn't see that.

1195
01:19:28,825 --> 01:19:31,885
Inspector, I was just quoting
an old song...

1196
01:19:31,962 --> 01:19:33,827
and right away
you're suspicious again.

1197
01:19:33,897 --> 01:19:36,525
Shot through the heart.
Awful.

1198
01:19:37,134 --> 01:19:39,796
One moment a man is running around
alive and well...

1199
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:42,430
and twelve hours later
he's dead.

1200
01:19:42,639 --> 01:19:44,869
- Stone-dead.
- So you know him then.

1201
01:19:44,941 --> 01:19:48,172
That would be pushing it.
I saw him last night at the Luxor.

1202
01:19:48,245 --> 01:19:51,339
I noticed him because of his clubfoot.
He has one, doesn't he?

1203
01:19:51,948 --> 01:19:53,108
Just what I thought.

1204
01:19:53,183 --> 01:19:56,346
He went up to the third floor
where Mrs. Menil is staying.

1205
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:59,287
By the way, it's strange.
Did you know that she checked out?

1206
01:19:59,356 --> 01:20:01,347
She's leaving
with the American today.

1207
01:20:01,425 --> 01:20:03,484
Let's say good-bye to the professor
and then we'll go.

1208
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,549
What's the number?

1209
01:20:04,628 --> 01:20:06,596
4-2-5...

1210
01:20:06,663 --> 01:20:08,756
5-2-7.

1211
01:20:11,034 --> 01:20:12,831
Say...

1212
01:20:12,903 --> 01:20:16,771
last night when you called him,
you only dialed three digits.

1213
01:20:17,407 --> 01:20:19,238
- Three?
- Yes.

1214
01:20:20,143 --> 01:20:23,544
You must be mistaken.
I've known Jordan's number for years.

1215
01:20:23,613 --> 01:20:25,808
It's 425-527.

1216
01:20:25,882 --> 01:20:27,440
And there's something else.

1217
01:20:27,517 --> 01:20:30,350
How could the professor get here
so quickly last night...

1218
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,513
just five minutes
after your call...

1219
01:20:32,589 --> 01:20:34,147
and with an ambulance?

1220
01:20:34,224 --> 01:20:37,159
For God's sake, don't say anything now.
They can hear and see everything.

1221
01:20:37,227 --> 01:20:39,354
- Who can hear and see everything?
- Later, later!

1222
01:20:39,429 --> 01:20:42,796
We must leave this hotel as soon
as possible, or it's all over!

1223
01:20:42,866 --> 01:20:45,562
What are you talking about?
What are you afraid of?

1224
01:20:45,635 --> 01:20:47,865
There! Look!

1225
01:20:47,938 --> 01:20:49,838
And there are more over there!
And over there!

1226
01:20:49,906 --> 01:20:51,737
Everywhere in this hotel.

1227
01:20:51,808 --> 01:20:54,106
In the bar, in every room,
in the nightclub.

1228
01:20:54,177 --> 01:20:56,407
They can observe everything.

1229
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,380
- We must leave immediately.
- But--

1230
01:20:58,448 --> 01:21:00,780
Please!
Please believe me!

1231
01:21:01,084 --> 01:21:03,382
Listen, Henry. I lied to you.

1232
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:05,387
I was lying the whole time!

1233
01:21:05,455 --> 01:21:08,913
But now you have to believe me,
just this once.

1234
01:21:08,992 --> 01:21:11,790
- Please! Before it's too late.
- Why?

1235
01:21:11,862 --> 01:21:14,160
For God's sake, don't ask
any more questions now.

1236
01:21:14,231 --> 01:21:17,132
Come on, before it's too late.
Come on!

1237
01:21:34,784 --> 01:21:35,978
Twelve...

1238
01:21:36,052 --> 01:21:37,246
eleven...

1239
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,584
ten, nine.

1240
01:21:39,656 --> 01:21:42,750
I'd like to know if Mrs. Menil
is still staying at the hotel...

1241
01:21:42,826 --> 01:21:45,158
or if she and Mr. Travers
have already left.

1242
01:21:45,228 --> 01:21:48,061
They must still be here,
probably in Mr. Travers suite.

1243
01:21:48,131 --> 01:21:50,793
- I can call to check for you.
- Thanks, but no need. I'll go up.

1244
01:21:51,334 --> 01:21:52,995
- But tell me--
- Don't speak.

1245
01:21:53,069 --> 01:21:55,731
They can hear us here too.
First we have to get out of here.

1246
01:21:58,341 --> 01:22:00,639
You slut.

1247
01:22:19,062 --> 01:22:21,121
Go on!

1248
01:22:28,438 --> 01:22:32,238
No, no. You know this place.
You've been here often enough.

1249
01:23:37,107 --> 01:23:38,972
Mrs. Menil?

1250
01:23:49,052 --> 01:23:50,519
Let him search all he likes.

1251
01:23:50,587 --> 01:23:53,522
The woman will bleed to death
without a doctor.

1252
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:55,581
Don't worry.
The doctor will be here shortly.

1253
01:23:55,659 --> 01:23:58,059
But if she's lucky,
she'll croak before he gets here.

1254
01:24:02,832 --> 01:24:04,629
Let's go.

1255
01:24:14,878 --> 01:24:17,403
We're in deep trouble,
thanks to this bitch.

1256
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,539
She would have jumped ship
in America anyway.

1257
01:24:19,616 --> 01:24:22,710
She loves him.
A blind man could see it.

1258
01:24:23,219 --> 01:24:24,948
A blind man.

1259
01:24:25,155 --> 01:24:27,385
Do you realize
we're the last ones...

1260
01:24:27,457 --> 01:24:29,448
to know
about this control room?

1261
01:24:29,526 --> 01:24:32,859
Aside from him, of course.
Doesn't that make you a bit uneasy?

1262
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:36,294
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling.

1263
01:24:36,366 --> 01:24:38,630
When that reporter Barter
surprised you...

1264
01:24:38,702 --> 01:24:41,136
as you were replacing
the defective camera in her room...

1265
01:24:41,204 --> 01:24:43,434
he was stone-dead
within the hour.

1266
01:24:43,506 --> 01:24:44,996
Number 11 -- dead.

1267
01:24:45,075 --> 01:24:47,009
Last night, when the clubfoot
had completed his mission...

1268
01:24:47,077 --> 01:24:48,840
and was no longer needed--
gone.

1269
01:24:48,945 --> 01:24:52,381
And now that this thing with
the American has failed completely...

1270
01:24:52,449 --> 01:24:54,781
do you think
we're still useful to him?

1271
01:24:54,851 --> 01:24:57,547
Who built this whole system
for him? I did.

1272
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:01,147
Who obtained the old Gestapo plans
and switched it all over to TV? I did.

1273
01:25:01,224 --> 01:25:03,158
He made millions
with this thing.

1274
01:25:03,226 --> 01:25:06,389
- He won't just get rid of me.
- He's capable of anything.

1275
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:11,458
From here he saw and heard
everything...

1276
01:25:12,135 --> 01:25:14,569
and could play
the role of the psychic.

1277
01:25:16,406 --> 01:25:19,500
Then he blackmailed
his victims.

1278
01:25:21,711 --> 01:25:24,009
My suicide attempt--

1279
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,913
The clubfoot and l--
It was all a sham.

1280
01:25:27,183 --> 01:25:30,277
There was nothing but blanks
in my revolver.

1281
01:25:31,488 --> 01:25:33,149
You didn't kill anyone.

1282
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:36,115
But why? Why all this?

1283
01:25:36,192 --> 01:25:39,389
To create a bond
between us.

1284
01:25:40,296 --> 01:25:45,461
In America, after our wedding,
they would have killed you.

1285
01:25:48,972 --> 01:25:53,932
I would have inherited everything--
your fortune, your industrial plants--

1286
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:56,740
and then he would have come.

1287
01:25:56,813 --> 01:26:00,044
His desire for power
knows no limits.

1288
01:26:03,853 --> 01:26:05,912
I had to do
what he wanted...

1289
01:26:05,989 --> 01:26:09,152
but I would have told you everything
once we boarded the plane.

1290
01:26:11,394 --> 01:26:13,988
But now it's too late.

1291
01:26:14,063 --> 01:26:16,293
I love you.

1292
01:26:16,366 --> 01:26:19,392
I know you can't
believe me anymore.

1293
01:26:20,603 --> 01:26:23,401
It's too late now.
Too late.

1294
01:26:23,473 --> 01:26:25,668
They simply disappeared,
Inspector.

1295
01:26:25,742 --> 01:26:28,404
Mr. Berg believes they must have
sneaked out of the hotel...

1296
01:26:28,478 --> 01:26:31,845
but neither the concierge
nor the two bellboys saw them.

1297
01:26:31,915 --> 01:26:34,577
Also, they haven't yet
settled their bill...

1298
01:26:34,651 --> 01:26:36,710
and some of Travers' belongings
are still in his room.

1299
01:26:36,786 --> 01:26:39,414
Don't call an alarm just yet.
I'll come over myself.

1300
01:26:53,102 --> 01:26:55,127
- What's new?
- The autopsy report.

1301
01:26:55,205 --> 01:26:57,196
The clubfoot that came in last night.
No internal bleeding.

1302
01:26:57,273 --> 01:26:59,867
When he was shot in the heart,
he had already been dead for a while.

1303
01:26:59,943 --> 01:27:02,605
The true cause of death
was a steel needle in his brain.

1304
01:27:27,103 --> 01:27:28,866
Open up.

1305
01:27:34,844 --> 01:27:37,836
Close the door behind me.
Send the elevator upstairs.

1306
01:27:42,318 --> 01:27:45,446
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Travers...

1307
01:27:45,522 --> 01:27:48,150
that you found out
about my plans.

1308
01:27:53,997 --> 01:27:56,227
You and I have both lost.

1309
01:27:56,299 --> 01:27:59,735
I lost a big game
and you lost your life.

1310
01:27:59,802 --> 01:28:01,497
Do you want
to push your infamy...

1311
01:28:01,571 --> 01:28:04,199
to the point of letting
this woman bleed to death?

1312
01:28:04,274 --> 01:28:06,333
A painless death, Mr. Travers...

1313
01:28:07,243 --> 01:28:09,973
and faster than the death
she could have expected from me.

1314
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,275
This woman
brought both of us down:

1315
01:28:13,349 --> 01:28:16,079
You, because you believed
in her love...

1316
01:28:16,152 --> 01:28:17,949
and me,
because I didn't believe...

1317
01:28:18,021 --> 01:28:21,457
this love could break
my hypnotic control.

1318
01:28:21,524 --> 01:28:23,549
Marion was hypnotized?

1319
01:28:23,626 --> 01:28:27,084
Do you think she could have pulled off
that little suicide farce otherwise...

1320
01:28:27,163 --> 01:28:28,858
without falling?

1321
01:28:29,532 --> 01:28:32,433
Do you believe, even if you had
indeed gained control...

1322
01:28:32,502 --> 01:28:34,333
of my enterprises
through Marion...

1323
01:28:34,404 --> 01:28:37,567
you would have become the sole owner
of all my financial assets?

1324
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:39,870
Who said anything
about money?

1325
01:28:39,943 --> 01:28:43,071
Having gained control
of your nuclear plant...

1326
01:28:43,146 --> 01:28:45,376
I would have thrown
the world into chaos...

1327
01:28:45,448 --> 01:28:47,780
with the rockets
from your experimental plant.

1328
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:50,250
The famous push of a button.

1329
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,810
I would have done it.

1330
01:28:51,888 --> 01:28:55,051
- You are insane.
- Maybe.

1331
01:28:55,124 --> 01:28:57,752
But where's the line?

1332
01:28:57,827 --> 01:28:59,522
Insane.

1333
01:28:59,596 --> 01:29:02,087
That's what they said
about Dr. Mabuse...

1334
01:29:02,165 --> 01:29:06,829
who died 25 years ago
and whose name and plans I used.

1335
01:29:07,203 --> 01:29:11,765
His arrogant contemporaries
considered him a criminal.

1336
01:29:12,742 --> 01:29:15,609
But to me he was a genius...

1337
01:29:15,678 --> 01:29:19,273
who wanted to throw this rotten world
into a reign of chaos...

1338
01:29:19,349 --> 01:29:21,977
that could only be controlled
by the one man...

1339
01:29:22,051 --> 01:29:25,214
who knows how to harness
it for his own gain-- me!

1340
01:29:31,694 --> 01:29:34,026
All your plans end
with my death.

1341
01:29:35,865 --> 01:29:40,097
What can I offer you to at least save
the life of this woman?

1342
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:42,638
Name your price.

1343
01:29:43,573 --> 01:29:47,600
I'm not speaking on my own behalf.
I know you can't let me live.

1344
01:29:49,545 --> 01:29:52,309
I admire your keen intelligence,
Mr. Travers.

1345
01:29:52,382 --> 01:29:54,373
- Then name your price.
- Police officers!

1346
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:57,544
Act rationally, now that your plans
have fallen through.

1347
01:29:58,821 --> 01:30:00,914
You underestimate me,
Mr. Travers.

1348
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:04,016
A check signed by you
would be my undoing...

1349
01:30:05,128 --> 01:30:07,824
and that's what you're hoping
to achieve, isn't it?

1350
01:30:11,067 --> 01:30:13,501
Their things
are still sitting here.

1351
01:30:20,243 --> 01:30:22,177
- Did you touch anything?
- Of course not.

1352
01:30:22,245 --> 01:30:23,735
Everything's empty next door.

1353
01:30:23,813 --> 01:30:26,338
They are searching for you already,
but they won't find you...

1354
01:30:26,416 --> 01:30:29,214
or at least not until it's too late--
for you.

1355
01:30:40,797 --> 01:30:44,324
I have no more time
to chat with you.

1356
01:30:45,068 --> 01:30:46,660
Here...

1357
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:50,733
just in case
you want to act logically...

1358
01:30:50,807 --> 01:30:52,604
to escape a slow death
from starvation.

1359
01:31:04,153 --> 01:31:05,848
By the way...

1360
01:31:06,355 --> 01:31:09,347
this room is soundproof.

1361
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,028
- Wait here for further instructions.
- Yes, sir.

1362
01:31:20,103 --> 01:31:22,765
We must systematically search
the entire hotel...

1363
01:31:22,839 --> 01:31:24,466
from the basement
to the top floor.

1364
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:27,600
The exits are being watched.
Kaiser, you stay here.

1365
01:31:52,502 --> 01:31:55,562
The hotel is surrounded. Two officers
in front, a patrol car in back.

1366
01:31:56,806 --> 01:32:00,572
There's the main entrance and the
hallway, back there on the right.

1367
01:32:06,682 --> 01:32:08,377
Professor Jordan!
Cornelius!

1368
01:32:16,492 --> 01:32:18,255
Go get him!

1369
01:32:20,429 --> 01:32:22,363
The blond man there
is Dr. Mabuse!

1370
01:32:22,999 --> 01:32:24,489
Freeze!

1371
01:32:28,037 --> 01:32:30,301
Three men come with me. The rest of you,
don't let anyone through!

1372
01:32:36,312 --> 01:32:38,507
Get away from the wheel!

1373
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:05,100
Cuff him!

1374
01:33:07,710 --> 01:33:09,837
It was about time.
He almost killed me.

1375
01:33:09,912 --> 01:33:12,437
- Goddamn it, who are you really?
- Interpol.

1376
01:33:12,515 --> 01:33:14,005
- But why?
- Later!

1377
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,744
I know where Mrs. Menil
and the American are.

1378
01:33:15,818 --> 01:33:18,810
- Send them after the car!
- Get the patrol car!

1379
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,019
A large gray sedan...

1380
01:33:26,762 --> 01:33:28,730
an American car...

1381
01:33:28,798 --> 01:33:32,598
GX 737.

1382
01:33:47,817 --> 01:33:50,149
Kras, homicide squad.
Start search immediately.

1383
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:54,679
A large gray sedan, American-made,
license number GX 737.

1384
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:00,094
Turn on the police radio.

1385
01:34:00,396 --> 01:34:03,160
All patrol cars and road blocks
are instructed...

1386
01:34:03,232 --> 01:34:05,894
to stop the suspect vehicle...

1387
01:34:05,968 --> 01:34:08,198
and arrest the passengers.

1388
01:34:08,271 --> 01:34:10,296
Exercise caution.
The suspects have machine guns.

1389
01:34:10,373 --> 01:34:14,503
I repeat.: a large gray sedan,
license GX 737--

1390
01:34:14,577 --> 01:34:16,511
Change the license plate.

1391
01:34:20,116 --> 01:34:23,711
A large American car,
license plate unknown...

1392
01:34:23,786 --> 01:34:26,186
exceeding the posted speed limit...

1393
01:34:26,255 --> 01:34:29,122
has just left Mhlendamm Street
and is now heading south.

1394
01:34:29,659 --> 01:34:34,392
This is Kras. Close all southbound
roads, if it's not too late.

1395
01:34:34,463 --> 01:34:36,328
He most likely wants
to get on the freeway.

1396
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:40,961
Then send a coded message
that Route 1 6 will be closed.

1397
01:34:41,037 --> 01:34:43,665
In case those guys are listening,
send a false, unencoded message...

1398
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:46,435
saying that we expect them
to break through at Neustadt.

1399
01:34:46,509 --> 01:34:48,841
Send four motor cycles
for backup.

1400
01:34:48,911 --> 01:34:50,845
- We'll meet at Sdstern.
- Understood.

1401
01:34:50,913 --> 01:34:53,643
And ask them at the Luxor
whether the damn Interpol guy...

1402
01:34:53,716 --> 01:34:55,513
found the American
and that darn female.

1403
01:34:55,584 --> 01:34:57,381
Come on, get in.

1404
01:35:01,757 --> 01:35:03,418
The key!

1405
01:35:03,993 --> 01:35:05,790
The key for down below!

1406
01:35:08,497 --> 01:35:10,829
Open up!

1407
01:35:19,108 --> 01:35:20,473
Police!

1408
01:36:17,033 --> 01:36:20,002
Double K, EKZ 302.

1409
01:36:20,069 --> 01:36:22,503
Reached square sequence. Over.

1410
01:36:23,072 --> 01:36:26,838
Good nose! Freeway southeast.
Come on, let's go!

1411
01:36:26,909 --> 01:36:29,002
A large American car,
license plate unknown...

1412
01:36:29,078 --> 01:36:31,512
has just passed a checkpoint,
apparently bound for Neustadt.

1413
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:33,673
All roads to Neustadt
have been closed.

1414
01:36:33,749 --> 01:36:35,740
Let 'em look for us!
That's 35 miles away.

1415
01:36:35,818 --> 01:36:37,911
It could be a ruse.
We've been on the freeway too long.

1416
01:36:37,987 --> 01:36:39,318
Hold on!

1417
01:36:47,663 --> 01:36:51,064
Double K, FKA 7 is running.
Over.

1418
01:36:51,133 --> 01:36:54,569
Damn! The freeway reports no contact,
but they should have passed it.

1419
01:36:54,637 --> 01:36:58,596
They must have broken through
between mile 1 35 and mile 140.

1420
01:37:01,777 --> 01:37:04,109
At the next crossing,
get off onto the old highway.

1421
01:37:08,517 --> 01:37:10,644
There they are! F aster!
Get ready.

1422
01:37:13,456 --> 01:37:16,152
A patrol car and four motor cycles
are following us.

1423
01:37:16,225 --> 01:37:19,285
- Distance?
- About 300 yards.

1424
01:37:19,428 --> 01:37:21,658
Don't shoot yet.
Let them get closer.

1425
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:23,254
I'm slowing down.

1426
01:37:23,332 --> 01:37:25,493
1 50.

1427
01:37:25,568 --> 01:37:27,035
1 00.

1428
01:37:27,103 --> 01:37:28,627
Now!

1429
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:49,690
Shoot at the tires!

1430
01:37:51,427 --> 01:37:53,895
Damn! I need to put in
a new magazine.

1431
01:38:04,607 --> 01:38:07,167
Leave him there!
Let's go!
