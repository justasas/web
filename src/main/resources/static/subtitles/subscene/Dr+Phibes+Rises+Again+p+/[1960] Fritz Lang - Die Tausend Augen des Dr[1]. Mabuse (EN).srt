HOMICIDE EMERGENCY SQUAD

8
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:07,364
Homicide squad,
Neuber speaking.

00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,339
"Criminal Psychology"
For you, boss. Mr. Cornelius.

10
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,535
Oh, my gosh!

11
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,635
The clairvoyant character.
Get rid of him.

12
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:19,877
Think about it. He helped us solve
that prostitute murder case.

13
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:24,950
Inspector Kras.

14
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:27,347
This is Cornelius.

15
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:30,326
You may still be in time to prevent
something terrible from happening.

16
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,287
I had a vision.

17
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,724
And?

18
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:40,669
Two cars right next to each other
in the middle of traffic.

19
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:43,730
A street sign: " Hansaring."

20
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:46,902
I don't know the people involved,
I don't know the circumstances...

21
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:48,741
but I sense an impending disaster.

22
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:50,474
A crime.

23
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:52,846
Murder!

24
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:16,630
"Television Station"
Where on earth is Barter?

25
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,869
The broadcast begins
in 30 seconds.

26
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:22,174
He should be here any minute. He called
about 1 5 minutes ago, all excited.

27
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:25,306
- He has some big scoop.
- Broadcast time is still the same.

28
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:26,816
Hurry up, hurry up.

29
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:29,045
Silence in the studio!

30
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,144
In two seconds.

31
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,416
Ladies and gentlemen...

32
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,893
unfortunately we must cancel
our news report.

33
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:42,092
We just received the horrible news
that our reporter Peter Barter...

34
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,932
died on his way to the studio
behind the wheel of his car...

35
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:47,835
presumably of heart failure.

36
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:49,566
Doctor!

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,665
Mission accomplished.

38
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:54,678
Good. Change the license plate
on the car.

39
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,509
Remove the transmitter.

40
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:59,106
Have the car painted immediately
and disposed of in Holland.

41
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,076
Have you ever seen
the doctor?

42
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:06,612
What concern is that of yours?
Aren't you satisfied with your salary?

43
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,488
I'm just asking.

44
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,323
I'd like to know
what he looks like.

45
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:14,832
Then you might as well order
a coffin for yourself.

46
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,460
Do you remember
the American?

47
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:21,369
He too wanted to speak
to the doctor in person.

48
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,930
They found him
a few hours later.

49
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:27,075
His throat had been cut.

50
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,214
But I really want to know
what the doctor looks like.

51
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:35,912
That I don't know.

52
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:39,889
Don't expect me to explain
clairvoyance to you, Inspector.

53
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,689
Magic powers
defy rational thought.

54
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:48,255
I feel the disaster looming.
I see it as if in horrible daydreams.

55
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:51,460
I myself suffer terribly from it,
for I can't stop it...

56
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:56,132
because, like a dark cloud,
some hostile force of black magic...

57
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:59,540
obscures my view
at the decisive moment.

58
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,341
Thus leaving a little bit of work
for the police.

59
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,714
By the way, did you know
the reporter, this Barter?

60
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:10,985
About a year ago,
shortly after I settled here...

61
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:13,387
he visited me once or twice.

62
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,858
He was always looking
for the sensational...

63
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:18,828
and he was a skeptic, like you.

64
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:21,888
That's a professional proclivity,
my dear Cornelius.

65
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,029
Unfortunately, a policeman can't afford
to mess around with magical powers...

66
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:29,232
and I rarely have anything to do
with dark clouds.

67
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:32,103
lf, like me, you had grown up
in Ireland...

68
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:35,077
where people still believe
in the elementary powers of nature...

69
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,706
you might think differently.

70
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:41,811
But perhaps the blind see more
than those who have sight.

71
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:46,016
Possibly, but in the Barter case
this vision has failed you.

72
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,718
Maybe you were also thrown off
by your dark cloud.

73
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:53,295
This was no murder,
my dear Cornelius.

74
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:56,026
It was a simple heart attack.

75
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,073
For you, Inspector.

76
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:16,614
Take it to the lab right away!
I'll be back in an hour.

77
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,419
You were right.

78
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:23,150
The autopsy revealed that
Barter didn't die of a heart attack...

79
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:27,260
but of a steel needle
in his brain.

80
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,999
Material: the finest iridium steel.

81
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:33,059
Length: 1 .5 1 inches.

82
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:37,130
The steel needle smoothly penetrated
the victim's skull bone...

83
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:41,372
and entered the brain without leaving
any visible trace on the outside.

84
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:44,676
We're not going to find
anything here either.

85
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,417
"To my dearest Peter,
with much love...

86
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:59,486
on the occasion
of our first Christmas together.

87
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:01,088
Corinna."

88
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,758
His girlfriend.

89
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,769
Poor guy.

90
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,470
"TV Journal - Peter Barter"

91
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:17,845
Not a shred of paper left.

92
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:25,212
They even took the blotter.

93
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,315
- The audiotapes were also taken.
- Of course.

94
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:33,790
They were searching for evidence
of Barter's sensational scoop.

95
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:37,725
And if there was anything here,
I'm sure they found it.

96
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:48,673
You won't find any fingerprints.
These were no beginners.

97
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:55,217
All we have is
a small, deadly steel needle.

98
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:57,413
An incredible weapon, gentlemen.

99
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:01,424
An air gun that shoots steel needles
absolutely silently.

100
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,427
It's a new infantry weapon...

101
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:08,659
tested at Fort Benning
in the United States.

102
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:12,402
But here's something strange:

103
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,406
Before the weapon could go
into full-scale production...

104
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:18,465
the blueprints disappeared.

105
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,476
They were stolen.

106
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:24,503
U.S. military intelligence
found the thief--

107
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,173
a U.S. soldier in Germany--

108
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:30,311
in a deserted bunker
with his throat cut.

109
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:32,754
He had been gruesomely mutilated
and apparently tortured.

110
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:34,882
The blueprints were, of course,
nowhere to be found.

111
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,292
- When did this happen?
- About a year ago.

112
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:42,389
There's no doubt that it was this steel
needle gun that caused Barter's death.

113
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,956
I don't know.

114
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:47,801
This Barter murder case reminds me
of something that happened long ago.

115
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,396
Gentlemen...

116
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:52,567
does the name Dr. Mabuse
mean anything to you?

117
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:54,076
- Never heard of him.
- No.

118
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:55,976
A criminal genius.

119
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:59,483
He wanted to shock the world
with terrorist acts...

120
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,212
undermining governments...

121
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:06,154
and establishing
a fantastic reign of crime.

122
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,321
He ended up in an insane asylum,
where he wrote a kind of last will...

123
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:13,192
instructions for the crimes
he was planning.

124
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:15,994
In 1 932 he died, insane.

125
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:20,800
But if you talk
to old-time criminals...

126
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:22,998
they all say
that Dr. Mabuse isn't dead.

127
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:24,769
He can't die.

128
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:26,469
Cock-and-bull stories!

129
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:30,173
How could you even think of this--
What was the name again?

130
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:32,772
Dr. Mabuse.

131
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,876
In those days, I was a young assistant
on the homicide squad...

132
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:38,046
and we had a similar case there.

133
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:42,684
A man was shot behind the wheel
of his car from another vehicle.

134
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,457
The Barter case strikes me as
an exact copy of Dr. Mabuse's methods.

135
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,521
You said he was
no longer alive.

136
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,861
Well...

137
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:53,233
I have seen his dead body
with my own eyes, but--

138
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:55,204
Why haven't we heard anything
about this case?

139
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:56,933
The case never made
criminal history...

140
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:58,998
because Hitler appeared on the scene,
and the whole Nazi nightmare.

141
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:02,273
But there must be files
on the Mabuse case.

142
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:31,197
This is number eight.

143
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,106
Switch it on.

144
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,773
Decoding is active.
Write it down.

145
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,781
This is Dr. Mabuse speaking.

146
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:46,886
Four days ago...

147
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:49,949
the American Henry W. Taylor
arrived in town.

148
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,122
The British foreign office
just agreed.

149
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:55,859
Good.

150
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:01,730
- Gentlemen?
- We accept.

151
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:03,706
Just a question of principle:

152
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:06,538
When you take over the entire stock
holdings of Taran Nuclear Works...

153
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,601
is this happening under the auspices
of the United States...

154
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,704
or are you signing
as a private citizen?

155
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,874
In practice, it's irrelevant.

156
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,885
When I evaluate the secret models
of your rockets...

157
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:18,387
on my U.S. testing grounds...

158
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,356
I will be under government supervision
anyway.

159
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:23,723
And how do you envision
the financial transaction?

160
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:26,228
As soon as my lawyers
have examined the contract...

161
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,527
you will receive
the full amount by check.

162
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:31,159
The name Taylor is an alias.

163
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:35,695
Departments B and C are to follow
Taylor's each and every step...

164
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:39,436
and give a detailed report
every 1 2 hours.

165
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,944
Taylor is staying
in a luxury suite...

166
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:45,448
on the 14th floor
of the Luxor Hotel.

167
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:47,814
A radio message
from Inspector Kras.

168
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:50,786
"Before he was murdered
on his way to the TV studio...

169
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,346
the reporter Peter Barter
had been at the Luxor Hotel...

170
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:56,257
according to a statement
by the vehicle maintenance man."

171
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,159
Please call a short staff meeting
for 20 minutes from now.

172
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,166
In the meantime, I will notify
the president of Interpol.

173
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,795
We have been struggling
for a while...

174
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,931
with a series
of strange, unsolved crimes.

175
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:11,975
It all began two years ago.

176
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:15,170
On May 1 5, 1 958...

177
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:19,444
a passenger airplane crashed
at the Dutch airport of Schiphol...

178
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:21,178
following an act of sabotage.

179
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:23,049
The perpetrators
are still unknown.

180
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,783
Among the dead was
the French bank president Luchard.

181
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:31,351
His death caused a significant drop
on the Paris stock exchange.

182
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:33,862
During his trip to Germany...

183
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:38,334
Luchard had stayed
at the Luxor Hotel.

184
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:41,200
On November 2, 1958...

185
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:45,333
Mr. Delano, an attorney
for the steel corporation PCA...

186
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:50,039
was murdered in a sleeping car
on a train traveling from Oslo to Paris.

187
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,642
Two weeks before the murder...

188
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:56,277
Mr. Delano spent three evenings
in the casino of the Luxor Hotel.

189
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:59,584
On May 1 2, 1 959...

190
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:04,026
the Algerian-born arms dealer
Hussein fell victim to a bomb blast...

191
00:13:04,094 --> 00:13:08,929
in his car shortly after crossing
the Belgian border.

192
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:12,093
Previously, Hussein had once met
with a well-known call girl...

193
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:14,660
at the Luxor Hotel.

194
00:13:14,738 --> 00:13:16,433
And the list goes on.

195
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:20,637
Serious capital offenses,
murder, stock fraud, kidnapping.

196
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:23,805
Each case is different,
and each remains unsolved.

197
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,281
But they all have
one thing in common.

198
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,047
The victims in all these cases were
at some point guests at the Luxor Hotel.

199
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,611
That's why we have set up
one of our best special agents there.

200
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,487
His identity is known only...

201
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,492
to the chief of the Federal Crime Bureau
and myself...

202
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,088
to avoid any kind of leak
to subordinate organizations.

203
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,861
He has been staying at the Luxor
for some time now.

204
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:49,065
His sole mission is to find out
what's going on at the Luxor Hotel.

205
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:07,422
I can't watch this!

206
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:10,187
The firefighters should be
spreading out their sheet by now!

207
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,091
She's about to jump!

208
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:24,938
Come back inside!

209
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:28,570
Madam, please don't cause any trouble.
We don't want a scandal.

210
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:32,082
Should you have financial difficulties,
the hotel will help, of course.

211
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:35,910
Ladies and gentlemen, you can't possibly
enter here. Please be reasonable.

212
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:38,750
- After all, a human life is at stake.
- Our jobs are on the line!

213
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:40,790
Don't give us a hard time.
We need pictures.

214
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:42,485
I'm afraid that's impossible.

215
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,187
- Is it someone from the 14th floor?
- What's her name?

216
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:47,992
- I'm sorry.
- Menil is her name.

217
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:49,794
Marion Menil.

218
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:52,961
She is staying here at the hotel. I was
going to insure her only yesterday.

219
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:55,232
Sometimes you get lucky, huh?

220
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:16,253
Don't be alarmed.

221
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:19,086
Why would you want to do
something so futile...

222
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,290
from which there is no return?

223
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:24,895
You are young and your whole life
lies ahead of you.

224
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,799
It might just be wonderful.

225
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,428
Think it over.

226
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,800
You might not die right away.

227
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:35,208
You may suffer horrible pain
before it's all over.

228
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:41,143
Or you might survive-- as a cripple.
Think about it.

229
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:45,953
I'm scared. So very scared.

230
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:48,184
Give me your hand.

231
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:52,387
Trust me.
I'll hold on to you.

232
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:55,361
- She moved!
- He took her hand.

233
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:06,399
Thank God!
I wouldn't have enjoyed my dinner.

234
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:10,507
Drink this.
It'll do you good.

235
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:12,572
This is the hotel manager.
Open the door.

236
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,277
- Please don't let anybody in.
- No, no.

237
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:17,721
Open the door!
This is the police!

238
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:18,880
Please!

239
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:21,720
Perhaps you should go in the other room.
I'll talk to these people.

240
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,161
Come in, gentlemen--
just the two of you.

241
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:35,330
No, no, please.
Don't push, gentlemen.

242
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:37,464
- We want to see the woman.
- We've got a right to see her.

243
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,476
Please, don't cause trouble. Mr. Taylor
is a guest from the United States.

244
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,637
What did he say?
What's his name?

245
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,845
Nonsense! Wait, it's--

246
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:52,951
Of course. I've seen him
in the newspapers. He did look familiar.

247
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:02,330
Get to the office right away so your
picture makes the evening edition.

248
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,698
In the meantime, I'm going to file
my report by phone.

249
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,431
Excuse me, gentlemen.

250
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:16,309
Who do you think
the noble rescuer is?

251
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:20,344
Mistelzweig.
Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.

252
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,078
The " B" stands for "belly."

253
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:24,245
General insurance: life, accident,
baggage loss, health...

254
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:26,221
fire, hail, theft, and burglary.

255
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,657
Only lovesickness and a chronic shortage
of cash are excluded.

256
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:33,124
Well, if you insure that guy,
you can retire.

257
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:36,166
Why?
Is he that well-off?

258
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:39,964
Billions. Mr. Travers is one
of the richest men from overseas.

259
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:41,026
And a bachelor.

260
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:43,470
Mrs. Menil is apparently wealthy.

261
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,872
She owns fabulous jewelry
and expensive furs.

262
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:48,503
She flew here from Paris
five days ago.

263
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,774
But our house detective
may know more about her.

264
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:53,612
- Then please ask him to come here.
- With pleasure.

265
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:57,652
Are you sure the woman won't do
anything else foolish?

266
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,889
My secretary is with her.

267
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:07,488
Gentlemen, please visit the bar--
on the house, of course.

268
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:13,429
I promise I'll give you
all the information you need later.

269
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:15,664
Mrs. Menil has lived very quietly
in this establishment.

270
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,764
She most certainly does not belong
to the demimonde.

271
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:20,036
I suspect the whole thing
has to do with a telegram...

272
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,101
that she received
about three hours ago.

273
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,113
- Do you know what it said?
- No...

274
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:26,877
but according to the receptionist...

275
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,145
Mrs. Menil grew visibly nervous
while reading the telegram...

276
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,278
and she retired
to her room immediately.

277
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:33,289
Then I will question her
personally.

278
00:18:33,357 --> 00:18:36,485
Above all, I must insist that the lady
leave the hotel at once.

279
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,257
- And I must insist--
- This won't work, gentlemen.

280
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,731
You can't save a person
from committing suicide...

281
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,598
only to leave her
to her own devices.

282
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,694
Give her time
to get over this shock.

283
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:51,707
Who will guarantee she won't
attempt suicide again?

284
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,175
I believe I can accept
that responsibility.

285
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:56,872
Perhaps Mr.--
What was the name again?

286
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:58,073
Berg.

287
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:01,174
- Mr. Berg can keep an eye on her.
- Of course.

288
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:09,990
The gentlemen are all gone.

289
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:14,555
For the moment,
no one is going to bother you.

290
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:17,366
If I can help you in any way--

291
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:20,002
No one can help me.

292
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,231
Why didn't you let me--

293
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,774
Everything would have been
over now.

294
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,105
Death is such a finite thing.

295
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,645
People often think they are facing
a catastrophe...

296
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:33,240
and despair descends
like a dark cloud.

297
00:19:33,317 --> 00:19:36,650
In every situation
there is a way out.

298
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,517
Not for me.

299
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:41,054
Do you have financial worries?

300
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:44,359
Romantic troubles?

301
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:48,694
You trusted me when you were
standing out there on the ledge.

302
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,863
I should probably
be grateful to you.

303
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:54,861
But I'm not.

304
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:57,805
Do you have any family
I can notify?

305
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:00,974
I don't want to see anyone.

306
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,536
I want to go to my room.

307
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:06,480
I don't want you
to be alone now.

308
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,750
Yes, I understand.

309
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:12,115
Then please notify
my doctor, Dr.Jordan.

310
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,597
- Where is he? In the lobby?
- No, in the other room.

311
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:31,563
Forgive me. I was told that
Mrs. Menil was in your suite.

312
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:35,143
Sister Agnes heard a radio broadcast at
my clinic about this terrible incident.

313
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,908
Mrs. Menil is my patient.
May I see her?

314
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:41,075
I was just about
to send for you.

315
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:43,352
Marion!

316
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:50,255
How could you do such a thing?
You've got to pull yourself together.

317
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:53,395
I'm going to take you to your room
and give you a little shot...

318
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:56,330
and then you'll have
a nice sleep.

319
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,868
I'll leave you
in Sister Agnes's care overnight.

320
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:00,994
She's a familiar face, right?

321
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:04,670
Please don't think
I'm ungrateful, but--

322
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,173
I think complete rest
is the best remedy now.

323
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:12,571
If you don't mind, I will take
the lady to her room now.

324
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:19,622
Professor, is Mrs. Menil
permanently in your care?

325
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,316
No, absolutely not.

326
00:21:21,391 --> 00:21:24,622
But she had a nervous breakdown
once before, about a year ago.

327
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:27,288
She was a patient at my clinic
for almost two months.

328
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:31,391
And she's got no husband,
no boyfriend?

329
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:36,237
As a doctor, I can't make statements
about Mrs. Menil's private life.

330
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:40,299
Certainly. But I am of course interested
in this woman's situation now.

331
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:43,210
She is a very lonely person,
very guarded.

332
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,714
It's not easy to win her trust.

333
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,443
You--

334
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:49,951
You must exert
a strong influence on her.

335
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,250
I mean, on her subconscious...

336
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:56,122
in that you succeeded
in saving her from suicide.

337
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:58,423
I'm somewhat surprised...

338
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,486
but very happy about it.

339
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:01,826
Good-bye now.

340
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:05,026
" Multimillionaire Thwarts Suicide
at Luxor Hotel"

341
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,798
Not exactly a pleasant advertisement
for our hotel.

342
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:13,302
- Good evening, Inspector. The usual?
- Yes, the usual.

343
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,241
A lot of action around here.

344
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:19,612
Are your rates so high that your guests
must jump out the window?

345
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:23,244
It may be a joke to you, Inspector,
but unfortunately the joke is on me...

346
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,084
as if I were everybody's baby-sitter.

347
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:29,148
These disgusting reporters.
May they go to hell.

348
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:32,787
Yes, these reporters
with their scribbling--

349
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:36,094
To think what my friend Barter
would have done with a thing like this.

350
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,795
Oh, well. Since his death
I haven't been watching TV anymore.

351
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,963
Was he the one who died
of a heart attack in his car?

352
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:45,565
Yes. A great guy, Inspector.
Generous in every way.

353
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:47,303
- Mr. Berg?
- Yes.

354
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:51,143
Mr. Travers' secretary would like
to speak to you on the phone.

355
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,910
Excuse me for a moment, please.

356
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:55,781
Did you know this Barter well?

357
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:59,049
He always asked me for tips
on special guests.

358
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:00,987
Especially the female ones,
I bet.

359
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:05,517
You will laugh, Inspector, but I had
pointed out Mrs. Menil to Mr. Barter.

360
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:07,460
Actually, it was
the day she arrived.

361
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:10,125
She sat over there, while Barter
drank his whiskey over there.

362
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,135
Things must have worked out...

363
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:15,967
because a little later
they went upstairs together.

364
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,507
Interesting.

365
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:28,481
Would you kindly let Mrs. Menil
know that I'd like to see her?

366
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:31,487
I'm afraid that's impossible.
She just took a sleeping pill.

367
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,413
- Is she asleep yet?
- No, but--

368
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,458
- Then I'd like to see her.
- Can't it wait until tomorrow?

369
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:37,015
Unfortunately, it can't.

370
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:39,027
My name is Kras.

371
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:41,529
Inspector Kras.

372
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:51,200
A man by the name of Inspector Kras
insists he must see you.

373
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:53,902
Is this necessary?
Why do people torture me so?

374
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,242
Please...

375
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:59,714
but take the lady's health
into consideration.

376
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,386
Please forgive the late visit,
but I'm afraid it's quite urgent.

377
00:24:04,454 --> 00:24:06,945
Please make it quick.
I feel faint.

378
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:10,322
Do you remember a man
by the name of Barter?

379
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:12,520
Barter? No.

380
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:14,120
A TV reporter.

381
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:16,529
This is the first time
I've heard his name.

382
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,835
Perhaps this will refresh
your memory.

383
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:22,565
Oh, that guy!
Yes, I know him.

384
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:26,942
He introduced himself
downstairs in the bar.

385
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:31,978
I hadn't quite caught his name.
He wanted an interview.

386
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:34,482
I refused. After all,
I'm not some movie star.

387
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:36,212
He was awfully pushy.

388
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,914
And yet you brought him upstairs
to your room.

389
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:41,924
I didn't want to make
a scene in the bar.

390
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:45,450
I brought him here upstairs,
but he got quite aggressive.

391
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:49,055
It got so bad that I had to ask him
to stop bothering me.

392
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:51,259
He's not going to bother you
anymore.

393
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,369
Shortly after visiting you,
Mr. Barter...

394
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:57,303
died.

395
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:00,709
But that's awful!

396
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:06,274
And when a person wants to die,
they won't let her!

397
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,711
" Return immediately or you must bear
the consequences of your actions.

398
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:12,152
I have proof
of your guilt."

399
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:17,421
Mrs. Menil, three hours after receiving
this telegram from Paris...

400
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:19,894
you attempted suicide.

401
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:21,954
How did you get
that telegram?

402
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:23,897
My personal life
is nobody's business.

403
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:27,664
When the police are interested
in something, there is no personal life.

404
00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:30,103
Why are you torturing me
like this?

405
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:31,902
Leave me alone!

406
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:33,966
That's enough.
Can't you see?

407
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:37,847
But I must talk to you again
about Barter.

408
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:42,146
I received
a very strange phone call.

409
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:45,614
For the time being,
please don't leave town.

410
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:48,317
Good night.

411
00:25:58,368 --> 00:26:00,962
" H. B. Mistelzweig
Insurance"

412
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:03,631
Tough times, tough business.

413
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:07,099
Mars has entered the house of death
of too many people.

414
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:10,510
- Who has entered what?
- Mars is in the house of death.

415
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,515
As a modern businessman, I work
solely on the basis of astrology.

416
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:18,077
There is no point in insuring people
if you know that they won't live long.

417
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:20,554
Imagine if I had insured
your friend Barter.

418
00:26:20,623 --> 00:26:21,954
He looked as chipper
as life itself.

419
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:24,255
He would have just paid
his first premium, and then-- wham!

420
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:26,852
A heart attack!
What an awful loss that would have been.

421
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,297
No, no. One must look at the stars
of these insurance candidates.

422
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:33,097
- Very interesting.
- What do you mean?

423
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:36,502
- Did you have Barter's horoscope?
- This is Inspector Kras.

424
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:39,508
Please, allow me:
Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.

425
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:41,168
" B" stands for "belly."

426
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:43,109
General insurance:
Life, accident, baggage loss...

427
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:44,874
health, fire, hail, theft, burglary.

428
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:48,349
Only lovesickness and a chronic shortage
of cash are excluded.

429
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:51,748
Impressive.
What companies do you work for?

430
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:53,789
Lloyd's of London,
Assurance la Paix Paris...

431
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:56,519
Seguros de Madrid,
Kontor Hamburg National and Overseas.

432
00:26:56,593 --> 00:26:58,891
Mistelzweig has
worldwide connections.

433
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:01,396
A lucrative business, isn't it?

434
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:03,762
One doesn't talk about that.
One gets by.

435
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:07,167
Allow me, gentlemen.
Another round.

436
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:09,767
A little schnapps with your beer
can't hurt, Inspector.

437
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,501
Besides, it's all tax-deductible.

438
00:27:13,143 --> 00:27:14,940
Karl, one more.

439
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:16,774
The hotel engineer is,
of course, included.

440
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,677
I'm sorry, Mr. Mistelzweig.
Perhaps later, though.

441
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:20,739
The freezer for the kitchen
downstairs is on the blink.

442
00:27:20,817 --> 00:27:24,150
Most likely it's a short. Do you have
the key to the machine room?

443
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,381
No, but there must be
a spare downstairs.

444
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:28,754
I can't find it.
Please come with me.

445
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:31,726
Go ahead and pour my drink.
I'll be right back.

446
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,098
Do you have an office
here at the hotel?

447
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,396
My office? No, no.

448
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:41,130
My office is here--
in my head.

449
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:43,263
I do my business at the Luxor...

450
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,830
but I wouldn't take a permanent office
here if they gave it to me for free.

451
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,809
What don't you like
about the hotel?

452
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:50,710
Just between you and me:
It's not under a lucky star...

453
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,874
like anything the Nazis started
near the end of the war.

454
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,578
What does that have to do
with the Luxor?

455
00:27:56,653 --> 00:28:01,249
People aren't the only ones influenced
by the constellations upon their birth.

456
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:03,554
- A building is too.
- Come on now!

457
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:06,421
- A building isn't born!
- Oh, yes, it is, Inspector.

458
00:28:06,496 --> 00:28:10,830
The placement of its cornerstone
is its birth hour...

459
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,700
and the cornerstone for the Luxor
was laid by the Nazis in May '44...

460
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:17,740
when they still believed
in final victory.

461
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:21,265
The bigwigs in the SS wanted
to build a few grand hotels...

462
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:23,369
for politicians and diplomats...

463
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:27,280
all in one huge cluster,
so they could spy on everybody.

464
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,217
No, the Luxor has a negative aura.

465
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:32,379
But your business is thriving here
nevertheless.

466
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:34,855
Well, in a hotel like this there are
always people with a lot of money.

467
00:28:34,924 --> 00:28:39,759
There's jewelry or baggage to insure,
or travel insurance to write.

468
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:42,559
My wife has always wanted me
to buy life insurance.

469
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:45,032
It all depends on the stars,
Inspector.

470
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:47,228
It's all in the stars.

471
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:50,338
Considering your profession...

472
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:53,068
you could be dead tomorrow,
right?

473
00:28:53,142 --> 00:28:55,303
I mean, since you're always
in dangerous situations.

474
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:57,676
Criminals never sleep,
do they?

475
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:59,874
But perhaps we could
work something out.

476
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:02,349
Call me at the office
in the morning.

477
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:04,579
It's pretty quiet there
these days.

478
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:07,919
I'd also like to talk
about Mr. Barter.

479
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:10,186
He wanted insurance too.

480
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,388
I received
a very strange phone call.

481
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,759
To your health,
Mr. Mistelzweig.

482
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,926
Cheers, Inspector.

483
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,208
- It was nice to meet you.
- The pleasure was all mine.

484
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:30,769
I'll be sure to call you.

485
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,292
No harm done...

486
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:56,202
but if you could take me to the other
side, I'd appreciate that very much.

487
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:58,740
May I give you
a lift somewhere?

488
00:29:58,808 --> 00:30:00,799
That's very kind of you.

489
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:05,512
If you can find room
for my dog too--

490
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:07,914
Of course.

491
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,192
In Ireland we also have
this cold, wet weather.

492
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:21,492
I can feel it on my skin
like damp wool.

493
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:23,589
I don't know.

494
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,235
Careful!
Don't take the turn so fast!

495
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,168
Danger!

496
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,178
Damn! That was close.

497
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:39,408
- Thanks for the warning.
- How did you know that?

498
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:42,508
Sometimes I can see
things coming.

499
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:45,918
You don't believe me.

500
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:49,119
This morning at the hotel...

501
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:51,183
you dropped a glass
while brushing your teeth.

502
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,491
In picking up the shards, you cut
the middle finger of your right hand.

503
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:56,625
But that's--

504
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:58,530
No one was there to see it
when it happened.

505
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:01,092
This morning, around 1 1:00...

506
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,162
you signed a check
drawn on an English bank...

507
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,471
but the business transaction
you're planning will not materialize.

508
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:11,070
The part about the check is true too,
but how do you know the rest?

509
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:15,049
I told you before:
Sometimes I can see things coming.

510
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:17,484
If you can predict
future events...

511
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:21,717
how come you didn't see that
we would almost run you over?

512
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,919
The hour of my death
has not yet come.

513
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:29,861
- Who are you?
- My name is Cornelius.

514
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,205
Good evening...

515
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:44,041
Inspector.

516
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:46,906
Why did you turn on the light?

517
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:49,247
So that you may see better,
Inspector.

518
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:51,718
I could have been a burglar.

519
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:54,222
No, my dog growled and barked.

520
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,781
This means that there's someone
in the room whom he knows.

521
00:31:56,859 --> 00:32:01,489
He would have behaved differently
with a stranger.

522
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:02,963
And then...

523
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:05,125
I also smelled
your pipe tobacco.

524
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:07,863
The odor clings
to your clothing.

525
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:11,168
Then I knew it was you
waiting for me in the dark.

526
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:15,166
The blind have keener senses
than people who see.

527
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:19,238
But how did you get in?
My attendant has the night off.

528
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:22,478
I was so bold as to let myself in,
Mr. Cornelius.

529
00:32:22,552 --> 00:32:25,749
Please accept my apologies,
but I must talk to you.

530
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:28,188
There's a new twist
in the Barter case.

531
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:30,452
Did they find something
in his car?

532
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,591
No.

533
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:36,097
In his head.

534
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,569
A small, unfriendly thing

535
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:43,735
Let me be frank,
Mr. Cornelius.

536
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,232
I'm not making much progress
in this matter.

537
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:49,176
You know I'm a skeptic...

538
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:52,180
but when you're stuck,
beggars can't be choosers.

539
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:57,980
If you concentrate
on this object...

540
00:32:58,054 --> 00:33:00,420
what do you see...

541
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,015
that might help me?

542
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:10,397
A man.

543
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:14,699
His face is a blur.

544
00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:18,597
Now, nothing!

545
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:21,675
The cloud again.
The dark cloud.

546
00:33:22,178 --> 00:33:26,137
It covers everything.
It's stronger than I am.

547
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:29,184
It threatens me personally.
I can feel it.

548
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:32,747
That's why I would be
grateful to you...

549
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:36,383
if you kept me informed
about the Barter case.

550
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:42,189
We have maintained absolute silence
with the press...

551
00:33:42,265 --> 00:33:45,029
regarding the fact that Barter
met a violent death.

552
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:48,669
Nevertheless, this afternoon I received
a very strange phone call.

553
00:33:49,572 --> 00:33:51,767
A man was willing...

554
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:54,901
in exchange for immunity
from prosecution and a reward...

555
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:58,879
to give me information
about this steel needle.

556
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:04,109
We immediately determined the call
originated from a public phone.

557
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:06,178
But the guy
was much too smart.

558
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:09,656
When the patrol car arrived,
he was long gone.

559
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:15,095
But before he hung up,
he said I should think about it.

560
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:17,291
He would call me again
tomorrow.

561
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:21,397
What are we doing here?

562
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,566
The bunker
where they found the American.

563
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:28,166
You know, the American!

564
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:32,472
- And why are we here?
- To make a phone call.

565
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:36,676
- You're so fond of making phone calls.
- Me? What do you mean?

566
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:39,778
You know. I warned you.

567
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:42,518
- The doctor doesn't like it.
- What doesn't he like?

568
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:44,958
- That you make phone calls.
- But I didn't--

569
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:48,319
I didn't!

570
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:53,202
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Morning.

571
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,929
It got pretty late last night.
Any news?

572
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,802
Nothing at all.
Everything was quiet.

573
00:34:57,874 --> 00:35:00,809
The telephone didn't work,
but it's been fixed.

574
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:03,204
- A man from the phone company--
- Don't pick up!

575
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,467
I'd be willing
to purchase it.

576
00:35:28,537 --> 00:35:31,802
Would you accept
45,000 marks?

577
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:35,708
- But it's worth much more!
- Let's say 50,000.

578
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:39,646
- All right.
- Would you like a check or cash?

579
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:43,674
Cash. I may need to leave today,
and the banks are already closed.

580
00:35:46,923 --> 00:35:48,584
Nexit.

581
00:35:48,658 --> 00:35:50,751
You were lucky, Inspector.

582
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:53,624
If it weren't for that cabinet,
you'd be dead as a rat now.

583
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,765
It would serve me right.

584
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:05,434
His wife is expecting
their first child.

585
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:13,081
You slowly get used to the fact that
people bite the dust in our profession.

586
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:15,782
It's all business as usual.

587
00:36:17,486 --> 00:36:19,477
And it's my fault.

588
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:21,853
Your fault? Why?

589
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:24,051
Yesterday I set out
three pieces of bait...

590
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:26,924
but the response
came faster than I expected.

591
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:29,157
But from whom?

592
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,358
The psychic?

593
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:33,561
The insurance agent?

594
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:35,126
Or the woman?

595
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:38,339
Why aren't you honest
with me?

596
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:40,500
I don't know
what you mean.

597
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,204
You sold this piece
of jewelry today.

598
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:47,776
- You had me followed?
- I feel responsible for you.

599
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,380
You booked flights today
with four different airlines...

600
00:36:52,455 --> 00:36:55,424
for four consecutive dates...

601
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:57,618
to four different cities...

602
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,718
under four different names...

603
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:01,524
none of them your real one.

604
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:04,865
- Why?
- Please, don't ask!

605
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,336
What is threatening you,
Marion?

606
00:37:09,405 --> 00:37:12,169
What were you so afraid of
that you wanted to end your life?

607
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:14,869
Please don't ask.
Please, please, don't ask!

608
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:18,436
I don't want to cause you pain, Marion,
but why don't you let me help you?

609
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:21,779
I don't want to owe
anybody anything.

610
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:26,220
- I won't accept any money from you.
- Then at least take this back.

611
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:31,492
I know what it means to a woman
to give up her jewelry.

612
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:35,491
Then I have no other choice
but to keep it.

613
00:37:35,564 --> 00:37:38,192
Perhaps chance will unite us
once again.

614
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,758
In the meantime,
this piece will remind me of you.

615
00:37:40,836 --> 00:37:43,100
My plane is leaving tomorrow.

616
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:45,197
Tomorrow, already?

617
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,101
Will you do me a big favor
before we part?

618
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:50,077
If I can, gladly, of course.

619
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:52,444
Then spend our last evening
with me.

620
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:55,416
You must distract yourself
to regain your zest for life.

621
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,475
You need to get out
and see happy people.

622
00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,544
You need to hear laughter
and music.

623
00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:30,010
To the next lucky coincidence
that will bring us together.

624
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:34,554
Everyday worries and concerns
must be checked in with your coat.

625
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:36,716
All right.
To the next lucky coincidence.

626
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:42,854
Terrific music, isn't it?
It gets in your blood.

627
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:45,162
I'm a Scorpio.
They burn with passion.

628
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:47,464
What are you, madam?
A Libra?

629
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:50,232
No, I'm a Sagittarius.

630
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:51,973
Straight to the heart!

631
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:54,874
- Would you like to dance?
- Oh, yes!

632
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,683
Do you like to dance?

633
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,242
I used to love to dance,
a long time ago.

634
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:10,654
You know, I believe you are
a cheerful person by nature.

635
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:13,126
I used to be
very happy and cheerful.

636
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:17,029
- I loved to laugh.
- Why don't you try it again?

637
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:23,169
See? Much better.
Come and dance with me.

638
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:35,747
Wasn't I right to drag you out
of your end-of-the-world mood?

639
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:37,410
Yes, perhaps.

640
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:46,587
You dance beautifully.

641
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:49,724
See? You are
a different person now.

642
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:54,231
Marion, come to Paris
with me tomorrow.

643
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:57,606
To Paris?
I can't go to Paris.

644
00:39:57,873 --> 00:39:59,932
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not a prude.

645
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:01,909
I would love to do it.

646
00:40:01,977 --> 00:40:03,740
But I can't leave now.

647
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:05,370
Why not?

648
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:08,213
I'm not free.

649
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:10,081
I'm married.

650
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:12,017
Do you love your husband?

651
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:14,419
I hate him.

652
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:53,055
When the lady
who just stepped out returns...

653
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:55,653
please tell her
I'll be right back.

654
00:41:12,548 --> 00:41:14,709
He carries a gun
in a shoulder holster.

655
00:41:14,783 --> 00:41:16,751
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

656
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:19,413
I'm all black and blue
from pressing against it.

657
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:22,389
Have you never considered
divorce?

658
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,586
Yes, often, but my husband
will never let me go.

659
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:28,687
Money can overcome
many obstacles.

660
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:30,391
Not in my case.

661
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:32,331
Money can't help me.

662
00:41:32,401 --> 00:41:34,801
But let's not talk about me.

663
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,464
Tell me about yourself,
about your life.

664
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:40,804
It's not very interesting.
Business, conferences.

665
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,501
-And women?
- Yes.

666
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,444
But only in passing.

667
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:48,745
You know, when someone lives
for his work as much as I do--

668
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:51,342
board meetings, staff meetings,
business meetings--

669
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,516
I practically live in planes
and conference halls.

670
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:59,027
There's only room
for brief pleasures...

671
00:41:59,094 --> 00:42:01,824
and not much more.

672
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:06,459
- That's very sad.
- One can't have everything.

673
00:42:06,535 --> 00:42:10,130
Mr. Travers? Excuse me.
We just received this.

674
00:42:13,509 --> 00:42:16,034
- What about the check?
- The lawyers still have it.

675
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:18,045
- Cancel it right away.
- Yes, sir.

676
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:22,114
You see?
You can't relax either.

677
00:42:22,184 --> 00:42:24,414
A few minutes ago,
when we were dancing...

678
00:42:24,486 --> 00:42:26,886
I believed that I could
run away from myself.

679
00:42:26,955 --> 00:42:29,287
But I can't.
No one can.

680
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,383
We've all got to follow
our path.

681
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:35,696
No, I would only bring you
bad luck.

682
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:38,927
If only all this had happened
three years ago, fine.

683
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,992
But now it's only self-deception.

684
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,405
I'm sorry to spoil
this lovely evening for you.

685
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:49,941
Please forgive me and forget me.
It's better that way.

686
00:42:50,012 --> 00:42:52,412
Do you really want me
to forget you?

687
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:56,717
Yes.

688
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:13,466
"Radio London announces
nuclear power plant...

689
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,470
run by the Taran Plutonium
Corporation was blown up today.

690
00:43:16,538 --> 00:43:19,473
Plant completely destroyed by fire.
Many casualties.

691
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:23,170
Population within 1 0-mile radius
evacuated for safety reasons."

692
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:27,841
The catastrophe itself
I did not foresee.

693
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:31,909
I only felt there was a dark shadow
hovering over your plans.

694
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:34,285
First, the broken glass
in the bathroom...

695
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:37,018
then the truck
we nearly collided with...

696
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:38,582
and now this
Taran Corporation matter.

697
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,959
What's the rational explanation
for all this?

698
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,295
F ate allowed me
to cross your path.

699
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:48,268
Perhaps I'm to protect you
from future harm.

700
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:51,670
The explosion in the Taran plant
is hardly harmful to me.

701
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,402
A business transaction
that didn't materialize.

702
00:43:54,476 --> 00:43:55,966
That's all.

703
00:43:56,845 --> 00:44:00,440
I mean your personal life.

704
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:10,681
Although I'm blind,
light that's too bright is bothersome.

705
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:13,091
It scatters your thoughts.

706
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:17,194
You must now focus on me.

707
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:25,564
You should go away.
Leave this town.

708
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:30,041
Something has crossed
your path...

709
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:34,372
and a dark cloud
hangs over you.

710
00:44:37,686 --> 00:44:40,655
I see a figure.

711
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:43,549
It's very blurred.

712
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:45,818
An animal.

713
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,054
And a woman?

714
00:44:47,696 --> 00:44:49,425
Perhaps.

715
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:52,998
I can't quite penetrate
the darkness.

716
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:57,403
But one thing I do see.

717
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,669
You saved a life...

718
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:05,312
and it is precisely this life
that threatens you with danger...

719
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:07,475
and death.

720
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:11,883
She can't just be making up the fact
she reserved four airplane tickets...

721
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:14,286
even if she did it
under false names.

722
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:16,221
I don't get it.

723
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:20,227
Take a note:
Interpol inquiry.

724
00:45:20,295 --> 00:45:23,662
Does this insurance agent Mistelzweig
really work for Lloyd's of London...

725
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:26,360
and Assurance la Paix Paris
and all the other companies?

726
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:34,838
Inspector, Mrs. Menil just canceled
all four flight reservations.

727
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:38,946
Interesting.

728
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:41,640
She goes out
with the American...

729
00:45:41,717 --> 00:45:44,049
and the next morning
she cancels her flights.

730
00:45:44,753 --> 00:45:47,813
Yet she didn't look too happy
when she went upstairs.

731
00:45:48,023 --> 00:45:50,253
Interesting.

732
00:45:50,325 --> 00:45:51,690
I have something else for you.

733
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,753
Get hold of this Cornelius character's
latest tax return. Be discreet about it.

734
00:46:05,173 --> 00:46:07,698
Hello, Mr. Cornelius?
This is Kras.

735
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:10,874
No. No news, really.

736
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:16,448
Did the man who wanted to give you
the confidential information call you?

737
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:19,010
He couldn't call me,
Mr. Cornelius.

738
00:46:19,087 --> 00:46:21,612
You see, my phone
exploded yesterday.

739
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,681
A little assassination attempt
against me.

740
00:46:24,192 --> 00:46:28,629
A man from the phone company
supposedly repaired it earlier.

741
00:46:28,697 --> 00:46:32,064
What did the man look like?
Can you please describe him for me?

742
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:35,694
The only person who could do that
is my assistant...

743
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:38,103
but, unfortunately, he's dead.

744
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:40,639
Why didn't you warn me
before it happened?

745
00:46:40,709 --> 00:46:42,108
What is that supposed to mean?

746
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:45,704
Are you saying you wanted me
to predict your death? You're alive!

747
00:46:46,582 --> 00:46:49,949
- But in the Barter case you did!
- Well, he's truly dead.

748
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:53,886
Inspector, I sense your mistrust.
You are skeptical.

749
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:56,049
That's why I would like
to convince you.

750
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:58,854
Please attend a telepathic sance
at my house tonight.

751
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:01,657
Choose for yourself
the people you want to witness it.

752
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,630
Bring whomever you wish.

753
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:05,994
Do you really believe
in this humbug?

754
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:09,526
Michael, you know I'm a skeptical man.
Always have been.

755
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:12,403
Now, for the first time
in my life...

756
00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:14,465
I wish I were able
to believe in someone.

757
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:17,341
The psychic or the woman?

758
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:19,642
You should know me better,
Michael.

759
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:22,548
I do what I think is right.

760
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:24,848
No psychic can change that.

761
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,788
- So you are staying here?
- Yes. You fly to London alone today.

762
00:47:28,857 --> 00:47:31,417
Get information on all the repercussions
of the catastrophe...

763
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:35,520
especially whether the secret plans
for the rockets were saved.

764
00:47:35,597 --> 00:47:38,430
And something else, Michael.
This you can do right away.

765
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,459
Pick out fifty roses
in the flower shop downstairs...

766
00:47:42,537 --> 00:47:45,472
and have them sent to Mrs. Menil,
with this note.

767
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,030
Certainly.

768
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,053
Excuse me, Mr. Travers.

769
00:48:00,122 --> 00:48:02,784
May I perhaps have a word
with you in private?

770
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:04,758
What is this about?

771
00:48:06,194 --> 00:48:08,059
It's about Mrs. Menil.

772
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:17,135
It's not my custom to intrude
in the private affairs of our guests...

773
00:48:17,205 --> 00:48:21,767
but I know you are interested
in anything that concerns Mrs. Menil.

774
00:48:21,843 --> 00:48:25,108
Our access to her
for surveillance purposes...

775
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,842
is unfortunately very restricted.

776
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,610
She spends most of the day
in her suite.

777
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:35,521
She speaks on the phone a great deal
and receives visitors too.

778
00:48:36,425 --> 00:48:38,290
But I may be able
to reveal something...

779
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,557
of great interest to you.

780
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,030
How much do you want?

781
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:46,590
That's entirely up to you,
of course.

782
00:48:46,668 --> 00:48:50,365
But it must be absolutely confidential.
I could lose my job.

783
00:48:56,044 --> 00:48:57,306
Well, then?

784
00:48:58,046 --> 00:49:00,708
Forgive me, but it's something
that I can only show you...

785
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:03,080
if I may trouble you
to come with me.

786
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:05,210
It won't take long.

787
00:49:45,627 --> 00:49:47,788
It's right here.

788
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:52,198
This suite is adjacent to the rooms
occupied by Mrs. Menil.

789
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:04,876
This room was once occupied
by a very jealous husband...

790
00:50:04,946 --> 00:50:06,971
whose wife was staying
right next door.

791
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:09,881
He was never sure whether
she was faithful to him or not...

792
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:13,944
so I helped him out
with this little setup.

793
00:50:14,856 --> 00:50:18,952
One fine day,
he caught her in the act.

794
00:50:21,863 --> 00:50:25,458
Here you can see and hear everything,
but from the other side, you can't.

795
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:28,962
I'm going to turn on
the loudspeaker.

796
00:50:43,218 --> 00:50:46,483
Unbelievable, no? On the other side,
it's just a normal mirror.

797
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:50,656
Please help me get dressed.

798
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:01,197
Please see who it is.

799
00:51:03,371 --> 00:51:05,498
These roses are for the lady.

800
00:51:23,024 --> 00:51:25,151
Beautiful roses.

801
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:27,557
I'll get a vase right away.

802
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:04,525
Well, did I promise
too much, Mr. Travers?

803
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,262
Turn it off! It's despicable
to eavesdrop on people like that.

804
00:52:08,703 --> 00:52:11,001
Turn it off!

805
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:15,065
Don't worry, Mr. Berg.
I will pay you for this secret.

806
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:20,380
So that no one else may misuse it,
reserve this suite for me.

807
00:52:20,448 --> 00:52:23,417
Tell the receptionist that it's for some
business partners I'm expecting.

808
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:25,316
Of course, Mr. Travers.

809
00:52:36,765 --> 00:52:38,289
Yes?

810
00:52:38,366 --> 00:52:41,927
May I remind you that
we still have an appointment?

811
00:52:42,203 --> 00:52:46,469
I would like you to attend
a telepathic sance with me.

812
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:48,740
Yes, ma'am.

813
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:51,643
With a psychic, at 8:30 p.m.

814
00:52:52,013 --> 00:52:54,004
I would very much appreciate
seeing you there.

815
00:52:54,082 --> 00:52:58,018
Hello, Inspector. Is this a bad time?
Shall l--

816
00:52:58,954 --> 00:53:01,946
Don't leave the hotel.
I'll call you later.

817
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:07,784
Is this place all right?
It looks so-- so dilapidated.

818
00:53:07,862 --> 00:53:10,922
You were right the other day,
Mr. Mistelzweig.

819
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:13,627
Someone planned to dispatch me
to heaven.

820
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:17,364
- Maybe I should--
- No, no, no.

821
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,930
You couldn't have come
at a better time. Have a seat.

822
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:22,635
You are interested in astrology
and such, aren't you?

823
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:25,145
Yes, as a business principle.
You know--

824
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,615
- Is this your wife?
- Yes, yes.

825
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:33,382
Would you like to attend
an interesting sance with a psychic?

826
00:53:33,455 --> 00:53:35,855
I'm flattered! When?

827
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:38,085
Tonight at 8:30.

828
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:40,923
Perhaps we can talk business too.
I'll bring my wife.

829
00:53:40,996 --> 00:53:43,692
May I introduce my wife?
Mr. Cornelius.

830
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:45,562
Very pleased to meet you,
madam.

831
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:47,624
This is my assistant, Mr. Kaiser,
and Mr. Mistelzweig.

832
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:50,466
Hieronymus B. Mistelzweig.
The " B" stands for "belly."

833
00:53:51,006 --> 00:53:53,804
He's very much interested
in the occult, especially astrology.

834
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:57,834
Only in a very amateurish way.
I'm an absolute dilettante.

835
00:53:57,912 --> 00:54:00,506
But, in fact, today the sun is
in conjunction with Neptune.

836
00:54:00,582 --> 00:54:02,675
That means water,
so we're due for a thunderstorm.

837
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,117
I should have brought
an umbrella, right?

838
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:12,155
That's a splendid animal
you've got there.

839
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:17,397
Come on, doggie.
Uncle has got something for you.

840
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:20,696
Quiet, Ferro. Be quiet.

841
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:24,102
He's not interested.
He won't take anything from a stranger.

842
00:54:38,086 --> 00:54:40,452
This is Mr. Cornelius,
my wife...

843
00:54:40,522 --> 00:54:42,513
Mr. Kaiser, and you already know
Mr. Mistelzweig.

844
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:45,616
- I hope I'm not late.
- Not at all, madam.

845
00:54:45,693 --> 00:54:49,129
Please, let's all take a seat.
It's very informal.

846
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,171
Please...

847
00:55:06,247 --> 00:55:09,648
concentrate on me now.

848
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:21,458
I'm having difficulty
concentrating.

849
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,894
Something is interfering
with me.

850
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:27,491
It's not the thunderstorm.

851
00:55:28,303 --> 00:55:30,601
- Inspector.
- Yes?

852
00:55:31,272 --> 00:55:33,900
Would you mind
if we traded places?

853
00:55:33,975 --> 00:55:36,136
Not at all.

854
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:39,772
- Excuse me!
- No problem.

855
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:42,282
I hope my cigars
survived intact.

856
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:44,147
I suspected as much:

857
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:47,586
Saturn in the 11th house--
a small accident among friends.

858
00:55:50,425 --> 00:55:52,188
Excuse me.

859
00:55:55,497 --> 00:55:57,795
Let us begin.

860
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:15,640
Someone among us has come here
with the intent to deceive.

861
00:56:17,185 --> 00:56:21,053
I see a woman's hand
and a ring.

862
00:56:21,122 --> 00:56:24,057
A ring that doesn't belong
on that hand.

863
00:56:24,959 --> 00:56:30,329
A tragic fate tore from this woman
the man she loved.

864
00:56:31,065 --> 00:56:34,193
A dark cloud
hangs over the man.

865
00:56:35,203 --> 00:56:36,830
The image is blurring.

866
00:56:37,372 --> 00:56:41,775
A car, with the man
at the wheel.

867
00:56:42,343 --> 00:56:44,277
He is dead.

868
00:56:44,345 --> 00:56:47,109
Peter Barter.

869
00:56:47,348 --> 00:56:52,843
One person here saw him
before he died...

870
00:56:53,988 --> 00:56:57,446
and one person here
will avenge his death.

871
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:02,320
It won't be an easy task.

872
00:57:02,397 --> 00:57:05,696
The dark cloud
is all-powerful.

873
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:09,400
It gathers and approaches...

874
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,404
ever closer!

875
00:57:11,973 --> 00:57:15,306
No, it's not a cloud.

876
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,108
It's a face.

877
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,647
The face of a dead man.

878
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:26,014
No, he's alive.

879
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:31,152
Mabuse. Dr. Mabuse.

880
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,558
Now it's gone.
The dark cloud has returned.

881
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:39,293
Close, very close.

882
00:57:40,235 --> 00:57:43,762
It is here!
It is hanging over--

883
00:57:44,439 --> 00:57:46,236
Kras!

884
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:47,797
Get away from the window!

885
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:53,104
Turn the lights off!

886
00:58:09,998 --> 00:58:12,558
The shot came from either
the roof or the attic of that house.

887
00:58:12,634 --> 00:58:14,693
Kaiser, maybe we can still
catch the guy!

888
00:58:17,538 --> 00:58:19,369
I'm not staying here
any longer.

889
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,499
Would you please take me
back to the hotel?

890
00:58:21,576 --> 00:58:23,567
Please don't leave me
here alone.

891
00:58:23,645 --> 00:58:25,943
The danger has passed.

892
00:58:26,014 --> 00:58:27,982
I regret this turn of events.

893
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:32,281
Perhaps some refreshments
will help you recover from the shock.

894
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:41,552
Mr. Cornelius...

895
00:58:44,332 --> 00:58:46,061
I admire your psychic gift.

896
00:58:46,134 --> 00:58:49,160
Really, it was fabulous!
Amazing!

897
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:53,470
By the way, what was that strange name
you mentioned?

898
00:58:57,312 --> 00:59:00,804
I don't remember.
I have no control in this state.

899
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:02,782
It doesn't really matter.

900
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:05,114
By the way--
just between you and me--

901
00:59:05,186 --> 00:59:09,646
does this Inspector Kras
have a chance of living much longer?

902
00:59:09,724 --> 00:59:12,420
I'm not omniscient,
Mr. Mistelzweig.

903
00:59:12,493 --> 00:59:14,518
Well, he wants to buy
life insurance from me...

904
00:59:14,595 --> 00:59:17,223
and I would appreciate
certain tips.

905
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:21,132
I don't do business
with the lives of other people.

906
00:59:21,202 --> 00:59:23,102
Of course not.
Please forgive me.

907
00:59:23,171 --> 00:59:25,036
It was just a thought.

908
00:59:25,106 --> 00:59:29,509
By the way, did you notice
that the shot rang out...

909
00:59:29,577 --> 00:59:33,570
just as your grandfather clock
struck for the first time.

910
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:37,907
- Is it accurate?
- I would assume it is.

911
00:59:37,985 --> 00:59:41,045
No, the clock is exactly
one minute fast.

912
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:43,147
Here, you see?

913
00:59:44,392 --> 00:59:46,155
Please forgive me.
I forgot.

914
00:59:46,661 --> 00:59:48,891
You are blind.

915
00:59:48,963 --> 00:59:51,989
But don't you think
that this delay of one minute...

916
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:54,967
may have saved
the inspector's life?

917
00:59:55,803 --> 00:59:58,294
Well, Inspector?
What did you find?

918
00:59:58,373 --> 00:59:59,840
Nothing.

919
00:59:59,907 --> 01:00:02,740
My assistant is still looking
for clues...

920
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,903
but the man is long gone,
of course.

921
01:00:04,979 --> 01:00:07,709
Cornelius, I haven't had a chance
to thank you.

922
01:00:07,782 --> 01:00:10,114
But for your warning,
I would be dead now.

923
01:00:10,184 --> 01:00:12,618
The bullet hit the chair
exactly in the spot...

924
01:00:12,687 --> 01:00:14,951
where my head had been.

925
01:00:17,024 --> 01:00:18,992
Strange.

926
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:23,328
This is the second assassination attempt
directed at me in the last 48 hours.

927
01:00:23,398 --> 01:00:25,457
You are mistaken, Inspector.

928
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:26,693
Why is that?

929
01:00:26,768 --> 01:00:30,704
You forget that I had been sitting
in that chair earlier.

930
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:33,741
This murder attempt
was directed at me.

931
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:41,414
I loved your roses
so very much.

932
01:00:43,317 --> 01:00:46,343
- How did you get--
- I felt so alone in my room.

933
01:00:47,255 --> 01:00:51,248
Perhaps it's childish, but I'm always
so scared of thunderstorms.

934
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:53,452
I hope you don't mind
that I simply came by.

935
01:00:53,528 --> 01:00:56,326
- Your door was open.
- Please, come in.

936
01:00:58,566 --> 01:01:00,932
Am I really the reason
you extended your stay?

937
01:01:01,002 --> 01:01:05,439
I wanted to ask you one more thing
before I dive back into my work.

938
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:07,568
Yes?

939
01:01:07,642 --> 01:01:09,872
Do you prefer
whiskey or cognac?

940
01:01:09,944 --> 01:01:12,970
Whiskey, please.
Straight up.

941
01:01:13,815 --> 01:01:16,147
- Was that the question?
- No.

942
01:01:22,323 --> 01:01:24,689
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

943
01:01:25,993 --> 01:01:27,460
And the question?

944
01:01:27,528 --> 01:01:30,588
If you were available,
would you marry me?

945
01:01:33,935 --> 01:01:36,460
I want to tell you
the truth now, Henry.

946
01:01:37,038 --> 01:01:39,336
The whole truth.

947
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:42,274
In reality,
my marriage is sheer hell.

948
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:47,978
My husband has always been driven
by an almost pathological jealousy.

949
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:50,483
He has a physical disability.

950
01:01:51,152 --> 01:01:54,815
It's just a problem with his foot.
It never bothered me.

951
01:01:54,889 --> 01:01:58,757
But it seems to be
the main reason for his jealousy.

952
01:01:59,994 --> 01:02:03,191
He is convinced
that I'm cheating on him.

953
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:07,031
Sometimes he would beat me
to extract a confession...

954
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:08,932
but there was nothing
to confess.

955
01:02:09,003 --> 01:02:11,335
That's grounds for divorce!

956
01:02:12,974 --> 01:02:16,842
I have often suggested
separation to him. Very often.

957
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:22,108
He said he would rather kill me
than set me free.

958
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:25,448
Last year, I simply ran away.

959
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:29,287
I was a nervous wreck.

960
01:02:29,357 --> 01:02:31,757
That's when I ended up
at Dr. Jordan's clinic.

961
01:02:31,826 --> 01:02:34,351
An old friend of our family.

962
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,592
When I recovered somewhat,
my husband took me back home...

963
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:42,500
and the torture, threats and abuse
began all over again.

964
01:02:43,504 --> 01:02:46,735
Ten days ago,
I completely lost control.

965
01:02:46,807 --> 01:02:49,037
I didn't care about anything.

966
01:02:49,844 --> 01:02:53,905
I obtained some poison
and intended to kill him...

967
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:57,446
but he found out
and nearly beat me to death.

968
01:02:57,985 --> 01:03:01,853
I didn't know what to do,
so I ran away again.

969
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:05,916
Just to get away from him.
That's how I ended up at the Luxor.

970
01:03:08,996 --> 01:03:10,827
But he tracked me down again.

971
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:14,231
He sent a telegram saying
if I didn't return immediately...

972
01:03:14,302 --> 01:03:16,327
he would report me.

973
01:03:16,404 --> 01:03:18,338
So that's the story
behind it all.

974
01:03:18,406 --> 01:03:22,467
I saw no other way out
but to kill myself.

975
01:03:23,978 --> 01:03:26,173
So now you know
the whole story.

976
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:28,815
Do you still want
to marry me...

977
01:03:28,883 --> 01:03:31,249
a woman who tried
to poison her husband?

978
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:42,121
Is Mrs. Menil there, Mr. Travers?
There's no answer in her room.

979
01:03:42,964 --> 01:03:45,398
It's for you.
Professor Jordan.

980
01:03:45,466 --> 01:03:47,263
The professor?

981
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,434
Yes? This is Marion.

982
01:03:51,772 --> 01:03:54,741
What? When?

983
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:57,769
Oh, my God!
Ten minutes ago?

984
01:04:01,082 --> 01:04:02,982
You'll stay at the clinic.

985
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,518
Yes, okay. Thank you.

986
01:04:05,586 --> 01:04:07,247
What's going on?

987
01:04:07,788 --> 01:04:09,688
My husband is on his way
to the hotel.

988
01:04:09,757 --> 01:04:13,056
He'll be here any minute.
He mustn't find me in your room.

989
01:04:13,127 --> 01:04:15,118
Stay here.
You are safe with me.

990
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:17,687
I can't drag you into this.
You don't know Roberto.

991
01:04:17,765 --> 01:04:19,824
Please let me go!

992
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,267
If I don't call you in half an hour,
come to my room.

993
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,773
- Is it still raining?
- I'll call a bellboy--

994
01:04:26,841 --> 01:04:29,969
No, thanks.
I'll take care of it myself.

995
01:05:08,149 --> 01:05:09,878
What is it?
I've already gone to bed.

996
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:12,646
Open the door
if you don't want a scandal.

997
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,585
Come back tomorrow.

998
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:17,180
If you don't open up,
I'll kick in the door.

999
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,192
That's it, darling.
Why resist?

1000
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:32,100
I'm sorry
if my sudden appearance...

1001
01:05:32,173 --> 01:05:34,971
rattles your tender nerves.

1002
01:05:35,042 --> 01:05:37,670
A woman who loves her husband
should welcome him more joyfully.

1003
01:05:38,245 --> 01:05:40,179
More tenderly.

1004
01:05:40,948 --> 01:05:42,745
What do you want from me?

1005
01:05:42,817 --> 01:05:45,342
I'm not sure yet myself.

1006
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:47,353
We'll see.

1007
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:50,356
It was quite stupid of you
to run away again...

1008
01:05:50,424 --> 01:05:53,757
and to believe
I wouldn't find you.

1009
01:05:53,828 --> 01:05:56,319
Just as stupid as your attempt
to poison me.

1010
01:05:56,697 --> 01:05:59,860
You thought no one would miss me
if you succeeded.

1011
01:06:00,501 --> 01:06:05,598
Now, one word from me
and you'll land in jail.

1012
01:06:05,673 --> 01:06:08,801
But this time you won't
get off the hook so easily.

1013
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:12,469
Beautiful roses.

1014
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,445
From him, right?

1015
01:06:14,515 --> 01:06:16,779
Since your dramatic
suicide attempt...

1016
01:06:16,851 --> 01:06:18,819
you've been
in all the newspapers...

1017
01:06:18,886 --> 01:06:20,319
you and your new lover.

1018
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:23,856
You must be grateful
to your savior.

1019
01:06:23,924 --> 01:06:25,755
That's best expressed...

1020
01:06:25,826 --> 01:06:30,320
with a few tender caresses,
right?

1021
01:06:30,397 --> 01:06:32,388
You animal!

1022
01:06:38,706 --> 01:06:40,264
There!

1023
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:43,208
Does this pain your little heart?
You love him, don't you?

1024
01:06:43,277 --> 01:06:44,539
Yes, I love him!

1025
01:06:44,612 --> 01:06:47,274
I love him as much as I hate you.
You hear me?

1026
01:06:47,348 --> 01:06:50,044
I don't regret for a second
that I wanted to kill you.

1027
01:06:50,117 --> 01:06:52,677
You're not human.
You're a beast!

1028
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:57,585
No so fast, my sweetheart.
Not so fast.

1029
01:06:58,092 --> 01:07:00,526
Let's see if the gentleman
from America...

1030
01:07:00,594 --> 01:07:03,893
will still want you in bed
with your face cut up.

1031
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,545
Shoot him!

1032
01:07:34,795 --> 01:07:36,956
- How did you get in here?
- Through the mirror.

1033
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:39,465
The detective--
I'll explain everything.

1034
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:47,599
Do you think anyone
heard the shooting?

1035
01:07:48,409 --> 01:07:50,001
Wait.

1036
01:08:05,392 --> 01:08:08,418
- There's nobody outside.
- I'm going to call Dr.Jordan.

1037
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:11,555
He must come right away.
Perhaps he can still save Roberto.

1038
01:08:19,306 --> 01:08:22,002
This is Marion, Professor.
Please come over right away.

1039
01:08:22,076 --> 01:08:24,067
Something terrible
has happened.

1040
01:08:25,746 --> 01:08:29,307
Perhaps you can still help him.
Thank you.

1041
01:08:29,383 --> 01:08:31,044
He's on his way.

1042
01:08:35,022 --> 01:08:38,355
- Where is my cognac?
- Here. I didn't know if you'd be back.

1043
01:08:38,425 --> 01:08:41,292
An insurance agent
always comes back.

1044
01:08:43,998 --> 01:08:45,898
It's raining cats and dogs.

1045
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:52,732
You wouldn't kick a dog out
in this weather.

1046
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:12,515
Dr.Jordan.
Thank God you're here.

1047
01:09:13,427 --> 01:09:15,895
- I shot him.
- I must tell you, Professor--

1048
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:18,421
Believe me,
it was self-defense.

1049
01:09:18,499 --> 01:09:20,763
The knife is still lying there
on the ground.

1050
01:09:47,995 --> 01:09:49,792
He's dead.

1051
01:09:49,863 --> 01:09:52,388
I didn't mean to kill him!

1052
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:54,830
Please help me, Professor.

1053
01:09:54,902 --> 01:09:58,065
You've got to help me
out of this mess!

1054
01:09:58,138 --> 01:10:00,800
Please, Marion, calm down.
Let me think.

1055
01:10:00,874 --> 01:10:02,967
Professor, I'm partially
to blame--

1056
01:10:03,043 --> 01:10:05,238
I too am to blame,
Mr. Travers.

1057
01:10:05,312 --> 01:10:07,644
I knew how dangerous
this man was.

1058
01:10:07,715 --> 01:10:09,876
Perhaps if I had come
right away--

1059
01:10:12,953 --> 01:10:16,889
The most important thing now is that
the police don't find out about this.

1060
01:10:16,957 --> 01:10:22,122
I had the ambulance park on a side
street, to avoid drawing attention.

1061
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:26,429
If we could just get the corpse
out of the hotel--

1062
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,934
A massive heart attack must be treated
in the hospital immediately.

1063
01:10:29,003 --> 01:10:33,599
Later, I could fill out the death
certificate to read "heart attack."

1064
01:10:34,641 --> 01:10:37,075
But how do we get him
out of the hotel?

1065
01:10:37,144 --> 01:10:41,274
The hotel detective will do anything
for money. Besides, he owes me one.

1066
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:44,779
And now it's time to go sleep
in my empty bed.

1067
01:10:50,024 --> 01:10:52,151
Would you have an extra raincoat?
I forgot mine.

1068
01:10:52,226 --> 01:10:55,093
I have an old one over there.
I'll get it for you.

1069
01:11:02,936 --> 01:11:06,269
- Here. Will this do?
- Yes, thank you.

1070
01:11:06,707 --> 01:11:09,642
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- That's okay.

1071
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,610
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Mistelzweig.

1072
01:11:11,678 --> 01:11:14,146
It's just a minor heart attack,
madam.

1073
01:11:14,214 --> 01:11:16,512
Please don't be alarmed.

1074
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:20,713
A few days of rest in my clinic
and he'll recover.

1075
01:11:20,788 --> 01:11:22,779
Initially he will need
to take it easy, of course.

1076
01:11:22,856 --> 01:11:25,518
Nothing upsetting.
No business.

1077
01:11:25,592 --> 01:11:27,924
He'll need to put himself
first now.

1078
01:11:27,995 --> 01:11:30,589
$5,000 in cash if you help us,
Mr. Berg.

1079
01:11:30,664 --> 01:11:32,655
We don't want any commotion
in the newspapers.

1080
01:11:32,733 --> 01:11:34,792
Naturally, Mr. Travers.

1081
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:36,859
It's not in the interest
of the hotel...

1082
01:11:36,937 --> 01:11:40,100
to create a stir
in case of sudden illness.

1083
01:11:40,174 --> 01:11:43,405
How can we get Mr. Menil
to the ambulance without being seen?

1084
01:11:43,477 --> 01:11:45,638
That's easy.
We use the freight elevator.

1085
01:11:45,712 --> 01:11:47,373
And the broken mirror?

1086
01:11:47,448 --> 01:11:50,417
I'll have that fixed within the hour.
I'll wake up the maintenance man.

1087
01:11:50,484 --> 01:11:52,475
He lives in the hotel.
He's my closest friend.

1088
01:12:35,395 --> 01:12:38,558
No sirens, no flashing lights.
We don't want any attention.

1089
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:40,994
I'll follow in the car.

1090
01:12:41,602 --> 01:12:43,536
I've known Professor Jordan
since I was a child.

1091
01:12:43,604 --> 01:12:45,401
I knew he would do
anything for me.

1092
01:12:45,472 --> 01:12:47,599
But if we had said
that you fired the gun--

1093
01:12:47,674 --> 01:12:50,040
To think that I'm hiding
behind a woman--

1094
01:12:50,878 --> 01:12:53,176
I always took responsibility
for my actions.

1095
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:56,114
If he hadn't been so quick,
I would have fired the shots.

1096
01:12:56,183 --> 01:13:00,313
But isn't this all beside the point?
You saved my life for the second time.

1097
01:13:00,654 --> 01:13:02,554
Even so.

1098
01:13:06,326 --> 01:13:09,955
Two hours ago, in this room...

1099
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:13,090
you asked me whether
I would marry you if I were free.

1100
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:17,161
And now I am free.

1101
01:13:27,347 --> 01:13:32,410
This worked out fine once again,
just as the doctor predicted.

1102
01:13:32,486 --> 01:13:35,080
Precisely.

1103
01:13:35,422 --> 01:13:37,083
No!

1104
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:51,829
What? What is it?

1105
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:54,100
Patrol car 8
has detected a fire...

1106
01:13:54,174 --> 01:13:56,267
on the top floor
of a bombed-out house.

1107
01:13:56,343 --> 01:13:58,243
There's a dead body
in one of the rooms.

1108
01:13:58,312 --> 01:13:59,870
You wake me up for that?

1109
01:13:59,947 --> 01:14:02,745
Franke is on night duty now.
Let me sleep.

1110
01:14:03,717 --> 01:14:05,582
What's that?

1111
01:14:07,621 --> 01:14:09,714
A secret transmitter?

1112
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:12,486
Police files on Dr. Mabuse?

1113
01:14:21,802 --> 01:14:25,169
Strange place. No sign on the door.
Nothing.

1114
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:27,434
When we saw the fire
from the street...

1115
01:14:27,507 --> 01:14:30,601
my partner said,
" No one lives there."

1116
01:14:31,111 --> 01:14:33,875
Then we found the body.

1117
01:14:42,089 --> 01:14:45,149
Shot in the chest, apparently
straight through the heart.

1118
01:14:45,225 --> 01:14:48,023
First they killed him, and then
they tried to burn the place down.

1119
01:14:48,095 --> 01:14:50,859
We pulled down the curtains
and doused the sofa with water.

1120
01:14:50,931 --> 01:14:53,399
We were able
to stomp out the rest.

1121
01:14:54,801 --> 01:14:57,497
- Any ID? Any papers?
- Nothing.

1122
01:15:10,984 --> 01:15:12,975
Nice of you
to make time for me...

1123
01:15:13,053 --> 01:15:15,180
so early in the morning,
Mr. Cornelius.

1124
01:15:15,255 --> 01:15:19,123
I was in the neighborhood
and thought I'd just drop by.

1125
01:15:19,593 --> 01:15:23,654
Isn't the little doggie
here today?

1126
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,722
A routine checkup at the veterinarian.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

1127
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,825
What can I do for you,
Mr. Mistelzweig?

1128
01:15:28,902 --> 01:15:33,362
Well, I thought, " Maybe you can
do business with Mr. Cornelius."

1129
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,340
With me? Business?

1130
01:15:35,409 --> 01:15:38,537
Don't worry.
I don't want to insure you.

1131
01:15:38,612 --> 01:15:40,512
I just want--

1132
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,241
- Mind if I smoke?
- Please.

1133
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:45,080
I know it's
a bad habit of mine, but--

1134
01:15:46,953 --> 01:15:49,319
Did I startle you?

1135
01:15:49,656 --> 01:15:53,524
I unseated you, so to speak,
in this charade.

1136
01:15:53,593 --> 01:15:57,552
You know, this blind-man ploy
is really great.

1137
01:15:57,631 --> 01:15:59,428
Yes, really.

1138
01:16:00,133 --> 01:16:03,933
When you take off the sunglasses
and stare into the distance--

1139
01:16:04,104 --> 01:16:05,765
Very attractive.

1140
01:16:05,839 --> 01:16:07,534
Really stylish.

1141
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:11,439
And the contact lenses--
like in an American horror film.

1142
01:16:12,412 --> 01:16:14,505
Come now!

1143
01:16:14,815 --> 01:16:16,874
Don't do anything stupid.

1144
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:20,185
The phone is going to ring soon.

1145
01:16:20,253 --> 01:16:21,948
A friend of mine.

1146
01:16:22,022 --> 01:16:24,616
I took the liberty of giving him
your phone number...

1147
01:16:24,691 --> 01:16:27,489
just as a precaution
so that nothing happens.

1148
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,591
What do you want from me?

1149
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:37,933
I want to go into business with you.
Fifty-fifty.

1150
01:16:38,004 --> 01:16:41,872
During the sance the day before
yesterday, I had this idea.

1151
01:16:41,942 --> 01:16:46,379
You know, people are so scared
when it comes to insurance.

1152
01:16:46,847 --> 01:16:50,977
If you, with your clairvoyance,
advise them to protect their families...

1153
01:16:51,051 --> 01:16:54,020
then they'll all come running
to me, you see?

1154
01:16:54,721 --> 01:16:56,348
That's him.

1155
01:16:57,657 --> 01:16:59,318
Yes, I'm still here.

1156
01:16:59,393 --> 01:17:02,089
No, not much longer.
A few more minutes.

1157
01:17:02,696 --> 01:17:05,324
I'll be in touch, yes.

1158
01:17:05,732 --> 01:17:07,791
No police-- don't worry.

1159
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:10,026
By the way,
this Kras character--

1160
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:14,369
Didn't you wonder why he would
drag me to your sance?

1161
01:17:14,608 --> 01:17:16,974
He wants to keep an eye on me.

1162
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:19,739
I've done time.
Five years.

1163
01:17:20,814 --> 01:17:25,080
Insurance fraud.
I've learned a lot since then.

1164
01:17:25,152 --> 01:17:29,179
And the two of us will come out
on top of that Kras guy, right?

1165
01:17:29,256 --> 01:17:32,419
Think it over, Cornelius.
Fifty-fifty.

1166
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:36,561
The projectile that hit
the psychic's chair...

1167
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:38,621
and the bullet in the corpse...

1168
01:17:38,698 --> 01:17:40,962
are of the same caliber
and have the same rifling marks.

1169
01:17:41,034 --> 01:17:43,832
They clearly come
from the same gun.

1170
01:17:44,704 --> 01:17:46,763
Very interesting.

1171
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,671
Thank you very much.

1172
01:17:50,677 --> 01:17:53,373
- Any word from Mistelzweig?
- No, he was asked to come at 1 1:00 p.m.

1173
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:55,438
But Interpol's answer
just came in.

1174
01:17:55,515 --> 01:17:57,312
Mistelzweig, Hieronymus Balthazar.

1175
01:17:57,384 --> 01:17:59,249
Insurance agent
with many years of experience.

1176
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:02,117
Best references from Lloyd's of London.
No prior convictions.

1177
01:18:02,389 --> 01:18:05,187
I still don't like his mug.

1178
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:09,792
The embodiment of promptness,
right?

1179
01:18:13,867 --> 01:18:15,835
What happened
to your right hand?

1180
01:18:15,902 --> 01:18:18,336
A small scuffle
ending in death, perhaps?

1181
01:18:18,405 --> 01:18:23,104
Inspector!
A peace-loving man like me?

1182
01:18:23,176 --> 01:18:25,644
- Have you ever been bitten by a dog?
- No.

1183
01:18:25,712 --> 01:18:28,909
Good for you. It hurts terribly,
let me tell you.

1184
01:18:28,982 --> 01:18:33,476
Last night I was going home
when a huge dog jumped at me...

1185
01:18:33,553 --> 01:18:35,885
and wouldn't let go.

1186
01:18:35,956 --> 01:18:39,756
And this should happen to me,
a real dog lover!

1187
01:18:41,595 --> 01:18:44,689
You left me a message, Inspector.
You wanted to talk to me.

1188
01:18:45,298 --> 01:18:47,129
Was it because of
the sance last night?

1189
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,792
No.

1190
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,731
But I want
to show you something.

1191
01:18:59,546 --> 01:19:03,209
Well, that's life.

1192
01:19:03,283 --> 01:19:07,117
"Yesterday on a steed abreast,
today a bullet in the chest."

1193
01:19:07,187 --> 01:19:09,382
- How did you know that?
- What?

1194
01:19:09,456 --> 01:19:12,254
That the man was shot in the heart.
You couldn't see that.

1195
01:19:12,325 --> 01:19:15,385
Inspector, I was just quoting
an old song...

1196
01:19:15,462 --> 01:19:17,327
and right away
you're suspicious again.

1197
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:20,025
Shot through the heart.
Awful.

1198
01:19:20,634 --> 01:19:23,296
One moment a man is running around
alive and well...

1199
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:25,930
and twelve hours later
he's dead.

1200
01:19:26,139 --> 01:19:28,369
- Stone-dead.
- So you know him then.

1201
01:19:28,441 --> 01:19:31,672
That would be pushing it.
I saw him last night at the Luxor.

1202
01:19:31,745 --> 01:19:34,839
I noticed him because of his clubfoot.
He has one, doesn't he?

1203
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:36,608
Just what I thought.

1204
01:19:36,683 --> 01:19:39,846
He went up to the third floor
where Mrs. Menil is staying.

1205
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,787
By the way, it's strange.
Did you know that she checked out?

1206
01:19:42,856 --> 01:19:44,847
She's leaving
with the American today.

1207
01:19:44,925 --> 01:19:46,984
Let's say good-bye to the professor
and then we'll go.

1208
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,049
What's the number?

1209
01:19:48,128 --> 01:19:50,096
4-2-5...

1210
01:19:50,163 --> 01:19:52,256
5-2-7.

1211
01:19:54,534 --> 01:19:56,331
Say...

1212
01:19:56,403 --> 01:20:00,271
last night when you called him,
you only dialed three digits.

1213
01:20:00,907 --> 01:20:02,738
- Three?
- Yes.

1214
01:20:03,643 --> 01:20:07,044
You must be mistaken.
I've known Jordan's number for years.

1215
01:20:07,113 --> 01:20:09,308
It's 425-527.

1216
01:20:09,382 --> 01:20:10,940
And there's something else.

1217
01:20:11,017 --> 01:20:13,850
How could the professor get here
so quickly last night...

1218
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,013
just five minutes
after your call...

1219
01:20:16,089 --> 01:20:17,647
and with an ambulance?

1220
01:20:17,724 --> 01:20:20,659
For God's sake, don't say anything now.
They can hear and see everything.

1221
01:20:20,727 --> 01:20:22,854
- Who can hear and see everything?
- Later, later!

1222
01:20:22,929 --> 01:20:26,296
We must leave this hotel as soon
as possible, or it's all over!

1223
01:20:26,366 --> 01:20:29,062
What are you talking about?
What are you afraid of?

1224
01:20:29,135 --> 01:20:31,365
There! Look!

1225
01:20:31,438 --> 01:20:33,338
And there are more over there!
And over there!

1226
01:20:33,406 --> 01:20:35,237
Everywhere in this hotel.

1227
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:37,606
In the bar, in every room,
in the nightclub.

1228
01:20:37,677 --> 01:20:39,907
They can observe everything.

1229
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:41,880
- We must leave immediately.
- But--

1230
01:20:41,948 --> 01:20:44,280
Please!
Please believe me!

1231
01:20:44,584 --> 01:20:46,882
Listen, Henry. I lied to you.

1232
01:20:46,953 --> 01:20:48,887
I was lying the whole time!

1233
01:20:48,955 --> 01:20:52,413
But now you have to believe me,
just this once.

1234
01:20:52,492 --> 01:20:55,290
- Please! Before it's too late.
- Why?

1235
01:20:55,362 --> 01:20:57,660
For God's sake, don't ask
any more questions now.

1236
01:20:57,731 --> 01:21:00,632
Come on, before it's too late.
Come on!

1237
01:21:18,284 --> 01:21:19,478
Twelve...

1238
01:21:19,552 --> 01:21:20,746
eleven...

1239
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,084
ten, nine.

1240
01:21:23,156 --> 01:21:26,250
I'd like to know if Mrs. Menil
is still staying at the hotel...

1241
01:21:26,326 --> 01:21:28,658
or if she and Mr. Travers
have already left.

1242
01:21:28,728 --> 01:21:31,561
They must still be here,
probably in Mr. Travers suite.

1243
01:21:31,631 --> 01:21:34,293
- I can call to check for you.
- Thanks, but no need. I'll go up.

1244
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:36,495
- But tell me--
- Don't speak.

1245
01:21:36,569 --> 01:21:39,231
They can hear us here too.
First we have to get out of here.

1246
01:21:41,841 --> 01:21:44,139
You slut.

1247
01:22:02,562 --> 01:22:04,621
Go on!

1248
01:22:11,938 --> 01:22:15,738
No, no. You know this place.
You've been here often enough.

1249
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:22,472
Mrs. Menil?

1250
01:23:32,552 --> 01:23:34,019
Let him search all he likes.

1251
01:23:34,087 --> 01:23:37,022
The woman will bleed to death
without a doctor.

1252
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:39,081
Don't worry.
The doctor will be here shortly.

1253
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:41,559
But if she's lucky,
she'll croak before he gets here.

1254
01:23:46,332 --> 01:23:48,129
Let's go.

1255
01:23:58,378 --> 01:24:00,903
We're in deep trouble,
thanks to this bitch.

1256
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,039
She would have jumped ship
in America anyway.

1257
01:24:03,116 --> 01:24:06,210
She loves him.
A blind man could see it.

1258
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,448
A blind man.

1259
01:24:08,655 --> 01:24:10,885
Do you realize
we're the last ones...

1260
01:24:10,957 --> 01:24:12,948
to know
about this control room?

1261
01:24:13,026 --> 01:24:16,359
Aside from him, of course.
Doesn't that make you a bit uneasy?

1262
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:19,794
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling.

1263
01:24:19,866 --> 01:24:22,130
When that reporter Barter
surprised you...

1264
01:24:22,202 --> 01:24:24,636
as you were replacing
the defective camera in her room...

1265
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,934
he was stone-dead
within the hour.

1266
01:24:27,006 --> 01:24:28,496
Number 11 -- dead.

1267
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:30,509
Last night, when the clubfoot
had completed his mission...

1268
01:24:30,577 --> 01:24:32,340
and was no longer needed--
gone.

1269
01:24:32,445 --> 01:24:35,881
And now that this thing with
the American has failed completely...

1270
01:24:35,949 --> 01:24:38,281
do you think
we're still useful to him?

1271
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:41,047
Who built this whole system
for him? I did.

1272
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,647
Who obtained the old Gestapo plans
and switched it all over to TV? I did.

1273
01:24:44,724 --> 01:24:46,658
He made millions
with this thing.

1274
01:24:46,726 --> 01:24:49,889
- He won't just get rid of me.
- He's capable of anything.

1275
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:54,958
From here he saw and heard
everything...

1276
01:24:55,635 --> 01:24:58,069
and could play
the role of the psychic.

1277
01:24:59,906 --> 01:25:03,000
Then he blackmailed
his victims.

1278
01:25:05,211 --> 01:25:07,509
My suicide attempt--

1279
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:10,413
The clubfoot and l--
It was all a sham.

1280
01:25:10,683 --> 01:25:13,777
There was nothing but blanks
in my revolver.

1281
01:25:14,988 --> 01:25:16,649
You didn't kill anyone.

1282
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:19,615
But why? Why all this?

1283
01:25:19,692 --> 01:25:22,889
To create a bond
between us.

1284
01:25:23,796 --> 01:25:28,961
In America, after our wedding,
they would have killed you.

1285
01:25:32,472 --> 01:25:37,432
I would have inherited everything--
your fortune, your industrial plants--

1286
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:40,240
and then he would have come.

1287
01:25:40,313 --> 01:25:43,544
His desire for power
knows no limits.

1288
01:25:47,353 --> 01:25:49,412
I had to do
what he wanted...

1289
01:25:49,489 --> 01:25:52,652
but I would have told you everything
once we boarded the plane.

1290
01:25:54,894 --> 01:25:57,488
But now it's too late.

1291
01:25:57,563 --> 01:25:59,793
I love you.

1292
01:25:59,866 --> 01:26:02,892
I know you can't
believe me anymore.

1293
01:26:04,103 --> 01:26:06,901
It's too late now.
Too late.

1294
01:26:06,973 --> 01:26:09,168
They simply disappeared,
Inspector.

1295
01:26:09,242 --> 01:26:11,904
Mr. Berg believes they must have
sneaked out of the hotel...

1296
01:26:11,978 --> 01:26:15,345
but neither the concierge
nor the two bellboys saw them.

1297
01:26:15,415 --> 01:26:18,077
Also, they haven't yet
settled their bill...

1298
01:26:18,151 --> 01:26:20,210
and some of Travers' belongings
are still in his room.

1299
01:26:20,286 --> 01:26:22,914
Don't call an alarm just yet.
I'll come over myself.

1300
01:26:36,602 --> 01:26:38,627
- What's new?
- The autopsy report.

1301
01:26:38,705 --> 01:26:40,696
The clubfoot that came in last night.
No internal bleeding.

1302
01:26:40,773 --> 01:26:43,367
When he was shot in the heart,
he had already been dead for a while.

1303
01:26:43,443 --> 01:26:46,105
The true cause of death
was a steel needle in his brain.

1304
01:27:10,603 --> 01:27:12,366
Open up.

1305
01:27:18,344 --> 01:27:21,336
Close the door behind me.
Send the elevator upstairs.

1306
01:27:25,818 --> 01:27:28,946
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Travers...

1307
01:27:29,022 --> 01:27:31,650
that you found out
about my plans.

1308
01:27:37,497 --> 01:27:39,727
You and I have both lost.

1309
01:27:39,799 --> 01:27:43,235
I lost a big game
and you lost your life.

1310
01:27:43,302 --> 01:27:44,997
Do you want
to push your infamy...

1311
01:27:45,071 --> 01:27:47,699
to the point of letting
this woman bleed to death?

1312
01:27:47,774 --> 01:27:49,833
A painless death, Mr. Travers...

1313
01:27:50,743 --> 01:27:53,473
and faster than the death
she could have expected from me.

1314
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,775
This woman
brought both of us down:

1315
01:27:56,849 --> 01:27:59,579
You, because you believed
in her love...

1316
01:27:59,652 --> 01:28:01,449
and me,
because I didn't believe...

1317
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:04,957
this love could break
my hypnotic control.

1318
01:28:05,024 --> 01:28:07,049
Marion was hypnotized?

1319
01:28:07,126 --> 01:28:10,584
Do you think she could have pulled off
that little suicide farce otherwise...

1320
01:28:10,663 --> 01:28:12,358
without falling?

1321
01:28:13,032 --> 01:28:15,933
Do you believe, even if you had
indeed gained control...

1322
01:28:16,002 --> 01:28:17,833
of my enterprises
through Marion...

1323
01:28:17,904 --> 01:28:21,067
you would have become the sole owner
of all my financial assets?

1324
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,370
Who said anything
about money?

1325
01:28:23,443 --> 01:28:26,571
Having gained control
of your nuclear plant...

1326
01:28:26,646 --> 01:28:28,876
I would have thrown
the world into chaos...

1327
01:28:28,948 --> 01:28:31,280
with the rockets
from your experimental plant.

1328
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:33,750
The famous push of a button.

1329
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,310
I would have done it.

1330
01:28:35,388 --> 01:28:38,551
- You are insane.
- Maybe.

1331
01:28:38,624 --> 01:28:41,252
But where's the line?

1332
01:28:41,327 --> 01:28:43,022
Insane.

1333
01:28:43,096 --> 01:28:45,587
That's what they said
about Dr. Mabuse...

1334
01:28:45,665 --> 01:28:50,329
who died 25 years ago
and whose name and plans I used.

1335
01:28:50,703 --> 01:28:55,265
His arrogant contemporaries
considered him a criminal.

1336
01:28:56,242 --> 01:28:59,109
But to me he was a genius...

1337
01:28:59,178 --> 01:29:02,773
who wanted to throw this rotten world
into a reign of chaos...

1338
01:29:02,849 --> 01:29:05,477
that could only be controlled
by the one man...

1339
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:08,714
who knows how to harness
it for his own gain-- me!

1340
01:29:15,194 --> 01:29:17,526
All your plans end
with my death.

1341
01:29:19,365 --> 01:29:23,597
What can I offer you to at least save
the life of this woman?

1342
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:26,138
Name your price.

1343
01:29:27,073 --> 01:29:31,100
I'm not speaking on my own behalf.
I know you can't let me live.

1344
01:29:33,045 --> 01:29:35,809
I admire your keen intelligence,
Mr. Travers.

1345
01:29:35,882 --> 01:29:37,873
- Then name your price.
- Police officers!

1346
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:41,044
Act rationally, now that your plans
have fallen through.

1347
01:29:42,321 --> 01:29:44,414
You underestimate me,
Mr. Travers.

1348
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:47,516
A check signed by you
would be my undoing...

1349
01:29:48,628 --> 01:29:51,324
and that's what you're hoping
to achieve, isn't it?

1350
01:29:54,567 --> 01:29:57,001
Their things
are still sitting here.

1351
01:30:03,743 --> 01:30:05,677
- Did you touch anything?
- Of course not.

1352
01:30:05,745 --> 01:30:07,235
Everything's empty next door.

1353
01:30:07,313 --> 01:30:09,838
They are searching for you already,
but they won't find you...

1354
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:12,714
or at least not until it's too late--
for you.

1355
01:30:24,297 --> 01:30:27,824
I have no more time
to chat with you.

1356
01:30:28,568 --> 01:30:30,160
Here...

1357
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:34,233
just in case
you want to act logically...

1358
01:30:34,307 --> 01:30:36,104
to escape a slow death
from starvation.

1359
01:30:47,653 --> 01:30:49,348
By the way...

1360
01:30:49,855 --> 01:30:52,847
this room is soundproof.

1361
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,528
- Wait here for further instructions.
- Yes, sir.

1362
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:06,265
We must systematically search
the entire hotel...

1363
01:31:06,339 --> 01:31:07,966
from the basement
to the top floor.

1364
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,100
The exits are being watched.
Kaiser, you stay here.

1365
01:31:36,002 --> 01:31:39,062
The hotel is surrounded. Two officers
in front, a patrol car in back.

1366
01:31:40,306 --> 01:31:44,072
There's the main entrance and the
hallway, back there on the right.

1367
01:31:50,182 --> 01:31:51,877
Professor Jordan!
Cornelius!

1368
01:31:59,992 --> 01:32:01,755
Go get him!

1369
01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:05,863
The blond man there
is Dr. Mabuse!

1370
01:32:06,499 --> 01:32:07,989
Freeze!

1371
01:32:11,537 --> 01:32:13,801
Three men come with me. The rest of you,
don't let anyone through!

1372
01:32:19,812 --> 01:32:22,007
Get away from the wheel!

1373
01:32:46,939 --> 01:32:48,600
Cuff him!

1374
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:53,337
It was about time.
He almost killed me.

1375
01:32:53,412 --> 01:32:55,937
- Goddamn it, who are you really?
- Interpol.

1376
01:32:56,015 --> 01:32:57,505
- But why?
- Later!

1377
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:59,244
I know where Mrs. Menil
and the American are.

1378
01:32:59,318 --> 01:33:02,310
- Send them after the car!
- Get the patrol car!

1379
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:09,519
A large gray sedan...

1380
01:33:10,262 --> 01:33:12,230
an American car...

1381
01:33:12,298 --> 01:33:16,098
GX 737.

1382
01:33:31,317 --> 01:33:33,649
Kras, homicide squad.
Start search immediately.

1383
01:33:33,719 --> 01:33:38,179
A large gray sedan, American-made,
license number GX 737.

1384
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,594
Turn on the police radio.

1385
01:33:43,896 --> 01:33:46,660
All patrol cars and road blocks
are instructed...

1386
01:33:46,732 --> 01:33:49,394
to stop the suspect vehicle...

1387
01:33:49,468 --> 01:33:51,698
and arrest the passengers.

1388
01:33:51,771 --> 01:33:53,796
Exercise caution.
The suspects have machine guns.

1389
01:33:53,873 --> 01:33:58,003
I repeat.: a large gray sedan,
license GX 737--

1390
01:33:58,077 --> 01:34:00,011
Change the license plate.

1391
01:34:03,616 --> 01:34:07,211
A large American car,
license plate unknown...

1392
01:34:07,286 --> 01:34:09,686
exceeding the posted speed limit...

1393
01:34:09,755 --> 01:34:12,622
has just left Mhlendamm Street
and is now heading south.

1394
01:34:13,159 --> 01:34:17,892
This is Kras. Close all southbound
roads, if it's not too late.

1395
01:34:17,963 --> 01:34:19,828
He most likely wants
to get on the freeway.

1396
01:34:19,899 --> 01:34:24,461
Then send a coded message
that Route 1 6 will be closed.

1397
01:34:24,537 --> 01:34:27,165
In case those guys are listening,
send a false, unencoded message...

1398
01:34:27,239 --> 01:34:29,935
saying that we expect them
to break through at Neustadt.

1399
01:34:30,009 --> 01:34:32,341
Send four motor cycles
for backup.

1400
01:34:32,411 --> 01:34:34,345
- We'll meet at Sdstern.
- Understood.

1401
01:34:34,413 --> 01:34:37,143
And ask them at the Luxor
whether the damn Interpol guy...

1402
01:34:37,216 --> 01:34:39,013
found the American
and that darn female.

1403
01:34:39,084 --> 01:34:40,881
Come on, get in.

1404
01:34:45,257 --> 01:34:46,918
The key!

1405
01:34:47,493 --> 01:34:49,290
The key for down below!

1406
01:34:51,997 --> 01:34:54,329
Open up!

1407
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:03,973
Police!

1408
01:36:00,533 --> 01:36:03,502
Double K, EKZ 302.

1409
01:36:03,569 --> 01:36:06,003
Reached square sequence. Over.

1410
01:36:06,572 --> 01:36:10,338
Good nose! Freeway southeast.
Come on, let's go!

1411
01:36:10,409 --> 01:36:12,502
A large American car,
license plate unknown...

1412
01:36:12,578 --> 01:36:15,012
has just passed a checkpoint,
apparently bound for Neustadt.

1413
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,173
All roads to Neustadt
have been closed.

1414
01:36:17,249 --> 01:36:19,240
Let 'em look for us!
That's 35 miles away.

1415
01:36:19,318 --> 01:36:21,411
It could be a ruse.
We've been on the freeway too long.

1416
01:36:21,487 --> 01:36:22,818
Hold on!

1417
01:36:31,163 --> 01:36:34,564
Double K, FKA 7 is running.
Over.

1418
01:36:34,633 --> 01:36:38,069
Damn! The freeway reports no contact,
but they should have passed it.

1419
01:36:38,137 --> 01:36:42,096
They must have broken through
between mile 1 35 and mile 140.

1420
01:36:45,277 --> 01:36:47,609
At the next crossing,
get off onto the old highway.

1421
01:36:52,017 --> 01:36:54,144
There they are! F aster!
Get ready.

1422
01:36:56,956 --> 01:36:59,652
A patrol car and four motor cycles
are following us.

1423
01:36:59,725 --> 01:37:02,785
- Distance?
- About 300 yards.

1424
01:37:02,928 --> 01:37:05,158
Don't shoot yet.
Let them get closer.

1425
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:06,754
I'm slowing down.

1426
01:37:06,832 --> 01:37:08,993
1 50.

1427
01:37:09,068 --> 01:37:10,535
1 00.

1428
01:37:10,603 --> 01:37:12,127
Now!

1429
01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:33,190
Shoot at the tires!

1430
01:37:34,927 --> 01:37:37,395
Damn! I need to put in
a new magazine.

1431
01:37:48,107 --> 01:37:50,667
Leave him there!
Let's go!
