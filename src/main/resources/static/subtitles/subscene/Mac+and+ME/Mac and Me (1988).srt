1
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,726
Closing pressure valve.

2
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:14,892
Hydraulic systems deactivated.

3
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,062
Insulation cover open.

4
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,599
Did you hear that?

5
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,832
What?

6
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,331
That. Did you hear that?

7
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:25,740
No.

8
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:27,642
Electrical system activated.

9
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:30,176
There it is again.

10
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,517
Procedure number six completed.

11
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:35,849
Second memory bank access open.

12
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,691
Professor, it's good
to see you again.

13
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,693
- Good to see you, Major.
- Agents Wickett and Midford.

14
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,251
- Professor.
- How do you do.

15
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:47,696
Looks like we've got a malfunction
on the aft sampler feed.

16
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,028
Try a reset.

17
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,501
Doctor, remember Major Bradley,
head of intelligence.

18
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,559
Major, how are you?

19
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:55,367
Opening C-5 container now.

20
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,239
Three full loads.

21
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:03,178
The gross weight discrepancy's
still there.

22
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,772
Recheck the pre-stat.

23
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,182
I've given it the auto test.
I've given it the manual test.

24
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,482
- It's still there.
- All right, let me see.

25
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,045
Could you reset these
and give me one last...

26
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:22,266
You see any
little green monsters in there?

27
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:26,932
HMS samples look great.

28
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:32,076
Section seven, closing down.

29
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:35,477
Gross weight discrepancy's still there.
I've cross-checked everything.

30
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,741
Let me see that.

31
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,476
Changing codes on the function keys.

32
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,817
Roger. Twenty megs left
in bank two memory.

33
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:47,849
Opening aft sampler chamber.

34
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,156
Pressure system in second mode.

35
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:54,426
Eighth procedure completed.
Going to program nine.

36
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,094
What happened?

37
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,034
Seal it back up!

38
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,542
What happened?

39
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,909
I don't know!
I undid the panel and it blew!

40
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,106
Come on, guys, shut it back!

41
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:13,049
Look out!
There's something in there!

42
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,586
- What the hell?
- Don't move! Don't move!

43
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:19,248
Larry, back off.

44
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:22,122
Back off, Larry. Get away from it.
Reverse the aft sampler.

45
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,755
Back off! Back off!

46
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:26,962
You okay?

47
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,124
Yeah, I'm okay.

48
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,293
Look out!
Get out of here! Come on!

49
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,336
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

50
00:08:36,074 --> 00:08:38,167
Breakout, breakout.
We've got a problem here.

51
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:39,403
Do you see anything?

52
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,967
Pull back to second perimeter.

53
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:44,880
Repeat, pull back to second perimeter.
We have a breakout here.

54
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,110
Code Red.

55
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:50,650
How many are there?

56
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:58,227
Keep still. Don't move.

57
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:19,715
Stay back.
Stay away from them.

58
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,038
Open the doors to the left!

59
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,574
Hey, to the right!

60
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:45,041
Moving in!

61
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:54,213
- Get ready!
- Wait! Hold your fire!

62
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,753
- Stay back!
- Hold your fire!

63
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,253
Everybody hold your fire!

64
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:04,459
Roger. We see him.

65
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,963
He's heading towards the north fence.

66
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,290
Holy smoke!
What the hell is that?

67
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:14,335
He's hung up on the fence!

68
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,714
Look out!
It's on the windshield!

69
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:28,878
Look out, Dad!

70
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,149
We're gonna crash, Dad!

71
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:34,214
Oh, no! Look out!

72
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:39,123
Oh, my God!

73
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:42,529
Look out!

74
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:45,625
Look out!

75
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:55,075
Stay here, okay?
You okay?

76
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:03,877
A fire extinguisher!
Do you have a fire extinguisher?

77
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,445
I've got one! I've got one!

78
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:07,923
- Here!
- Get away, get away!

79
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:24,268
Come on, that's it.

80
00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:26,503
Close your mouth.
Close your eyes.

81
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:27,943
It's okay.

82
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:46,627
Looks like a biggie.

83
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:48,461
Mom, get in their lane,
follow 'em down.

84
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,398
Will you guys just stop it?

85
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:52,163
Can we get down and watch?

86
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,727
No way.

87
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:55,432
Is anybody hurt?

88
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,499
Nothing serious, lady.
Something just ran across the road.

89
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:04,938
I'm not crazy.
It looked like an omelet with two eyes.

90
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,417
- It must've been some sort of alien.
- My dad, he's telling the truth...!

91
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:09,885
Think it was a drunk?

92
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:11,751
It's probably an ADUl.

93
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:12,983
What?

94
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:15,288
An alien driving under the influence.

95
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,925
We need the paramedics here
when you get time.

96
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,400
- It'll be midnight...
- Okay, bring it up, bring it up.

97
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:26,164
It's gonna be backed up for hours.

98
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:28,205
Good evening, miss.
Everything all right?

99
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,298
- You tell me.
- This won't take a minute.

100
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:37,504
All right, you can go.
Go on.

101
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:41,018
Next car. Come on,
let's pull up. Quickly.

102
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:44,118
Wonder what they were looking for?

103
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:48,255
Omelets... with eyes.

104
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,060
Wow! He jumped over two cars!

105
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,463
And nobody got hurt?
Yeah, right.

106
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,001
That car's flat! Jeez!

107
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,503
Okay, give it back, Mike.

108
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,561
What?

109
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,335
- He took my Coke, Mom.
- Come on, you guys.

110
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,070
I don't have it. I didn't take it.

111
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,670
- I knew it!
- Gross!

112
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,544
- That wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

113
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:14,346
- Mom...?
- It wasn't me!

114
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,909
I'm onto you!

115
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:18,545
Come on, Mike, give it back.

116
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,139
- Mom.
- Thanks.

117
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,340
Eric, wake up.
We're almost there.

118
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:17,677
- Eric.
- All right.

119
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:23,019
Hey, look at all the cars.

120
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,146
This looks pretty nice.

121
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:27,157
Pretty nice.

122
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,316
- Great hill for the wheels, man.
- Yeah!

123
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:05,385
No, you're not going down any hills
until we've checked it out, okay?

124
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:06,794
I know, Mom.

125
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,799
Okay, we're almost here.
Close your eyes, guys.

126
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,856
Close 'em.

127
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,731
There's a pretty girl.

128
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:16,296
I said close 'em,
you cheaters.

129
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,534
Come on.

130
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,203
You guys are gonna love this place.

131
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,772
Okay, you can open 'em.

132
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,572
Kitty, kitty.

133
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:28,175
Wow! Top of the hill!

134
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:30,084
Cool, check it out!
Two-car garage!

135
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:31,621
Yes, it's the chauffeur's day off!

136
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,179
Can we afford this?

137
00:15:33,258 --> 00:15:36,250
No, we can't, Eric. That's why
I'm forced to sell your brother.

138
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:37,817
Tough break, Mike.

139
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,884
Hey!

140
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,864
That's my stuff you're
throwing around there.

141
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:45,732
Relax, lady.
It's just our furniture pads.

142
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:47,327
Oh. Sorry.

143
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:50,371
Bring the groceries in, guys, okay?

144
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:52,602
- I like it.
- Me too.

145
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:54,941
Hey, how's it going?

146
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,144
We're communing
with the earth spirits.

147
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,276
Right.

148
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:05,652
- Welcome to California, bud.
- Really.

149
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:06,781
Here.

150
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,020
Aren't you gonna carry anything?

151
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,255
Sure. I've got my skateboard.

152
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,299
Let's go.
Hello, California women.

153
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:18,597
Have no fear,
your hormonal hero is here.

154
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:36,879
Oh, my...!

155
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:41,014
- Great house, man.
- I can't see anything.

156
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,923
Put the stuff
over on the table, guys.

157
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:45,326
- You're gonna love it.
- The ceiling looks good.

158
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:47,193
Yeah? Well, check it out.

159
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:49,028
This is totally rad!

160
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,466
Is this gonna get me a great
Mother's Day present or what?

161
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,197
You really scored big, Mom.

162
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:54,329
Look over here.

163
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:56,270
Hey, is that all ours?

164
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:58,332
Yeah, about the first
25 yards of it.

165
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:01,207
You think there's any
wild animals out there?

166
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,474
Definitely, definitely.
Some big grizzly bears.

167
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:04,981
There's probably some deer up here.

168
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,813
- Alligators, big nasty ones.
- Are you guys kidding?

169
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:12,379
Maybe a couple of gorillas.
Maybe a werewolf.

170
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:13,856
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, Mom, where's my room?

171
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,722
It's down the hall.

172
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:17,556
Watch the door.

173
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:23,295
Did you notice, my dear, that there is
not one step in the entire place?

174
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:24,767
Low counters.

175
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,531
Wide hallways.

176
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:28,731
And you can see
out of every window.

177
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,172
And, baby, you ain't
seen nothing yet!

178
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,073
Okay?

179
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:44,747
It's great! You see the size of these
closets? I'm gonna need more clothes!

180
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:46,551
Yeah, we'll put you on the list.

181
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:47,613
Thanks.

182
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,357
What do you think, huh?

183
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:55,922
I thought we'd put the bed over here.

184
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,592
That way you just wake up
every morning

185
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,226
and see the sun coming
over the mountains.

186
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,634
You did great, Mom.

187
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,434
Thank you.

188
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:29,989
Want some lunch?

189
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,035
No thanks. I'm fine.

190
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:33,092
Okay.

191
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,891
Your mom said this is your TV.
You want me to hook it up for you?

192
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:13,198
No, I can handle it.
Just put it down over there.

193
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:14,431
You got it.

194
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,548
There's Tooter Shellby on Sea SnaiI,

195
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:32,851
Or is it the other way around?

196
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:38,860
Casey Kelp on Clamdancer,

197
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,524
Junior Wetworth riding Snorkaway,

198
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:46,998
And Allstar Seaworthy
atop Seabiscuit,

199
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:50,097
They're all in line,

200
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:51,573
Here's your TOW.

201
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:52,631
What?

202
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,143
Tuna on whole wheat.

203
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,475
Oh. Thanks.
Hey, come look at this.

204
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,845
...Allstar Seaworthy,
grabbing an early lead,

205
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,905
Thattaboy...

206
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:02,917
That's very good.

207
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:05,615
It didn't do that last time.
It stayed on.

208
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:11,757
Yeah, well, if it happens again,
let me know.

209
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,564
And as they approach
the home stretch...

210
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:04,963
Hi.

211
00:23:06,077 --> 00:23:08,739
- Hi.
- You looking for your friend?

212
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:09,973
Yeah!

213
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:11,514
He went down the hill.

214
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:13,049
Did you get
a good look at him?

215
00:23:13,117 --> 00:23:14,675
Yeah, he's real cute.

216
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:16,583
What did he look like?

217
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:19,646
He's your friend, and you don't even
know what he looks like?

218
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:22,386
I was just kidding.
He's my brother.

219
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,827
Your brother?
Where are you from?

220
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:26,920
lllinois.

221
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:28,965
Welcome to the neighborhood.

222
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,399
Looks like you'll be
an interesting addition.

223
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:32,959
Hey, Deb, time to eat.

224
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,026
Okay.

225
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:36,164
I've got to go.
What's your name?

226
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,264
Eric.

227
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,502
I'm Debbie.
This is my sister Courtney.

228
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:41,169
- Hi.
- Hl.

229
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,372
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

230
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:45,540
- See ya.
- Bye.

231
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:47,550
What happened in here?

232
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:49,051
Did you just go down the hill?

233
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,109
No.

234
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,018
Mom is gonna freak out.

235
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:54,148
There's something weird going on.

236
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,386
- Look at this.
- What?

237
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,394
There were footprints here.

238
00:23:58,462 --> 00:24:00,828
Somebody was just in my bathroom
taking a shower.

239
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,230
Yeah, right. You think she's
gonna go for that, huh?

240
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,631
I'm serious.

241
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:07,000
The TV went on, and it
wasn't even plugged in.

242
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,305
I'm not joking, Michael.

243
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:11,864
Who broke the lamp?

244
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:14,536
Well, Sherlock Holmes here
thinks he saw a ghost.

245
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:15,806
Did the ghost do it?

246
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,213
Something was just in my bedroom.
It jumped over my head.

247
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,945
- Yeah, right.
- What thing?

248
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,647
I never saw it.
It just kept doing things.

249
00:24:24,722 --> 00:24:27,691
I'm not lying, Mom.
I swear it.

250
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:14,598
Right. I've got something better
for the fireplace, anyway.

251
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:16,333
It's Harvey!

252
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:20,400
What did you dress that thing up in?
Give it to me. It's horrible!

253
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:52,406
Eric... you asleep?

254
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:11,089
Now, come on. I want you
to stop worrying about this.

255
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:13,026
Did you lock all the windows?

256
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:16,123
- Yes.
- Good.

257
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,966
I was thinking maybe it wasn't
such a bad thing, anyway.

258
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,200
All it did was take a shower
and drink a soda.

259
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,473
Maybe it was one of
the neighborhood kids or something.

260
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,875
I'm sure there's
a rational explanation.

261
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,545
Come on, try and get
some sleep, huh?

262
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:34,106
It's been a long day.

263
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,725
Michael?

264
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,359
Oh, my God!

265
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:23,106
Michael, Eric,
what have you done?

266
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,613
I didn't do it, Mom.

267
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:26,376
Oh, my...

268
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,044
Oh, this is my mother's painting!

269
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,019
It's a hundred years old!

270
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:33,056
Whoa! What happened in here?

271
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:35,718
Everything's ruined!

272
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,384
It's totally ruined!

273
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,021
It wasn't me, Mom! It was
the little creature! I saw it!

274
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:43,191
The house is totally destroyed!

275
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:46,532
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say anything!

276
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:47,968
Well, calm down, Mom.

277
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:50,871
This is incredible. It's insane.
I don't believe it.

278
00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:53,432
Look at this. Oh, my God.
I'm going back to bed.

279
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:55,645
What the heck happened, man?

280
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,558
Eric!

281
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:29,228
Stop it, Eric, stop!

282
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,901
Eric!

283
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:40,980
Oh, my gosh!

284
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:42,746
Eric!

285
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,809
Eric!

286
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:47,220
Come on, Eric, swim!

287
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:50,955
Swim to the side, Eric! Swim!

288
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:52,996
Mom! Mom!

289
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:56,157
Swim! Swim, Eric!

290
00:32:57,868 --> 00:33:00,860
No! Eric!

291
00:33:04,408 --> 00:33:05,602
What is it?

292
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,009
Eric!

293
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,660
Eric, look at me!
Say something!

294
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:32,224
Did you see him?

295
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,291
What?

296
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,701
The little creature!

297
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:36,432
I can't believe he did this.

298
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:38,167
He's all right, Mom.
I'll go get him.

299
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:40,732
No, no. Just go
and get some help.

300
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,678
2-17, paramedics on the way,

301
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:52,013
I don't know why he did it.
I just saw him go.

302
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:55,422
Deep breath? Good.

303
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,481
One more.

304
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:59,222
Oh, fine. Now sit back.

305
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,891
- How's your head feel?
- Fine.

306
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:03,159
No dizziness?

307
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:05,394
I want you to follow this
with your eyes.

308
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:07,392
Good.

309
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:08,733
Once more.

310
00:34:09,906 --> 00:34:11,066
Fine.

311
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:13,006
You're a lucky young man.

312
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:14,668
Everything seems to be okay.

313
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:17,407
Could you leave us
alone for a minute?

314
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,150
Your mother tells me that
you've been seeing some things.

315
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,450
Can you tell me about it?

316
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,289
You wouldn't believe it.

317
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,419
Try me.

318
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:36,926
It's a little creature.

319
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:39,591
Do you see him often?

320
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:42,103
Just the things that he does.

321
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:44,197
Has anyone else
seen this little creature?

322
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:46,265
Just Debbie.
She's the girl next door.

323
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:51,070
I'm going to give you
this mild sedative.

324
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:52,547
It'll help you get some rest.

325
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:55,949
Why don't you just ask Debbie?
She knows all about it.

326
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:57,543
Here, you take this.

327
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:01,421
And we'll discuss all that later, okay?

328
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,726
You get that rest.

329
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:09,521
I'll come back to see you soon.

330
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,965
He's not your brother, is he?

331
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,271
Why didn't you tell them
that you saw him?

332
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:22,470
Because nobody would believe it.

333
00:35:22,546 --> 00:35:24,605
What is he, some sort of ghost?

334
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:26,148
I don't know what he is.

335
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:27,979
You should have backed me up.

336
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:29,882
It wouldn't do any good.

337
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:32,217
They only believe
what they want to believe.

338
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:34,689
They already think
you've got schizo-freakia.

339
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,623
Schizo what?

340
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:37,990
Freakia.

341
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:40,359
It's when you see people
that really aren't there.

342
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,160
Well, I'm gonna prove it to everyone.

343
00:35:43,233 --> 00:35:45,201
I'm gonna catch him.

344
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,826
Can I come in?

345
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:47,995
Sure.

346
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:50,739
Sorry to hear what happened.

347
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:52,104
You look okay.

348
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:53,437
I'm fine.

349
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,205
Mom wants to go, Deb.

350
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,644
Okay. I'll see you later.

351
00:35:57,714 --> 00:35:59,306
Give me a call.

352
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:03,716
Hey, why don't you invite Eric
to Brittany's birthday tomorrow.

353
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,880
- You want to come?
- Sure.

354
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,389
Okay, I'll see you then.

355
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,516
Bye. I'm glad you're okay.

356
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:10,582
Bye.

357
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:14,386
- Hi.
- Hi.

358
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,227
I'm Michael, Eric's brother.

359
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,199
I'm Courtney, Deb's sister.

360
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:20,327
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you.

361
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:21,392
Me too.

362
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:25,205
- McDonald's, huh?
- Yeah.

363
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:28,142
Why don't you stop by
for a Big Mac?

364
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:29,735
Let's go.

365
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,683
You never told me about her.

366
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,722
I knew I shouldn't have
taken this job right now.

367
00:36:44,794 --> 00:36:46,659
Mom, it's gonna be fine.

368
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,028
Are you getting a draft?

369
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:50,327
I'm rolling up the window.

370
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,890
You should be in bed, anyway.

371
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:53,833
- I'm fine.
- Michael!

372
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:56,270
Hey, look out, you idiot!

373
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,000
I saw it, Mom.
I had plenty of room.

374
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:00,235
What is the matter with you today?

375
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,543
I'm gonna have to hire somebody
to take care of you guys.

376
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:06,207
- I can be on my own, Mom.
- That's it. Not if I can help it.

377
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:08,444
Debbie's mom said
she could look after him.

378
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,748
Okay, we're here.

379
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,980
I should have called in sick.

380
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,353
You can't call in sick
on your first day.

381
00:37:14,424 --> 00:37:15,982
Are you gonna be okay?

382
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,287
Guaranteed.

383
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,885
Listen, I'm getting out at nine.
Mr. Allen is bringing me home.

384
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:22,830
- Please be there, guys.
- We'll be there, Mom.

385
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,095
I'm not ready for this.

386
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:27,329
Mom, relax.
You've already got the job.

387
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:29,668
- You look great.
- Thanks.

388
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:33,165
Never seen her this tense before.

389
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:35,734
Yeah, well, it's her first job
in ten years.

390
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:38,280
- You know what I feel like?
- A Big Mac?

391
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:40,873
- The man is a genius.
- I'm psychic!

392
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:42,316
I tell ya!

393
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,888
That's over, though.
She's back in Indiana.

394
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,253
I'm here, she's there.

395
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:58,024
Well, you know,
that doesn't really matter.

396
00:38:58,094 --> 00:39:01,154
So... let's talk about you.
Are you dating anyone?

397
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,126
Good.

398
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,599
What are you doing right now?

399
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:08,898
Oh. What subject?

400
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:13,341
Oh, that's sort of my subject.
I can help you if you want some help.

401
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,638
Come on over.

402
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:56,979
What are you doing here?

403
00:39:57,987 --> 00:39:59,818
- Did you catch him?
- Not yet.

404
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:02,380
- I want to help.
- What about your mom?

405
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:04,927
I'm not going to tell her.
Who's that?

406
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:08,430
It's just my old
Chicago Cubs mascot.

407
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:11,296
Here, you can carry
the equipment. Put this on.

408
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,960
What are we going to do?

409
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,504
It's just a precaution.

410
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:17,733
I think you should know I bruise easily.

411
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:31,218
Get those cords! Come on!

412
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:34,120
You still haven't told me
what we're going to do.

413
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,658
Here, strap this vacuum cleaner
on your back.

414
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,387
We're gonna suck him up.

415
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:49,163
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

416
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:25,866
You ready?

417
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:29,972
Hit it.

418
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:33,110
Charge!

419
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:37,709
You got him!
Don't hurt him!

420
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,880
You're hurting him!

421
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,389
We got him!

422
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,620
Get me off of this thing!

423
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:45,683
Debbie!

424
00:41:52,502 --> 00:41:53,491
Michael!

425
00:41:57,874 --> 00:42:00,104
Hey! What's going on?

426
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,545
Get me off of this thing!

427
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:07,345
Turn it off! Stop it!

428
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:12,210
Get this off of me!

429
00:42:12,288 --> 00:42:15,223
- Are you okay?
- Would you get me off of here?

430
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,259
I think I'm gonna throw up.

431
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,727
Would somebody please tell me
what is happening?

432
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:21,093
He's in the vacuum.

433
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,722
What? What are you
talking about?

434
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:24,699
It's the thing I've been
telling you about-the MAC.

435
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:25,756
What?

436
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,826
The Mysterious Alien Creature.

437
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:30,134
You've got to get him
out of there.

438
00:42:30,206 --> 00:42:31,537
Plug it back in.

439
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:33,007
Wait, what are you gonna do?

440
00:42:33,076 --> 00:42:36,204
Just do it.
I'm gonna reverse the motor.

441
00:43:22,258 --> 00:43:23,748
Get me a drink.

442
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:34,866
We hurt him bad, didn't we?

443
00:43:34,938 --> 00:43:36,235
It's okay.

444
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:38,240
He looks tired.

445
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:43,510
This is unreal.
This is incredible, guys.

446
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,514
This must be like what they drink
on their own planet.

447
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,277
Where'd he come from?

448
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,477
I don't know.

449
00:43:49,552 --> 00:43:53,648
He came in the van with you.
I saw him when you first got here.

450
00:43:53,723 --> 00:43:56,453
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought you knew.

451
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:59,893
Wait a minute. This is what they
were looking for back at the accident.

452
00:43:59,963 --> 00:44:01,123
That's Mom.

453
00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:03,097
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna tell her.

454
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:07,125
Don't tell her about me, please!
My mom will go crazy!

455
00:44:07,203 --> 00:44:09,637
Okay, split, Debbie. Go!

456
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:12,936
I'm sorry we set you up.

457
00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:14,772
I'll see you later.

458
00:44:19,649 --> 00:44:21,241
There must be a power failure.

459
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:22,875
What happened?
All our lights are out.

460
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:29,655
It's okay. It's just my mom!

461
00:44:29,726 --> 00:44:30,784
Come back!

462
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,886
What's going on?

463
00:44:33,763 --> 00:44:35,924
Power's surging
in the whole neighborhood.

464
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,661
- Michael?
- Yeah.

465
00:44:38,735 --> 00:44:39,793
Is everything okay?

466
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:41,700
Fine, but you'd better
come look at something.

467
00:44:41,771 --> 00:44:43,204
What's the matter?
Where's Eric?

468
00:44:43,272 --> 00:44:45,365
- Where is he?
- He's fine. He's over here.

469
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:47,875
What are you doing on the floor?
What is all this smoke?

470
00:44:47,944 --> 00:44:49,605
He ran off again!

471
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,147
It's Eric's friend, Mom, the one
he's been trying to tell us about.

472
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:54,376
They caught him in the vacuum cleaner.

473
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,680
- "They"?
- We.

474
00:44:58,054 --> 00:45:00,579
Okay, let's start from
the beginning again, shall we?

475
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,682
- Can I have my chair first, please?
- Go get him his chair.

476
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,890
I sucked him up in the vacuum
to prove to everyone that he exists.

477
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:10,489
He's not lying, Mom.
I saw it.

478
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:16,399
You sucked this living thing
into a vacuum cleaner?

479
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:18,770
Yeah, and then
we blew him out again!

480
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,240
It's the truth, Mom.

481
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:22,072
No, I can handle it.

482
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:25,206
I can, really.
I can handle it.

483
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:47,425
Morning.

484
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,637
Strange-looking pets
in this neighborhood.

485
00:46:56,305 --> 00:46:59,297
Mike! Hey, Mike, wake up.
Looks like he came back.

486
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:01,775
- Who?
- The little creature. Come on!

487
00:47:01,844 --> 00:47:03,038
Ah, cool!

488
00:47:04,514 --> 00:47:06,846
Wow! He cleaned up everything!

489
00:47:08,384 --> 00:47:09,373
Wow!

490
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,852
- You think he did it?
- Hey, I sure didn't.

491
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:13,752
Check out the door!

492
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:15,552
Glad we didn't kill
the little dude!

493
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,958
Yeah, he even fixed Mom's old painting.
And look at the ceiling!

494
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:22,122
Hey, we should rent this guy out.
We'd be millionaires!

495
00:47:22,198 --> 00:47:24,428
Look at this.

496
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,660
What is it?

497
00:47:25,735 --> 00:47:27,999
I don't know. Looks like
he's trying to tell us something.

498
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,334
I bet it's got something to do
with where he came from.

499
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:33,239
A Wickes Furniture store?
And what about these?

500
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,004
Maybe he likes horses.

501
00:47:35,077 --> 00:47:38,911
This is incredible.
I don't believe it.

502
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,612
Thanks, you guys.
I really appreciate it.

503
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:47,053
We didn't do it, Mom.
He came back.

504
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:51,287
Come on. Are you telling me this thing
came in and cleaned up the house?

505
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,954
Think about it-
would we do something like this?

506
00:47:56,732 --> 00:47:58,393
That's a good point.

507
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:01,697
He left these. We think it's
some kind of message.

508
00:48:01,771 --> 00:48:04,968
It's that thing they were looking for
back at the crash site, I'm telling you.

509
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,168
It's an alien, like the guy said.

510
00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:11,036
You still don't believe us, do you?

511
00:48:12,882 --> 00:48:14,406
Come on, guys.

512
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:19,452
I believe there's something,
but the question is what.

513
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:04,518
Come on, Mom, let's go!

514
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:09,195
- How far do you want to go?
- How about to the next driveway?

515
00:50:09,265 --> 00:50:11,961
Come on, let's go down
to the bottom of the hill and back.

516
00:50:12,034 --> 00:50:14,161
Okay. I'm gonna beat you.

517
00:50:14,236 --> 00:50:15,726
Wanna make a bet?

518
00:50:20,776 --> 00:50:23,711
Good dogs. Good dogs.
Stay where you are.

519
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,769
Come on.

520
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:36,848
Eric! Eric!

521
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:40,188
I don't think he saw me.

522
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,691
What is that?

523
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:48,168
Don't hit him!

524
00:50:48,237 --> 00:50:50,296
What is he, crazy or something?

525
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:57,145
What was that? I've never
seen anything like it.

526
00:53:07,576 --> 00:53:09,567
Get your shoes on.
We've got to go.

527
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:11,568
Anything?

528
00:53:12,448 --> 00:53:14,507
Maybe he went to haunt
somebody else.

529
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,574
That's not even funny, Mom.

530
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:17,641
Sorry.

531
00:53:20,422 --> 00:53:21,411
Hello.

532
00:53:22,758 --> 00:53:24,020
Yeah, he's ready.

533
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,220
Okay. Bye-bye.

534
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:29,488
Eric, that was Debbie.
She's on her way.

535
00:53:29,565 --> 00:53:31,396
- You ready?
- Yeah.

536
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:34,629
Gonna have a good time
at the party today?

537
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,540
- Did you remember to lock the back?
- Yeah, I got it.

538
00:53:39,608 --> 00:53:40,768
Water and Power, ma'am.

539
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,937
We're looking into last night's blackout.
Can we check your power boxes?

540
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:45,446
Sure.
They're around the back.

541
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,345
Thanks. It'll just take a minute.

542
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:51,546
Mrs. Cruise, did you notice
anything unusual last night?

543
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:52,951
Like what?

544
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:54,887
What were you doing
when the blackout occurred?

545
00:53:54,957 --> 00:53:57,448
- I was driving up the street.
- I see.

546
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:58,515
Thank you.

547
00:53:59,328 --> 00:54:02,786
Mom, that's the guy from the crash
in the desert. Don't you recognize him?

548
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,993
Remember? He was the one
looking in all the cars.

549
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:07,626
Doesn't it seem a little weird?

550
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,330
- Hi.
- Hi, Debbie.

551
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:11,396
My Mom wants to leave
in five minutes.

552
00:54:11,473 --> 00:54:13,737
Okay, fine. Come on,
we've got to go.

553
00:54:13,809 --> 00:54:16,369
I'll pick you up
at the party later.

554
00:54:16,445 --> 00:54:18,777
Don't forget the present
I left for you on the table.

555
00:54:18,847 --> 00:54:21,042
And call me. I want to
know what's going on.

556
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:27,585
So what happened?
Where is he?

557
00:54:28,924 --> 00:54:30,482
Come on.

558
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:42,259
It's here.

559
00:54:42,338 --> 00:54:44,465
Get Rankin
and the capture group up here.

560
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,269
This is 100 X-Ray.

561
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:48,310
Think they followed you here?

562
00:54:48,377 --> 00:54:50,004
I don't know.

563
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,808
I bet they're looking for him.

564
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:55,047
Maybe that's why
he's so scared.

565
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,415
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

566
00:55:03,392 --> 00:55:05,326
What's all this stuff-

567
00:55:05,394 --> 00:55:07,385
straws and flowers?

568
00:55:07,463 --> 00:55:08,987
I don't know.

569
00:55:09,064 --> 00:55:10,622
And there they go!

570
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:12,166
And it's Allstar Seaworthy...

571
00:55:12,234 --> 00:55:13,223
Eric!

572
00:55:17,206 --> 00:55:20,141
He doesn't look so good.

573
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,541
Get that drink.

574
00:55:24,246 --> 00:55:26,271
What's the matter with him?

575
00:55:26,348 --> 00:55:28,282
I don't know.

576
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,215
Here, you want some?

577
00:55:33,522 --> 00:55:35,581
He looks depressed or something.

578
00:55:38,394 --> 00:55:39,884
You have a family?

579
00:55:41,864 --> 00:55:44,856
- Oh, my gosh, there's three of them.
- Three?

580
00:55:44,933 --> 00:55:46,525
Ask him where he came from.

581
00:55:46,602 --> 00:55:48,331
How am I gonna do that?

582
00:55:48,404 --> 00:55:49,735
Wait a second.

583
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:54,873
Your family here?

584
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,205
He's pointing to my school.

585
00:56:00,282 --> 00:56:03,649
Oh, my gosh, that's my mom!
What are we going to do?

586
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:05,516
You'll have to go without me.

587
00:56:05,587 --> 00:56:08,522
She won't do that. She's supposed
to be looking after you.

588
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,581
We can't leave him here like this.

589
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,422
You have to go, Eric.

590
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,359
Tell her I'll be there
in a minute.

591
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:17,661
- What are you going to do?
- Just go and tell her.

592
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:19,564
Okay.

593
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:22,001
Bye! I'll see you later!

594
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:27,432
It's not safe here anymore.

595
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,272
You have to come with me.

596
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,436
Please.

597
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,673
I won't let anybody hurt you.

598
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:01,826
What is he doing in there?

599
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:05,698
I think he was changing
steering wheels on his wheelchair.

600
00:57:06,271 --> 00:57:09,536
Debbie, wheelchairs
don't have a steering wheel.

601
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,667
Maybe it was a flat tire.

602
00:57:13,745 --> 00:57:15,406
Maybe I'd better go help him.

603
00:57:15,481 --> 00:57:16,573
I'll do it.

604
00:57:17,716 --> 00:57:20,082
Oh, no!

605
00:57:21,854 --> 00:57:24,516
Kinda old for a teddy,
isn't he?

606
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,751
He's from lllinois.

607
00:57:29,128 --> 00:57:30,618
Sorry it took so long.

608
00:57:30,696 --> 00:57:32,459
That's okay.
So, how do we do this?

609
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:35,295
My wheelchair can fit in back,
and I'll sit in front.

610
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:36,356
Sounds good.

611
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:39,360
Here, take him. Go.

612
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:44,608
All right, here we go.

613
00:57:49,681 --> 00:57:51,046
Sit down.

614
00:57:53,685 --> 00:57:55,152
Are you crazy?

615
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,188
There's no way you're gonna
get away with this.

616
00:57:57,256 --> 00:58:00,589
I had to do something with him.
Keep him quiet.

617
00:58:04,997 --> 00:58:06,658
Sit still.

618
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:09,425
Okay.

619
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:13,027
Everybody fasten your seatbelts.

620
00:58:13,605 --> 00:58:14,765
Let's go.

621
00:58:22,014 --> 00:58:25,211
- Well, what do you think?
- Follow them.

622
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:53,600
This is J-3. We're traveling
east on Valley Vista.

623
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:55,510
Tell them to stand by.

624
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,981
Don't.

625
00:59:03,055 --> 00:59:05,216
So, Eric, how long
have you two been together?

626
00:59:06,225 --> 00:59:08,318
She means the teddy, Eric.

627
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:10,088
Oh, a long time.

628
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:14,655
- Keep still.
- Does your bear move?

629
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:19,329
Oh, yeah. He's one of those
new computerized kind.

630
00:59:19,404 --> 00:59:21,804
But I thought you said
you had him a long time.

631
00:59:21,873 --> 00:59:25,240
I have.
He just got new microchips.

632
00:59:28,046 --> 00:59:29,035
Amazing.

633
01:00:26,938 --> 01:00:28,030
What's in here?

634
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:33,373
Hi, Brittany! Happy birthday!

635
01:00:33,445 --> 01:00:35,072
Thank you.

636
01:00:35,147 --> 01:00:36,739
This is my friend Eric.

637
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:38,180
- Hi, Eric.
- Hi.

638
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,547
He's cute.

639
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,451
Hiya. How's it going?

640
01:00:43,522 --> 01:00:45,285
- It's going.
- Nice teddy bear.

641
01:00:46,692 --> 01:00:48,455
Hi, Eric, how ya feelin'?

642
01:00:48,527 --> 01:00:50,051
Have you seen my brother yet?

643
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:51,618
He'll be here soon.

644
01:00:57,536 --> 01:01:00,664
- No, Mac, give me that.
- Did you see that?

645
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:04,903
- There's something in there.
- I don't believe it! Freaky!

646
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:08,311
Lookit, honey, we're leaving, okay?

647
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,905
I'm gonna go, and I'll leave
Courtney here to watch you

648
01:01:10,982 --> 01:01:12,643
until Michael gets here, okay?

649
01:01:12,718 --> 01:01:16,085
Boy, that teddy is amazing!
I'll see you.

650
01:01:16,154 --> 01:01:17,143
Bye-bye.

651
01:01:21,093 --> 01:01:22,253
Happy birthday!

652
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:25,592
Okay, kids, let's get
this dance contest going!

653
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:26,858
- He's here!
- What?

654
01:01:26,932 --> 01:01:29,924
- Mac! He's in the teddy suit.
- He is? I don't believe this!

655
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:32,162
- Let's dance!
- Debbie, what's going on?

656
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:34,797
It's okay. Everybody thinks
he's just a toy!

657
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:37,440
Hi, Michael.

658
01:01:37,509 --> 01:01:39,704
The thing I was telling you about,
it's in the teddy suit.

659
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:41,541
Oh, no way!
He's so cute!

660
01:01:41,613 --> 01:01:43,877
Yeah, real cute. Listen, those guys
who were following us, they're here.

661
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:45,246
Well, what are we gonna do?

662
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:48,218
I don't know. Just keep him dancing,
they'll just think he's a teddy.

663
01:01:54,393 --> 01:01:57,692
Okay, pick up the pace,
That's very good, Kathy,

664
01:02:58,757 --> 01:03:01,419
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

665
01:03:01,993 --> 01:03:04,427
This is Base-1.
Where are you guys? Move it!

666
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:16,998
All right, come on, move it.
Let's go.

667
01:03:45,003 --> 01:03:46,732
Leave him alone!
He's not hurting anyone!

668
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:49,171
You don't know
what you're getting into.

669
01:03:49,241 --> 01:03:51,334
- What's he done wrong?
- Come on, kid, back off.

670
01:03:51,409 --> 01:03:52,569
What's he done wrong?

671
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:59,249
Hold on, Mac.

672
01:03:59,317 --> 01:04:01,979
Get after them! Move it!

673
01:04:02,053 --> 01:04:03,748
Let's get the car.

674
01:04:03,822 --> 01:04:06,347
Get him before he hits the street!
Look out!

675
01:04:06,424 --> 01:04:07,652
Come on.

676
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:10,626
All right, come on!

677
01:04:10,695 --> 01:04:13,129
- Come on!
- Oh, no!

678
01:04:16,635 --> 01:04:18,034
I got him! I got him!

679
01:04:18,603 --> 01:04:19,661
Come on.

680
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:29,513
Come on, come on, come on!

681
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:31,139
Go! Keep going!

682
01:04:41,226 --> 01:04:42,215
Come on!

683
01:04:42,294 --> 01:04:44,023
- Look out!
- Stay with him!

684
01:04:47,332 --> 01:04:48,526
Come on!

685
01:04:53,939 --> 01:04:55,839
Come on! Come on!

686
01:05:16,328 --> 01:05:17,488
Stay with him!

687
01:05:53,598 --> 01:05:55,862
He's in here!
Come on, come on!

688
01:05:55,934 --> 01:05:57,265
Let's go, let's go!

689
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,534
Check the aisles!

690
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:08,434
There he is!

691
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:14,282
Let's get him!
Let's get him!

692
01:06:15,286 --> 01:06:17,618
- You okay?
- I'm okay. Go!

693
01:06:18,623 --> 01:06:20,056
Mom! Mom!

694
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:22,957
Mom!

695
01:06:23,028 --> 01:06:24,552
How long have you
been in lingerie?

696
01:06:24,629 --> 01:06:25,618
Mom!

697
01:06:26,631 --> 01:06:28,724
Excuse me,
I'll be right back. Eric!

698
01:06:31,469 --> 01:06:33,232
Come on, guys, cool it!

699
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:35,602
- What are you people doing?
- Stop that kid!

700
01:06:35,674 --> 01:06:37,574
Eric! What is that on your lap?

701
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:40,142
Stop!

702
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:47,513
The door's jammed!
The door's jammed!

703
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:49,780
Get something!
Get something!

704
01:06:55,493 --> 01:06:57,085
What do you think you're doing?

705
01:06:57,662 --> 01:06:58,651
Eric!

706
01:06:59,497 --> 01:07:01,431
This is not gonna work, Michael!

707
01:07:01,499 --> 01:07:04,468
- Just trust me.
- It's gonna work.

708
01:07:04,536 --> 01:07:06,128
Be careful.

709
01:07:06,204 --> 01:07:07,193
Eric!

710
01:07:07,272 --> 01:07:08,899
Don't hit him, Courtney!

711
01:07:09,908 --> 01:07:11,967
- Get him!
- Get ready!

712
01:07:12,043 --> 01:07:13,203
Stay with him.

713
01:07:14,212 --> 01:07:16,180
Michael! Eric!

714
01:07:16,247 --> 01:07:17,646
Come on, we've got you!

715
01:07:20,018 --> 01:07:22,612
- Now!
- You got him!

716
01:07:22,687 --> 01:07:23,847
All right!

717
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:28,517
Hey, those are
my kids in there!

718
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:31,960
Those kids? Those kids
just ran off with a...

719
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:35,965
A little creature from outer space?

720
01:07:38,236 --> 01:07:39,897
No, Wickes.

721
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:42,872
Well, no, Palmdale's fine.
I just need...

722
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:44,499
That's fine, thank you.

723
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:48,377
No, the address.
Wait, give me that again.

724
01:07:48,446 --> 01:07:50,209
Why don't you give it to him?

725
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:51,680
Here, Mac.

726
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,911
I don't think
he's feeling too good.

727
01:07:53,985 --> 01:07:58,149
Something's happened to his family.
He keeps on pointing in the same direction.

728
01:07:58,223 --> 01:08:01,192
There's a Wickes in Palmdale.
It's about 20 miles from the crash.

729
01:08:01,259 --> 01:08:03,727
- We have to go there.
- What do you think?

730
01:08:03,795 --> 01:08:05,422
I think we should call your mom.

731
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:08,489
Look, she's not gonna understand.
She's just gonna tell us to turn him in.

732
01:08:08,566 --> 01:08:10,500
Maybe that's what we should do.

733
01:08:10,568 --> 01:08:12,092
No, we have to help him.

734
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:14,229
What if they have a good reason
for wanting him, Eric?

735
01:08:14,305 --> 01:08:16,899
What if he's dangerous?
What if he's got a disease or something?

736
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:19,102
He doesn't have any diseases.

737
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:21,577
I know no one's interested
what I have to say,

738
01:08:21,646 --> 01:08:23,807
but I think he's
communicating with someone.

739
01:08:23,882 --> 01:08:25,315
It's his family.

740
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:27,681
Don't you like him?

741
01:08:27,752 --> 01:08:29,845
Of course I do.

742
01:08:29,921 --> 01:08:32,048
I just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

743
01:08:32,123 --> 01:08:35,183
We're gonna get caught sooner or later.
I don't see what we've got to lose.

744
01:08:40,765 --> 01:08:41,754
We're gonna go.

745
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:45,166
Come on. Let's do it.

746
01:08:45,236 --> 01:08:46,396
All right!

747
01:08:46,471 --> 01:08:47,529
Let's go, come on!

748
01:08:47,605 --> 01:08:48,833
All right!

749
01:09:21,005 --> 01:09:22,529
Thank you, my dear.

750
01:09:25,343 --> 01:09:27,436
Ooh, he likes this.

751
01:09:29,547 --> 01:09:31,606
Here, see if he likes this.

752
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:48,730
Maybe they're just flowers.

753
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:52,128
- How about a spaceship?
- Great!

754
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:54,068
Yeah, and we'll have
a close encounter of the third kind.

755
01:09:54,138 --> 01:09:55,127
What's that?

756
01:09:55,206 --> 01:09:57,401
That's when you get to go
on the ship.

757
01:09:57,475 --> 01:09:59,170
Here's another police car.

758
01:09:59,244 --> 01:10:00,233
Keep him down.

759
01:10:01,613 --> 01:10:02,602
We're fine.

760
01:10:09,053 --> 01:10:11,146
Hey, he's pointing at something.

761
01:10:11,222 --> 01:10:12,985
It's the horses.

762
01:10:13,057 --> 01:10:15,651
We've been passing horses
all the way here.

763
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:16,785
Hey, did you see that?

764
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,522
What?

765
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:24,523
That's it!

766
01:10:24,602 --> 01:10:26,331
It's a sign, not a store.

767
01:10:26,404 --> 01:10:28,372
Looks like he wants
to go down there.

768
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:30,430
Maybe he's picking up
some sort of signal.

769
01:10:30,508 --> 01:10:31,497
Hold on.

770
01:10:31,576 --> 01:10:33,737
Maybe he lives around here.

771
01:11:16,421 --> 01:11:17,410
Hey, look!

772
01:11:17,488 --> 01:11:20,582
Windmills! That's what
he was trying to tell us.

773
01:11:20,658 --> 01:11:22,683
It's the straws! That's it!

774
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,421
We must be getting closer!

775
01:11:24,495 --> 01:11:27,362
Bummer. I thought it was
gonna be a spaceship.

776
01:11:27,432 --> 01:11:29,832
You never know.
There still could be one.

777
01:12:24,655 --> 01:12:26,816
What's he doing?

778
01:12:26,891 --> 01:12:28,756
He's communicating.

779
01:12:56,554 --> 01:12:57,612
That's it.

780
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:11,466
Let's go.

781
01:13:43,668 --> 01:13:45,067
You sure this is it, Mac?

782
01:13:49,006 --> 01:13:50,735
You guys better just wait here.

783
01:13:50,808 --> 01:13:52,332
Better give him the flashlight.

784
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,741
Let's go, Mac.
Come on, on my back.

785
01:13:57,115 --> 01:13:58,139
Be careful.

786
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:03,917
I know everybody's trying
to be optimistic,

787
01:14:03,988 --> 01:14:05,888
but what if
they really are dangerous?

788
01:14:05,957 --> 01:14:08,084
- They're not dangerous.
- Michael!

789
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,389
Are you sure it's okay?

790
01:14:10,461 --> 01:14:11,826
Yeah, just wait there.

791
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:24,396
Get off, Mac. Come on.

792
01:15:50,828 --> 01:15:52,762
She's alive, Mac.

793
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,889
We're gonna get some help.
Just stay here.

794
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:56,194
She's alive.

795
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:03,536
Give me some drinks,
and the jackets.

796
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:05,269
- What is it?
- There's three more of them.

797
01:16:05,343 --> 01:16:06,332
Three?

798
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,241
- Are they friendly?
- We'll find out soon enough.

799
01:16:08,312 --> 01:16:11,110
- There's only two cans left.
- That's fine, let's go.

800
01:16:11,182 --> 01:16:12,581
Come on, Eric.

801
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:18,054
Be careful.
It's slippery there, guys.

802
01:16:18,122 --> 01:16:19,316
Hey, Mac.

803
01:16:24,629 --> 01:16:25,653
Give me a straw.

804
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:36,130
That's it.

805
01:16:36,207 --> 01:16:37,538
See, Mac?

806
01:16:37,608 --> 01:16:40,042
She's gonna be okay, Mac.

807
01:16:44,148 --> 01:16:45,137
It's okay.

808
01:16:45,216 --> 01:16:47,377
All right, see if you can
get the other one to drink,

809
01:16:47,451 --> 01:16:48,611
the little one.

810
01:16:48,686 --> 01:16:49,675
Here.

811
01:17:06,103 --> 01:17:07,092
Good.

812
01:17:10,841 --> 01:17:13,036
Here, put the jacket on her.

813
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:15,668
Okay.

814
01:17:19,517 --> 01:17:21,883
It's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

815
01:17:21,952 --> 01:17:24,352
Here's your baby.
He brought us to you.

816
01:17:24,422 --> 01:17:26,117
Easy, now. It's okay.

817
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:29,182
- She must be Mac's sister.
- Must be.

818
01:17:32,596 --> 01:17:34,120
She's so gentle.

819
01:17:37,368 --> 01:17:38,733
Easy. Easy.

820
01:17:43,374 --> 01:17:44,932
She won't hurt you.

821
01:17:45,009 --> 01:17:47,739
I'm Debbie.
I live next door.

822
01:17:50,214 --> 01:17:52,182
This is my friend Eric.

823
01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:00,479
Hi.

824
01:18:11,168 --> 01:18:12,999
Here, give me the other jacket.

825
01:18:14,004 --> 01:18:15,471
Okay, just a minute.

826
01:18:35,693 --> 01:18:37,593
All right, put the jacket on.

827
01:18:39,363 --> 01:18:40,853
Give me that one, too, Debbie.

828
01:18:40,931 --> 01:18:44,867
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on!
Guys, give me another drink!

829
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:46,266
We don't have any more.

830
01:18:46,337 --> 01:18:49,170
- Oh, shoot!
- We better get something soon!

831
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:53,074
We're Mac's friends.
He brought us to meet you.

832
01:18:53,144 --> 01:18:54,611
No, friends,

833
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:48,525
What if they need some kind of
medical attention or something?

834
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:51,397
Look, we can't just walk into a hospital.
Everyone's gonna freak out.

835
01:19:51,469 --> 01:19:53,937
It's just like you said, people
are gonna find out sooner or later.

836
01:19:54,004 --> 01:19:56,268
Oh, my gosh...

837
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,671
What's he doing now?

838
01:19:57,741 --> 01:20:00,073
He just tied a knot
in the tire iron!

839
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:01,577
It's okay, I think he's just bored!

840
01:20:01,645 --> 01:20:04,705
Well, keep him busy!
Guys, keep him busy!

841
01:20:04,782 --> 01:20:07,376
- Here! Here, read him this!
- It's okay. He's got the hat.

842
01:20:07,451 --> 01:20:08,509
Look, maybe we should go public.

843
01:20:08,586 --> 01:20:11,020
If we can get 'em on the news,
everyone is gonna want to help 'em.

844
01:20:11,088 --> 01:20:12,350
I'm not so sure about that.

845
01:20:12,423 --> 01:20:14,118
I think they'll be a big hit on TV.

846
01:20:14,191 --> 01:20:17,183
- What's he doing now?
- I think he wants my bracelet.

847
01:20:17,261 --> 01:20:18,956
- Well, then, give it to him!
- You're hurting me!

848
01:20:19,029 --> 01:20:20,428
- Michael!
- Well, do something!

849
01:20:20,498 --> 01:20:22,227
- What?
- I'm driving. I don't know.

850
01:20:22,299 --> 01:20:24,358
You can't do this
when we're in a vehicle like this.

851
01:20:24,435 --> 01:20:28,428
Now, you just cross your arms and don't
unloose them until I tell you you can.

852
01:20:28,506 --> 01:20:29,803
Cross your arms.

853
01:20:29,874 --> 01:20:32,775
That's right. Just be the mommy,
be the mommy.

854
01:20:32,843 --> 01:20:33,901
That's right. You teach 'em.

855
01:20:34,245 --> 01:20:35,439
How much further is it?

856
01:20:35,513 --> 01:20:36,707
We should be there by now.

857
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,407
He's starting to move again.

858
01:20:38,482 --> 01:20:40,416
What do you want me to do?

859
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:42,748
- Simon says!
- Simon says, yeah.

860
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:44,447
- Put your hands on your head.
- Hands on your head.

861
01:20:44,522 --> 01:20:46,422
- Your head.
- That's right, on your head.

862
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:49,220
Head. Your head.

863
01:20:49,293 --> 01:20:51,124
All right, it's working, guys!

864
01:20:51,195 --> 01:20:53,356
- Okay, Simon says to...
- All right, great.

865
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:55,796
Simon says... wiggle your ears.

866
01:20:55,866 --> 01:20:57,424
Wiggle your ears.
Wiggle your ears.

867
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:02,263
All right, it's working!

868
01:21:02,339 --> 01:21:03,567
Think of another one.

869
01:21:03,641 --> 01:21:05,404
Clap your hands.
Simon says clap your hands.

870
01:21:05,476 --> 01:21:06,636
Clap your hands.

871
01:21:07,211 --> 01:21:11,739
Old MacDonald had a farm,
e- i-e-i-o

872
01:21:11,815 --> 01:21:16,411
And on this farm he had a bird,
e- i-e-i-o

873
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:21,782
All right, just keep 'em singin',
all right?

874
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:24,756
- All right, you got any money?
- Yeah.

875
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:27,422
All right, pay for the gas, get some drinks.
I'm gonna call my mom.

876
01:21:27,498 --> 01:21:29,932
- What if they trace the call?
- We're not gonna be here that long.

877
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,467
- Just go do it.
- Okay.

878
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:40,439
- Do you need anything?
- Yeah, get me some smokes.

879
01:22:01,966 --> 01:22:03,399
Don't do that!

880
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:08,496
It's okay, they won't hurt you!
They won't hurt you!

881
01:22:08,572 --> 01:22:11,063
Well, when did she leave?

882
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:14,971
Did she say where she was going?

883
01:22:15,045 --> 01:22:16,637
You better come quick.

884
01:22:16,714 --> 01:22:19,410
They got out of the van.
Everbody's freaking!

885
01:22:20,484 --> 01:22:22,213
Why didn't you
keep them singing, Debbie?

886
01:22:22,286 --> 01:22:24,379
Ma'am, I have to total
all the groceries first,

887
01:22:24,455 --> 01:22:25,888
then I can deduct the coupons.

888
01:22:25,956 --> 01:22:28,186
What is that?

889
01:22:28,258 --> 01:22:29,247
Dad!

890
01:22:29,326 --> 01:22:32,159
It's all right, son. It's just
a promotional gag or something.

891
01:22:34,064 --> 01:22:37,192
Well, they're not
advertising clothes, that's for sure.

892
01:22:37,267 --> 01:22:40,202
Oh, I think they are real.

893
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:42,261
Oh, they don't know
what they're doing.

894
01:22:42,339 --> 01:22:43,397
We're getting out of here.

895
01:22:43,474 --> 01:22:45,806
Ernie, customer service
to register four,

896
01:22:48,178 --> 01:22:49,236
Do you believe this?

897
01:22:49,313 --> 01:22:51,304
That's it, man.
I'm going back on the soda.

898
01:22:53,784 --> 01:22:55,752
Hey! Hey, put that down!

899
01:22:57,621 --> 01:23:00,055
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

900
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:03,927
I don't believe this.

901
01:23:09,133 --> 01:23:12,193
- Stay with Mommy.
- Security. Get security, quick!

902
01:23:12,269 --> 01:23:15,864
Security to the front, please,
Buck, get up here,

903
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:18,865
- What is that?
- I don't know. Get 'em out of here.

904
01:23:18,942 --> 01:23:20,409
Don't hurt 'em.
They're not dangerous.

905
01:23:20,477 --> 01:23:22,138
They won't hurt you.

906
01:23:22,212 --> 01:23:23,736
All right, now you
put that down right now.

907
01:23:23,814 --> 01:23:25,042
They're not dangerous.

908
01:23:25,115 --> 01:23:27,310
Like hell it isn't.
Now, now, put it down.

909
01:23:27,384 --> 01:23:29,045
Look, they're not gonna hurt you.

910
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:31,485
Look, I'll pay for the damage.

911
01:23:31,555 --> 01:23:33,580
You stand back, now.
I'm warning you.

912
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:35,056
No, they don't understand you.

913
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:36,422
He's telling the truth.

914
01:23:36,493 --> 01:23:38,120
Tell him to back off!

915
01:23:38,195 --> 01:23:39,890
No!

916
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:43,963
Give me the gun!

917
01:23:45,035 --> 01:23:46,161
Get out of here!

918
01:23:46,236 --> 01:23:48,136
- I'm not leaving!
- Go!

919
01:23:51,508 --> 01:23:52,770
Give me the gun.

920
01:23:52,843 --> 01:23:54,674
Step back!
Move away from it!

921
01:23:54,745 --> 01:23:57,680
- Step away from it!
- They're not gonna hurt you!

922
01:23:57,748 --> 01:24:00,080
- Move it, now!
- Michael, please!

923
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:03,347
You don't understand!
They're not gonna hurt anyone!

924
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,217
Give me the gun!

925
01:24:05,289 --> 01:24:06,916
Come on!

926
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:08,150
Don't shoot 'em!

927
01:24:08,225 --> 01:24:10,557
Come on, don't shoot 'em!
They're not gonna hurt you!

928
01:24:11,862 --> 01:24:13,853
I don't know where they came from.
We found them in a cave.

929
01:24:13,931 --> 01:24:15,660
Just get over to the car.
Come on, move!

930
01:24:15,733 --> 01:24:18,429
- They're not dangerous!
- Just get 'em down here right away!

931
01:24:18,502 --> 01:24:21,062
No! Leave 'em alone!
They're not gonna hurt anyone!

932
01:24:21,138 --> 01:24:22,628
Hold your fire, everybody!

933
01:24:22,706 --> 01:24:24,537
- Hold your fire!
- It's still got a gun.

934
01:24:24,608 --> 01:24:26,974
Just do as I tell you.
Hold your fire.

935
01:24:27,044 --> 01:24:28,102
This is the police,

936
01:24:28,178 --> 01:24:30,703
Put down your gun,
and nothing will happen to you,

937
01:24:30,781 --> 01:24:34,581
I repeat, put down your gun,
and nothing will happen to you,

938
01:24:34,651 --> 01:24:35,982
He doesn't understand you.

939
01:24:36,053 --> 01:24:38,521
Get back, get back, get back.

940
01:24:42,326 --> 01:24:44,260
Get those people out of here.
Get those people back.

941
01:24:44,328 --> 01:24:45,317
Move it!

942
01:24:45,395 --> 01:24:48,159
- Get those people out of here!
- Evacuate that building!

943
01:24:48,232 --> 01:24:49,563
Get those people
out of that building!

944
01:24:49,633 --> 01:24:51,100
Can you tell them to stop?

945
01:24:51,168 --> 01:24:52,829
I told you,
they don't understand.

946
01:24:52,903 --> 01:24:54,837
Clear this building now!

947
01:24:54,905 --> 01:24:58,602
I can stop them!
Let me go out there, please!

948
01:24:58,675 --> 01:25:01,007
I can't let you do that, son.
He's got a gun.

949
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:03,902
We're gonna lose 'em, Bill!

950
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:06,176
They don't know how to drive, anyway!

951
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,239
Stop him!

952
01:25:07,317 --> 01:25:08,841
Eric!

953
01:25:13,257 --> 01:25:14,554
No!

954
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:31,669
Get a doctor!

955
01:25:43,787 --> 01:25:45,778
Let me get him on the ground.

956
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:48,757
Come on, Eric.
Eric, talk to me, please!

957
01:25:48,826 --> 01:25:51,294
Eric! Eric, talk to me!

958
01:25:51,361 --> 01:25:53,386
Talk to me, Eric.
Come on.

959
01:25:53,463 --> 01:25:54,725
I know he's still breathing.

960
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,329
- Eric!
- He's gonna be okay.

961
01:25:59,403 --> 01:26:01,064
Get back, I'm a doctor.
Get back.

962
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:04,767
Oh, my God!

963
01:26:04,842 --> 01:26:08,869
Eric! Come on, Eric,
talk to me, please!

964
01:26:08,946 --> 01:26:10,413
What is it?

965
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,471
Eric, everything's gonna be okay.

966
01:26:13,483 --> 01:26:14,472
He's gone.

967
01:26:14,551 --> 01:26:15,882
What?

968
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:18,717
- He's gone?
- There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

969
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:19,778
Eric!

970
01:26:19,857 --> 01:26:22,018
Oh, my God!

971
01:26:23,794 --> 01:26:25,455
He can't be!

972
01:26:25,529 --> 01:26:27,463
My God, Eric!

973
01:26:48,852 --> 01:26:51,753
- We've got a problem.
- What is it?

974
01:26:51,822 --> 01:26:54,484
- Little boy's been hurt.
- Which little boy?

975
01:26:54,558 --> 01:26:56,549
I don't know his name,
but he's in a wheelchair!

976
01:26:56,627 --> 01:26:58,254
- Where is he?
- He's over here.

977
01:26:58,328 --> 01:27:00,262
- Wickett, secure the area.
- Take that area over there.

978
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:02,662
He's ten years old!

979
01:27:02,733 --> 01:27:05,099
All you people move back!

980
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:08,535
Let me in. I'm his mother.

981
01:27:11,008 --> 01:27:13,533
They can't help him!
They can't!

982
01:27:20,183 --> 01:27:22,174
We tried to stop him.

983
01:27:24,855 --> 01:27:26,618
Oh, my baby.

984
01:27:35,032 --> 01:27:36,522
My baby!

985
01:28:25,482 --> 01:28:29,578
They won't hurt you, Mom.
They won't hurt you.

986
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:37,456
They're not gonna hurt him, Mom.

987
01:28:38,528 --> 01:28:40,223
Just trust 'em, all right?

988
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:58,089
Eric.

989
01:31:05,642 --> 01:31:07,132
You okay?

990
01:31:08,145 --> 01:31:09,737
He's okay!

991
01:31:21,825 --> 01:31:23,850
Mom? Mom?

992
01:31:39,009 --> 01:31:41,273
Okay, the house.
Is everything arranged in the house?

993
01:31:41,344 --> 01:31:42,606
Everything's been taken care of.

994
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:44,510
- What about the car?
- It's fine!

995
01:31:44,581 --> 01:31:46,947
- Headroom-what about headroom?
- It's perfect. There's plenty of headroom!

996
01:31:47,017 --> 01:31:48,678
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive!

997
01:31:48,752 --> 01:31:50,947
- Let's go! We can't be late!
- I'm coming!

998
01:31:57,961 --> 01:32:01,556
All rise,
Please raise your right hand,

999
01:32:04,367 --> 01:32:05,959
I hereby declare on oath

1000
01:32:06,036 --> 01:32:08,766

been a subject or citizen,

1004
01:32:23,153 --> 01:32:25,621

when required by the law,

1010
01:32:46,343 --> 01:32:50,336
that I will perform noncombative service
in the armed forces

1011
01:32:50,413 --> 01:32:52,438
when required by the law,

1012
01:32:52,515 --> 01:32:55,951
that I will perform work
of national import

1013
01:32:56,019 --> 01:33:00,388
under civilian direction
when required by the law,

1014
01:33:00,457 --> 01:33:03,551
and that I have
taken this obligation freely,

1015
01:33:03,627 --> 01:33:08,530

01:33:08,598 --> 01:33:10,691
so help me God,

1017
01:33:10,767 --> 01:33:13,235
And if you agree
to all of the above,

1018
01:33:13,303 --> 01:33:16,500
please state so by saying, "I do,"

1019
01:33:16,573 --> 01:33:18,234
I do.

1020
01:33:18,308 --> 01:33:20,742
Now, may I extend
a warm congratulation,

1021
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:25,338
You are now citizens
of the United States of America.
