00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:24,559
What?

00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:27,639
Why?
- Do not tell me anything
you have noticed.

3
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:30,037
Of course not. Why? Did it?
- What do you think?

00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:32,596
I'm your rear, rear up, Tiago.

You sing immediately show a softer tune, and off you go!

All right, do not get on.

9
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:47,126
What 's the problem, anyway?

Got a problem?

Go on, go to work!

13
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,917
Goodchild, Snoesje.

14
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,077
I said, lie Snoesje!

15
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,405

00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:03,085
Good, I catch him on.

00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:05,477
I give you something back?
Half of your dough?

00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:08,366
And what do you give me back? Half of the girl?!

21
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,918
Okay, Manu?

22
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,917
I knew it, they bake
anything about it.

23
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,964
Everybody wants to
bully me today.

24
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,516
Hey, Ace!
- Fuck.

25
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,957
Ins! Najma!

26
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,404
Are you OK?
Are you waiting for the bus?

27
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,482
You got arthritis in your hands?

28
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,839
Damn ...

29
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,596
What does that say?
Find his car keys?

30
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,246
He behaves.

31
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,602
Overruns on it, I forfeit!

32
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,282
And you subscribe you again for 3 minutes
or you get your face in my usage!

33
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,605
Away, ok?!

34
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,797
Come on, do yourself at home.

35
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,635
Ace, Rodrigue. Rodrigue, Ace.

36
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:41,406
He really show a face that
asking for trouble.

37
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:43,598
Wine is so fascinating.

38
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,644
Do you mind of grands crus, Ace?

39
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,765
My Strongest Suit-an is
rather nice bum, Tiago.

40
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:52,477
We know each other for
20 years, Ace ...

41
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,518
... The age of this wine.

42
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,396
To show a grand Cruts make, you need time ...
and good grapes.

43
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,444
'S Problem with grapes ...

44
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,518
... That one bad pit
is sufficient ...

45
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,598
... The whole bunch
of flags to help.

46
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:06,838
With us ...

... 'T tell.

49
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:14,040
And I think I've found one.
What do you think?

50
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,682
I swear, Ace ...

51
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,405

52
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,922
Have you got a tell-all
say, "Yes, I am" t "?

53
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:26,759
Let me go or I'll work face to a pulp!
Rotten pit!

54
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,677
The care, Ace ...

55
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:40,482
... Is that sometimes two bad
seeds in 'n spray down.

56
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,957
And Franky who thinks
you're second.

57
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:48,560
And you let lull you to sleep
by that filthy whore tongue.

58
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,756
Nothing lulls me to sleep
if I have doubts.

59
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:57,246
Of doubts I am crazy.
'T spoil my night.

60
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:59,637
I get nervous, see everything in
black, nothing distinction.

61
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:01,877
You can make me especially
nervous, Ace.

62
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,083
I must find my sleep
again, and soon!

63
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:08,163
I want you also do not need wrapping paper to wrap.
Clear?

64
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,204
Perfectly clear.

65
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,676
You can rest assured.

66
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:14,721
Just go.

67
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,721
Why in your fucking car, huh?!

68
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,401
What now?

69
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:53,160
Damn, he's got a problem!
He emerged from behind!
Ride, quick!

70
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:05,716
Damn!

71
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,283
Go ahead.

72
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,556
He is so burnt that he immediately
'n urn fits.

73
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:28,083
Are you sure he is?
- He bore our micro itself.

74
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:16,645

Turn around! Face to the wall!

86

'S shot went off by itself.
I was not it.

87
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:23,357
What was your dispute
with that guy?

88
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:25,757
'S got to do with your

121
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,640
It's not true!

122
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:25,802
This is a nightmare!
- Ho but, wait 's. ..

123
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,527
There maybe a solution.
- What?

124
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:38,203
It never works.
- What?

125
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:42,443
Butt ...
- Wait ...

126
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:45,917
If thou wilt me explain, I understand everything.
So I am just one, but ...

If we in our report ...

"one stupid mistake ...

129

... And insist on the
evil of the dead,

130
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:57,796
get thee into the worst three years.
- Yes, even conditionally.

131
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:01,164
In return you replace
your brother.

132
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,597
His boss prepares 's striking
out with' one Colombian.

133
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,962
Burs to them, we want a date,
an hour and 'a place.

134
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:09,756
Your brother played us now and then info
on, but he took sabbatical leave.

135
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,964
So you replace him until we
have the info, and voila.

136
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,163
Very complicated is not it.

137
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:18,524
No, so viewed, is
it not, but ...

138
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:21,395
... I have not understood
everything.

139
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,717
My brother ...

140
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:27,924

141
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,355
Who is that?
- Your new best friend.

142
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,278
Can I have your glasses here?

143
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,638
Good day.

00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,039
I dunno, they told me nothing.

152
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,323
The basis of all learning
is repetition.

153
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,883
Wait!
Hold on, does that damn much.

154

00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:31,523
And now the studio for engraving.

00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:55,405
If they are going to have
fun, I have on my guard.

173
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:58,396
Relax your sphincter,
but, it's done.

174
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,127
It hurts, terribly hurt.

175
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,718
Beware, that hurts ...
hold on ...

176
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,003
That tickles ...

177
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:10,076
What is she doing now?

178
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,998
You bitch!

179
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:21,558
Another important rule: 'n
continually lying pimp.

180
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:31,081
With his fists. Left, right!

Chest forward ... ... arms ...

You're the Slim Saurir ...

Nice, huh?

204
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,163
That's one of my
henchmen, Mario.

205
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:11,478
Marco, damn! Marco!

00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:14,878
And such a blunder and kill everything!
Repetition!

00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:17,356
No, wait!
You have not seen everything.

00:19:17,527 --> 00:19:20,803
Wait! Look!

209
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:27,523

00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:32,485
I am the boss!
The playboy of the neighborhood!

211
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,603

What? You got's problem?

213
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,726
Okay, you?

214
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,918
Not bad, but there

00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:46,806
Why, do not miss?!

00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:09,084
You're calm, we can pick you up.

223
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,317
But ho, wait 's!

Why?

Show what?

228
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,281
That's already better.

229
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:56,558
Very well.

230
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:05,199
Ace!

231
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,725
Damn ...

232
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:16,084
That nose of yours ...
something in common.
Those bastards have

233
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,760
It's cool to see you, Ace.
- No!

234
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:19,280
Will it continue?
- Nothing!

235
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:20,880
If you ...
- Stop!

236
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,436
No, shhh, quiet!

237
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,762
Jente us but you. So I recognize you again ...
- What? You recognize me ...
Mario?! Marco!

238
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:39,443
I do not want to be recognized, do you hear?!
Nothing! I don 't want! Never!

239
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:45,206
OK? You too?

240
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:51,478
You're in our bars, for sure.

241
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,366
Damn, you!
That is one word too many!

242
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:58,406
You know what?
Take the car and round it off.

243
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,366
Sphere it off!
- The Acorn's ties to us ...

244
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:03,438
I heard that!

245
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:07,395
And you never recognize me more of your life!
Roger, Marco?
Come on, ball it off!

246
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:15,441
Given how I've put on his number?
He had not returned.

247
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,486
You had to do without
a car can go away.

248
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,717
I just say, it meant nothing.

249
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:24,038
Oh, yes, it would be good if you showed
up again in the neighborhood.

250
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:28,164
Since your disappearance,
Franky follow us closely.

251
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:35,922
That fruitcake slijmt mends
to your place to pick up.

252
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,722
I have seen it.
- Damn, Franky ...

253
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:40,878
... That fche No. 9!

254
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:42,526
That's a tough guy!

255
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:44,757
By the way ... This is yours.

256
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:48,835
Oh, yeah, can I?

257
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:54,597

258
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,719
Until tomorrow.

259
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:43,398
Hey, what are you doing?

260
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:46,037
Calm down, calm down, woof!

261
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,838
Boel sucks!

262
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:31,717
If you are beaten, say.
What happened?

263
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,003
Mark came by yesterday in Calao.

264
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:37,557
He told us that all that time
in lik Sat You okay?

265
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:42,480
No, but ...
- What is that?
What is happening to you?

266
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,844
'Tis the woof.

267
00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:50,876
When he saw me coming through that door,
he went all the way through it ribbon.

268
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:52,639
And that is all his work?

269
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,957
Yes, he started to piss
everywhere ...

270
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,357
... I'm off to continue.

271
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,646
You look wiped out ...

272
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:02,765
We thought something had happened to you.
We were worried sick.

273
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:08,041
Well done, keep it up.

274
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,641
You, as well as they ...
and so are you.

275
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:31,598
I give you in, girls?

276
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,598
Covers furniture, huh?

277
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:42,163
And again, it works ... are you?

278
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:45,486
It's quietly.

279
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:49,435
From that purchase, I am
also happy because ...

280
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:54,564
... 'T move.
- I don 't al

281
00:25:56,447 --> 00:26:00,281
Looking for this sometimes?
You do not poop so
much to support.

282
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,443
Here's your dough al

283
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,563
The whole week is on the table.

284
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:07,121
Dt, for a week?

285
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:10,245
We did not know what had happened.
We saw it not really like.

286
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,238
Because you saw it not there?

287
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:14,204
Now keep on at work to think.

288
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,007
We are yours' s relax.

289
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:23,239
Do you got a little massage, Ace?
- Here and now? In full day?

290
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:27,600
Wait, I'd rather ...
I need to breathe ...

291
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:38,475
What should that stuff, Ace?

292
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:42,959
Tiago wants to see you. It's urgent.
- Who? Wait ... Tiago?

293
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,961
I've seen you!
I do not want to hear!

294
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:48,721
I'm not here.
- What? I'm not here?

295
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,923
All right, let's go.

296
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,760
Hey, Ace? It's still Tiago.

297
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:56,395
Damn ... 'S shirt.

298
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,398
And comb your hair.

299
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:58,240
I've been worried about you.
- That was not necessary, Tiago.

300
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:01,444
Indestructible, this valve.
Franky!

301
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,957
You must have had fun
with the cops, huh?

302
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:09,359
Initially not, but then I've
given them a broadside.

303
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:13,076
I got it made them hell!
- That's right, Ace.

304
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,201
Because I am doing it all wrong.

305
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,927
I sleep getting worse and I
start to think seriously

306
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:25,157
Franky is right that as for you.

307
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:29,355
But I also, Tiago.

308
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:31,916
I think about as you like.

309
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:40,563
Courage you have, Ace ...
guts to me so take
the piece of shit!

310
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:44,279
What were you doing when the cops?
- Nothing.

311
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:46,438
They wanted to interrogate
me about 's murder.

312
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:49,405
'S Murder two times nothing, really.
- What murder?

313
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:52,240
They found it corpse 's guest at sea
with a bullet in his head ...

314
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:54,238
... And he was drowned.

315
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:58,161
So they wanted to know who fired the
bullet that had him was drowned.

316
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,437
Rodrigue?
- If that it was ...

317
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:06,485
... Then I swear I have nothing
unloaded, Tiago.

318
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:11,084
Sometimes you trip?
I got your eyes Rodrigue
Fri afgeknald!

319
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:15,682
That I what I said,
Tiago, I swear t!

320
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:18,486
I have no one denounced, not
yours, not Franky ...

321
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:21,002
... Not the dead!
I have the cops sand sprinkled
in the eyes.

322
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:24,045
He poeiert us.
I tell it you in the beginning,
he is their sentinel.

323
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:26,323
No, damn it! Sentinel ...

324
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:30,446
... I'm seen by the cops.
It's ... other!

325
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:37,004
The other one?
- 'N Guest cooperates
with Rodrigue.

326
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:40,443
Once I saw it, I thought, "He's
got a real indicator head.

327
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:42,598
That should Tiago know
when I'm see.

328
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,837
And I know him? What's his name?

329
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:49,239
No idea, but I 'd be able
to recognize problems.

330
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:51,363
I listen ...

331
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:55,679
He is not very big ...
between 20 and 50 years ...

332
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:59,317
... Maybe 30, but he's a
very ordinary indicator.

333
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:03,241
Vaporing enough.
You will find that everyday
back and tell him resign.

334
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:04,999
Franky will gladly go.

335
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,965
If you're bluffing, let Franky,
who is good at magic ...

336
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:10,925
... You with his barks in
'n seesaw disappear.

337
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:13,237
Give me anyway for a week,
a question of ...

338
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:17,116
Three days.
And who else's magic trick
with Franky barker.

339
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:19,676
No, but I have to ...
- Two days seems fine.

340
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:23,362
Sphere it now.
Go pick up my envelope with the Japanese.
Get out!

341
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:32,403
Hats off to your workout!
- Calm down ...

342
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,525
Calm?!
I have just replaced my brother
and I have already

343
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:40,397
dough to pick 'n Japanese and show a guest
flats that does not exist or even die!

344
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:44,401
You can mends' trust can only recover
if you do what he says.

345
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:48,925
You hear it now and then when we have guests you have afknallen.
- Disturbed!

346
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:52,602
You need either one pushed back without
hesitation set in 'n garage, so ...!

347
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:56,839
This is going too far!
Find it 's other brother, my
twin brother to replace.

348
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,963
Maybe it was my mother
's triplets ...

349
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:01,163
... Let them also one behind
the Porte de Montreull!

350
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,278
Your Desk is here on the street.

351
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,041
Or go back to work or to
the lick in 20 years.

352
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:39,838
Leave me alone.

353
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:42,238
I control everything.

354
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:47,517
What have I been 's that?!

355
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:55,284
You stay here.

356
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:02,723
Come with me.
- You sure?

357
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,878
Yeah, come anyway.

358
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,882
Goodbye, sir. Three people?

359
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:23,759
Well done, you count properly.
But we are not as customers
but for the envelope.

360
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:27,326
Envelope? I do not understand.

361
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:31,116
Envelope!
Show a rectangular piece of paper
with 'n stamp and "For mends.

362
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:33,676
Go ahead, get him out soon.

363
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:40,595
He translates it word "envelope"
in 't Japanese.

364
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:43,406
It lasts a while, but
I got a good feeling.

365
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:46,116
What are you looking for? Money?

366
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:48,926
There is no money.
It's a restaurant.

367
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:51,197
You eat, or else d out!

368
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:53,358
But ho, calm!

369
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:57,361
Tell your vrouwte calm, and
even if your wife is not.

370
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:04,197
I'm talking toughest job.
I leave you it finish,
because she ...

371
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:05,356
Outside!

372
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:10,799
Sami? Marco? What are you doing?
- 'N classic.

373
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:13,037
If they do not afdokken,
we fkken tent.

374
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:15,437
If they cause trouble, we shoot them down.
- As usual.

375
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:18,080
Wait a minute ...

376
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,478
How can they give me the envelope
when they're dead?

377
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:26,004
That makes sense.
- What I say to Tiago?

378
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,364
That thaw 'n envelope look
in' n restaurant?

379
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:31,757
Frankly, I do not think
he believes me.

380
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,521
What inspires you, Ace?
Usually you are their
radio anyway

381
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:37,076
'S signal right between the eyes?
Qu pasa?

382
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:39,397
Qu pasa ... I try 'n. ..

383
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:42,240
Go ahead, you have the honor.
- I'll stay standing.

384
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,078
... Show a slightly
different approach.

385
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:51,359
Get Started!

386
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,517
It's good, we have the envelope.

387
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:11,483
See you then, parting

388
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,117
Please! Suit.

389
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:24,084
Say to M.
Mends that things sincerely
regret the delay.

390
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:27,358
It will not happen again.
Promised.

391
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,165
Where did that suddenly
come from?

392
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,966
Do not touch my restaurant, please
- fuck!

393
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:44,399
Bravo!
You are two and not one has
come close to exploring.

394
00:35:44,647 --> 00:35:47,525
What are you?
- I got nothing to say ...

395
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:52,317
And you, you say nothing at all.
Whether swinging
something for you.

396
00:35:53,607 --> 00:35:56,326
Do not complain ... afterwards.

397
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,398
Who?

398
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:07,486
Mommy?

399
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,520
Hi, Ace!

400
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:15,400
Beretta 92.

401
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,922
Never used.

402
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:20,806
'T Is your cousins experienced
great difficulty to find it.

403
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:23,317
How often have I dreamed
of the moment ...

404
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:26,285
Nothing to do.
If you dream to own
this barker ...

405
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:28,244
... You have afdokken mr.

406
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:31,923
I did not track with acid.
You can easily take n moles.

407
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:33,759
I have so much to say ...

408
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:37,357
Do not start whining.
We had agreed in prices.

409
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:45,518
What should that stupid smile of yours?
- What?

410
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:47,757
Looking for me sometimes
to cheat?

411
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:52,046
Of course not!

412
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:53,720
It's just me ...

413
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:59,159
... Is currently always on the other
to think. I do not know why.

414
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:00,999
The other thing?

415
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:05,003
The twin brother, you know, the
one you left behind in Paris.

416
00:38:05,927 --> 00:38:09,397
I know you, I've told
you that yet.

417
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:14,606
You'll tell him, will
soon be done.

418
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:20,675
We have very little
time together.

419
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:25,723
I wish to know why you've
left me and not him?

420
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,038
No, I mean, why have you
dumped him and not me?

421
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,357
I mean, why?

422
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:35,038
Why am I here ...

423
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:37,965
... And he does not?

424
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:40,717
Because you are the best, Ace.

425
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:43,397
The best? Why the best?

426
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:47,355
It's simple.
I never knew I was going
to have one twin.

427
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:50,326
And when I did, I realized

428
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:53,047
I had 13 kids standing
at the counter.

429
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,767
Thirteen, you hear me? Thirteen!

430
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:58,725
But never! Never! Vade retro!

431
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:02,163
And just why?
- I've been in shit ...

432
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:04,887
... I did not go my whole
life, unlucky.

433
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:08,642
So to determine which
I went to leave ...

434
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:12,163
... I threw my last bill
from your tween.

435
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:16,039
Unseen!

436
00:39:16,207 --> 00:39:20,166
Two seconds, Ace ...
the time you needed it to catch.

437
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:24,880
I still see the frumpy look of the
other, with big round eyes ...

438
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:31,877
... Just like yours now.

439
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,398
And you've never tried

440
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:40,479
to him again to find, just to ...
I do not know ...

441
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:43,445
To do what?
If something grows only
in his corner,

442
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:45,757
that bitter, hateful, resentful.

443
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:49,682
That 's the kind of kid that is wrong
to end, as a lawyer or cop ...

444
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:52,236
Bugger of cops! Or a banker ...

445
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:59,920
What you can be crazy sometimes!

446
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:04,442
That would it be height, "one
banker in the family!

447
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,199
Oh, you're stupid!

448
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,637
What's not?

449
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,364
You've been here two days,
it is disturbing.

450
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:36,076
So can you not understand, Luna.

451
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:39,277
I experience something
like a huge void.

452
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:43,197
Listen, Ace, we all have programs
in the throttle.

453
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,597
But you I have never seen.

454
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:50,246
Me neither, Luna.

455
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:52,998
I have also never seen.

456
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:56,636
But it is something that ...

457
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,879
... From very far.

458
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:04,157
I can not explain, it's ...

459
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,518
Is it any better?

460
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:27,916
Take this the wrong way, but ...

461
00:41:28,207 --> 00:41:31,483
... I think you had to
frequently go to jail.

462
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:34,356
It is true, since you're
outside ...

463
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:38,600
... There is something in you changed.
- You sure?

464
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:42,999
You have something delicate
and fragile ...

465
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:46,557
... That is not against me.
- Yes!

466
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:51,316
That is the lick now.

467
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:54,160
"A week in the lick?
It's already ...

468
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:58,161
I do not know why,
but this time ...

469
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:00,958
... Are you not over.

470
00:42:04,447 --> 00:42:07,484
I'll get ready for Calao.
- Yes, do it.

471
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:30,207
And that man of you?
- Someone from our department.

472
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,407
And not many propose,
easy to shoot down.

473
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:35,717
We took instant 'n fat.
Impossible to miss.

474
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,685
Pops up three bullets into his
bulletproof vest, and voila.

475
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,803
Why not with blanks?

476
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:43,561
Franky will be with you and your
only at the last moment

477
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,287
"Barks one pass.
We take no chances.

478
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:49,086
And we are close, you
have nothing to fear.

479
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:53,399
You must be very stupid to
let's start a fake murder.

480
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:03,436
Will hold our own in an hour
at this restaurant.

481
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:07,721
Now you call Franky and you say
'to tell that you have found.

482
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,478
Well, which is it?

483
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:30,242
There is only one fat.
Do not bother me with your questions.
Let's go.

484
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,557
No, Franky, stay.

485
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:36,003
I'll go.
That seems quite 'n
cozy restaurant.

486
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:54,158
And where is your husband somewhere?
- There.

487
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:56,158
That fat there?

488
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:02,523
Goes' t. .. Wilfried?

489
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:06,122
Do you recognize me?
- No.

490
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:09,245
Ace, with "n" A ". Ace!

491
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:11,238
Do you know me again?

492
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:15,684
Unbelievable, dammit.
He is working with
the wrong fat.

493
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:18,157
No, do not you.

494
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:20,045
And you know why?

495
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:23,358
Some years ago I already 's
a guy just like you meet.

496
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,325
'N Simple guest, not talkative,
quiet, no more.

497
00:44:28,687 --> 00:44:30,757
And I found it again
in 'n restaurant ...

498
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:33,521
... Like the one where you think
nothing can happen to you.

499
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:36,481
'S Family affair, not expensive ...
exactly as shown.

500
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:39,320
Expensive or inexpensive, so
once he sends you walk ...

501
00:44:39,487 --> 00:44:43,002
... So do right now with him
off and we smear him!

502
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,556
And he had taken the daily
special, just like you.

503
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,797
With 'n spider crab,'
n Chablis ...

504
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:51,435
And he chuckled to himself as early
as it was dessert that follow ...

505
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,165
... And suddenly ...

506
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:55,602
... Collapsed, he collapsed.
He fell smack down, just ...

507
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,325
... And he started
blren. Pathetic.

508
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,116
What are you doing?
We read from the Michelin Guide?
Do it quickly!

509
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:04,245
I make him some hot ...
- Do it fast!

510
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:07,319
You know why he started crying?
- Not really.

511
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:12,798
He do not know.

512
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,516
You do not know?
Why, you do not know?

513
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:17,518
He do not know.

514
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:23,115
Ace ...
put him down if I hold
myself doing it.

515
00:45:38,247 --> 00:45:40,078
What?

516
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:43,559
I have rarely barks.

517
00:45:43,847 --> 00:45:47,203
Why?
Someone will shoot you
without a barker?

518
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:51,122
What are you doing?
I do not know you ...

519
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:56,236
Do not start to kick stand, you,
or I get the crab and ...

520
00:45:57,327 --> 00:45:59,602
Damn! You see that?!

521
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,485
You see now what you did?!

522
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:04,366
You're going down, pal.

523
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:07,917
You have really the head of
one today will kick off!

524
00:46:10,607 --> 00:46:14,395
You're just 'n loser.
- I?! 'S loser?!

525
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:18,116
I'm a loser?! Give me that!

526
00:46:18,287 --> 00:46:20,278
Everybody out!

527
00:46:23,287 --> 00:46:24,640
'S loser?!

528
00:46:24,807 --> 00:46:28,561
Arise!
And wipe that sauce off your mouth or indirectly
support the laughs I got a cherry.

529
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:31,844
You will die like a man.
First you look at me.
Look at me. Here.

530
00:46:32,007 --> 00:46:35,443
You will die like a man.
Go ahead, die like a man!

531
00:46:36,607 --> 00:46:38,962
Die like a man.
- Blast your'm still

532
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:41,641
Yes, I shoot him down!
Take that! You ...

533
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:53,281
What do this?!
- That was the sentinel!

534
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:56,484
He wanted us tackle treacherous.
Fortunately I was alert.

535
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,559
I just saved our lives!
- And who is that?

536
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:00,842
Distraction!

537
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:05,002
Damn! If it ever ignites ...

538
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,317
... I'll come back damn it ...

539
00:47:09,007 --> 00:47:11,077
... And I fuck you!

540
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:42,718
Ace, my size!

541
00:47:44,087 --> 00:47:46,282
Where is he anyway?
Being at her tear
off or something?

542
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:53,996
Another beer from fche
's file was ...

543
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:56,517
What's up, buddy?

544
00:47:57,647 --> 00:47:59,797
Will you do not find
size Doggy Bag?

545
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:01,958
What is it?
- Silently?

546
00:48:02,207 --> 00:48:05,517
Shut up, I tell you!
Shut up! Shut up!

547
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:08,275
My animals yet?
I train them for future battles.

548
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,041
All day, 6 hours per day, locked in
the car, heating on full house.

549
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:13,038
Motivated they are. Bek here!

550
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:15,198
'S Lids antitheft system.

551
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:18,245
Gladiators, I tell you!
And since only ball leek 'n Mon

552
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:21,558
And no one gram of meat.
Otherwise they are
obscenely fat.

553
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:24,844
Are you a friend or not?
You must do me a favor do.

554
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:28,204
Make sure my chances with
the bookmakers to rise,

556
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:33,124
Sure, I'm your friend. And your dogs.
- See you!?

557
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:35,482
Take care. If you need anything,

558
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:37,842
you call it, and I and
my dogs come off.

559
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:39,963
Ok! Bye, huh?
- See you later!

560
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:44,640
Kutbeesten Damn! If you still do retebek 's open ...
I'm the boss here!

561
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:46,684
Who's the daddy?! I'm the daddy!

562
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:58,322
What should hide this
dinner, Ace?

563
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:01,726
Nothing, Luna. No, I ...

564
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:04,199
I really have nothing to hide.

565
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:06,676
But because we work all the
time, came up and never ...

566
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,077
... Hence this TTE
by candlelight.

567
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:11,238
That what?

568
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:13,605
TTE.
- TTE?

569
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,557
TipTop Dinner.

570
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:24,526
You know how long
ago our last TTE?

571
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:26,878
'S Watching ... few weeks?

572
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,446
Right, yes.

573
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:31,197
Months?
- For years, Ace.

574
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:35,725
Anyway ...
- Exactly seven years.

575
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:37,400
Damn ...

576
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:39,876
Just what I said, we work
and work but ...

577
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:43,642
... And see the time pass. Would you like champagne?
Waiter!

578
00:49:43,807 --> 00:49:46,401
A bottle of champagne!
The coolest and most
expensive, please!

579
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,286
Chapelle Not gossip.
This girl already 's views?

580
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:51,597
And if you show a little
patience, I promise you

581
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:53,917
Ace you that you knew, you
will find them again.

582
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:57,238
I swear you, on my head.
Promise of Ace.

583
00:49:57,407 --> 00:49:59,318
Chapelle
- Yes?

584
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:03,802
Gilbert Chapelle?
- No. We do not know each.

585
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,435
Chapelle, are you doing?!
What incredible together
here to take.

586
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:09,883
Day, ma'am, I imagine: Vergnault
Olivier, a fellow of Chapelle.

587
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,844
Well, his superior ...

588
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:15,363
... For "the" Chappelle went on sick parade,
but if he does not look sick.

589
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:18,157
I do not know you.
Do you know him, Luna?

590
00:50:18,327 --> 00:50:21,478
You know what? Sphere it off.
- Even the others have
recognized you.

591
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:23,717
Come here, you.

592
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:27,476
We are here at seminary, but we bales
somewhat since we have to peddle.

593
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:30,286
Day, Chapelle ... Miss.

594
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:32,922
You've obviously cast off
the brakes, Chapelle.

595
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,318
That's not the green plant that
decorated the bank, huh?!

596
00:50:36,487 --> 00:50:38,637
Did you happen to not have
friends as the lady?

597
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:41,002
Because we are all with
my pants full of lust.

598
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:44,603
What does this?
You recognize people
you do not know?

599
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:46,519
What are you doing?

600
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:48,962
You put 'n dikkenek because you're
with your girlfriend?!

601
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:56,163
I will be yours' s explain
my name, asshole.

602
00:50:57,127 --> 00:51:00,085
I explain: there is nothing or no one you know.
Clear?

603
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:01,885
Sphere it now!

604
00:51:02,487 --> 00:51:04,876
And you, two assholes,
you know my name?

605
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:07,402
My name is Ace! Is that clear?!

606
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:10,517
Sphere it now! I'm a fool!

607
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:14,243
Come on, Seminar! Photocopier!

608
00:51:15,847 --> 00:51:18,645
You know what, Luna?
The world is full of people

609
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:21,605
recognize each other, but
that do not exist.

610
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:37,200
And my champagne?!

611
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:45,524
I do not understand.
Why will not you play
for Arsenal?

612
00:52:45,687 --> 00:52:47,359
Arsenal is d club for you.

613
00:52:47,527 --> 00:52:49,563
Read your contract anyway.
What's bothering you?

614
00:52:49,727 --> 00:52:52,924
They speak English and drive on the
left of the steering wheel right.

615
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:56,284
'T his averechtsen.
And such people can
not play football.

616
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,280
We lend you one year and
then come back to OM.

617
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:02,837
You will at how much some of your
toes then n all will be worth.

618
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:04,918
Here, Tiago ...

619
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:07,444
Excuse me! Sylvain, Ace.

620
00:53:07,607 --> 00:53:09,518
Your most faithful fan.

621
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,520
I've seen your match delayed 50 times.
You are ...

622
00:53:12,687 --> 00:53:15,121
Ace, let me alone with
Sylvain, please.

623
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:20,201
Listen well.
If you send to Arsenal Sylvain,

624
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,198
they put him on the
bench anyway.

625
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:25,165
In OM he is the max!
So cut your 'm' s
lawn underfoot.

626
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,124
I'm not going to OM.

627
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,517
It's my club, my
city, my region.

628
00:53:29,687 --> 00:53:33,965
And I understand that field the ball,
the ball and understands me.

629
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,365
I do not want angry at
you, nor your ball.

630
00:53:40,527 --> 00:53:43,883
I leave you I got a week's
easy to talk ...

631
00:53:44,047 --> 00:53:46,959
... You both, you and
your ball. Agreed?

632
00:53:49,047 --> 00:53:51,515
Thanks, Sylvain. Until later.

633
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,121
And another bravo for the
match on Saturday ...

634
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:58,406
What are you doing?!
- The guy's a miracle!

635
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:00,797
It's one to do you guessed it.
Put your stupidity right.

636
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:04,596
I have all their efforts on his transfer.
When not at Arsenal draw

637
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:08,442
I lose 's fortune.
Pull out your plan,
but he should draw.

638
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,557
What about the Colombian?
Hurry it up?

639
00:54:16,727 --> 00:54:20,242
When I need you, you can hear it though.
Sphere it now, you have work.

640
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,398
Sorry.

641
00:54:27,127 --> 00:54:28,879
Sorry.

642
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:48,360
Awesome!

643
00:54:58,167 --> 00:55:01,045
Franky wants to see you.
- That he 's appointment.

644
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:03,198
Franky, "an appointment?!

645
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:06,245
No, really, he wants to see you in the parking lot.
He expects you alone.

646
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:10,719
Alone is not a problem.
Marco, you and I have always been one.
Come on.

647
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,046
Franky is not stupid, he
can really count to 3.

648
00:55:16,207 --> 00:55:18,846
If we keep up with you, he will
immediately smell danger.

649
00:55:19,007 --> 00:55:20,998
Yes, that's true.

650
00:55:23,247 --> 00:55:25,124
Then I'll go alone.

651
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:34,677
Pipo your mate is coming
to find me today.

652
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:36,917
He wanted something
to show me a s.

653
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,637
No idea what it could be?

654
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:43,843
Pipo?
I got a vague idea
who that is ...

655
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,805
Take the piss out of me, Ace.

656
00:55:47,287 --> 00:55:49,039
He wanted to sell me pictures.

657
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:52,324
Only time he sold his talent.
Too much.

658
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:57,285
That I'm already said, but ...

659
00:55:58,167 --> 00:56:01,239
... Is simply Pipo Pipo.

660
00:56:01,407 --> 00:56:04,843
He must always exaggerate.

661
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:10,003
How much would you be willing
to pay for it here?

662
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:15,201
What do you do when two cops
of the drug brigade?

663
00:56:17,047 --> 00:56:20,403
Dt, the drug squad cops?
Pipo Why did I say anything?

664
00:56:20,567 --> 00:56:23,798
If I address you, he
will hear from me!

665
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,558
I will give you that pleasure.

666
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:30,003
Only I'm not sure he hears you.

667
00:56:35,087 --> 00:56:37,681
He asked me too, that
Brown could not go.

668
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:44,516
Step.
Tiago I'm sure some will
find the photos.

669
00:56:52,407 --> 00:56:54,443
You're right, Ace.
Together we n.

670
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:56,643
What have you done?!
- Why?

671
00:56:56,807 --> 00:56:59,037
We saw him up and threatened ...
Reflex!

672
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:02,085
Fucking-reflex!
Stop! Now you say nothing.

673
00:57:02,247 --> 00:57:04,363
I still get it on your shit!

674
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:07,564
What are we saying to Tiago if he ever
realizes that Franky is dead?

675
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:09,797
Hang on, Franky!

676
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:17,523
I think he is still
somewhat dead.

677
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:22,205
Do not stand there, call an ambulance,
police, somebody!

678
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:25,564
The cops?!
Are you sometimes overwrought?

679
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:29,163
Tiago and wants of his ears, he must first
show a corpse, but if one is not ...

680
00:57:33,127 --> 00:57:34,355
What?

681
00:57:35,847 --> 00:57:39,840
You do know 's where we can
to make it disappear?

682
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:44,646
If you have anything nodlg, my dogs and I are ready.
Gladlatoren, say I jel

683
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:49,878
Go ahead ...

684
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:51,998
Wait ...

685
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:57,402
In order ... Go ahead!

686
00:58:06,807 --> 00:58:10,482
Good idea of you.
Worse than piranhas,
which pit bulls.

687
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:13,559
You have to think about it!
What do you want?

688
00:58:22,527 --> 00:58:26,236
I do not understand, damn.
They have slept for days.

689
00:58:26,407 --> 00:58:28,159
I had them yet given
nothing to eat.

690
00:58:28,327 --> 00:58:32,002
If it can comfort you, you were no
better off dead pit bulls die.

691
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:36,001
They were eaten while still asleep.
They have not abandoned.

692
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:45,285
Damn, bastard, "one darn
flair you have.

693
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:48,803
You're the only one who gave Doggy
Bag losing all battles.

694
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:54,246
What's up, Tiago?

695
00:58:55,207 --> 00:58:57,562
How far are you with Wiltord?
Will he sign?

696
00:58:57,727 --> 00:59:01,561
No, there is no moving forward.
Besides, I got an idea that
you will surely like.

697
00:59:01,727 --> 00:59:02,762
You better.

698
00:59:02,927 --> 00:59:06,203
Oh, yes, have you seen Franky nowhere?
No one has of him hearing.

699
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:10,275
At the head of Sami
and Marco, I swear

700
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:12,915
I'm been a long time not seen.

701
00:59:13,087 --> 00:59:17,080
Every time I call, I
find his mailbox.

702
00:59:19,527 --> 00:59:22,360
Franky you insist.
He is like death.

703
00:59:22,527 --> 00:59:24,757
I mean, he likes to beg.

704
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:29,198
I call 'm.

705
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:44,637
Go ahead, Franky, well zol

706
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,197
Everyone Fri me.

Go ahead, Franky, well zol

708
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:33,404
Today, forget all DLE
undersized tubers.

709
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:35,558
There's only nNote
wlppen in life ...

710
01:00:35,727 --> 01:00:37,957
... There is also sex.

711
01:00:38,407 --> 01:00:40,716
I do not understand, Tiago, I'm
sure nothing in between.

712
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,926
Franky would never have let anyone
to steal his mobile phone.

713
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:55,520
Everybody sing!
Go ahead, Franky, well zol

714
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,757
I'm 5 minutes late, and then?

715
01:01:28,927 --> 01:01:31,077
The cargo of Colombian
arrived tonight.

716
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:33,602
And what did you come to info on the deal passed?
Zilch!

717
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:35,997
Our rebuff for your affairs,
you can dt.

718
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:39,477
You're worse than your brother!
You must keep the family
business is not running!

719
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:43,083
We just want to know when, where and
how the Colombian and mends meet.

720
01:01:43,247 --> 01:01:45,841
I can not help mends solves nothing!
- Pull out your plan.

721
01:01:46,007 --> 01:01:49,477
I would you guys' s busy to see.
At night popping
freaks on me ...

722
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:52,081
Day 3 ...
and I remain the boss bitches!

723
01:01:52,247 --> 01:01:54,238
Never knew such a hot damn!

724
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:58,525
They come into the room and without asking
me something, is it from dattum.

725
01:01:58,687 --> 01:02:01,247
Every 5 minutes!
'S Been here, my leg there ...

726
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:03,557
... Loezen in my face,
I still pretty off!

727
01:02:03,727 --> 01:02:06,400
Reason for leaving your
job to finish quickly.

728
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:09,957
Or your life will never be long
enough to sentence you to sit!

729
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,601
It'll never be long enough
for it to finish.

730
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:16,163
They make me, dammit!
My dick looks like 's tea bag!

731
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:34,880
So we have it again?
This time no mistakes.

732
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:38,960
If you ever whatever comes,
you come to me first.

733
01:02:39,447 --> 01:02:43,360
We put him just under pressure.
No more, no less.
Strike at the right place.

734
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,442
Sylvain!
What is it?
I can still say Sylvain?

735
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:51,801
Tiago is not?
- Oh, if I Tiago, n em.

736
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:54,037
We have reserved the entire bar.
Smart, huh?

737
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,995
If Tiago let me come to Arsenal to play ...
I stand by my decision.

738
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:01,239
Relax you still here!
On the field has yet to
play even in defense?

739
01:03:01,407 --> 01:03:04,126
So we're going to the
game's about it.

740
01:03:04,287 --> 01:03:06,357
My mind is, I do not
sign with Arsenal.

741
01:03:06,527 --> 01:03:09,246
You know what?
We keep a half-time,
and meanwhile

742
01:03:09,407 --> 01:03:12,922
read my assistant do it contract, so you
know exactly what you're missing.

743
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:17,806
Please do not bother, I'm
not going to Arsenal.

744
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,999
Lecture contract?

745
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:31,399
Do you drink anything?
- No, thanks.

746
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:34,286
Sami, would you do as background
's contract can read?

747
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:37,325
'N juice?
'N juice mandatory nowhere.

748
01:03:37,487 --> 01:03:39,717
Go ahead, 'n juice.

749
01:03:42,207 --> 01:03:45,643
Damn, the bastard!
He screwed up my knee!

750
01:03:47,687 --> 01:03:51,441
My season is soap!
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

751
01:03:51,607 --> 01:03:54,440
Just the way you wish, Ace:
hit on the best products!

752
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:57,724
I am far too hurt!
My knee! My leg is killing off!

753
01:03:57,887 --> 01:04:01,880
The contracts ...
and like an autograph for
my cousin, as it can.

754
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,117
I have pain!
- Kevin is his name.

755
01:04:04,287 --> 01:04:06,198
I'm not good!

756
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:10,883
What is it, Ace?
He had to sign it?

757
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:12,878
I am far too hurt! Hurry!

758
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:15,117
Why did he sign?

759
01:04:15,887 --> 01:04:18,196
To go to Arsenal.

760
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:23,120
Good.
And what was he doing
at Arsenal?

761
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:24,840
Football.

762
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:28,843
Exactly. And how do you play soccer?
- My knee! I'm not good!

763
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:30,918
With 's ball.

764
01:04:31,927 --> 01:04:33,519
And ...?

765
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,482
And, and, and?!
- And ...

766
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:40,638
And his feet, damn!
- But hey!

767
01:04:42,527 --> 01:04:45,837
The silly bastards!
- Is there been a
light burning?!

768
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,486
It was not me, but he!

769
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:50,525
I tell you now that Arsenal play
football with your hands?!

770
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,359
Call an ambulance, I can not!

771
01:04:52,527 --> 01:04:55,644
It's already, Sylvain!
Please! You only hear you yet!

772
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,116
We also have problems!
What do I say to Tiago?!

773
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:00,437
It will do nothing if they can
say 't find them again ...

774
01:05:00,607 --> 01:05:02,996
I have pain!
- Shut up!

775
01:05:04,887 --> 01:05:07,765
The pit bulls?
- No, we hide 'm.

776
01:05:07,927 --> 01:05:11,476
But yes, the pit bulls!
- Go outside, you!

777
01:05:11,647 --> 01:05:15,401
And this time I did not start.
Let it fall and help me.

778
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:21,526
Sylvain?
We will try to put
your leg, okay?

779
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:24,201
Anyway. Watch ... 1 ...

780
01:05:24,527 --> 01:05:26,279
... 2 ... 3!

781
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:30,281
And look!
'S state law! Look! Feel that?

782
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:41,766
Rule, Ace, or I bury you alive
under the turf of 't Vlodrome.

783
01:05:41,927 --> 01:05:44,646
Do not worry, we 're going
flavored dough suits.

784
01:05:46,647 --> 01:05:48,717
Beware of the bumps, damn!

785
01:05:48,887 --> 01:05:51,037
It's looks best stadium
in the world, beef.

786
01:05:51,207 --> 01:05:53,596
Say's that it is bumpy, and
I spoil your other knee.

787
01:05:53,767 --> 01:05:55,997
And smile, they keep
us in his sights.

788
01:05:57,047 --> 01:05:58,685
Look there ...

789
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:03,126
Thought about our proposal, gentlemen?
Are you ready for him to insure?

790
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:06,962
We are going into just about the premiums and M.
Wiltord is injured.

791
01:06:07,127 --> 01:06:10,403
Of course.
But look at him anyway.
Look how fast it goes.

792
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,683
Is not he in shape?

793
01:06:13,847 --> 01:06:16,520
Make him an ambassador of your group
and you win thousands of customers.

794
01:06:16,687 --> 01:06:18,837
Plus the impact on the shares
of uwmaatschappij.

795
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,077
I calculated that every
time he scores ...

796
01:06:21,247 --> 01:06:23,556
... At least 3% added value.

797
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:25,958
Sylvain And this year ...

798
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,916
... Accounted for 32 goals
during it season.

799
01:06:29,887 --> 01:06:32,685
I got a little review
about it years made.

800
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,204
If that is not nice of profits
is exponential!

801
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,323
Why does he really
rounds out there?

802
01:06:38,487 --> 01:06:40,523
You can not really say
that he trains.

803
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:48,315
If you write him wanted to see training,
you had to come at 6 am this morning.

804
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:50,955
Were you at 6 am already?
- Not this morning.

805
01:06:51,127 --> 01:06:52,446
What have we to do?

806
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:55,595
I will make it still but at explaining,
just for you two.

807
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:58,406
Sylvain plays its final
match tomorrow for OM.

808
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,202
And he has come to set up
lawn to soak, to feel it.

809
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:04,927
Yes, gentlemen, that's the
power of great champions.

810
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,647
And you know what?
You deserve him not.

811
01:07:07,807 --> 01:07:09,843
You deserve him not.
Come, M. Mends.

812
01:07:10,007 --> 01:07:12,316
Still waiting ...
- No! Come on.

813
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:14,159
I bale kloefkappers.

814
01:07:14,327 --> 01:07:17,239
What are you doing?
They were willing to sign.

815
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:19,159
Listen ...

816
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:25,477
With an eye to show a
rise in our premiums

817
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:29,481
We can 't discuss contract might again.
What do you think?

818
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:34,643
That depends.

819
01:07:35,287 --> 01:07:38,438
For roughly a broken leg ...

820
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:42,087
... To how high would you go
in terms of compensation?

821
01:07:46,607 --> 01:07:49,963
Good work.
You have your ticket to deal
with my Condor earned.

822
01:07:50,127 --> 01:07:51,560
The Condor? The Colombian?

823
01:07:51,727 --> 01:07:53,877
Because do you think the Russian
Condor sometimes sound like?

824
01:07:54,047 --> 01:07:58,279
We'll meet tomorrow in the Calao
to talk about business.

825
01:08:04,567 --> 01:08:06,478
Okay, guys, grab it back again!

826
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:22,884
Hey, Marco.
Stop the car here in the wash.

827
01:08:24,047 --> 01:08:25,480
Good, I get 'm.

828
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:33,878
Damn, he looks back acid!

829
01:08:34,047 --> 01:08:36,277
This morning he was so
paranoid as hell.

830
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:38,677
You had me see what he was
doing one of his glrls.

831
01:08:45,847 --> 01:08:48,361
Wait 's. Is that you?

832
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:51,405
Over there 's along.
- Why?

833
01:08:53,807 --> 01:08:57,322
Are you that or not? Look ...

834
01:08:57,647 --> 01:08:59,797
All right, calm down ...

835
01:09:00,127 --> 01:09:03,005
Still, you're "t. Look ...
- Damn, he wears' s micro!

836
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:05,727
I'm exposed! Come get me, quick!

837
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:10,998
Later, I ...

838
01:09:15,087 --> 01:09:16,486
Damn!

839
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:20,006
Go ahead, say!
Is everyone asleep sometimes?!

840
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:23,557
Sophie!
Nathalie!
Champagne!

841
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:26,402
Circle of Ace!

842
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:29,445
Where is everyone?!
I do not hear you!

843
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:32,405
Sphere it off, bitch!

844
01:09:55,247 --> 01:09:56,965
Come get me anyway, dammit!

845
01:09:57,127 --> 01:09:59,687
If we move, is it in there
to show a massacre.

846
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,964
What's he doing with his micro?!

847
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:18,197
Come get me, goddamn it!

848
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:44,401
Are you, Ace?
- Shut up!

849
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:17,244
Damn, I'm lost!

850
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:38,803
That's not nice.

851
01:11:49,407 --> 01:11:53,116
What are you doing?
Go get that little coat it into
the audience threw up.

852
01:11:53,287 --> 01:11:55,437
I'm sure he 's Micro said.

853
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:59,441
Yes, against two cops in their
car outside the Calao.

854
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,837
"Damn, I'm surrounded, they
are going to kill me."

855
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:04,646
You hit really gibberish, Tiago.

856
01:12:05,687 --> 01:12:08,997
Damn!
- What is that?
What have you got?

857
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:13,240
Dt? These are the girls.
Tiger collection.

858
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:17,604
Have you ever wondered if Franky
was not the sentinel?

859
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,998
Nothing in his jacket.
- Of course not!

860
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:25,876
You hit the ball completely wrong.
I have enough of jouwkutplannen.

861
01:12:26,407 --> 01:12:29,922
I got a business, babes that I must maintain.
I've needed dough.

862
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:33,842
Whether you light me on the Condor,
or you do not need me ...

863
01:12:35,207 --> 01:12:37,277
... And I ball it off.

864
01:12:44,967 --> 01:12:47,083
Let's go 'n drink.

865
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:49,841
The commitment is
50 million, guys.

866
01:12:50,207 --> 01:12:52,243
Tomorrow afternoon, in
't Htel the Castllle.

867
01:12:52,407 --> 01:12:55,205
10 million in cash, and the remaining
40 million via the Internet

868
01:12:55,367 --> 01:12:58,165
transferred to 's account of
the Condor Tiago passes.

869
01:12:58,327 --> 01:13:00,397
And the drugs?
- In 'n numbered container

870
01:13:00,567 --> 01:13:02,319
stored somewhere in 's dock.

871
01:13:04,487 --> 01:13:08,685
Once the 40 million paid, gets Tiago
's number one container dock.

872
01:13:08,847 --> 01:13:11,805
We take contact with you one
hour before the attack.

873
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:14,083
Why? What attack?

874
01:13:14,687 --> 01:13:17,724
I do not raid with you!

875
01:13:17,887 --> 01:13:21,562
'd Rather lick than 20 years
in my life to be dead!

876
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:23,922
Your shirt!
- No way! I did my part.

877
01:13:24,087 --> 01:13:26,726
I've had enough, I do not count.

878
01:13:28,207 --> 01:13:30,243
Driving, he agrees.
- Nothing attack!

879
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:33,118
Asshole!

880
01:13:33,687 --> 01:13:35,678
Hljo the puta!

881
01:13:36,647 --> 01:13:41,277
You can slap me all you want, mom ...
you simply let you fool.

882
01:13:41,447 --> 01:13:44,325
The person to whom you gave
barker, is the other.

883
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:47,638
The person to whom you give
the ball, me, Ace.

884
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:52,837
Cousins, come d'there.

885
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,998
When I phone up to 3 ..

886
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:07,998
... Grab this fri
all your cousins.

887
01:14:27,447 --> 01:14:28,721
Watch ...

888
01:14:32,207 --> 01:14:34,641
... 1 ... 2 ...

889
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:38,996
... 3!

890
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:55,123
Now honestly, Mom.
Test me with 'n false bench
demonstrates no respect.

891
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:57,039
Bitch I am!

892
01:14:57,207 --> 01:14:59,516
I had the other at
birth to drown!

893
01:14:59,687 --> 01:15:02,918
'S Are the acorns of those twin
brother cops got there.

894
01:15:03,087 --> 01:15:06,159
A plan that I had prepared for months.
Me death issue ...

895
01:15:06,327 --> 01:15:08,795
... And the money of the deal between
the Colombian and Tiago anyway.

896
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:12,676
Nobody could accuse me!
Neither the cops nor Tiago, nobody!
This is disgusting!

897
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:16,203
How many zeros are you in
this battle of yours?

898
01:15:16,487 --> 01:15:18,762
500,000 ... not much.

899
01:15:21,887 --> 01:15:24,321
But if you help me, is it
60 for 40 for me and you.

900
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:27,160
No. 50-50.

901
01:15:27,327 --> 01:15:28,806
All right.

902
01:15:28,967 --> 01:15:31,003
And if you bepikt me, I pop you.

903
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:33,601
You know me, mom ...

904
01:15:34,127 --> 01:15:36,038
Very reason ...

905
01:15:57,247 --> 01:15:58,680
Excellent.

906
01:16:00,727 --> 01:16:03,525
That was the Condor.
He is about 'half an hour.

907
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:05,484
Ace, go to Carlos.

908
01:16:05,647 --> 01:16:09,276
Once Condor give me the numbers,
you come with the cash down.

909
01:16:09,647 --> 01:16:13,083
You and Carlos are not already down.
Clear?

910
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:16,406
You stay here.

911
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:40,887
Let 's look at the car parks.

912
01:16:48,007 --> 01:16:50,157
Carlos, I'll send you Ace.

913
01:16:52,727 --> 01:16:54,877
It's Ace.

914
01:16:56,887 --> 01:16:59,924
Already?
- Now Ace is back already.

915
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:03,124
Hey, you there ...
- Where?

916
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:05,198
There!

917
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:25,117
'm On the floor.

918
01:17:36,847 --> 01:17:38,599
It's Ace.

919
01:18:14,647 --> 01:18:17,844
Now we can talk.
- And the provision, barker?

920
01:18:18,007 --> 01:18:22,000
Do not panic, I take care of everything.
I crawl back into my old skin.

921
01:18:23,087 --> 01:18:25,806
Funny.
Whenever I asked
for your mug ...

922
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:28,959
... I saw it said.
- Did you think it's just me?

923
01:18:29,127 --> 01:18:30,799
Me? All day.

924
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:35,037
Every morning I had it
with meetje about you.

925
01:18:35,207 --> 01:18:38,005
Then I asked, 'r: Why have you denied me my brother?
"

926
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:40,397
With each birthday I
blrde as a child.

927
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:42,876
All those moments that
we missed it:

928
01:18:43,047 --> 01:18:45,561
first whore, first fart ...

929
01:18:45,727 --> 01:18:49,276
... First robbery. Damn,
I'll never forget her.

930
01:18:49,447 --> 01:18:51,836
It's quite all right, Ace ...

931
01:18:52,007 --> 01:18:54,805
Yes, I'm glad to have.

932
01:18:55,887 --> 01:18:57,843
Now we are with tween, huh?

933
01:18:58,007 --> 01:19:01,966
Tell me, why are you gone?
- I? Why?

934
01:19:02,727 --> 01:19:05,639
To take a breath.
With those two maniacs
from cops ...

935
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:09,356
... Plus I got the paranoia
of Mends not breathe.

936
01:19:09,527 --> 01:19:11,165
So I held my own death.

937
01:19:11,327 --> 01:19:13,283
I Jatte a car, drove
to the morgue ...

938
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:17,406
... Grab 'n dead with it, brought them together and hop!
The fk it.

939
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:20,476
What I wanted to know ...
Have you whores my birding?

940
01:19:20,647 --> 01:19:22,524
Who, me?! Are you crazy?!

941
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:24,882
Never would I call something
my own brother.

942
01:19:25,047 --> 01:19:27,402
Because I would not have done.

943
01:19:27,567 --> 01:19:30,127
Did you do it?
- No! No ...

944
01:19:30,647 --> 01:19:32,558
Surely not.

945
01:19:33,927 --> 01:19:35,758
Come ...

946
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:52,437
Fucking bag!

947
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,317
What have you done with Carlos?

948
01:19:55,487 --> 01:19:58,604
Dt, brother, you go 'a few
minutes to explain ...

949
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:00,519
... He added.

950
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:02,837
But remember, it will 't like.

951
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,202
Why?
- I summarize here together.

952
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,801

And dt is just for fun.

955
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:16,520
Mends makes you decide to side.
And he'll love me already,

956
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:20,362
and I'm dead, you die two times,
which is rare, brother!

957
01:20:20,847 --> 01:20:23,407

With me.
Linke lot.
Carlos has doubts about the men

960
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:55,076
Get them out of there fri they have

961
01:20:57,767 --> 01:21:00,964
Eeneden 5 and 6, clear

962
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,798
Damn ...

01:21:21,887 --> 01:21:25,084
Are you heading to?
- No.

964
01:21:26,207 --> 01:21:28,084
Give me Carlos.

965
01:21:28,247 --> 01:21:30,124
That is just a piss.

966
01:21:30,287 --> 01:21:32,482
What's wrong?
Sometimes there's problem?

967
01:21:32,647 --> 01:21:34,638
No, everything is fine.

968
01:21:35,047 --> 01:21:37,436
Yes, the money is here.

969
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:40,687
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

970
01:21:42,847 --> 01:21:47,045
Nothing wrong, Tiago.
It's just can not view all
the dough that takes me.

971
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:53,916
Tiago, you come up best.

972
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:12,204
Ace, what are you doing here?
Should not you wait up?

973
01:22:12,367 --> 01:22:14,278
And should you not
keep your head?

974
01:22:14,447 --> 01:22:17,120
I'm gonna put my bag in the car Fri I go to Carlos.
Anything?

975
01:22:17,287 --> 01:22:20,324
No sense of orientation, huh?
The car is over.

976
01:22:20,487 --> 01:22:22,239
No, down. Let's walk with you.

977
01:22:22,407 --> 01:22:24,159
I just got to pull my plan.

978
01:22:24,327 --> 01:22:28,036
Your brain from year to year to see softening ...

979
01:22:28,847 --> 01:22:31,077

980
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:34,284
We go better apart.
- Young Whore!

981
01:22:35,967 --> 01:22:40,040
The whore is you got a third eye deliver,
and that will be ugly ...

982
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:46,035
Nor have you stir up, bastard!

983
01:22:46,727 --> 01:22:48,957
Godverdomse and put
your bag down!

984
01:22:49,967 --> 01:22:52,037
I'm still your son, Mama.

985
01:22:52,287 --> 01:22:55,324
Therefore I know whom
you have your parts!

986
01:22:57,127 --> 01:22:59,197
Make the bag open.

987
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:01,837
Can I?
- Please ...

988
01:23:15,127 --> 01:23:17,516
'S Battle of 500,000, huh?

989
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:22,406
I was sure you took me in
the asshole, bastard!

990
01:23:22,647 --> 01:23:26,845
Would you kill those two idiots, but
so we can talk quietly among family?

991
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:29,760
I have here the barker,
I am here the talking!

992
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:32,845
And if you even show a lobe
moves, I shoot you down.

993
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:36,443
For the first and last time,
Ace: Where's the dough?

994
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:40,205
If I get an explanation,
you will not believe me.

995
01:23:40,527 --> 01:23:42,563
Carlos, death m.

996
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:48,804
We have solid Ace.
The Squib wanted to run
away with the loot ...

997
01:23:48,967 --> 01:23:53,279
The only one who currently is holding Ace,
Carlos, and they are here fri me!

998
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:57,122
Bring him up so we can arrange

999
01:23:57,287 --> 01:24:00,484
'T lie somewhat complicated.
I would rather that

1000
01:24:09,527 --> 01:24:14,317
Geef'm some air.
Apparently he has me now in the
parking lot at her fuck.

1001
01:24:27,847 --> 01:24:32,045
Ace?
What do you do with
barkers on you?

1002
01:24:36,087 --> 01:24:38,476
That is rotzakje of 's

1003
01:24:38,647 --> 01:24:41,366
A bank clerk that the cops want
to take you and the Condor.

He's playing for

1005
01:24:44,047 --> 01:24:47,483
Oh, yeah?
Why do you have the
bag of money?

1006
01:24:48,127 --> 01:24:51,278
And a micro-piercing
through the nipple?

1007
01:24:51,567 --> 01:24:55,401
For one time I was not out of my dick neck!
Here he chats anything!

1008
01:24:55,567 --> 01:24:57,398
I'm Ace, goddamn it!

1011
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:07,125
Angel, help 'm.

1012
01:25:19,727 --> 01:25:23,720
I still get it from you shit, twins!
Vade retro!

1013
01:26:12,887 --> 01:26:14,957
He's off with the loot.

1014
01:26:15,127 --> 01:26:17,243
He was too quick for us all.

1015
01:26:17,807 --> 01:26:19,798
"He". But who?

1016
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:36,283
2 weeks later

1017
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:44,158
Damn, still ...

1018
01:26:46,007 --> 01:26:48,237
We have the codes from the
account of mends broken.

1019
01:26:48,407 --> 01:26:51,604
We can transfer 40 million.
- On what account?

1020
01:26:51,767 --> 01:26:54,486
He is the man of the profession.
- I have four accounts:

1021
01:26:54,647 --> 01:26:57,605
Luxembourg, Malta, the Bahamas
and the Cayman Islands.

1022
01:26:58,167 --> 01:27:00,397
You have put them firmly
to shit, brother.

1023
01:27:00,567 --> 01:27:02,159
Beautiful bastard you are.

1024
01:27:02,327 --> 01:27:05,956
You have cheated them all:
the cops, Mends, everyone!

1025
01:27:06,127 --> 01:27:08,402
You know what he said because I'm
the man suggested 5 million?

1026
01:27:08,567 --> 01:27:11,877
Yes!
"50 million under two is
better!" We know 't.

1027
01:27:12,047 --> 01:27:14,117
Well, I have it all 's said.

1028
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:18,401
But when you imagined you a bullet
in the arm to shoot ...

1029
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:20,637
... Then I took you
really seriously.

1030
01:27:22,127 --> 01:27:24,402
Seriously, but also very stupid.

1031
01:27:24,567 --> 01:27:26,364
Why else are we brothers?

1032
01:27:26,527 --> 01:27:29,883
Next time we'll arrange it back
to that golden oldie ticket.

1033
01:27:33,447 --> 01:27:36,041
Forget it, you're no chance.

1034
01:27:37,447 --> 01:27:39,483
Look what I got.

1035
01:27:41,127 --> 01:27:44,517
Whoever it can pick, picks
it part of the Other.

1036
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:49,276
Go ahead, brother, you
will be humiliated.

1037
01:27:51,367 --> 01:27:53,676
Suit yourself, my likeness.

1038
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:59,797
Can you count to three, Luna?

1039
01:28:03,647 --> 01:28:05,842
Go ahead. And ...

1040
01:28:06,527 --> 01:28:09,246
... Two ... three!

1041
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:14,320
