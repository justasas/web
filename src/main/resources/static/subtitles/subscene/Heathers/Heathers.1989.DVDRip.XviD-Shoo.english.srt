00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,079
# When I was just a little girl

2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,314
# I asked my mother, what will I be?

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,994
# Will I be pretty?

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,514
# Will I be rich?

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,912
# Here's what she said to me

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,118
# Que será, será

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,672
# Whatever will be, will be

8
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,073
# The future's not ours to see

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,038
# Que será, será

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,755
# What will be, will be

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,069
# When I was just a child in school

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,235
# I asked my teacher, what should I try?

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,118
# Should I paint pictures?

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,794
# Should I sing songs?

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,839
# This was her wise reply

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,152
# Que será, será

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,189
# Whatever will be, will be

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,195
# The future's not ours to see

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,432
# Que será, será

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,356
# What will be, will be... #

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,631
Damn.

22
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,676
It's your turn, Heather.

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,312
No, Heather. It's Heather's turn.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,356
Heather.

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,352
Sorry, Heather.

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,116
# Que será, será

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,558
# Whatever will be, will be

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,270
# The future's not ours to see

29
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,195
# Que será, será

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,274
# What will be, will be

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,710
# Que será, será #

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,831
Dear diary...

33
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,708
'Heather told me
she teaches people real life.

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,270
'She said real life sucks losers dry.

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,070
'If you want to fuck with the eagles,
you have to learn to fly.

36
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,358
'I said, "So, you teach people
to spread their wings and fly?"

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,351
'She said, "Yes."

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,874
'I said, "You're beautiful..."'

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,474
God, come on, Veronica.

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,551
What is your damage, Heather?

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,437
Don't blame me, blame Heather.

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,273
She told me to haul your ass
into the caff pronto.

43
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,588
Back me up, Heather.

44
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,638
She really wants to talk to you, Veronica.

45
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,917
OK, I'm going. Jesus Christ.

46
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,271
Hello, Heather.

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,351
Veronica. Finally.

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,113
I got a note of Kurt Kelly's.

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,113
I need you to forge a hot and horny
but realistic note in Kurt's handwriting.

50
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,873
We'll slip it onto
Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,952
I don't have anything
against Martha Dunnstock.

52
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,110
You don't have anything for her.

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,350
Come on. It'll be very.

54
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,752
The note will give her shower nozzle
masturbation material for weeks.

55
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,520
I'll think about it.

56
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,566
Don't think.

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,757
Veronica needs something to write on.
Bend over.

58
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,672
Dear Martha, you're so sweet...

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,433
I'm telling you, man, it'd so be righteous

60
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,956
to be in a Veronica Sawyer -
Heather Chandler sandwich.

61
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,871
Hell, yes.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,112
I want to put a Heather on my johnson
and spin her around like a pinwheel.

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,679
Punch it in.

64
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,078
Westerburg feeds the world.
Come on, people.

65
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,755
Give that leftover lunch money
to people who don't have lunches.

66
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,400
God, aren't they fed yet?

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,313
Do they even have thanksgiving in Africa?

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,915
Oh, sure. Pilgrims, Indians, Tater Tots.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,911
It's a real party continent.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,230
Sawyer, guess what today is.

71
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,118
Ouch. Lunch-time poll?
What's the question?

72
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,634
Yeah, what's the question, Heather?

73
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,599
God, you were with me in study hall
when I thought of it.

74
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,194
I forgot.

75
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,840
Such a pillowcase.

76
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,556
It's not that bizarro thing you were babbling
about over the phone last night, is it?

77
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,278
Of course it is.

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,879
I told Dennis if he gives me another
political topic, I'd spew burrito chunks.

79
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,192
Oh, Veronica, I'm sorry.

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,998
Betty Finn. Gosh.

81
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,595
I'm sorry I couldn't go
to your birthday party last month.

82
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,592
It's OK. Your mom said you had a big date.

83
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,638
I'd probably miss my own birthday for a date.

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,676
Don't say that.

85
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,834
I was looking around the other day
and I dug up these old photographs.

86
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,316
Oh. They're great.

87
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,436
Come on, Veronica.

88
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,636
I was talking to somebody.

89
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,510
Great. Here comes Heather.

90
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,830
Oh, shit.

91
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,151
- Hi, Courtney. Love your cardigan.
- Thanks.

92
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,196
I got it last night at The Limited.

93
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,795
Like, totally blew my allowance.

94
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,317
Check this out. You win $5 million
from the Publisher Sweepstakes

95
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,039
and the same day
the guy gives you the cheque,

96
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,070
aliens land on the earth and say they'll blow
up the world in two days. What do you do?

97
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,752
That's easy.

98
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,389
I'd just slide that wad over to my father

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,438
because he's one of the state's top brokers.

100
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,308
If I got that money,
I'd give it all to the homeless.

101
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,038
Every cent.

102
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,076
You're beautiful.

103
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,994
If you're going to openly be a bitch...

104
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,072
Why can't we talk to
kinds of different people?

105
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,948
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw.
Do I look like Mother Teresa?

106
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,669
If I did, I probably wouldn't mind
talking to the geek squad.

107
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,914
Did see that? Heather number one
just looked right at me.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,913
Does it not bother you that
everybody thinks you're a piranha?

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,956
Like I give a shit.

110
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,873
They all want me as a friend or a fuck.

111
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,236
I'm worshiped at Westerburg
and I'm only a junior.

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,755
I can't believe this, we're going to a party
at Remington University tonight

113
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,960
and we're brushing up on our conversational
skills with the scum of the school.

114
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,189
Hi.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,399
Hi.

116
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,597
So this is what's called a lunch-time poll.

117
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,717
You win $5 million
in the Publisher Sweepstakes

118
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,598
and the same day whatshisface
gives you the cheque

119
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,477
aliens land on earth

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,312
and say they'll blow up the world
in two days.

121
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,960
What are you going to do with the money?

122
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,598
I'd go to Egypt.

123
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,238
With a girl.

124
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,756
I'd use the money for
an end-of-the-world get-together.

125
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,559
I'd pay Madonna a million bucks
to sit on my face

126
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,596
and ride like the Kentucky Derby.

127
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,831
That's the most spooky-assed question
I ever heard.

128
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,718
After taxes, I'll only be getting...

129
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,597
She should pay me, though.

130
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,435
You go to the zoo and get a lion and
put a remote control bomb up its butt...

131
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,193
Then there's social security, legal fees...

132
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,319
Push the button on the bomb
and you and the lion die like one.

133
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,590
What?

134
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,277
Oh, my God. Here we go.

135
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,392
Oh, my God.

136
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,436
Hi, Veronica.
Five keeps an infant alive.

137
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,830
You wanted to be a member of
the most powerful clique in school.

138
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,515
If I wasn't already the head of it,
I'd want the same thing.

139
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,716
Come on, Veronica.

140
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,995
You used to have a sense of humour.

141
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,629
Veronica, could you
come back here a minute?

142
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,995
A true friend's work is never done.

143
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,389
- Gross.
- Gross.

144
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,916
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia is so '87.

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,595
- Maybe you should see a doctor.
- Yeah, maybe.

146
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,753
Come on, Heather,
let's take another look at today's lunch.

147
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,393
God, Veronica, drool much?

148
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,550
His name's Jason Dean.

149
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,596
He's in my American History.

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,956
Hello, Jason Dean.

151
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,157
Greetings and salutations.

152
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,356
Are you a Heather?

153
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,509
No.

154
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm a Veronica. Sawyer.

155
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,352
This may seem like
a really stupid question...

156
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,635
There are no stupid questions.

157
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,639
You inherit $5 million.
The same day aliens land on the earth

158
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,554
and say they're going to blow it up
in two days. What do you do?

159
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,232
That's the stupidest question
I've ever heard.

160
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,790
Who's that guy in the coat
think he is anyways?

161
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,552
Bo Diddley?

162
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,074
Veronica's into his act, no doubt.

163
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,197
I don't know. Probably row out
to the middle of a lake,

164
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,748
bring along a bottle of tequila,

165
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,912
my sax and some Bach.

166
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,993
How very.

167
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,436
Come on, Veronica.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,194
Later.

169
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,236
Definitely.

170
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,431
Let's kick his ass.

171
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,556
Shit, Ram, we're seniors, man.

172
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,074
We're too old for kind of that kind of crap.

173
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,515
Let's give him a good scare, though.

174
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,232
You going to eat this?

175
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,552
What did your boyfriend say when you told
him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?

176
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,790
Answer him, dick.

177
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,237
Hey, Ram, doesn't this cafeteria
have a "no fags allowed" rule?

178
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,996
They seem to have an open-door policy
for assholes, though, don't they?

179
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,631
What did you say, dickhead?

180
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,188
I'll repeat myself.

181
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,792
They won't expel him, they'll just
suspend him for a week or something.

182
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,953
He used a real gun.
They should throw his ass in jail.

183
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,600
No way. He used blanks.

184
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,195
All JD really did was ruin two pairs of pants.

185
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,236
Maybe not even that.

186
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,595
Can you bleach out urine stains?

187
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,800
You seem pretty amused. I thought
you had given up on high school guys.

188
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,871
Never say never.

189
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,390
What are you going to do, Heather?

190
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,756
Take the two shots or send me out?

191
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,715
Did you have a brain tumour for breakfast?

192
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,519
First you ask if you can be red,

193
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,716
knowing that I'm always red.

194
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,548
Shit.

195
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,031
It's your turn, Heather.

196
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,516
Easy shot, Heather.

197
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,716
No way, no day.

198
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,473
Give it up, girl.

199
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,675
- Holy shit.
- Incredible!

200
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,637
Whoo!

201
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,111
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?

202
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,395
I'm giving Veronica her shot,

203
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,789
her first Remington party.

204
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,950
You blow it tonight, girl,

205
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
and it's keggers with kids all next year.

206
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,559
Why?

207
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,629
Why not?

208
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,032
Heather, your mother's here.

209
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,350
Come on, whoever wants a ride.

210
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,873
- Bye. Thank you.
- Bye-bye, girls.

211
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,793
Hey, take a break, Veronica. Sit down.

212
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,516
So what was the first week
of spring vacation withdrawal like?

213
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,556
I don't know. It was OK, I guess.

214
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,518
Hey, kid, isn't the prom coming up?

215
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,238
I guess.

216
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,390
Any contestants worth mentioning?

217
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,038
Maybe.

218
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,396
There's kind of
a dark horse in the running.

219
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,876
God, will somebody tell me
why I read these spy novels?

220
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,269
Because you're an idiot.

221
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,715
Oh, yeah, that's it.

222
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,109
You two...

223
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,035
Great pâté, but I gotta motor
if I want to be ready for that party tonight.

224
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,072
Corn nuts!

225
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,479
BQ or plain?

226
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,312
BQ!

227
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,117
You're going to pull a super-chug with that?

228
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,398
No, but if you're nice,
I'll let you buy me a slushie.

229
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,393
I see you know
your convenience-speak pretty well.

230
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,473
Yeah, well, I've been
moved around all my life.

231
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,394
Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas...

232
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,596
Sherwood, Ohio.

233
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,558
There's always been
a Snappy Snack Shack.

234
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,112
Any town, any time, pop a ham and cheese
in the microwave and feast on a turbo-dog.

235
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,991
Keeps me sane.

236
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,752
Really?

237
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,952
That thing you pulled in the caff today
was pretty severe.

238
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,238
Yeah, well, the extreme
always seems to make an impression.

239
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,270
Did you say a cherry or Coke slushie?

240
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,670
I didn't. Cherry.

241
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,238
Great bike.

242
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,996
Yeah. Just a humble perk
from my dad's construction company.

243
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,832
Seen the commercial, right?

244
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,957
"Bringing every state to a higher state."

245
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,996
Wait a minute. Jason Dean.

246
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,640
Your pop's Big Bud Dean Construction?

247
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,837
It must be rough moving place to place.

248
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,799
Everybody's life has got static.
Is your life perfect?

249
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,872
Yeah. I'm going to
a Remington University party.

250
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,357
No, my life's not perfect.

251
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,476
I don't really like my friends.

252
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,348
Yeah, uh, I don't really like
your friends, either.

253
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,756
Well, it's just like they're people I work with

254
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,912
and our job is being popular and shit.

255
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,913
Maybe it's time to take a vacation.

256
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,115
Hello, ladies.
Throw your coats on the floor.

257
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,111
Veronica, this is Brad.

258
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,599
Excellent.

259
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,877
Did you girls bring
your partying slippers?

260
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,872
- Let's party.
- She loves to party.

261
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,359
'Dear diary, I want to kill,

262
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,637
'and it's for more than just selfish reasons.

263
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,473
'More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle.

264
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,391
'You have to believe me.'

265
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,837
It's so great to talk to a girl
and not have to ask "what's your major?"

266
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,876
I hate that.

267
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,389
So, when you go to college,

268
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,153
what subjects do you think you'll study?

269
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,037
Come on, David.
Shouldn't we get back to the party?

270
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,758
We will.

271
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,718
It's just you're so hot tonight.

272
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,756
I can't control myself.

273
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,676
'I can't explain it but
I'm allowed an understanding

274
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,356
'that my parents and these
Remington assholes have chosen to ignore.

275
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,908
'I understand that I must stop Heather.'

276
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,835
How's my little cheerleader, huh?

277
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,680
Oh, I know everyone
at your high school isn't so uptight.

278
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,718
- Come on.
- I don't feel so good, OK?

279
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,712
Let's do it on the coats.
It'll be excellent, huh?

280
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,189
I have a prepared speech I tell my suitor

281
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,999
when he wants more
than I'd like to give him.

282
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,957
Gee, blank, I had a really nice...

283
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,508
Save the speeches for Malcolm X.

284
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,836
I just want to get laid.

285
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,074
You don't deserve my fucking speech.

286
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,159
'Betty Finn was a true friend
and I sold her out

287
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,073
'for a bunch of Swatchdogs
and Diet Cokeheads.

288
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,835
'Killing Heather would be like offing
the Wicked Witch of the West.

289
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,117
'Wait, East. West!
I sound like a fucking psycho.'

290
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,795
What's your damage?
Brad says you're being a cooze.

291
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,759
I feel really sick, like I'm gonna throw up.
Can we please jam now?

292
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,592
No. Hell, no.

293
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,156
'Tomorrow I'll be kissing
her aerobicised ass

294
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,869
'but tonight let me dream of
a world without Heather,

295
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,076
'a world where I am free.'

296
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,070
You stupid fuck.

297
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,549
You goddamn bitch.

298
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,270
You were nothing before you met me.
You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn.

299
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,830
You were a Bluebird, you were a Brownie,

300
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,559
you were a Girl Scout Cookie.

301
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,279
I got you into a Remington party.

302
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,069
What's my thanks?
It's on the hallway carpet.

303
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,957
I got paid in puke.

304
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,350
Lick it up, baby. Lick it up.

305
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,030
Monday morning you're history.

306
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,350
I'll tell everyone about tonight.

307
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,716
Transfer to Washington,
transfer to Jefferson,

308
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,316
no one at Westerburg's gonna let you
play their reindeer games.

309
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,952
Dreadful etiquette. I apologise.

310
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,552
That's OK.

311
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,879
I saw the croquet set up in the back.
You up for a match?

312
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,109
I thank you.

313
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,557
That was my first game of strip croquet.

314
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,631
You're welcome.

315
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,429
It's a lot more interesting
than just flinging off your clothes

316
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,080
and boning away
on a neighbour's swing set.

317
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,628
There's lots to be said for throwing off...

318
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,876
What a night.

319
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,791
What a life.

320
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,395
They wanted to move me
into high school out of the sixth grade

321
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,313
because I was supposed to be
this big genius.

322
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,391
Then we decided to chuck the idea

323
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,268
because I'd have trouble
making friends, blah, blah, blah.

324
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,396
Now blah, blah, blah is all I do.

325
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,472
I use my grand IQ
to decide what colour gloss to wear

326
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,438
and how to hit three keggers before curfew.

327
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,559
Heather Chandler is one bitch
that deserves to die.

328
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,915
Killing her won't solve anything.

329
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,711
I say we just grow up, be adults and die.

330
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,431
But before that...

331
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,876
I'd love to see Heather Chandler
puke her guts out.

332
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,474
Trust me, she skips
the Saturday morning trip to grandma's

333
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,516
even when she's not hung over.

334
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,276
We'll just concoct ourselves
a little hangover cure

335
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,989
that'll induce her to spew
red, white and blue, then.

336
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,838
What about milk and orange juice?
What's the up-chuck factor on that?

337
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,310
I'm a no-rust-build-up man, myself.

338
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,356
Don't be a dick.

339
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,317
That stuff will kill her.

340
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,236
I know, we can cook up some soup
and put it in a Coke.

341
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,071
That's pretty sick, eh?

342
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,470
Should it be chicken noodle
or bean with bacon?

343
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,075
Put a lid on that stuff.
I say we go with big blue here.

344
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,878
What are you talking about?

345
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,875
She would never drink anything
that looked like that, anyway.

346
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,157
So we'll... put it in this.

347
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,879
She won't be able to see
what she's drinking.

348
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,916
Let me get a cup, jerk.

349
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,837
OK.

350
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,798
Milk and orange juice.

351
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,317
Maybe we could, like, cough up
a phlegm globber in it or something.

352
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,315
- No?
- Nothing.

353
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,359
Oh, well. Milk and orange juice
will do quite nicely.

354
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,590
You're chicken.

355
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,636
You're not funny.

356
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,752
I'm sorry.

357
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,879
- Uh, Veronica?
- What?

358
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,033
Uh, never mind. I'll, er, carry the cup.

359
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,550
Morning, Heather.

360
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,239
Veronica... and Jesse James.

361
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,675
Quelle surprise.

362
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,957
Hear about Veronica's
affection for regurgitation?

363
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,237
Last night we both
said things we didn't mean.

364
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,038
Did we?

365
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,951
How did you get in?

366
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,999
Um... Veronica knew
you'd have a hangover

367
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,548
so, uh, I whipped this up for you.

368
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,392
It's a family recipe.

369
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,710
What, you put a phlegm globber in it?

370
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,758
I'm not going to drink that piss.

371
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,400
I knew this stuff'd be too intense for her.

372
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,429
Intense.

373
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,238
Grow up.

374
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,518
You think I'll drink it
just because you call me chicken?

375
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,631
Just give me the cup, jerk.

376
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,516
Corn nuts.

377
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,396
Oh, my God.

378
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,914
I can't believe it.

379
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,956
I just killed my best friend.

380
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,917
And your worst enemy.

381
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,956
Same difference.

382
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,551
Ohh...

383
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,835
What are we going to tell the cops?

384
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,960
"Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."

385
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,508
Cops.

386
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,592
I can't believe this is my life.

387
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,274
Oh, my God.

388
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,874
I'm going to have to send
my SAT scores

389
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,349
to San Quentin instead of Stanford.

390
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,679
All right, just a little freaked, here.

391
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,799
At least you got what you wanted.

392
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,757
Got what I wanted?

393
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,752
It's one thing to want
somebody out of your life,

394
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,118
it's another thing to serve them
a wake-up cup full of liquid drainer.

395
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,869
All right, we did a murder
and that's a crime,

396
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,751
but if this were like
a suicide thing, you know?

397
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,198
Like a suicide thing?

398
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,555
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,553
You can do Heather's handwriting
as well as your own, right?

400
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,312
Right?

401
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,074
- Yeah.
- All right.

402
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,873
You might think what I've done is shocking?

403
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,154
Yeah.

404
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,880
Um...

405
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,032
to me, though,
suicide is the natural answer

406
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,669
to the myriad of problems
life has given me.

407
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,991
That's good but Heather
would never use the word myriad.

408
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,389
This is the last thing she'll ever write,

409
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,392
she'll want to use
as many 50-cent words as possible.

410
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,438
She missed myriad
on the vocab test two weeks ago.

411
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,556
That only proves my point more.

412
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,712
The word is a badge
for her failures at school.

413
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,837
Oh. OK, you're probably right.

414
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,595
People think just because
you're beautiful and popular,

415
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,070
life is easy and fun.

416
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,390
- Yeah.
- Uh...

417
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,237
no one understood I had feelings too.

418
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,152
I die knowing no one knew the real me.

419
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,030
That's good.

420
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,076
Have you done this before?

421
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,357
Any other principal
would take the same position -

422
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,476
keep things business as usual.

423
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,120
Heather Chandler's
not your everyday suicide.

424
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,715
- She was very popular.
- If I let these kids out before lunch,

425
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,837
the switchboard would light up
like a Christmas tree.

426
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,597
I was impressed that she made proper use
of the word myriad in her suicide note.

427
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,911
I find it profoundly disturbing

428
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,356
that we're told of
the tragic destruction of youth

429
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,318
and all we can think to talk about

430
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,790
is adequate mourning times
and misused vocabulary words.

431
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,677
Oh, Christ!

432
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,911
We must revel in this revealing moment.

433
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,709
Look, I suggest that
we get everybody together,

434
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,792
both students and teachers, in the cafeteria

435
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,839
and just talk and feel...

436
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,592
together.

437
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,990
Thank you, Ms Fleming.
You call me when the shuttle lands.

438
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,548
Now, is this Heather the cheerleader?

439
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,279
That would be Heather McNamara.

440
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,353
Damn. I'd be willing to go half a day
for a cheerleader.

441
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,752
God, it's unfair. It's just so unfair.

442
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,912
We should get off a whole week,
not just an hour.

443
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,718
Write the school board.

444
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,519
Watch it, you might be digesting food.

445
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,478
- Yeah, where is your urge to purge?
- Fuck it.

446
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,312
Look...

447
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,031
Heather left behind one of her Swatches.

448
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,680
She'd want you to have it, Veronica.

449
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,470
She always said
you couldn't accessorise for shit.

450
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,630
Sorry to hear about your friend.

451
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,439
I thought she was your usual airhead bitch.

452
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,431
Guess I was wrong.

453
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,476
We all were.

454
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,717
What a waste.

455
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,836
Oh, the humanity.

456
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,632
Veronica?

457
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,439
Veronica, what are you doing?

458
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,870
I'm just so thrilled...
to finally have an example

459
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,873
of the profound sensitivity of
which a human animal is capable.

460
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,555
That example is Heather Chandler.

461
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,312
I have her note.

462
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,550
Whoo!

463
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,438
I'm gonna pass this note around the class

464
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,910
so you can all feel
its pathetic beauty for yourself.

465
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,996
And while we do this,

466
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,516
I think it's a good opportunity to share...

467
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,434
the feelings that this suicide
has spurred in all of us.

468
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,239
Now, who would like to begin?

469
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,276
I heard it was really gnarly.

470
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,114
She sucked down a bowl of
multi-purpose deodorising disinfectant

471
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,838
and then smash!

472
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,596
Tracy, let's not rehash the coroner's report,
let's talk emotions.

473
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,115
Um, Heather and I used to go out

474
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,270
but she said I was boring.

475
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,238
But now I realise I really wasn't boring...

476
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,039
it's just that she was
dissatisfied with her life.

477
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,995
That's... very good, Peter.

478
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,390
Are we going to be tested on this?

479
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,436
'We were the same size

480
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,559
'so we could borrow
each other's clothes, mix it up. It was fun.'

481
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,997
"I remember I won her
a rhino at the 4-H Club... '

482
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,469
You're an asshole. Mute him.

483
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,110
- 'We liked the same clothes... '
- How many networks did you run to?

484
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,430
'It won't be the same without her.'

485
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,717
What are you talking about?
You hated her. She hated you.

486
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,110
'Every English class
I looked forward to seeing her... '

487
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,431
Heather Chandler
is more popular than ever now.

488
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,598
- Scary stuff.
- Yeah.

489
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,795
Hey, son, I didn't hear you come in.

490
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,509
Hey, Dad, how was work today?

491
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,713
It was miserable.
Some damn tribe of withered old bitches

492
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,997
doesn't want us to terminate
that fleabag hotel.

493
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,471
All because Glen Miller and his band
once took a shit there.

494
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,757
Just like Kansas.
You remember fucking Kansas?

495
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,274
That was the one with the wheat, right?

496
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,148
Yeah. Save the Memorial Oak Tree Society.

497
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,629
Showed those fucks.

498
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,759
30 of those 4th of July fireworks
attached to the trunk.

499
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,796
Arraigned but acquitted.

500
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,476
Gosh, Pop,
I almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend.

501
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,471
Oh. Veronica, this is my dad.

502
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,516
Dad, Veronica.

503
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,749
Hi.

504
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,433
Son, why don't you ask
your little friend to stay for dinner?

505
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,115
I can't. My mom's making
my favourite meal tonight -

506
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,555
spaghetti, lots of oregano.

507
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,278
How nice.

508
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,271
The last time I saw my mom

509
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,433
she was waving from
a library window in Texas. Right, Dad?

510
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,912
Right...

511
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,353
son.

512
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,876
Right.

513
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,360
Take a break, Veronica. Sit down.

514
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,869
So what was the first day
after Heather's suicide like?

515
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,996
Well, it was OK, I guess.

516
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,991
Terrible thing.

517
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,993
So, will we get to meet
this dark horse prom contender?

518
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,548
Maybe.

519
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,269
God, will somebody tell me
why I smoke these things?

520
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,590
Because you're an idiot.

521
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,596
Oh, yeah. That's it.

522
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,750
You two...

523
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,833
Great pâté but I have to motor
if want to be ready for that funeral.

524
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,157
I blame not Heather

525
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,630
but rather a society

526
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,870
that tells its youth

527
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,034
that the answers can be found
in the MTV video games.

528
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,676
We must pray that the other
teenagers of Sherwood, Ohio,

529
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,275
know the name of that righteous dude

530
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,318
who can solve their problems.

531
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,473
It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book.

532
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,956
Amen.

533
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,956
'O God, this is a tragic thing

534
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,316
'and sometimes
I have a hard time dealing with it.

535
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,595
'Please send Heather to heaven.'

536
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,433
'Dear God, please make sure
this never happens to me,

537
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,476
'I don't think I can handle suicide.

538
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,315
'Early acceptance into an Ivy League school
and please let it be Harvard. Amen.'

539
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,269
'Jesus God in heaven,
why did you kill such hot snatch?

540
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,194
'It's a joke, man.
Jeez, people are so serious.

541
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,271
'Hail Mary, who aren't in heaven,

542
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,318
'pray for all us sinners
so we don't get caught.

543
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,356
'Another joke, man.'

544
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,194
'I prayed for the death of
Heather Chandler many times.

545
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,795
'I felt bad every time I did it
but I kept doing it.

546
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,519
'Now I know you understood everything.

547
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,398
'Praise Jesus. Hallelujah.'

548
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,636
'Hi. I'm sorry.

549
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,477
'Technically, I did not kill Heather Chandler,
but, hey, who am I trying to kid, right?

550
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,996
'I just want my high school
to be a nice place.

551
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,752
'Amen.

552
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,796
'Did that sound bitchy? '

553
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,756
Veronica, what are you doing tonight?

554
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,232
I don't know. Mourning.
Maybe watch some TV. Why?

555
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,997
Well, Ram asked me out tonight...

556
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,197
but he wants to double with Kurt...

557
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,714
and Kurt doesn't have a date.

558
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,360
Heather, I have something going with JD.

559
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,750
Please, Veronica.
Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight.

560
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,910
I'll be your best friend.

561
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,879
So we on tonight, man, or what?

562
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,916
I don't know.

563
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,355
I still got to talk to Heather, dude.

564
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,351
Weird funeral, huh?

565
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,074
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.

566
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,118
- Let's kick his ass.
- Cool off.

567
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,668
- We're seniors.
- Goddamn geek!

568
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,594
Ah, well. Sit and spin.

569
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,069
That little prick.

570
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,229
You piece of shit fag.
You like to suck big dicks?

571
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,392
- Cut it out.
- Say, "I like to suck big dicks."

572
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,472
Leave him alone, Ram.

573
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,758
Say it.

574
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,953
Say it!

575
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,678
OK, OK.

576
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,956
You like to suck big dicks.

577
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,076
I like to suck big dicks.

578
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,032
I can't get enough of 'em.
Are you satisfied?

579
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,998
Don't worry. Ram's been so sweet lately,

580
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,071
consoling me and stuff.

581
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,232
It'll be really very. Promise.

582
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,517
OK. Just as long as
it won't be one of those nights

583
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,718
where they get shitfaced
and take us to a pasture to tip cows.

584
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,313
- Is it sleeping, dude?
- I think so, man.

585
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,436
Shh!

586
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,518
Come here.

587
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,628
Oh, shit. Cow tipping is the fucking greatest!
Punch it in.

588
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,877
Shit. On the count of three, guy.

589
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,038
One...

590
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,951
two... three!

591
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,952
When I get that feeling,
I need sexual healing.

592
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,110
Yeah, right, asshole.

593
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,516
What is this shit?

594
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,753
Doing a favour for Heather. Double date.

595
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,957
I tried to tell you at the funeral
but you rode off.

596
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,996
Another fucking Heather.

597
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,908
I'm sorry. I'm feeling a little superior tonight.

598
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,076
Seven schools in seven states

599
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,550
and the only thing different
is my locker combination.

600
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,195
Our love is god. Let's go get a slushie.

601
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,710
I'm not belittling the foodless fund, Peter,
but we're talking teen suicide here.

602
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,749
The number one song in America today
is Teenage Suicide Don't Do It by Big Fun.

603
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,755
Westerburg finally got one of these things
and I'm not gonna blow it.

604
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,595
So Heather gets the front page and
I get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.

605
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,037
Hi, guys, I came to check up
on this week's lunch-time poll topic.

606
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,556
Don't worry about it, Veronica.
Sit down, huh?

607
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,111
That funeral yesterday
must have really been rough, huh?

608
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,599
Oh, yeah.

609
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,549
We were wondering if you had any poems,
artwork that Heather did

610
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,269
that we can put in
the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?

611
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,157
The what?

612
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,951
Look, it's a two-page layout with
her suicide note right up here in the corner.

613
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,399
It's more tasteful than it sounds.

614
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,359
I don't know, Dennis,
this stuff leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

615
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,431
Like last night, Veronica?

616
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,112
Excuse me? I don't get it.

617
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,997
You did last night.

618
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,991
Kurt told us of your little date.

619
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,834
Yeah, and? I left him drunk
and flailing in cow shit.

620
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,071
Well, I don't know. He was really detailed.

621
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,390
- Shh.
- Shut up, Courtney.

622
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,438
No, don't shut up.
I'd like to know exactly what I did.

623
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,479
Come on, Veronica.
I'll show you the lunch-time poll topic.

624
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,591
What the fuck?

625
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,717
I rarely listen to Neanderthals like Kurt Kelly

626
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,677
but he said that he and Ram

627
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,878
had a nice little sword fight
in your mouth last night.

628
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,033
Ew! That son of a bitch.

629
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,558
Hi, Kurt?

630
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,279
Hi, this is Veronica Sawyer.

631
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,639
I didn't expect to be calling, either.
I guess my emotions took over.

632
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,396
I was wondering if you wanted those things
you've been saying to really happen.

633
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,439
It's always been a fantasy of mine
to have two guys at once.

634
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,239
Oh, sure, you can write to Penthouse forum.

635
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,549
Yeah, in the woods behind the school.

636
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,437
At dawn.

637
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,476
Don't forget Ram.

638
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:34,912
Why am I writing a suicide note when we're
just going to be shooting them with blanks?

639
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,037
We're not gonna be using blanks this time.

640
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,196
You can't be serious.

641
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,077
I am.

642
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,072
Listen, my Bonnie and Clyde days are over.

643
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,232
Wait a second, wait a second.
Do you take German?

644
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,912
French.

645
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,514
All right. These are echt Luger bullets.

646
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,876
My grandfather snared
a shitload of them back in WWII.

647
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,349
They're like tranquillisers,

648
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,673
only they break the skin's surface enough
to cause blood but no real damage.

649
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,036
So it looks like
the person's been shot and killed

650
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,430
and really they're just
unconscious and bleeding?

651
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,112
Oh.

652
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,997
Right.

653
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,153
See, we shoot Kurt and Ram,
make it look like they shot each other

654
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,189
and by the time they regain consciousness,
they'll be the laughing stock of the school.

655
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,397
The note's the punch line.
How'd that turn out?

656
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,597
First tell me the similarity is not incredible.

657
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,752
It's incredible similarity.

658
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,996
OK. Ahem.

659
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,750
"Ram and I died the day we realised

660
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,311
"we could never reveal our forbidden love
to an uncaring and un-understanding world.

661
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,518
"The joy we shared in each other's arms
was greater than any touchdown,

662
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,750
"yet we were forced to live the lie

663
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,230
"of sexist, beer-guzzling, jock assholes."

664
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,550
That's perfect.

665
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,110
Let's take a look at some
of the homosexual artefacts

666
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,156
I dug up to plant at the scene.

667
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,559
All right. An issue of Stud Puppy.

668
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,154
That's great!

669
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,518
A candy dish, a Joan Crawford postcard.

670
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,511
Good.

671
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,556
Some mascara.

672
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,316
All right, now, here's the one perfecto thing
I picked up -

673
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,549
mineral water.

674
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,475
Come on, a lot of people
drink mineral water. It's come a long way.

675
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,278
Yeah, but this is Ohio.

676
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,955
If you don't have a brewski in your hand,
you might as well be wearing a dress.

677
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,235
Oh, you're so smart.

678
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,950
Hi, Veronica.

679
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,951
Hi, guys.

680
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,116
Glad you could make it.

681
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,516
So should I just whip it out or...

682
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,639
Well, I've made a circle
on each side of the clearing.

683
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,154
Ram, you come over here.

684
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,673
Kurt.

685
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,796
When you get to the circle, strip.

686
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,836
What about you?

687
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,276
I was hoping you could
rip my clothes off me, sport.

688
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,153
Oh.

689
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,878
Good idea.

690
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,071
OK. Count of three, guys.

691
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,638
One...

692
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,998
two...

693
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,313
Three!

694
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,756
You missed him completely?

695
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,831
It was worth it just to see the look...

696
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,798
Don't move. I'll get him back.

697
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,752
Ha!

698
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,711
- No.
- Now!

699
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,360
- Hey, I heard it that time.
- What?

700
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,510
Another gunshot from the woods.

701
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,556
Oh, shit. Let's roll!

702
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,517
Kurt doesn't look too good.

703
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,716
Just remember he's left-handed.

704
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,076
Keep going until you hit the clearing.

705
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,276
Come on.

706
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,715
- Mother of shit!
- Call in.

707
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,112
Hey, I heard something out there.

708
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,156
I'm checking it out.

709
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,869
This is Officer McCord.
I've got two dead bodies in the woods

710
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,712
behind Westerburg High.

711
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,476
Whoa! Whoa!

712
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,799
'Milner, can you hear me?
What's going down? '

713
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,589
Yeah... I think what I heard
was just a bunny rabbit.

714
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,355
All I've got here is two kids
making out in a station wagon.

715
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,317
'Should I pry them apart? '

716
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,551
No. Forget it.
I got all the answers back here.

717
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,278
Hey...

718
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,920
are they naked?

719
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,879
Yeah, so what's the deal?

720
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,475
Suicide. Double suicide.
They shot each other.

721
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,596
Hey, that's Kurt Kelly.

722
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,069
Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.

723
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,629
Phew. My God, suicide. Why?

724
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,912
Does this answer your question?

725
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,309
Oh, man. They were fags.

726
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,030
Listen up. "We realised we could never
reveal our forbidden love

727
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,430
"to an uncaring
and un-understanding world."

728
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,193
Jesus H Christ!

729
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,113
The quarterback buggering the linebacker.

730
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,111
What a waste.

731
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,156
Oh, the humanity.

732
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,469
So we killed them, didn't we?

733
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,676
Yeah. Of course.

734
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,230
Echt Luger bullets. I'm such an idiot.

735
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,989
Look, you believed it
because you wanted to believe it.

736
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,835
Your true feelings
were too gross and icky for you to face.

737
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,953
I did not want them dead.

738
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,557
- You did too.
- I did not.

739
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,868
Did too.

740
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,279
- I did not.
- Did too.

741
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,191
- Did not.
- Did too.

742
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,475
- Did not! Did not!
- Did too!

743
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,630
Shut up! I did not want them dead.

744
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,030
- Come on, you did. You're just...
- # Mary had a little lamb... #

745
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,669
I did not!

746
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,512
Young love!

747
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,354
School's cancelled today
because Kurt and Ram killed themselves

748
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,431
in a repressed homosexual suicide pact!

749
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,476
No way.

750
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,312
God!

751
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,270
The football season is over, Veronica.

752
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,113
Kurt and Ram
had nothing to offer the school

753
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,236
but date rapes and AIDS jokes.

754
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,750
Sure.

755
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,952
Can we make an ice run
before the funeral?

756
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,237
If there's any way
you can hear me, Kurt buddy...

757
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,270
I don't care that
you really were some... pansy.

758
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,911
You're my own flesh and blood

759
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,956
and you made me proud.

760
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,432
My son's a homosexual and I love him.

761
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,756
I love my dead, gay son.

762
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,989
How do you think he'd react to a son
that had a limp wrist with a pulse?

763
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,438
'Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit
has a body count.

764
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,671
'The most popular people
in school are dead.

765
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,356
'Everybody's sad
but it's a weird kind of sad.

766
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,594
'Suicide gave Heather depth,
Kurt a soul, Ram a brain.

767
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,676
'I don't know what it's given me

768
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,311
'but I've got no control
over myself when I'm with JD.

769
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,278
'Are we going to prom or to hell? '

770
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,275
Now, it seems we were in
a similar position on Monday

771
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,397
when I thoughtfully suggested
we get everybody together

772
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,517
for an unadulterated
emotional outpouring, but no.

773
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,559
You took this as an opportunity
to play yet another round

774
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,915
of "let's laugh at the hippy".

775
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,390
- Pauline...
- Shut up, Paul.

776
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,675
I've seen a lot of bullshit -

777
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,274
ángel dust, switchblades,

778
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,353
sexually perverse photography exhibits
involving tennis rackets -

779
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,556
but this suicide thing...

780
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,799
guess that's more on Pauline's wavelength.

781
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,553
We're just going to write off today

782
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:23,033
and on Friday she can hold
her little love-in or whatever.

783
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,232
Whatever.

784
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,239
Attention!

785
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,240
May I have your attention, please?

786
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,359
This school has been
torn apart by tragedy.

787
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,149
I'm here today to fuse it back again
through togetherness.

788
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,596
I want everyone to clasp hands.

789
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,389
We need to connect this cafeteria
into one mighty circuit!

790
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,392
- Excuse me.
- Here comes the TV crew!

791
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,232
Lock your paws!

792
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,959
- We're ready when you are.
- Hi, there.

793
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,993
Come on. Let's go. Here.

794
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,913
This will be on TV.
Let's show them how you feel!

795
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,390
Looks like Miss Phlegm's
on another one of her crusades.

796
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,550
With usual success, of course.

797
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,392
Come on, get up!

798
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,118
Hi, what's your name?

799
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,997
I'm Heather Duke.

800
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,910
Is this as good for you as it is for me?

801
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,639
Those fish sticks can wait. Let's go.

802
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,676
Come on, kids!

803
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,795
The whole world is watching!

804
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,315
Show them that you care!

805
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,039
Greetings and salutations.

806
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,875
I'll need a VHS copy of this by Monday
for my Princeton application.

807
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,909
You can beat this,
don't let suicide get you down.

808
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,668
That thing this afternoon,

809
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,513
I'm so angry, it was chaos, fucking chaos.

810
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,837
What are you talking about?

811
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,629
I mean, today was great.
Chaos was great.

812
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,030
Chaos is what killed the dinosaurs, darling.

813
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,436
Face it, our way is the way.

814
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,954
We scare people into not being assholes.

815
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,634
Our way is not our way.

816
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,553
Oh, yeah? Tell that to the judge, all right?

817
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,471
Tell it to Kurt Kelly.

818
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,915
I'm telling it to you.

819
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,350
God, you can be so immature.

820
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,035
Oh! You kids are making
too much damn noise.

821
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,750
We beat the bitches.

822
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,308
Beautiful. The beaver's home.

823
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,358
Judge told them to slurp shit and die.

824
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,955
I put a Norwegian in the boiler room.

825
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,429
Masterful.

826
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,353
And then when that blew,

827
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,591
it set off a pack of thermals I stuck upstairs.

828
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,589
Some days it's great to be alive.

829
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,429
Stick it to those goddamn...

830
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,476
Do you like your father?

831
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,354
Never given the matter much thought.

832
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,196
Liked my mother.

833
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,072
They said her death was an accident

834
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,993
but she knew what she was doing.

835
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:36,949
She walked into the building two minutes
before my dad blew the place up.

836
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,191
She waved at me and then...

837
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,236
boom.

838
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,108
'Dudes, if I get one more request
for that Big Fun song,

839
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,918
'I'm gonna commit suicide.'

840
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,752
Playing our song.

841
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,479
'Here it is, Teenage Suicide Don't Do It.'

842
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,236
# Teenage suicide
# Don't do it

843
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,788
# Teenage suicide
# She blew it

844
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,950
# Teenage suicide

845
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,314
# Don't do it... #

846
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,916
That's it. We're breaking up.

847
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,310
What? You can't bring them back,
you must know that.

848
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,439
I'm not trying to bring anybody back
except maybe myself.

849
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,911
No!

850
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,198
To think once
I actually thought you were cool.

851
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,717
If you can't deal with me now
then just stay home and shoot your TV,

852
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,394
blow up a couple toasters or something.

853
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,553
Just don't come to school
and don't mess with me.

854
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,151
You'll be back.

855
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,029
Me and Martha Dumptruck?

856
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,917
Where did you get this?

857
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:09,437
Oh, I just had the nicest little chat
with Ms Dumptruck.

858
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,556
Got along famously.

859
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,996
It's scary how everybody's got
a little story to tell.

860
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,514
Want to see the canoeing shots?

861
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,431
What is this? Blackmail?

862
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,670
I'll give you a week's lunch money.

863
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,549
I don't want your money.
I want your strength.

864
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,677
Westerburg does not need
mushy togetherness,

865
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,955
it needs a strong leader.

866
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,077
Heather Chandler was that leader but...

867
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,549
But she couldn't handle it.

868
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,631
I think you can.

869
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,676
Moby Dick is dunked.

870
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,436
The white whale drank some bad plankton
and splashed through a coffee table

871
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,159
and now it's your turn to take the helm.

872
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,356
What about the photographs?

873
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,876
Oh, don't worry.
I'll ask you to do me a favour

874
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,030
and it'll be one you'll enjoy.

875
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,714
You'll get the negatives back then.

876
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,550
But in the meantime, strength.

877
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,390
Here's a little gift...

878
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,630
from Heather to Heather.

879
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,992
- Guess who.
- Heather?

880
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,439
'Hello? '

881
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,158
Hello, Betty? This is Veronica.

882
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,400
I don't believe it, I'm winning!

883
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,473
Don't you start getting cocky on me, girl.

884
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,470
I really missed you.

885
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,597
I know I'm not as exciting as
your other friends.

886
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,636
That is bullshit.

887
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,676
Shoot.

888
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,035
Do you know I'm still a virgin?

889
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,192
OK, I French-kissed Al Springer once.

890
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,236
It was a total disaster.

891
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,232
Shoot the ball.

892
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,629
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than
my realities, believe me.

893
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,272
But now, prepare to die.

894
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,112
Ronnie.

895
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,993
You're not just going for those two shots.

896
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,709
I mean, go ahead, knock me out.
It's the only way to win.

897
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,675
It's not my style.

898
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,514
Nice guys finish last, I should know.

899
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,513
Bravo.

900
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,318
Bravo.

901
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,960
Listen, I got to get home, OK?

902
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,156
OK.

903
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,037
Thanks.

904
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,997
Bye, Betty.

905
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,513
Bye.

906
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,512
Betty, leaving so soon?

907
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,158
I'm red.

908
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,553
'The Westerburg suicides
were tough on all of us,

909
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,350
'but we shared the pain of losing
three very popular students.

910
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,069
'I came into the cafeteria,
asked them to hold hands... '

911
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,993
Isn't that that flake
we met at the open house?

912
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,389
'... burst of cleansing synchronicity,

913
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,870
'TV cameras happened
onto our path and captured... '

914
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,520
Cleansing synchronicity?

915
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,388
Outpouring of emotion?

916
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,789
Ha! Look! There's Heather.

917
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,713
There's Heather. Where are you, Veronica?

918
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:13,511
'Before a teenager decides to kill himself,
there are certain facts that he should know.

919
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:19,391
'After all, this decision affects all of us
and there's only one chance to get it right.'

920
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,196
'Getting some supervi... '

921
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,111
Turn that back on.

922
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,509
These programmes are eating suicide up.

923
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,433
They're making it sound like
a cool thing to do.

924
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,469
Are you trying to tell me it's not a time
for troubled youth? Stand up straight.

925
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,757
All we want is to be
treated like human beings,

926
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,354
not patronised like bunny rabbits.

927
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,590
I don't patronise bunny rabbits.

928
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,671
Treated like human beings?

929
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,514
Is that what you said,
little Miss Voice-of-a-generation?

930
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,831
How do you think adults
act with other adults?

931
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,593
You think it's all just
a game of doubles tennis?

932
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,116
When teenagers complain
they want to be treated like human beings,

933
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,998
it's because they are
being treated like human beings.

934
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:17,551
Well, I guess I picked the wrong time
to be a human being.

935
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,631
Well, you'll live.

936
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,716
Want some pâté?

937
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,234
Hi, everybody. Door was open.

938
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,675
Veronica, have you heard?

939
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,115
We were doing Chinese at the food fair

940
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,510
when we heard Martha Dumptruck
tried to buy the farm.

941
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,434
She belly-flopped in front of a car
wearing a suicide note.

942
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,192
Is she dead?

943
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,955
No. That's the punch line.
She's in stable condition.

944
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:56,068
Just another case of a geek trying to imitate
the popular people and failing miserably.

945
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,116
Is that pâté?

946
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,630
- I said I was sorry.
- You were out of control.

947
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,792
Heather and Kurt were a shock
but Martha Dumptruck?

948
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,997
Get crucial. She dialled
suicide hotlines in her diapers.

949
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,196
You're not funny.

950
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:19,438
Look, Martha couldn't take the heat
so she got out of the kitchen.

951
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,230
Just think what a better place this world
would be if every nimrod followed her cue.

952
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,198
Just shut up. Hot Probs is on.

953
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,759
Oh, shit. Yeah.

954
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:33,356
'Skipper's OK but sometimes
I feel like I'm on that island

955
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,591
'and Gilligan can be so stupid sometimes... '

956
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,355
If it wasn't for the courage
of the fearless crew,

957
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,591
the Minnow would be lost,
and you are too.

958
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,272
Next call.

959
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:49,273
'Hey, you've got the dog-catcher.'

960
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,717
'My name is Heather.
No... it's not Heather.'

961
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,036
No, it...

962
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,155
It's Madonna. Jeez. No, not that.

963
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,630
Hey, babe, I need a name.

964
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,271
My name is Tweety.

965
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,316
'Tweety?

966
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,278
'Ooh, tweet! '

967
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,112
God has cursed me, I think.

968
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,714
The last guy I had sex with
killed himself the next day.

969
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,516
I'm failing math.

970
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,318
My whole life is a mess.

971
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,278
I'm supposed to be captain of
the cheerleading...

972
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,591
She knows we listen to this show.

973
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,990
Holy shit! We'll crucify her.

974
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,470
'... my parents are divorced and stuff... '

975
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:50,990
'Heather told everyone about Heather.

976
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,989
'Yes, dear diary,
I've cut off Heather Chandler's head

'I guess that's Heather's way.

'I can't get him out of my head.

01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,714
'Wait. Where's Heather going? '

988
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,950
Where's Heather going?

989
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,190
She's going to cry.

990
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,954
Fucking child protector caps.

991
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,231
Now where is she going?

992
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,598
Heather.

993
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,999
- What are you trying to do? Kill me?
- What are you trying to do? Sleep?

994
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,354
Suicide is a private thing.

995
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,954
Heather, you're throwing your life away

996
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,952
to become a statistic
in the US fucking A Today.

997
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,952
That's the least private thing I can think of.

998
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,998
What about Heather and Kurt and Ram?

999
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,393
If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you?

1000
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,437
Probably.

1001
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,276
Hey now, if you were happy
every day of your life,

1002
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,955
you wouldn't be a human being,
you'd be a game show host.

1003
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:38,909
What do you say we knock off early,
buy some shoes, something lame like that?

1004
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,598
OK.

1005
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,352
So it's come to this.

1006
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,237
Heather Chandler did polls,

1007
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,836
I want you to do a petition,
as a favour, as the favour.

1008
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,878
You've heard of the group Big Fun, right?

1009
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,157
That's right. Teenage Suicide Don't Do It.

1010
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:07,155
Right. Some teenybopper rag
says that they want to play a prom.

1011
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:11,153
It could be Westerburg's
if we get everybody's John Hancock.

1012
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,992
I'll get right on it, coach.

1013
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,311
Little gift for you. I won't be needing it.

1014
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,232
Heather?

1015
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,514
Veronica.

1016
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,194
Colour me stoked, girl.

1017
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,316
Everyone's signed this petition,

1018
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,710
even the ones who think
Big Fun are tuneless Eurofags.

1019
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,518
People love me.

1020
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,511
You haven't signed yet.

1021
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,637
People love you but I know you.

1022
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,553
Jennifer Forbes told me
the petition she signed

1023
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,189
was to put a hot tub in the cafeteria
and Doug Hilton said...

1024
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,272
Some people need
different kinds of convincing.

1025
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,635
Just sign the petition, OK?

1026
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,631
Don't talk to me like that, OK?

1027
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,029
Look, it was JD's idea.

1028
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:28,796
He made out the signature sheet
and everything so why not just sign it?

1029
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,154
No.

1030
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,958
Jealous much?

1031
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,231
Heather, why can't you just be a friend?
Why are you such a megabitch?

1032
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,351
Because I can be.

1033
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,995
Veronica, why are you pulling my dick?

1034
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,039
Do you think if Betty Finn's
fairy godmother made her cool,

1035
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,351
she'd still hang out
with her dweebette friends?

1036
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,670
No way, Veronica.

1037
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,591
Uh-uh.

1038
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,909
Want to go out tonight?

1039
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,878
Catch a movie, some miniature golf?

1040
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,080
I was thinking more along the lines
of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open,

1041
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,310
making it look like a suicide.

1042
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,119
Now you're talking. I could be up for that.

1043
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,670
I've already started
underlining meaningful passages

1044
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,957
in her copy of Moby Dick,
if you know what I mean.

1045
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,516
I knew you'd be back, Veronica.

1046
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,638
I knew it. I was positive sure.

1047
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,036
It's over, JD, over.

1048
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,678
Grow up!

1049
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,591
You don't get it.

1050
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,750
You were wrong. I was right.

1051
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,316
Strength, damn it!

1052
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,556
Come on, come back!

1053
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,471
Yes?

1054
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,997
Your friend Jason Dean stopped by.
He seemed very concerned about you.

1055
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,675
He said he thought
you might try to kill yourself.

1056
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,716
You have been depressed lately.

1057
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,756
Oh, he left this for you.

1058
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,836
Oh, my God.

1059
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,833
He said that we should
keep you away from sharp objects,

1060
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,071
closed garage doors,
chemical, uh, substances.

1061
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,038
- Prescription drugs.
- Prescription drugs.

1062
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:26,910
"To neither love
nor reverence wilt thou be kind,

1063
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,437
"and even for hate thou canst but kill,

1064
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,670
"and all are killed."

1065
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,199
I like it.

1066
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,669
It's got that what-a-cruel-world

1067
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,197
so let's-toss-ourselves-in-the-abyss
type of ambiance, huh?

1068
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,992
Come on. It's Heather's copy of Moby Dick.

1069
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,238
Why don't you give it a try?
Underline something.

1070
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,834
Get off of my bed, you fucking psycho!

1071
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:02,799
You think you're a rebel?
Do you actually think you're a rebel?

1072
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,792
You're not a rebel.
You're fucking psychotic.

1073
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,034
You say "tom-ay-to", I say "tom-ah-to".

1074
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,031
Hold it.

1075
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,351
Eskimo. Look at that.

1076
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,034
That's one word. I love it!

1077
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:23,511
I usually go for the whole sentence myself
but this is perfecto.

1078
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,275
Eskimo, you know, it's so, uh, mysterious.

1079
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,995
Eskimo.

1080
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,596
Come on.

1081
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,475
JD, you are not listening to me.

1082
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,988
Nag. Nag. Nag. Nag. Nag!

1083
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,075
Th-th-that knife is filthy.

1084
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,675
Do you think I'm going to
take out her tonsils with it?

1085
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,070
Excuse me, I think I know Heather
a little better than you do.

1086
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:01,358
If she was going to slit her wrists,
the knife would be spotless.

1087
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,391
How's this? Can you see your fucking
reflection in the thing?

1088
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,397
Tomorrow someone else
will move into her place.

1089
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,592
That person could be me.

1090
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,750
Ha! There's only one of us
knows Heather's handwriting.

1091
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,310
If you think I'll write another suicide note,
you're wrong.

1092
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,039
You don't get it! Society nods its head

1093
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,636
at any horror the American teenager
can think to bring upon itself.

1094
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:38,157
Nobody's going to care about
exact handwriting. Help me. Quick.

1095
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,230
Life sucks.

1096
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,316
It's perfecto.

1097
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,115
Jesus, I've got
a meaningfully marked-up Moby Dick.

1098
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,555
What else does a suicide need, huh?

1099
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,596
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1100
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,592
No!

1101
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,716
Open the door!

1102
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,356
Eskimo.

1103
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:38,236
Heather Duke underlined a lot of things
in this copy of Moby Dick

1104
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:42,199
but I believe the word Eskimo,

1105
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,635
underlined all by itself,

1106
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,508
is the key to understanding Heather's pain.

1107
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,593
On the surface, Heather Duke
was the vivacious young lady

1108
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,955
we all knew her to be...

1109
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,669
but her soul was in Antarctica,

1110
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:04,790
freezing with the knowledge
of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel...

1111
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:10,635
the way that parents can be unresponsive...

1112
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:14,998
and as she writes so eloquently
in her suicide note,

1113
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:18,038
the way that life can suck.

1114
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,231
We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo.

1115
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,951
Let's just hope
she's rubbing noses with Jesus.

1116
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,190
Is this turnout weak or what?

1117
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,597
I had at least 70 more people at my funeral.

1118
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,428
Heather?

1119
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,436
Oh, God, Veronica,

1120
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,830
my afterlife is so boring.

1121
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,718
If I have to sing Kumbaya one more time...

1122
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,438
What are you doing here?

1123
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,114
I made your favourite -

1124
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,350
spaghetti.

1125
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,396
Lots of oregano.

1126
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,711
Dinner!

1127
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,596
Veronica! Dinner!

1128
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,837
'Dear diary, last entry.

1129
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,672
'No one can stop JD -

1130
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:41,639
'not the FBI, the CIA or the PTA.

1131
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:46,111
'He once told me that
the extreme always makes an impression.

1132
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,952
'Well, now it's my turn.

1133
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:52,830
'Let's see how the son of a bitch reacts
to a suicide he didn't perform himself.'

1134
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,117
I can't believe you did it.

1135
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,156
I was teasing.

1136
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,993
I loved you.

1137
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,038
Sure, I was coming up here to kill you.

1138
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,911
First I was going to try and get you back
with my amazing petition.

1139
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:55,117
It's a shame you can't see what
our fellow students really signed.

1140
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,836
All right, listen.

1141
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:09,677
"We students of
Westerburg High will die. Today.

1142
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,309
"Our burning bodies
will be the ultimate protest

1143
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,312
"to a society that degrades us.

1144
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,356
"Fuck you all."

1145
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:26,432
It's not very subtle, but, uh, neither's
blowing up a whole school, now, is it?

1146
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,594
Talk about your suicide pacts, huh?

1147
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,918
When our school blows up tomorrow,

1148
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,073
it's going to be the kind of thing
to infect a generation!

1149
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,709
I mean, it's going to be
a Woodstock for the '80s.

1150
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,036
Damn it, Veronica.

1151
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,592
We could have
toasted some marshmallows together.

1152
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:05,073
What does she want? A written invitation?

1153
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,151
Veronica! Dinner!

1154
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,992
Sheesh.

1155
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,836
Veronica, I...

1156
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:23,595
Oh, I... I... I should have let you
take that job at the mall.

1157
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,356
It was just that I was afraid of you
coming home late at night and I...

1158
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,798
Hey, Mom, why so tense?

1159
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,677
Hey, Prob, I need some help
with my homework.

1160
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,797
Uh, not right now, tiger. I'm a little busy.

1161
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,792
Veronica, JD told me
you committed suicide last night.

1162
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:27,555
- Where is he? Where's JD?
- We have to talk.

1163
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:32,555
Whether to kill yourself or not is the most
important decision a teenager can make.

1164
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,039
Get a job.

1165
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,229
Rodney, where's everybody going?

1166
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:14,228
- It's Friday.
- Shit, another damn pep assembly.

1167
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:18,632
Yeah. You know, these things,
they get pretty artificial

1168
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,518
but you know, at least you get out of class.

1169
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,353
Rodney, what's underneath the gym?

1170
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:31,036
The boiler room.

1171
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,714
May I see your hall pass?

1172
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,878
I knew that loose was too noose.

1173
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,998
I mean, uh, noose too loose.

1174
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,276
Goddamn you, woman.

1175
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,196
Like father, like son.

1176
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:01,717
A serious-as-fuck bomb in the boiler room
to set off a pack of thermals upstairs.

1177
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:09,069
Ok, let's start by putting the bomb down
on the ground.

1178
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,672
I knew that.

1179
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,917
I knew that.

1180
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,117
OK, put your hands on your head.

1181
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,356
You didn't say "Simon says".

1182
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,952
Let's go!

1183
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,349
Let's go, Rottweilers, let's go!

1184
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,111
Let's go, Rottweilers, let's go!

1185
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,114
W- E-S!

1186
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,430
- T-E-R!
- T-E-R!

1187
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,080
- B-U-R!
- B-U-R!

1188
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,673
- G!
- G!

1189
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,149
- What does it spell?
- Westerburg!

1190
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:31,198
- Again!
- Westerburg!

1191
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,271
Westerburg!

1192
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,955
Lean to the left, lean to the right!

1193
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,350
Stand up, sit down, fight, fight, fight!

1194
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,919
Stop!

1195
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,274
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1196
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:28,629
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1197
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,998
You think because
you started this you can end it?

1198
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,072
I'll kill, I'll fucking kill you, I swear to God.

1199
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,193
How do I turn off the bomb, asshole?

1200
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,157
Fuck you!

1201
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,631
Shit!

1202
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,599
It's all over, JD. Help me stop it.

1203
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:15,313
You want to clean the slate as much as I do.

1204
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:20,558
All right, so maybe I am
killing everyone in the school...

1205
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,596
because nobody loves me.

1206
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,873
Let's face it, all right?
The only place different social types

1207
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:31,236
can genuinely get along
with each other is in heaven.

1208
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,434
Which button do I press to turn it off?

1209
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,954
Try the red one, all right?

1210
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,679
People are going to look at
the ashes of Westerburg and say,

1211
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,672
"Now, there is a school that self-destructed,

1212
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:54,470
"not because society didn't care
but because the school was society!"

1213
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,312
It's pretty deep, huh?

1214
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,391
Which red button?

1215
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,832
Press the middle one to turn it off...

1216
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,876
if that's what you really want.

1217
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,474
You know what I want, babe?

1218
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,868
What?

1219
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,394
Cool guys like you out of my life.

1220
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,276
Colour me impressed.

1221
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:21,756
You, uh, you really fucked me up
pretty bad, Veronica.

1222
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,036
You, um...

1223
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,556
you got power.

1224
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,956
Power I didn't think you had.

1225
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,472
The slate is clean.

1226
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,554
Pretend I did blow up the school...

1227
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,676
all the schools.

1228
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,036
Now that you're dead,

1229
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,509
what are you going to do with your life?

1230
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,233
Veronica... you look like hell.

1231
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,675
Yeah? I just got back.

1232
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,556
Veronica, what are you doing?

1233
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,358
Heather, my love,

1234
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,590
there's a new sheriff in town.

1235
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,876
Hey, Martha!

1236
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,396
My date for the prom
kind of flaked out on me.

1237
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,153
If you aren't doing anything that night,

1238
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,869
maybe we can rent some new releases,
pop some popcorn.

1239
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,832
I'd like that.

1240
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:21,673
Yeah. So would I.

1241
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:51,917
# When I was just a little girl

1242
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:58,235
# I asked my mother, what will I be?

1243
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,993
# Will I be pretty?

1244
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,038
# Will I be rich?

1245
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:09,238
# Here's what she said to me

1246
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:14,917
# Que será, será

1247
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:25,030
# Whatever will be

1248
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:27,350
# Will be

1249
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:31,470
# Will be

1250
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:39,193
# The future's not ours to see

1251
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:44,710
# Well, well, well, well, ohh

1252
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:50,750
# Que será, que será

1253
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,070
# Que será

1254
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:01,631
# When I grew up and fell in love

1255
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:07,670
# I asked my lover, what will I be?

1256
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:14,598
# Will I be rich day after day?

1257
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:18,912
# Here's how my lover said

1258
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,155
# Que será, será

1259
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,834
# Yeah

1260
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:34,870
# Whatever will be

1261
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,791
# Will be

1262
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,319
# Will be

1263
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,197
# Que será, será

1264
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,038
# Whatever will be
# Whatever

1265
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,190
# Will be

1266
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,236
# Will be

1267
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,878
# Will be

1268
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:09,512
# The future's not ours to see

1269
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:22,152
# Que será
# Que será

1270
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,878
# Will be

1271
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,916
# Que será

1272
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,110
# Y'all get down #
