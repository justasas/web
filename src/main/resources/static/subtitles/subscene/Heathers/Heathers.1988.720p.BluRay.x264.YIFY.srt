It's your turn, Heather.

24
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,501
No, Heather.
It's Heather's turn.

25
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,186
Heather.

26
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,894

Dear diary,

33
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,773
Heather told me
she teaches people real life.

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,410
She said,
"real life sucks losers dry."

35
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:17,846
If you wanna fuck
with the eagles,
you have to learn to fly."

36
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:22,136
I said, "so, you teach people
how to spread their wings
and fly ?"

37
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,155
She said, "yes."

38
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:27,524
I said, "you're beautiful."

39
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:30,227
God, come on,
Veronica.

40
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,696
What is your damage,
Heather ?

41
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:37,051
Don't blame me.  Blame Heather.
She told me to haul your ass
into the caf pronto.

42
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:41,388
- Back me up, Heather.
- Yeah, she really wants
to talk to you, Veronica.

43
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,758
Okay, I'm going.
Jesus Christ !

44
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:56,971
Hello, Heather.

45
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,107
Veronica.  Finally.

46
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,876
I got a note
of Kurt Kelly's.

47
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:05,879
I need you to forge a hot and
horny but realistically low-key
note in Kurt's handwriting...

48
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,782
<i>And slip it onto
Martha's "dumptruck's"
lunch tray.</i>

49
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,718
Heather,
I don't have anything
against Martha Dunnstock.

50
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:13,887
You don't have anything
for her either.

51
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:16,123
<i>Come on.
It'll be very.</i>

52
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:20,594
The note will give her
shower nozzle masturbation
material for weeks.

53
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:27,702
- I'll think about it.
- Don't think.

54
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:35,877
Veronica needs
something to write on.
Heather, bend over.

55
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,604
"dear Martha,
you're so sweet."

56
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:48,239
<i>I'm telling you, man,
it would be so righteous...</i>

57
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,943
To be in a Veronica Sawyer/
Heather Chandler sandwich.

58
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,945
Oh, hell, yes.

59
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:55,447
I wanna get Heather
and put her on my Johnson
and start spinning her around...

60
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:57,449
Like a goddamn pinwheel.

61
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,517
Punch it in.

62
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,849
[ boy ]
Westerberg feeds the world.
Come on, people.

63
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:34,503
Let's give that leftover
lunch money to people
who don't have lunches.

64
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,172
God, aren't
they fed yet ?

65
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,109
Do they even have
Thanksgiving in Africa ?

66
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:45,381
Oh, sure.  Pilgrims,
Indians, tater tots.
It's a real party continent.

67
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:48,217
Sawyer,
guess what today is.

68
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,886
Ouch.
Lunchtime poll ?

69
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:53,356
So, what's the question ?
Yeah, what's
the question, Heather ?

70
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:57,360
Goddamn, Heather.
You were with me in study
hall when I thought of it.

71
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:59,930
I forgot.

72
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:03,766
Such a pillowcase.

73
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:08,037
This wouldn't be that bizarro
thing you were babbling about
over the phone last night ?

74
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,105
<i>Of course it is.</i>

75
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:16,679
I told Dennis if he gives me
another political topic,
I'd spew burrito chunks.

76
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:28,575
- Oh, Veronica, I'm sorry.
- Betty Finn.  Gosh.

77
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:31,377
I'm really sorry
I couldn't make it to your
birthday party last month.

78
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:34,981
That's okay.  Your mom
said you had a big date.

79
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:38,117
I'd probably miss
my own birthday for a date.
Don't say that.

80
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:42,522
I was looking around
the other day
and I dug up, uh,

81
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,624
These old photographs.

82
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:48,078
Oh, wow.
These are great.

83
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:51,581
Come on, Veronica.
I was talking
to somebody.

84
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,475
Oh, great.
Here comes Heather.

85
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:03,844
Oh, shit.

86
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:06,447
Hi, Courtney.
Love your cardigan.

87
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:08,982
Thanks.  I just
got it last night
from limited.

88
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,586
Like totally blew
my allowance.

89
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:14,588
Now, check this out.

90
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,090
You win $5 million
from the publisher's
sweepstakes.

91
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:19,826
And the same day
that that big Ed guy
gives you the check,

92
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:24,231
Aliens land on the earth
and say they're gonna blow up
the world in two days.

93
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,568
<i>- What do you do ?
- [ boy ]  that's easy.</i>

94
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:31,438
I'd just slide that wad
over to my father,

95
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:34,008
'cause he is like one
of the top brokers
in the state.

96
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:39,780
If I got that money,
I'd give it all
to the homeless.  Every cent.

97
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,282
You're beautiful.

98
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,688
If you're gonna
openly be a bitch--

99
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:50,924
Heather, why can't
we talk to different
kinds of people ?

100
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,926
Fuck me gently
with a chain saw.

101
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,929
Do I look like
mother Teresa ?

102
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:58,767
If I did,
I probably wouldn't mind
talking to the geek squad.

103
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:05,690
Did you see that ?
Heather number one
just looked right at me.

104
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:09,778
Does it not bother you
that everybody in this school
thinks that you're a piranha ?

105
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:11,779
Like I give a shit.

106
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:14,515
They all want me
as a friend or a fuck.

107
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,085
I'm worshipped
at Westerberg.
And I'm only a Junior.

108
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:32,000
I can't believe this.
We're going to a party at
Remington university tonight...

109
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:36,805
And we're brushing up
on our conversational skills
with the scum of the school.

110
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:41,710
Hi.
Hi.

111
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:46,381
So, this is what's called
a lunchtime poll.

112
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,518
You win $5 million
in the publisher's sweepstakes.

113
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:52,387
And the same day
that what's-his-face
gives you the check,

114
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,255
Aliens land on earth.

115
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:56,090
They're gonna blow up
the world in two days.

116
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:58,728
What are
you gonna do
with the money ?

117
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:02,031
I'd go to Egypt...
With a girl.

118
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:05,535
I'd use the money
for an end-of-the-world
get-together.

119
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:08,237
I'd pay Madonna
a million bucks
to sit on my face...

120
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,373
And have her ride
like the Kentucky derby.

121
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:13,591
That's gotta be the most
spooky-ass question
I ever heard.

122
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:16,494
This is important.
After taxes,
I'll only be getting--

123
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:20,631
- She should pay me, though.
- You go to the zoo
and you get a lion.

124
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:23,201
And then you put
a remote-control bomb
up its butt.

125
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,937
And then there's
social security,
legal fees--

126
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:30,509
You push the button on the bomb,
and you and the lion
die like one.

127
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:33,445
What ?

128
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:41,120
Oh, my God.
Here we go.

129
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:03,877
[ cackling ]

130
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:24,814
Hi, Veronica.
A five keeps
an Infant alive.

131
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,622
You wanted to be a member
of the most powerful clique
in school.

132
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:35,292
If I wasn't already
the head of it,
I'd want the same thing.

133
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:39,830
Come on, Veronica.
You used to have
a sense of humor.

134
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,503
Veronica,
could you come back
here a minute ?

135
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,939
A true friend's work
is never done.

136
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:51,074
Gross.
Gross.

137
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:54,678
Grow up, Heather.
Bulimia is so '87.

138
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:58,364
Maybe you should see
a doctor.
Yeah, maybe.

139
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,987
Come on, Heather.
Let's take another look
at today's lunch.

140
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:20,287
<i>God, Veronica,
drool much ?</i>

141
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,522
His name
is Jason Dean.

142
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,591
He's in
my American history.

143
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,754
Hello, Jason Dean.

144
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,924
Greetings
and salutations.

145
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:43,327
You a Heather ?
No.

146
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,898
I'm a Veronica...
Sawyer.

147
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:51,285
This may seem like
a really stupid question.

148
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:53,454
There are
no stupid questions.

149
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,644
You inherit $5 million
the same day aliens
land on the earth...

150
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:02,447
And say they're gonna
blow it up in two days.

151
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:04,517
<i>What do you do ?</i>

152
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:09,054
That's the stupidest
question I've ever heard.

153
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:12,608
Who's that guy in the coat
think he is anyways ?

154
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:14,610
Bo Diddley ?

155
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,844
Veronica's into his act,
no doubt.

156
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,964
I don't know.  Probably
row out to the middle
of the lake somewhere,

157
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,534
Bring along a bottle
of tequila,

158
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:25,770
My sax and, uh, some Bach.

159
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:28,823
How very.

160
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,111
Come on, Veronica.

161
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:39,117
Later.
Definitely.

162
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:43,104
Let's kick his ass.

163
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:45,474
Shit, ram.
We're seniors, man.

164
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,510
We're too old
for that kind of crap.

165
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:51,012
Let's give him
a good scare, though.

166
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:58,837

or bean with bacon ?

329
00:25:10,014 --> 00:25:13,850
Put a lid on that stuff.
I say we go with big blue here.

330
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:15,852
What are you
talking about ?

331
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,922
She would never
drink anything that
looked like that anyway.

332
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,961
We'll, uh,
put it in this.

333
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:26,997
She won't be able to see
what she's drinking.

334
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:30,435
Let me get a cup,
jerk.

335
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:35,105
Okay.

336
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:37,574
Milk and orange juice.

337
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:39,876
Hmm.  Well, maybe
we could, like,

338
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:42,429
Cough up a phlegm glob
in it or something.

339
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,843
No ?
None.

340
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,114
Well, milk
and orange juice
will do quite nicely.
Mm.

341
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:02,116
You chicken ?

342
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:04,185
You're not funny.

343
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,660
I'm sorry.

344
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:31,446
<i>Uh, Veronica ?
What ?</i>

345
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:36,651
Uh, never mind.
I'll, uh, carry the cup.

346
00:26:39,954 --> 00:26:41,955
<i>[ Veronica ]

347
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:47,995

And Jesse James.

348
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:51,499
<i>Please.</i>

349
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,835
Hear about Veronica's
affection for regurgitation ?

350
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,005
Heather, I think last night,
we both said a lot of stuff
we didn't mean.

351
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,708
Did we ?
How the hell
did you get in here ?

352
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:03,095
Um,

353
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:07,332
Veronica knew you'd
have a hangover, so, uh,
I whipped this up for you.

354
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,503
It's a family recipe.
What did you do, put a phlegm
glob in it or something ?

355
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:14,523
I'm not gonna drink
that piss.

356
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,592
I knew this stuff
would be too intense for her.

357
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:22,664
Too intense.
Grow up.

358
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:27,636
You think I'll drink it just
because you call me chicken ?

359
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,892
Just give me the cup,
jerk.

360
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:47,238

362
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:10,429
Oh, my God.

363
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:13,599
I can't believe it.

364
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,035
I just killed
my best friend.

365
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:19,505
And your worst enemy.
Same difference.

366
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,182
Oh !

367
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:31,018
What are we gonna tell
the cops ?

368
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:35,723
"fuck it if she can't
take a joke, sarge" ?

369
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,725
The cops.

370
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:41,194
I can't believe
this is my life.

371
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,197
Oh, my God.

372
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,935
I'm gonna have to send
my M.I.T. scores to San Quentin
instead of Stanford.

373
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:55,174
All right.  I'm just
a little freaked here.

374
00:28:55,242 --> 00:28:58,879
At least you got
what you wanted,
you know ?

375
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,914
Got what I wanted ?

376
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:03,350
It is one thing
to want somebody
out of your life;

377
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,954
It is another thing
to serve them a wake-up cup
full of liquid drainer.

378
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:35,683
All right, we-we, uh--
we did a murder,
and that's a crime.

379
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,752
But, uh--

380
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,656
This was like
a suicide thing, you know ?

381
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:47,778
- Like a suicide thing ?
- Yeah.

382
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:50,447
Yeah.  I mean, uh,

383
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:54,251
You can do Heather's
handwriting as well
as your own, right ?

384
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,320
Right ?

385
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:04,629
Yeah.

386
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:11,035
"you might think what
I've done is shocking."
yeah.

387
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:16,541
Um,

388
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:19,444
"to me, though, suicide
is the natural answer...

389
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:23,481
To the myriad of problems
life has given me."

390
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:26,851
That's good,
but Heather would never
use the word "myriad."

391
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:28,854
This is the last thing
she'll ever write.

392
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:32,024
She's gonna wanna cash in
on as many 50-cent words
as possible.

393
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:35,160
Yeah, but she missed "myriad"
on the vocab test
two weeks ago.

394
00:30:35,229 --> 00:30:40,333
That only proves my point more.
The word is a badge
for her failures at school.

395
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,202
Oh.  Okay,
you're probably right.

396
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,207
"people think...

397
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:52,377
"just because you're
beautiful and popular,

398
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:56,715
Life is easy and fun."

399
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:58,717
Uh--

400
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:01,153
"no one understood...

401
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:04,490
"I had feelings too.

402
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:10,162
I die knowing
no one knew the real me."

403
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:16,602
That's good.
Have you done this before ?

404
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:24,277
Any other principal
would take the same position.

405
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:27,930
Keep things business as usual.
Heather Chandler is not
your everyday suicide.

406
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:29,933
She was very popular.

407
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:34,637
If I let these kids out before
lunch, the switchboard will
light up like a Christmas tree.

408
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:40,410
I was impressed to see that
she made proper use of the word
"myriad" in her suicide note.

409
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:43,746
I find it
profoundly disturbing...

410
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:47,149
<i>That we're told
of the tragic
destruction of youth,</i>

411
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:50,386
And all we can think
to talk about is...

412
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:53,588
Adequate mourning times and
misused vocabulary words ?

413
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:55,724
Oh, for Christ--

414
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,727
We must revel
in this revealing moment.

415
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:02,498
<i>Look, I suggest that we
get everybody together,</i>

416
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:05,368
Both students and teachers,
in the cafeteria...

417
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:09,639
And just...
Talk... And feel...

418
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:11,641
<i>Together.</i>

419
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,644
Thank you, Ms. Fleming.
You call me
when the shuttle lands.

420
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:17,513
Now, is this Heather
the cheerleader ?

421
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:20,083
That would be
Heather McNamara.

422
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:24,154
Oh, damn.  I'd be willing to go
a half a day for a cheerleader.

423
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,489
God, it's unfair.

424
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:28,625
It's just so unfair.

425
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:31,495
We should get off
a whole week,
not just an hour.

426
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:33,497
Write the school board.

427
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:36,300
Watch it, Heather.
You might be digesting
food there.

428
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:39,303
Yeah, where's
your urge to purge ?
Fuck it.

429
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:41,188
[ McNamara ]
look.

430
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:45,526
Heather left behind
one of her swatches.

431
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,598
She'd want you to have it,
Veronica.

432
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:55,402
She always said you couldn't
accessorize for shit.

433
00:32:55,469 --> 00:32:57,537
Sorry to hear
about your friend.

434
00:32:57,605 --> 00:33:00,339
Thought she was
your usual airhead bitch.

435
00:33:00,408 --> 00:33:03,844
I guess I was wrong.
We all were.

436
00:33:06,581 --> 00:33:08,516
[ McNamara ]
what a waste.

437
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,552
Oh, the humanity.

of the profound sensitivity of
which a human animal is capable.

<i>That example
is Heather Chandler.</i>

<i>So you can all feel

for yourself.</i>

<i>And while we do this,</i>

00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:13,482
<i>I think it's a good
opportunity to share the...</i>

has spurred in all of us.

to begin ?

it was really gnarly.

rehash the coroner's report.

used to go out,

But she said I was boring.

But now I realize
I really wasn't boring.

459
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:43,880
It's just that she was
dissatisfied with her life.

460

Are we gonna
be tested on this ?

464
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:03,348
We wore the same size, and
sometimes we could borrow
each other's clothes...

465
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,351
And mix it up;
it was fun.

466
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:08,988

<i>At the 4-h club.
Oh, you're an asshole.

of clothes.

Heather, how many networks
did you run to ?

470
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:20,266
It's just not gonna
be the same here
without her.

00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:23,503
What are you talking about ?
You hated her; she hated you.

Every English class
I looked forward
to seeing her.

Doesn't want us
to terminate
that fleabag hotel,

All because
Glenn miller and his band
once took a shit there.

Just like Kansas.
Remember fucking Kansas ?

Yeah, that was the one
with the wheat, right ?

So, why don't you ask

to stay for dinner ?

<i>Lots of oregano.

00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,618
Take a break, Veronica.
Sit down.

497
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,757
So, what was the first day
after Heather's suicide like ?

498
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,827
I don't know.
It was okay, I guess.

<i>[ mom ]

500
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:15,816
So, will we get
to meet this dark horse
prom contender ?

501
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:18,386
Maybe.

502
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:22,090
Goddamn, will somebody
tell me why I smoke
these damn things ?

503
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:25,209
'cause you're an idiot.

504
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,428
Oh, yeah, that's it.

505
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,564
You two.

506
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:33,801
Well, great pate, but I'm
gonna have to motor if I wanna
be ready for that funeral.

507
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:40,976
[ man ]
I blame not Heather...

508
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:44,463
But rather a society...

That tells its youth...

510
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:51,837
That the answers can be found
in the MTV video games.

<i>We must pray that
the other teenagers
of Sherwood, Ohio...</i>

of that righteous dude...

513

Who can solve
their problems.

514
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:08,753
It's Jesus Christ.
And he's in the book.

516
00:38:16,947 --> 00:38:18,981
O God,
this is a tragic thing...

517
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:22,284
And sometimes
I have a hard time
dealing with it and stuff.

518
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:24,386
Please send Heather
to Heaven and all that.

519
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:27,656
Dear God,
please make sure
this never happens to me...

520
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,925
'cause I don't think
I can handle suicide.

521
00:38:29,993 --> 00:38:34,129

into an Ivy league school, and
please let it be Harvard.  Amen.

522
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:39,601

why did you have
to kill such hot snatch ?

523
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:43,506

Jeez, people are so serious.

524

Hail Mary who aren't in Heaven,
pray for all us sinners
so we don't get caught.

525
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:50,180
Another joke, man.

526
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:53,816
I prayed for the death
of Heather Chandler many times.

527
00:38:53,884 --> 00:38:57,319
And I felt bad
every time I did it,
but I kept doing it anyway.

528
00:38:57,387 --> 00:39:00,255
Now I know
you understood everything.

529
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:03,192

Hallelujah.

Technically, I did not kill
Heather Chandler.

532

But hey, who am I trying
to kid, right ?

533

to be a nice place.  Amen.

Did that sound bitchy ?

535
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:28,318
Veronica.  What are
you doing tonight ?

536
00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:34,057
I don't know.  Mourning.
Maybe watch some TV.  Why ?

537
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:37,877
Well, ram
asked me out tonight,

538
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:40,546
But he wants
to double with Kurt...

539
00:39:40,615 --> 00:39:43,884
And Kurt doesn't
have a date.

540
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:46,286
Heather, I have
something going with J.D.

541

Please, Veronica,
put Billy the kid
on hold tonight.

So we on tonight, man,
or what ?

I still gotta talk
to Heather, dude.

is my locker combination.

It's just that we're
talking teen suicide here.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:42,359
We were wondering
if you had any poems
or artwork that Heather did...

Well-well, take a look.

It's a two-page layout
with her suicide note
right up here in the corner.

00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,593
It's more tasteful
than it sounds.

last night.

of your little date.

Yeah, and I left him drunk
and flailing in cow shit.

He was really detailed.

to Neanderthals

had a nice little sword fight
in your mouth last night.

all those things you've been
saying to really happen.

a fantasy of mine

I don't get the point
of me writing
a suicide note...

When we're just gonna
be shooting them
with blanks.

Enough to cause a little blood
but no real damage.

640
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,589

See, we shoot Kurt and ram,
make it look like
they shot each other.

they regain consciousness,

They'll be

is not incredible.

You can't bring him back.
You must know that.

835

to bring anybody back,
except maybe myself.

you were cool.

Where did you get this ?

846
01:02:04,912 --> 01:02:09,266
Oh, I just had
the nicest little chat
with miss dumptruck.

847
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:11,335
Got along famously.

848
01:02:11,403 --> 01:02:14,838
It's kind of scary
how everybody's got
a little story to tell.

What is this, blackmail ?

01:02:23,516 --> 01:02:25,584
I'll give you
a week's lunch money.

I don't want your money.
I want your strength.

853
01:02:31,223 --> 01:02:36,093
I mean Westerberg does
not need mushy togetherness.
It needs a strong leader.

854
01:02:36,161 --> 01:02:39,763
Heather Chandler
was that leader, but--

855
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:42,366
But she couldn't handle it.

856
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:44,502

And now it's your turn
to take the helm.

860
01:02:55,047 --> 01:02:58,483
What about the photographs ?
Oh, don't worry.

861
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:00,785
I'll ask you
to do me a favor,

862
01:03:00,853 --> 01:03:02,854
And it'll be one
you'll enjoy.

863
01:03:02,921 --> 01:03:05,590
Then you'll
get the negatives
and everything back then.

864

Don't you start
getting cocky on me now, girl.

I know I'm not as exciting
as your other friends.

Okay, I French kissed
Al Springer once,

You know, betty,
your daydreams are a lot better
than my realities, believe me.

I mean, uh, go ahead,
knock me out.

It's the only way

the Westerberg suicides
were tough on all of us.

898
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:39,106
But we shared the pain...

899
01:06:39,174 --> 01:06:42,210
Of losing
three very popular students.

900
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:45,913
I came into the cafeteria,
asked them to hold hands.

Hey, isn't that
that flake we met
at the open house ?

And there's Heather.
Where are you, Veronica ?

908
01:07:07,636 --> 01:07:12,074
Before a teenager decides
to kill himself, there are
certain facts he should know.

909

After all,
this is a decision
that affects all of us,

These little programs

They're making it sound
like it's a cool thing to do.

Are you trying to tell me
it is not a time
for troubled youth ?

917
01:07:44,156 --> 01:07:47,792
- Stand up straight.
- All we want is to be treated
like human beings.

01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:52,263
Not to be experimented on
like guinea pigs or patronized

When teenagers complain
that they want to be treated
like human beings,

925
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:12,818
It's usually because they are
being treated like human beings.

<i>To become a statistic
in U.S.-Fucking-A. Today.</i>

995
01:12:07,675 --> 01:12:10,844
Now, that is about
the least private thing
I can think of.

996
01:12:12,146 --> 01:12:16,149
- What about Heather
and Kurt and ram ?
- [ sighs ]

997
01:12:17,318 --> 01:12:20,453
If everyone
jumped off a bridge,
would you ?

998
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:25,258
Probably.

999
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:31,131
You know, if you were
happy every day of your life,
you wouldn't be a human being.

1000
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,667
You'd be a game show host.

1001
01:12:33,735 --> 01:12:36,436
What do you say
we knock off early,
buy some shoes,

1002
01:12:36,504 --> 01:12:38,572
Something lame like that ?

1003
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,608
Okay.

1004
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:49,216
So, it's, uh, come to this.

1005
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:52,836
Heather Chandler did polls.
I want you to do a petition,

1006
01:12:52,903 --> 01:12:55,805
<i>As a favor,
as the favor.</i>

1007
01:12:55,873 --> 01:12:58,775
You've, uh,
heard of the group
big fun, right ?

1008
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:01,879
That's right.
"teenage suicide
don't do it."

1009
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:04,949
Right.
Some teenie bopper rag
says that,

1010
01:13:05,017 --> 01:13:07,151
Uh, they want to play a prom.

1011
01:13:07,218 --> 01:13:11,255
Now, it could be Westerberg’s
if we get everybody's
John Hancock.

1012
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:14,959
I'll get right on it, coach.
Oh, a little gift for you.

1013
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:17,327
I won't be needing it.

1014
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,346
Heather ?
Veronica.

1015
01:13:52,414 --> 01:13:55,049
<i>Color me stoked, girl.</i>

1016
01:13:55,116 --> 01:13:57,751
I've gotten everyone
to sign this petition,

1017
01:13:57,819 --> 01:14:00,754
Even the ones who think
big fun are tuneless,
gyro fags.

1018
01:14:00,822 --> 01:14:03,992
People love me.  You know,
you haven't signed yet.

1019
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,495
People love you,
but I know you.

1020
01:14:07,563 --> 01:14:10,398
Jennifer Forbes told me
the petition she signed...

1021
01:14:10,466 --> 01:14:12,667
Was to put a hot tub
in the cafeteria.

1022
01:14:12,734 --> 01:14:17,138
- And Doug Hilton said--
- some people need different
kinds of convincing.

1023
01:14:17,206 --> 01:14:19,307
<i>Look, just
sign the petition, okay ?</i>

1024
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:21,476
Don't talk to me
like that, okay ?

1025
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:23,878
Look,
it was J.D.’s idea.

1026
01:14:23,946 --> 01:14:25,981
<i>He made out
the signature sheet
and everything.</i>

1027
01:14:26,048 --> 01:14:30,085
<i>So why don't you
just sign it ?
No.</i>

1028
01:14:31,887 --> 01:14:33,889
Jealous much ?

1029
01:14:37,594 --> 01:14:40,096
Heather, why can't you
just be a friend ?

1030
01:14:40,163 --> 01:14:42,064
Why are you
such a mega bitch ?

1031
01:14:42,132 --> 01:14:45,267
[ chuckles ]
because I can be.

1032
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,837
Veronica, why are you
pulling my dick ?

1033
01:14:48,905 --> 01:14:51,373
<i>Do you think--  I mean,
do you really think...</i>

1034
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,641
If betty Finn's
fairy godmother made her cool,

1035
01:14:53,709 --> 01:14:56,211
She would still hang out
with her dweebette friends ?

1036
01:14:56,278 --> 01:14:58,513
<i>[ chuckles ]
no way, Veronica.</i>

1037
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,482
Uh-uh.

1038
01:15:09,576 --> 01:15:11,644
[ J.D. ]
you want to go out tonight ?

1039
01:15:12,813 --> 01:15:15,782
Catch a movie ?
You know, some miniature golf ?

1040
01:15:17,484 --> 01:15:20,820
I was thinking more
along the lines of slitting
Heather Duke's wrists open,

1041
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:22,822
Making it
look like a suicide.

1042
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,691
Ah, now you're talking.
I could be up for that.

1043
01:15:25,759 --> 01:15:30,396
<i>I've already started
underlining meaningful passages
in her copy of Moby Dick,</i>

1044
01:15:30,463 --> 01:15:32,531
If you know what I mean.

1045
01:15:34,367 --> 01:15:36,636
I knew you'd be back,
Veronica.

1046
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:40,974
I knew it.
I was positive.
I was sure.

1047
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:43,777
Ugh !

1048
01:15:44,813 --> 01:15:48,481
It's over, J.D.  Over.
Grow up !

1049
01:15:48,817 --> 01:15:52,668
I don't get it.
I mean, you were wrong.
I was right.

1050
01:15:54,904 --> 01:15:57,106
<i>Strength, damn it !</i>

1051
01:15:58,408 --> 01:16:00,476
Come on, come back.

1052
01:16:09,587 --> 01:16:11,321
Yes ?

1053
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:13,790
Y-your friend Jason Dean
stopped by.

1054
01:16:13,858 --> 01:16:15,825
He seemed very
concerned about you.

1055
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:19,496
He said that he thought
you might try to kill yourself.

1056
01:16:19,564 --> 01:16:23,400
You have been depressed lately.
Oh, he left this for you.

1057
01:16:28,839 --> 01:16:32,709
Oh.  Oh, my God !

1058
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,532
He said that
we should keep you
away from sharp objects,

1059
01:16:37,599 --> 01:16:41,269
Uh, closed garage doors,
chemical, uh, substances--

1060
01:16:41,337 --> 01:16:43,538
Uh, prescription drugs.
Prescription drugs.

1061
01:17:21,677 --> 01:17:25,746
"to neither love nor reverence
will thou be kind ?

1062
01:17:26,815 --> 01:17:30,485
"and even for hate,
thou canst but kill.

1063
01:17:31,487 --> 01:17:33,555
And all are killed."

1064
01:17:35,023 --> 01:17:38,127
I like it.
It's got that, uh,

1065
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:43,532
"what a cruel world,
so let's toss ourselves in
the abyss" type ambience, huh ?

1066
01:17:45,802 --> 01:17:48,920
Come on.
It's Heather's copy
of Moby Dick.

1067
01:17:51,257 --> 01:17:54,158
Why don't you
give it a try, huh ?
Underline something.

1068
01:17:55,694 --> 01:17:58,696
Get off of my bed,
you fucking psycho !

1069
01:17:58,764 --> 01:18:02,633
You're a rebel ?
Do you actually think
you're a rebel ?

1070
01:18:02,701 --> 01:18:05,703
You're not a rebel.
You're a fucking psychotic.

1071
01:18:07,272 --> 01:18:09,941
You say tomato,
I say "to-mah-to."

1072
01:18:11,944 --> 01:18:15,814
Hold it.
"Eskimo."  that--

1073
01:18:15,882 --> 01:18:17,883
That's one word.

1074
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,586
I love it.
I usually go for
the whole sentence myself.

1075
01:18:20,653 --> 01:18:23,221
<i>But this is perfecto.</i>

1076
01:18:23,289 --> 01:18:28,260
Eskimo.
You know, it's so,
uh, mysterious.

1077
01:18:28,327 --> 01:18:33,331
Es-ki-mo.
[ sighs ]

1078
01:18:36,152 --> 01:18:38,086
Come on.

1079
01:18:38,154 --> 01:18:40,089
J--

1080
01:18:40,157 --> 01:18:42,692
J.D., you are not
even listening to me.

1081
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,896
Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag !

1082
01:18:47,632 --> 01:18:49,900
<i>That-that-that knife
is filthy.</i>

1083
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:53,503
What do you think
I'm going to do with it,
take out her tonsils ?

1084
01:18:53,571 --> 01:18:56,906
Excuse me.
I think I know Heather
a little better than you do.

1085
01:18:56,973 --> 01:19:00,042
<i>If she was going
to slit her wrist,
the knife would spotless.</i>

1086
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:05,313
All right, how's this, huh ?
Can you see your fucking
reflection in the thing ?

1087
01:19:08,184 --> 01:19:11,320
Tomorrow, someone else
is just going to move
into her place.

1088
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:14,524
That person could be me.

1089
01:19:18,863 --> 01:19:21,965
Ha !  There's only one of us
who knows how to do
Heather's handwriting.

1090
01:19:22,033 --> 01:19:25,268
And if you think
I'm going to write another
suicide note, you're wrong.

1091
01:19:25,335 --> 01:19:27,671
You don't get it,
do you ?

1092
01:19:27,738 --> 01:19:29,873
I mean,
society nods its head
at any horror...

1093
01:19:29,941 --> 01:19:33,476
The American teenager
can think to bring upon itself.

1094
01:19:33,544 --> 01:19:36,546
Nobody's going to care
about exact handwriting.

1095
01:19:36,614 --> 01:19:39,348
How ridic--  look.

1096
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:50,143
"life... Sucks."

1097
01:19:52,531 --> 01:19:54,498
<i>It's perfecto.</i>

1098
01:19:54,566 --> 01:19:59,436
<i>Ha.  Jesus !  I mean,
I've got a meaningfully
marked-up Moby Dick.</i>

1099
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,904
What else
does a suicide need, huh ?

1100
01:20:01,972 --> 01:20:04,140
Now if you'll excuse me--

1101
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:12,316
No !

1102
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:19,089
Open the door !

1103
01:20:27,015 --> 01:20:29,082
Eskimo.

1104
01:20:33,021 --> 01:20:38,091
<i>Heather Duke
underlined a lot of things
in this copy of Moby Dick.</i>

1105
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:41,845
But I believe
the word "Eskimo,"

1106
01:20:41,913 --> 01:20:44,449
Underlined all by itself,

1107
01:20:44,516 --> 01:20:48,320
Is the key
to understanding Heather's pain.

1108
01:20:48,387 --> 01:20:52,424
On the surface, Heather Duke
was the vivacious young lady...

1109
01:20:52,491 --> 01:20:54,759
We all knew her to be.

1110
01:20:54,827 --> 01:20:58,528
But her soul
was in Antarctica,

1111
01:20:58,997 --> 01:21:03,384
Freezing with the knowledge
of the way fellow teenagers...

1112
01:21:03,452 --> 01:21:05,586
Can be cruel,

1113
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:10,458
The way that parents
can be unresponsive...

1114
01:21:10,525 --> 01:21:14,829
And, as she writes so eloquently
in her suicide note,

1115
01:21:15,131 --> 01:21:17,949
The way that life
can suck !

1116
01:21:19,652 --> 01:21:23,421
We'll all miss
Sherwood’s little Eskimo.

1117
01:21:25,007 --> 01:21:29,711
Let's just hope she's
rubbing noses with Jesus.

1118
01:21:29,778 --> 01:21:32,280
Is this turnout weak
or what ?

1119
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:36,518
I had at least
70 more people
at my funeral.

1120
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:40,455
Heather ?

1121
01:21:43,309 --> 01:21:45,344
<i>God, Veronica,</i>

1122
01:21:45,412 --> 01:21:48,697
My afterlife
is so boring.

1123
01:21:48,765 --> 01:21:53,368
<i>If I have to sing
"kumbaya" one more time--
what are you doing here ?</i>

1124
01:21:54,571 --> 01:21:59,841
I made your favorite--
spaghetti, lots of oregano.

1125
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:04,979
Dinner !

1126
01:22:06,432 --> 01:22:08,916
[ mom ]
Veronica, dinner !

1127
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:35,677
Dear diary, last entry.

1128
01:22:35,745 --> 01:22:41,017
No one can stop J.D.--
Not the FBI, the M.I.T.
Or the P.T.A.

1129
01:22:41,084 --> 01:22:45,554
He once told me
that the extreme
always makes an impression.

1130
01:22:45,622 --> 01:22:47,790
Well, now it's my turn.

1131
01:22:47,858 --> 01:22:50,627
Let's see
how the son of a bitch
reacts to a suicide...

1132
01:22:50,694 --> 01:22:52,762
He didn't perform himself.

1133
01:23:29,017 --> 01:23:30,951
I can't believe you did it.

1134
01:23:31,019 --> 01:23:35,923
I was teasing.
I loved you.

1135
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:40,194
Sure, I was--  I was
coming up here to kill you.

1136
01:23:42,096 --> 01:23:46,900
First I was going to try
and get you back
with my amazing petition.

1137
01:23:50,339 --> 01:23:52,406
It's a shame you
can't see what our, uh,

1138
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:54,843
Fellow students
really signed.

1139
01:23:58,547 --> 01:24:00,681
All right, listen.

1140
01:24:01,951 --> 01:24:03,884
[ sighs ]

1141
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:07,221
"we students
of Westerberg high will die...

1142
01:24:07,288 --> 01:24:09,489
"today.

1143
01:24:09,557 --> 01:24:13,160
"our burning bodies
will be the ultimate protest...

1144
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:16,163
"to a society
that degrades us.

1145
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:19,300
Fuck you all."

1146
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:22,203
It's not really subtle,

1147
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:26,341
But, uh, neither is blowing up
a whole school, now is it ?

1148
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:30,644
Talk about
your suicide pacts, huh ?

1149
01:24:32,681 --> 01:24:35,984
When our school
blows up tomorrow,

1150
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:39,453
It's going to be
the kind of thing
to infect a generation.

1151
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:42,490
I mean, it's going to be
a Woodstock for the '80s.

1152
01:24:51,634 --> 01:24:53,702
Damn it, Veronica.

1153
01:24:55,906 --> 01:24:59,108
We could have toasted
some marshmallows together.

1154
01:25:01,794 --> 01:25:04,595
What does she want,
a written invitation ?

1155
01:25:04,663 --> 01:25:06,948
