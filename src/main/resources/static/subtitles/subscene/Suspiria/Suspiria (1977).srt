1
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,962
Suzy Bannion decided to
perfect her ballet studies...

2
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,798
In the most famous school
of dance in Europe.

3
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,635
She chose the celebrated
academy of Freiburg.

4
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:55,472
One day at 9:00 in the morning,
She left Kennedy airport, New york,

5
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:59,310
And arrived in Germany at
10:40 p.m. Local time.

6
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,897
Taxi!

7
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,401
Taxi, taxi!

8
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,739
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

9
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,672
Taxi! Taxi!

10
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,677
Can you give me a hand?

11
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,697
Uh, Escherstrausse.

12
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:19,950
- Was?
- Escherstrausse.

13
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,953
Was?

14
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,960
Ah, Escherstrausse.

15
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,296
Ja, ja.

16
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:26,017
Has it been raining this hard for long?

17
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:34,275
Half an hour.

18
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,929
Can you wait a minute, please?

19
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,700
- Hello?
- Who is it?

20
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:10,205
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.

21
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:13,707
- I don't know you. Go away!
- But I have the letter you sent.

22
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,211
Look, it's really raining hard. You
could just let me in and I'll explain.

23
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,714
- Go away. Go away!
- But you don't understand!

24
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:25,720
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.

25
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,225
Hello. Is anybody there?

26
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,228
Hello?

27
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:55,560
If you're happy enough with the couch,
you can stay for as long as you please.

28
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,062
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.

29
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:02,065
- I'm going away forever.
- Oh, big deal, kid.

30
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,569
So what if you've been
thrown out of school?

31
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,572
I always got kicked out of school,
beginning in kindergarten.

32
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:12,076
No, that's not it. I don't give a
damn about getting kicked out.

33
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,328
Well, then?

34
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,830
It's useless to try and explain it to you.

35
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,832
You wouldn't understand.

36
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,336
It all seems so... Absurd,

37
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,338
So fantastic.

38
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:29,260
All I can do is get away from
here as soon as possible.

39
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:32,346
Would you mind if I used the
bathroom? I'd like to dry off.

40
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:34,766
No, of course not. Go ahead.

41
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,791
Hey, why don't you close it?

42
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:05,797
That's better. It was just the wind.

43
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,801
You sure are in bad shape.

44
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:13,136
You have to tell me all about it.

45
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:17,140
The wind! The windows burst open.

46
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,645
- I got scared.
- No. That's not it.

47
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:24,148
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.

48
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:31,155
Okay, you can tell me about it later.

49
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,630
Let me in! Pat!

50
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,385
Pat! Pat!

51
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:05,476
Help me! Help me!
There's a murderer!

52
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:12,150
Help me! Help!
There's a murderer!

53
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,492
Help me! Help!

54
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,912
No! No! No!

55
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,761
Help me!

56
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,772
Help!

57
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:58,029
There's a murderer!

58
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:21,886
No!

59
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,918
Good morning. Good morning, Daniel.

60
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,921
Good morning, miss Tanner.

61
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:25,844
- Good morning. May I help you?
- Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.

62
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:28,846
We expected you yesterday evening.
You wrote us that--

63
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,348
Right. I did arrive
last night about 10:00.

64
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:34,351
But the door was locked,
and somebody on the call box...

65
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,854
Said they didn't know who
I was and couldn't let me in.

66
00:15:36,855 --> 00:15:40,357
- Who said that to you?
- I don't know. She didn't say her name.

67
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm so sorry. At any rate,
Now you're here among us,

68
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:47,865
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss
Tanner, one of the instructors.

69
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:49,867
Nice to meet you.

70
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:52,870
Come along. I'd like to
introduce you to madame Blanc,

71
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:54,872
Our vice directress.

72
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,874
She was a very famous ballerina.

73
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,877
- Madame Blanc?
- Yes?

74
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,213
Suzy Bannion, our new student.

75
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,965
Oh, yes.

76
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,887
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Of course, madame.

77
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:14,892
You're pretty. Very pretty
indeed. They're policemen.

78
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:19,396
I knew a woman called Bannion years
ago in New York. Carol Bannion.

79
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:22,399
- She's my aunt.
- Good! She's a marvelous woman,

80
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,902
A friend and benefactress
of artists everywhere.

81
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:28,406
I'm delighted to have her niece here.

82
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,492
Well, I offer our academy's official
welcome in the name of our directress,

83
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,994
Who unfortunately is not
here at the moment.

84
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:36,497
- She's traveling abroad.
- Thank you.

85
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:40,501
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.

86
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:43,504
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.

87
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:45,507
I must tell you what I
have to say very quickly...

88
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,008
Because those gentlemen
are waiting for me.

89
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:51,011
Something terrible, truly
horrible, has happened.

90
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:56,016
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was
expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,

91
00:16:56,017 --> 00:17:00,270
Was murdered last night by some
madman. It's a frightening story.

92
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,773
But I always warn our students,
Don't I, miss Tanner?

93
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:05,276
I tell them to be careful, not to get
involved with questionable friendships.

94
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:09,279
What I wanted to tell you was that
your room here isn't free yet.

95
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,282
- Just a slight hitch.
- Yes, but don't worry.

96
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:15,786
We've found you a place to stay with one of
our third-year students who lives in town.

97
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:19,289
You'll have to pay 50 of your
American dollars a week,

98
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,292
But it's a good price, and you can
deduct it from your fee here.

99
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:25,797
Now I entrust you to the care of miss
Tanner, one of our veteran teachers here.

100
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:31,802
Don't be upset if she seems a little stern or surly.
It's only her manner. She's even that way with me.

101
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:34,806
She really is an invaluable teacher.

102
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:39,226
- Come with me.
- And now, gentlemen--

103
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:42,479
As you know, our courses last three years,

104
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,983
And you must pass an exam
at the end of each year.

105
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,985
So, the girl left the school
About 11:00 in the evening?

106
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:51,989
- That's my information.
- Excuse me.

107
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,492
When I got here last night about 11:00,
I saw a girl leaving the school.

108
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,996
She's a new student. She just
arrived. What did she look like?

109
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:03,001
Well, she had blonde hair and
was wearing a brown raincoat.

110
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:07,504
- What did she do?
- I don't know. I only saw her for a minute in a storm.

111
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:10,507
So you see? It really was 11:00.

112
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:13,511
Coming?

113
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:18,515
We don't teach you how to dance here, because
we presume our students already know how.

114
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:22,519
This is an established academy
dedicated to specializing.

115
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,522
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.

116
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:28,275
He's really ugly, isn't he?
Don't be afraid to say so.

117
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:31,111
He can't understand you, anyway.
He speaks only Romanian.

118
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:35,617
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth.

119
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,623
Last year, he discovered He
had gingivitis of the gums,

120
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:45,125
So he had all his teeth pulled.

121
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:48,128
The top row one morning.
The bottom row a day later.

122
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,130
Bang.

123
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,633
- Where are we going?
- To the locker room.

124
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:56,137
We also have a swimming pool,
which you can use when you want.

125
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:04,061
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.

126
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:07,064
- Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.
- Who said that? Shut up.

127
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:09,566
That's enough of these little
games for the moment.

128
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:13,570
I want to introduce Suzy
Bannion, our new student.

129
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:17,575
You'll find several fellow Americans
among these girls--Miriam, for one.

130
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:20,577
- Hello. -Hi. -Your
locker's over there.

131
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:23,080
You'll find everything
in there except shoes.

132
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:27,084
For today, you can borrow shoes
from someone who has two pairs.

133
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:31,089
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting
for all of you in the red room.

134
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,092
Come with me.

135
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,104
Mata Hari is going to file her report.

136
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:52,609
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.

137
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,611
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

138
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:57,614
They tell me you have
to give me $50 a week.

139
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:00,117
- Yeah.
- In advance.

140
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:02,619
Well, don't worry. If
you think I'm not--Oh--

141
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,624
Don't get hot under the collar.
That's how people are here.

142
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,628
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?

143
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:14,631
- Yes. Me.
- Oh, thank you.

144
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:17,634
If you want to buy them, I can make
you a nice price. Fifteen marks.

145
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:20,637
Oh, no, thanks. I already
have some in my suitcase.

146
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:22,640
I just need a pair for today.

147
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:24,642
But if you'd rather not--

148
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:27,644
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.

149
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:30,648
- But, uh, Give them back, hmm?
- Of course.

150
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:37,654
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

151
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,657
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.

152
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:47,664
Did they shake you up with all
that talk about money?

153
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,667
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.

154
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,169
Same with me at first.

155
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,672
Then I found out it's a
charming habit around here.

156
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:03,180
I once read that names...

157
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:06,683
Which begin With the letter "S"...

158
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:09,187
Are the names of snakes.

159
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,361
Next year, after I finish the course,

160
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:20,364
I've got an offer from the
state school of ballet in Geneva.

161
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:23,367
What about you?

162
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:27,372
Well, I'll go back to the states,
but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.

163
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:30,874
Hey, thanks.
My room is really pretty.

164
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,876
- Like it?
- Uh-huh.

165
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:37,381
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do
nicely together. I think you're sweet.

166
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,383
Even if I have the name of a snake?

167
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:41,385
I was just kidding.

168
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:43,887
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.

169
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:46,391
No.

170
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:52,396
Hello?

171
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:55,399
Oh, hi! No, no, no.

172
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,402
You did the right thing.

173
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:00,905
- Hi.
- Hi.

174
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:03,157
Oh, you didn't have to
bring these over here.

175
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:05,660
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.

176
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:08,162
I thought you might be needing them.

177
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:10,165
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.

178
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,669
- Anyway, thanks a lot.
- Oh, no. It's nothing.

179
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,171
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

180
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:20,174
- Don't you want to stay for a while?
- No, thanks. I can't.

181
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:24,178
I live at the school, so I've got to
be back for supper in half an hour.

182
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,180
- I have to.
- Just for a minute?

183
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:28,682
No, no, really. I have to be going.

184
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:31,685
They get very upset if you
show up late for supper.

185
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:36,190
- Okay, Sunday. No, not before lunchtime.
- Well, ciao.

186
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,692
See you tomorrow.

187
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:40,694
Bye.

188
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,697
No, go on.

189
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:46,701
Uh-huh, I know.

190
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:50,705
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can
hear you very well.

191
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:52,707
Didn't you see how he was blushing?

192
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,709
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um--

193
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,213
And he never has enough money
for room and board at school.

194
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:01,715
That's why that bitch Tanner
has got him under her thumb.

195
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:04,218
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.

196
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:07,221
Sure.

197
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:09,223
I got it. Okay.

198
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:12,226
Call me back tomorrow evening.
Give me a chance to think it over.

199
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:14,561
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

200
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:17,064
Anyway, he is cute.

201
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:20,068
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.

202
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,071
That poor kid, ending up like that.

203
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:26,574
I can't even think about it.

204
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:29,077
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.

205
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:32,079
Uh-huh. Outside the school.

206
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,582
She was acting very strange.

207
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,584
Mumbling to herself.

208
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:42,257
She really felt terrible when they kicked
her out, but she really deserved it.

209
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:47,261
- There was so much noise.
- God, was she difficult.

210
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:49,763
She was saying things that made no sense.

211
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:53,268
She was always arguing, causing trouble.

212
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:56,521
"Secret."

213
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:59,273
"Iris."

214
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,775
What?

215
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:05,279
Uh, I remember...

216
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,282
She mentioned the word "secret."

217
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:11,285
And then she... Mentioned a flower--

218
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:13,287
Iris, I think, or a lilac.

219
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:15,789
Secret flowers? What's
that supposed to mean?

220
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,792
I don't know. She was a busybody.

221
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:22,797
It would've been easy for her to
find out one of us was in a jam.

222
00:24:52,744 --> 00:24:55,746
- How do you like it at Olga's?
- It's nice.

223
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:59,751
Those eight on the list this morning,
come with me to the yellow room.

224
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:05,756
Good morning, miss Tanner. Suzy.

225
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:08,759
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- I've got good news for you.

226
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,763
We have it all arranged.
Your room is ready for you.

227
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:14,766
Isn't that marvelous? You can
move in today, if you like.

228
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:17,268
But I'd rather stay at
Olga's, if it's okay.

229
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:19,770
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,

230
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:22,773
But in your letter of enrollment, you
said you'd be boarding at the school.

231
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:25,776
- I know, but--
- The room is free now.

232
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:29,279
- Well, I didn't think it was so important.
- As you wish.

233
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,783
If that's what you want, so be it.

234
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:46,297
Sara?

235
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,302
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.

236
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:55,305
I see that when you make up
your mind about something,

237
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:57,808
Nothing will change it for you.

238
00:25:57,809 --> 00:25:59,811
My compliments.

239
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:43,354
Witch!

240
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:43,748
And then, toward the end
of the 19th century,

241
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:46,750
The technique of classical ballet...

242
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:50,255
Assumed a different, more
stylized impostation.

243
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:54,259
All right. Let's warm up.

244
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,261
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

245
00:27:57,262 --> 00:28:00,764
No, it's nothing. I just
feel a little weak.

246
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:03,267
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.

247
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:05,269
And now some exercises.

248
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,273
Daniel, you may begin.

249
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:17,447
One, two, three and four.

250
00:28:17,448 --> 00:28:19,950
And one and two...

251
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:22,453
And three and four.

252
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,038
And one and two...

253
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,040
And three and four.

254
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,042
- And one--
- I'm sorry, miss Tanner.

255
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:31,545
I feel a little weak. Can I
just rest for a second?

256
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:34,798
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.

257
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,302
This is the first time
we've worked together.

258
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:40,305
I want to see what you can do,
how far along you are.

259
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:44,309
Now, come along and join the others.
Come on; Let's go.

260
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,060
Daniel?

261
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:50,064
All together now.

262
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:55,068
And one and two...

263
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:58,072
And three and four.

264
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:02,576
- I can't. Please.
- And one and two...

265
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:04,579
And three and four.

266
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:10,084
And one and two and three and four.

267
00:29:10,335 --> 00:29:14,338
And one and two and three and four.

268
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:18,593
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs
up higher. You're not paralyzed.

269
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:25,015
Get those legs up higher.
And one and two and three and--

270
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:28,101
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...

271
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:30,604
And three and four.

272
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:34,609
And one and two and three and four.

273
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:07,808
Come on. Come on. Run along.

274
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,310
Come on. Drink up.

275
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:13,313
- Oh, you--You must drink.
- No, that's enough.

276
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:15,816
You heard what the doctor said.

277
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:18,318
- Drink up.
- No.

278
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,321
You must drink.

279
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:23,407
The blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids.

280
00:30:23,408 --> 00:30:27,411
- Right, professor Verdegast?
- Obviously.

281
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:29,913
My dear madame.

282
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:33,917
Do not be concerned. It's nothing,
as I've already told the young lady.

283
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:36,920
That's a relief, professor.
How do you feel, dear?

284
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:39,924
- Uh, better.
- The fault lies with your exercises.

285
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:45,429
When somebody's been out of practice, violent movement
could cause tiny tears in internal ligaments.

286
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,432
Thus the hemorrhaging.

287
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:51,435
You look better already. You've
even got color back in your cheeks.

288
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:53,516
- Isn't that right?
- Oh, yes. She looks much better.

289
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,440
- Ow!
- Hold still.

290
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,943
This will get you back
into shape in no time.

291
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:04,949
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two,
you'll be on your feet, as good as new.

292
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:11,955
- Who brought my bags here?
- Olga. What a dear.

293
00:31:11,956 --> 00:31:15,076
The minute she heard you were ill, she
went right home and brought your things.

294
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,962
Oh, and she also left me your $50,
and she didn't take a penny of it.

295
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:21,965
Why--Why did she do that?

296
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:24,968
- If I wanted to, I would--
- Well, my dear,

297
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:27,971
What you need now is
some peace and quiet.

298
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:31,475
If the hemorrhaging should start
again, which is very improbable,

299
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:33,977
You can telephone me.

300
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:37,482
And Tanner, she is to eat
bland food for about a week.

301
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:39,984
And you mustn't let
her have any fruit.

302
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:42,486
- A drop of vin rose?
- Yes.

303
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:45,989
Good. A glass of red wine with
each meal. It works miracles.

304
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,494
Clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles. It builds the blood.

305
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:53,498
Rest well. You're in good hands.

306
00:32:17,272 --> 00:32:20,774
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.

307
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:23,777
So, you moved in here.

308
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,780
Well, they moved me in here.

309
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,783
I really didn't want to.

310
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:32,286
You know, as soon as I got sick,
your pal Olga ran and got my bags...

311
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:34,288
And threw me out of her place.

312
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:37,792
She must've thought I had
something awfully contagious.

313
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:42,796
But I can't stand to live in a
boarding school like a ten-year-old.

314
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:45,799
Oh, wow. You come back strong.

315
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,302
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.

316
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:51,805
I mean, it's almost as if nothing
had happened. It's incredible.

317
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:55,309
- And all thanks to professor Verdegast.
- Verdegast?

318
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,311
- He came to look at you?
- Yeah.

319
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:59,814
Come in.

320
00:33:02,317 --> 00:33:04,319
Hi, Pavlos.

321
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:17,248
Thank you.

322
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,252
You'd better keep an eye on that
lighter. He really likes it.

323
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:24,254
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.

324
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:26,256
At least you know.

325
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:30,260
- Are you eating up here?
- Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.

326
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:33,263
And on a restricted diet,
they give you wine?

327
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:37,268
That's professor Verdegast's idea.
Says it'll build up my blood.

328
00:33:43,608 --> 00:33:46,610
The bell. Oh, god. That means
it's only 15 minutes till supper.

329
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:49,112
I'd better change.

330
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:52,116
- Ciao. See you later.
- Okay.

331
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:24,708
Where? Where?

332
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:26,711
Everywhere. The whole floor.

333
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,713
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!

334
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:32,216
- Where are they coming from?
- I don't know! Let's go and see!

335
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:35,720
- They're coming from the ceiling.
- In the meantime, everybody downstairs.

336
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,902
Don't let anyone come up.

337
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:50,460
I'm sorry. Truly mortified.
Please excuse me.

338
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:52,462
But it was nothing to do
with you, madame.

339
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:55,465
No, of course not, girls.
It was not madame Blanc's fault.

340
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:58,219
We ordered those cases
of food by mail...

341
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,722
From a reliable firm that
we thought to be honest.

342
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:02,640
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.

343
00:37:03,141 --> 00:37:05,142
In a few days' time,
you see what happened.

344
00:37:05,143 --> 00:37:07,895
- Oh, it was awful.
- Yes, one got in my mouth.

345
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:11,899
I suppose we're fortunate those things
only reached the floor below the attic.

346
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,902
- Are the other floors all right?
- Yes. We checked them out.

347
00:37:14,903 --> 00:37:16,904
Just the floor where the
students' rooms are.

348
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,907
Well, I'll take care of the problem
of fumigating in the morning.

349
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:23,410
In the meantime, for tonight, I've
thought of a makeshift arrangement.

350
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:25,914
Go and see how they're getting
along, will you, dear?

351
00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:29,917
The boys have kindly offered to help,

352
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:32,798
And they and the servants are turning
the practice hall into a dormitory.

353
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:36,423
If some of you choose to find hotel
rooms, I'll have no objections.

354
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:38,425
But it's already late,
and in any case,

355
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,427
The inconvenience will only
be for one night.

356
00:37:40,428 --> 00:37:42,764
We'll all sleep together.

357
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,266
- Bravo.
- You all right?

358
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,770
- Yes, thank you.
- Fine.

359
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,272
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.

360
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:53,274
- Good.
- Are you all right?

361
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:55,276
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.

362
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:58,279
- Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.
- Good.

363
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,782
Are you sleeping here with
us, too, Madame Blanc?

364
00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:03,522
Certainly, as are all the other
teachers and miss Tanner.

365
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:06,286
Do the teachers live here at school?

366
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:08,288
No, they live in town.

367
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:11,793
They leave after supper at
9:30, just like clockwork.

368
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,360
It's very late. You won't be afraid
if I turn out the lights?

369
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:16,965
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night. Good night.

370
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:58,672
Is that guy hot for you?

371
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:00,633
- Maybe.
- That's funny.

372
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:03,552
I heard he was, uh--

373
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:09,100
- Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.
- That's a good one.

374
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:11,685
Come on. You tried to get
him and didn't make it.

375
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:13,645
- You liar! That's not--
- Why don't you two shut up?

376
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:16,191
Some of us want to go to sleep.

377
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:24,699
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.

378
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:48,116
Suzy, are you asleep?

379
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,869
- Were you sleeping?
- No. What's the matter?

380
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,997
You hear that snoring?

381
00:40:54,998 --> 00:40:57,875
It's weird.

382
00:40:57,876 --> 00:41:00,752
Hear it?

383
00:41:00,753 --> 00:41:03,131
Where do you think it's coming from?

384
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,806
Behind the sheet.

385
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:15,309
Lies!

386
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,395
What?

387
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:22,900
They lied to us.

388
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:25,402
The directress is here.

389
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:28,906
That's her, the one who's snoring.

390
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:31,408
She's the directress.

391
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:33,870
- How do you know?
- I'm sure it's her.

392
00:41:37,165 --> 00:41:39,208
Last year, for a while,

393
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:41,335
I lived in one of the guest rooms...

394
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:43,505
Under the top of the stairs.

395
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,009
One night,

396
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,763
I heard someone coming very late in,

397
00:41:52,764 --> 00:41:55,934
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.

398
00:41:57,018 --> 00:41:59,102
And then--

399
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:02,689
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.

400
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,277
I tell you, it was so weird
I never forgot it.

401
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:11,282
Listen.

402
00:42:11,783 --> 00:42:13,868
You hear that whistle?

403
00:42:15,078 --> 00:42:18,039
It's exactly the same.

404
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:22,042
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...

405
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:24,545
That the directress had spent
a few hours at the school...

406
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:27,549
And had slept in the room next to mine.

407
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:31,719
You see?

408
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,806
So I know she's the directress.

409
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:37,809
She's here.

410
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:42,980
She's there.

411
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:46,067
Right behind that sheet.

412
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:11,341
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take
care of the fumigating so promptly.

413
00:43:11,342 --> 00:43:14,345
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- Good morning, Daniel.

414
00:43:14,846 --> 00:43:17,848
- Is everything in order now?
- All cleaned up, madame.

415
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:20,351
Just to be sure, we checked
the other floors too.

416
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:26,356
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.

417
00:43:26,357 --> 00:43:28,358
Did the directress sleep
here last night?

418
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:31,362
- No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.
- Good morning.

419
00:43:31,863 --> 00:43:35,866
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe
she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.

420
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:39,369
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which
class do I attend this morning?

421
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,371
The second-year class in the red room.

422
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:43,374
Thank you.

423
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:44,685
Stop!

424
00:44:44,686 --> 00:44:47,688
Stop! Stop!

425
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,691
Enough. Enough!

426
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:53,694
- Do you know what happened? Do you know?
- What day is it?

427
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:57,197
Your lousy, disgusting
dog has bitten Albert!

428
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:59,200
He took a piece out
of Albert's arm.

429
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:02,202
- What?
- Did you all hear that?

430
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:05,205
That miserable dog tried
to mutilate a child.

431
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:09,209
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to
a first-aid center to have stitches put in!

432
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,714
- That's impossible.
- Let's go to the first-aid center.

433
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:16,216
Even if you can't see the blood, at least
you can hear the poor child's crying.

434
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:18,219
That's enough now!

435
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,222
My dog's a peaceful, faithful
animal. He's never hurt anyone.

436
00:45:22,223 --> 00:45:24,725
The boy must have done
something to him first!

437
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:28,228
Oh, the poor little animal!
The poor little puppy!

438
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:32,733
If I ever see him within a mile of this
school again, I'll have him put to death!

439
00:45:32,734 --> 00:45:34,735
Stop it!

440
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:36,737
I won't allow such talk, you understand?

441
00:45:36,738 --> 00:45:39,740
You won't allow it?

442
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:42,243
Then get out! You and your dog!

443
00:45:42,744 --> 00:45:45,746
- Get moving!
- You bitch!

444
00:45:45,747 --> 00:45:47,748
Out!

445
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:50,751
I'm going. I'm going.

446
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:53,254
But try to understand that--

447
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:57,258
That I'm blind, not deaf.

448
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:59,760
Get it? Huh?

449
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:01,763
Not deaf.

450
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:04,515
Not deaf. You understand that?

451
00:46:04,516 --> 00:46:06,518
You understand?

452
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,022
Ahh, fresh air!

453
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:14,526
Let me out of this gilded parade.

454
00:46:15,026 --> 00:46:19,030
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!

455
00:46:23,034 --> 00:46:26,538
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer
do I have to eat like this?

456
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:53,147
Hey, listen.

457
00:46:53,148 --> 00:46:57,151
There they go, right on schedule.

458
00:46:57,152 --> 00:46:59,654
The teachers. Remember?

459
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:04,659
Can you hear them?
They're going away.

460
00:47:08,663 --> 00:47:10,665
You hear them?

461
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:14,669
Yes.

462
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,342
I--

463
00:47:31,352 --> 00:47:34,855
I--I don't think they'll
even miss school.

464
00:47:34,856 --> 00:47:37,858
What? What did you say?

465
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,360
Wake up.

466
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:44,866
I said, it doesn't seem to
me that they're going out.

467
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:48,870
A front door is on the left.

468
00:47:50,371 --> 00:47:53,875
Their footsteps are going to the
right, somewhere inside the school.

469
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:58,378
Jesus, Suzy.

470
00:47:58,379 --> 00:47:59,380
- You're a genius.
- Mmm.

471
00:48:00,882 --> 00:48:02,883
Fantastic.

472
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:06,303
How come I never noticed that before?

473
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:11,309
Suzy. If they don't leave,
Where do they go?

474
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:13,810
Wake up. Suzy.

475
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:18,650
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!

476
00:48:20,151 --> 00:48:22,653
I'm so sleepy.

477
00:48:22,654 --> 00:48:24,655
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

478
00:48:24,656 --> 00:48:27,658
Maybe--

479
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:30,161
Maybe we can find out where they really go.

480
00:48:31,663 --> 00:48:36,167
Of course!
Yes.

481
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:42,674
Begin to count the steps as they go.

482
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:01,943
It's like the search of Alietne.

483
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:30,318
Easy.

484
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,821
What is it? Huh?

485
00:52:33,822 --> 00:52:35,824
Come on.

486
00:52:37,325 --> 00:52:39,327
Come on; Let's go home.

487
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,602
Who is that? Who's there?

488
00:53:06,104 --> 00:53:08,273
Easy, boy.

489
00:53:13,778 --> 00:53:15,780
What is it?

490
00:53:18,283 --> 00:53:20,368
What's happening?

491
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,500
Who's there?

492
00:53:31,963 --> 00:53:34,465
Who's there?

493
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:50,648
Wait!

494
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:50,017
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.

495
00:55:50,018 --> 00:55:53,020
Oh, yeah, but you can never put
too much trust in wolfhounds.

496
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:56,523
They're crazy. We had two of them
once at the villa in Gestaad.

497
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:59,526
My god. First Pat gets
murdered by a madman,

498
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:02,029
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.

499
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,532
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.

500
00:56:05,033 --> 00:56:09,037
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist
and have it purged.

501
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:13,541
- What is it? Is something wrong?
- No, everything's all right.

502
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:16,293
Is it something personal, dear?

503
00:56:16,294 --> 00:56:18,796
No, no, it's nothing like that.

504
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:22,800
Miss Tanner, would you mind?

505
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:24,969
I'd like a few minutes
alone with Suzy.

506
00:56:30,475 --> 00:56:32,477
Well? What is it?

507
00:56:32,977 --> 00:56:36,481
I just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately.

508
00:56:36,981 --> 00:56:39,983
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's
death, as we all have been.

509
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:41,986
No, but it's more than that.

510
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:44,989
Does anybody know anything
about who killed Pat?

511
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,490
I spoke with the chief of
police just this morning.

512
00:56:47,492 --> 00:56:49,494
He told me they had
some definite clues.

513
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:52,996
- You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.
- Yes, you told me that.

514
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:56,459
And that she was mumbling some
strange, unrelated words.

515
00:56:57,001 --> 00:56:59,461
No, you didn't tell me that.

516
00:56:59,462 --> 00:57:03,006
Because it was something that didn't
make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.

517
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:06,009
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

518
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:09,012
I only caught two words distinctly:

519
00:57:09,013 --> 00:57:11,473
"Secret" and "Irises."

520
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:15,018
I don't know what they mean, but
I thought they might be important.

521
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:17,020
You've done very well. Congratulations.

522
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:20,023
I don't know what the words
"Secret" or "Irises" mean either.

523
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:22,484
But I think it's only right we should
let the police know about it.

524
00:57:22,485 --> 00:57:26,990
I'm only amazed you waited
two days before-- hello?

525
00:57:27,198 --> 00:57:30,784
- You really messed things up.
- What are you talking about?

526
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:33,788
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...

527
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:36,791
Someone just inside the
building that night.

528
00:57:40,795 --> 00:57:43,298
And we know that someone
wasn't one of the teachers.

529
00:57:50,054 --> 00:57:52,056
Come on.

530
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,060
Now you've put them
on the hunt for somebody.

531
00:57:57,061 --> 00:58:00,063
What difference does that make to you?

532
00:58:00,064 --> 00:58:02,066
Big difference.

533
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:06,070
Because I was Pat's friend.

534
00:58:06,571 --> 00:58:09,072
She was telling me something
When you suddenly showed up.

535
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:12,576
She got scared and she ran away.

536
00:58:12,577 --> 00:58:15,079
She was in hysterics almost.

537
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,581
And then she was killed.

538
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:21,084
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?

539
00:58:21,085 --> 00:58:23,588
Well, that was me.

540
00:59:19,644 --> 00:59:23,647
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.

541
00:59:23,648 --> 00:59:26,150
Pat was taking notes on them for months.

542
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:29,653
And before going away,
she gave me all the notes.

543
00:59:29,654 --> 00:59:33,157
I've only told one person,
a very good friend of mine.

544
00:59:33,158 --> 00:59:36,161
Frank Mandel. He's here
for a convention.

545
00:59:36,661 --> 00:59:39,664
I'll let you read them tonight.

546
00:59:50,341 --> 00:59:54,344
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.

547
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:57,807
The notes are gone! Someone
stole them from me!

548
00:59:58,183 --> 01:00:01,602
You understand? They disappeared.

549
01:00:01,603 --> 01:00:06,441
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!

550
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:09,694
- Wake up! Help me!
- I can't.

551
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:11,446
Can't?

552
01:00:13,948 --> 01:00:18,952
This is the only thing I got left,
and that's because I kept it on me. Look.

553
01:00:18,953 --> 01:00:21,455
- Look.
- What is it?

554
01:00:21,456 --> 01:00:25,960
What's the matter with you? Don't
you remember? What's going on?

555
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:30,214
This is the key that'll get us
wherever the teachers go every night.

556
01:00:30,215 --> 01:00:34,218
I thought it out yesterday evening
while I was sitting here next to you.

557
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:39,933
Suzy, do you know
anything about witches?

558
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,483
Oh, no! Please!

559
01:00:49,943 --> 01:00:53,488
Don't leave me alone!

560
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,461
I must get away!

561
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:08,248
Wait!

562
01:03:28,476 --> 01:03:31,479
Wait!

563
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:06,431
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

564
01:08:59,307 --> 01:09:02,184
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.

565
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:05,187
But that's impossible. I just
talked to her last night.

566
01:09:05,188 --> 01:09:09,191
She left this morning, as a matter
of fact, without telling anyone.

567
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:12,694
Just packed her bags and left. She
was heard leaving about 6:00.

568
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:16,198
- You heard her leave, didn't you?
- Sara? Oh, yes.

569
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:19,701
I heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall.

570
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:23,705
And then I heard a car driving off down the
street. I guess someone was waiting for her.

571
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:28,711
- But it's impossible.
- If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.

572
01:09:29,212 --> 01:09:31,714
Why sneak off like a thief?

573
01:09:41,975 --> 01:09:45,979
Hello. May I speak to Frank
Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.

574
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,482
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.

575
01:09:50,483 --> 01:09:53,485
No, we've never met. I'm a
friend of Sara's.

576
01:09:53,486 --> 01:09:57,991
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to
know where Sara is?

577
01:09:59,492 --> 01:10:02,495
Well, she disappeared from
school this morning.

578
01:10:02,996 --> 01:10:05,998
Yes, it seems she left and
took all her luggage.

579
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:10,503
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see
you sometime today?

580
01:10:11,504 --> 01:10:14,506
Well, I'm really worried about her.

581
01:10:14,507 --> 01:10:19,011
Oh, great. Where?

582
01:10:19,012 --> 01:10:22,514
At the convention center.
Okay. I'll see you there.

583
01:10:22,515 --> 01:10:26,018
She didn't inform any of her classmates.
I've already asked all of them.

584
01:10:26,019 --> 01:10:29,522
It's very upsetting. I can't
understand why she did it.

585
01:10:30,023 --> 01:10:32,524
I'm the one who's held responsible
by their families.

586
01:10:32,525 --> 01:10:36,154
I'll call her father in Geneva.
Perhaps she might have gone there.

587
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:53,170
I've already phoned Sara's father.
He's the Italian consul in Geneva.

588
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:57,674
But he wasn't there today.
He was away for the weekend.

589
01:10:57,675 --> 01:11:01,678
They said he'd be back by Monday, and
they don't know anything about her there.

590
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,681
Well, do you understand
Why I'm so worried?

591
01:11:04,682 --> 01:11:09,186
Yes, but before we both get upset,
let's wait for the father's return.

592
01:11:09,187 --> 01:11:12,689
Maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own.

593
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:18,695
I know her quite well. She was a
patient of mine three years ago.

594
01:11:18,696 --> 01:11:22,699
- Were you aware of that?
- No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.

595
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:27,205
Well, she had a nervous breakdown
after her mother's death,

596
01:11:27,705 --> 01:11:29,707
And she came to me for treatment.

597
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:33,710
After she got better again,
we remained friends,

598
01:11:33,711 --> 01:11:38,715
But lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers.

599
01:11:38,716 --> 01:11:41,719
- Not you, I hope?
- No.

600
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:44,471
They were kind of wild ideas.

601
01:11:44,472 --> 01:11:48,977
She had discovered that the
Tam academy was founded...

602
01:11:49,102 --> 01:11:53,605
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos,
A Greek immigrant,

603
01:11:53,606 --> 01:11:57,110
And that the local people
believed her to be a witch.

604
01:11:58,611 --> 01:12:02,614
- I guess you knew that?
- No. But I have a strange feeling...

605
01:12:02,615 --> 01:12:08,120
That somebody already told me
about it--Or something similar.

606
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:10,122
I can't--can't remember.

607
01:12:10,123 --> 01:12:14,127
Well, that really got Sara's imagination
going. Earlier in the 19th century,

608
01:12:14,502 --> 01:12:19,006
The Markos woman had been expelled
from several European countries.

609
01:12:19,007 --> 01:12:24,512
She seemed to have something about her which
urged religious people to persecute her.

610
01:12:25,013 --> 01:12:29,517
She also wrote a number of books, and
I read that among the initiated,

611
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:33,145
She went by the name "The Black Queen."

612
01:12:33,146 --> 01:12:37,149
After she settled down here, she became
the subject of a lot of gossip.

613
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:41,153
Nevertheless, she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money,

614
01:12:41,154 --> 01:12:43,655
And she founded the Tam academy--

615
01:12:43,656 --> 01:12:48,785
At first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences.

616
01:12:48,786 --> 01:12:51,788
But that didn't last long,
because in 1905,

617
01:12:51,789 --> 01:12:54,791
After being hounded and
cursed at for ten years,

618
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:58,295
Madame Markos died in a fire.

619
01:12:58,296 --> 01:13:01,798
That's all there is, as far
as witchcraft is concerned.

620
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:06,929
The school was taken over by her favorite
pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.

621
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:11,433
And soon the place became
the famous dance academy.

622
01:13:11,434 --> 01:13:16,439
But what does it mean to be a witch?

623
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:20,067
Well, as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot,

624
01:13:20,068 --> 01:13:24,571
I'm convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult...

625
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:28,075
Is part of mental illness.

626
01:13:28,076 --> 01:13:33,581
Bad luck isn't brought by broken
mirrors, but by broken minds.

627
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,544
Excuse me. Milius?

628
01:13:37,627 --> 01:13:40,129
Professor Milius can answer your
question better than I can.

629
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:43,632
He wrote a book called paranoia
or magic, and believe me,

630
01:13:43,633 --> 01:13:45,635
It's the final word on the subject.

631
01:13:46,135 --> 01:13:50,139
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

632
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:54,143
- Fraulein.
- She's interested in your favorite subject:

633
01:13:54,144 --> 01:13:56,645
Witches.

634
01:13:56,646 --> 01:14:00,150
Can you tell her something
about the mysterious?

635
01:14:01,651 --> 01:14:04,653
Well, I have to go. I have an
appointment to keep.

636
01:14:04,654 --> 01:14:07,156
Keep me posted, Hmm?

637
01:14:07,157 --> 01:14:09,658
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

638
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:14,163
Ah, so, what would you like to know?

639
01:14:14,164 --> 01:14:17,666
- Do you believe in the existence of witches?
- Ah.

640
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:21,670
I have known some women who
are said to be witches.

641
01:14:21,671 --> 01:14:25,174
- Really?
- I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.

642
01:14:25,175 --> 01:14:27,677
I am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage...

643
01:14:28,178 --> 01:14:31,180
Of contemporary psychiatry.

644
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:33,182
You're skeptical, my dear.

645
01:14:33,183 --> 01:14:36,686
Well, frankly, it is a little
hard to believe.

646
01:14:38,688 --> 01:14:43,817
- What do witches do?
- They are malefic, negative and destructive.

647
01:14:43,818 --> 01:14:48,323
Their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers.

648
01:14:48,823 --> 01:14:53,828
They can change the course of events and
people's lives, but only to do harm.

649
01:14:54,829 --> 01:14:58,332
- You don't believe me?
- No, I--

650
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:01,835
Their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth,

651
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:05,839
But that can only be achieved
by injury to others.

652
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,343
They can cause suffering,
sickness and even the death...

653
01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:13,348
Of those who, for whatever
reason, have offended them.

654
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,852
Why do you have all this
interest in the occult?

655
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:21,855
Because some friends spoke
to me about witches.

656
01:15:21,856 --> 01:15:24,858
I read some stuff.

657
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:27,862
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?

658
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:31,365
Oh, yes. She was a very
famous black queen.

659
01:15:31,366 --> 01:15:34,368
A powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil,

660
01:15:34,369 --> 01:15:36,371
A real mistress of magic.

661
01:15:36,746 --> 01:15:39,749
She lived and died in the city.
Did you know that?

662
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:44,753
Yes. And might there exist
a guild of witches?

663
01:15:44,754 --> 01:15:47,756
The correct term would
be a coven of witches.

664
01:15:47,757 --> 01:15:50,760
A woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful...

665
01:15:51,261 --> 01:15:53,762
Than the rest of the coven,
which is like a serpent.

666
01:15:53,763 --> 01:15:57,766
Its strength rests with its leader--
That is, with its head.

667
01:15:57,767 --> 01:16:01,770
A coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra:

668
01:16:01,771 --> 01:16:04,274
Harmless.

669
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:08,277
Skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays,

670
01:16:08,278 --> 01:16:11,281
But magic is ever present.

671
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:15,160
In other words:

672
01:16:20,165 --> 01:16:22,667
Which means that magic is everywhere,

673
01:16:23,168 --> 01:16:26,170
And all over the world,
it's a recognized fact.

674
01:16:26,171 --> 01:16:29,340
Always.

675
01:16:43,313 --> 01:16:46,316
Mark? Mark?

676
01:16:54,824 --> 01:16:58,327
Excuse me. Where is everybody?

677
01:16:58,328 --> 01:17:02,831
They have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the Bolshoi.

678
01:17:02,832 --> 01:17:05,835
- Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?
- I don't know.

679
01:17:06,336 --> 01:17:09,839
Miss Tanner obtained
tickets for everyone.

680
01:17:14,344 --> 01:17:18,847
- Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?
- Suzy? Hello?

681
01:17:18,848 --> 01:17:21,350
- I can't--
- Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.

682
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:24,853
- Did something happen?
- Well, I haven't heard from Sara,

683
01:17:24,854 --> 01:17:27,856
But a lot of strange
things are happening.

684
01:17:27,857 --> 01:17:31,236
I mean, for example,
when I eat at night, I--

685
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:34,489
Hello? Hello, Frank?

686
01:17:35,073 --> 01:17:37,950
Hello? Can you hear me?

687
01:17:37,951 --> 01:17:40,869
Frank? Hello?

688
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:44,206
Hello? Hello?

689
01:17:44,207 --> 01:17:46,209
Hello?

690
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:51,214
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?

691
01:19:21,805 --> 01:19:24,808
No!

692
01:19:28,812 --> 01:19:31,815
No!

693
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:16,835
They don't leave the school at all.

694
01:21:16,836 --> 01:21:21,800
The front door is on the left. Their
footsteps are going to the right.

695
01:21:49,828 --> 01:21:54,832
Two, three, four, five, six,

696
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:57,794
Seven--

697
01:22:00,296 --> 01:22:05,301
I can find out where they're
going by counting their footsteps.

698
01:23:17,874 --> 01:23:19,876
Twenty.

699
01:24:31,114 --> 01:24:33,616
Who's there?

700
01:25:15,992 --> 01:25:19,829
Carpet. That's why the
footsteps stop here.

701
01:25:38,264 --> 01:25:41,768
It's impossible. There's gotta
be another way out of here.

702
01:26:50,378 --> 01:26:53,130
The secret--
I saw it behind the door!

703
01:26:53,131 --> 01:26:56,509
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

704
01:26:57,886 --> 01:27:00,888
The secret--
I saw it behind the door!

705
01:27:00,889 --> 01:27:03,641
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

706
01:29:55,396 --> 01:29:59,399
I told you: We must get rid of that
bitch of an American girl!

707
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:04,781
Vanish--She must vanish! Make
her disappear, understand?

708
01:30:08,284 --> 01:30:11,287
She won't eat or drink
anything this evening.

709
01:30:18,294 --> 01:30:21,798
Vanish--She must vanish!

710
01:30:21,923 --> 01:30:24,926
She must die, die, die!

711
01:30:32,684 --> 01:30:35,186
Helena, give me power.

712
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,203
Sickness! Sickness!

713
01:30:52,704 --> 01:30:55,205
Away with her! Away with trouble!

714
01:30:55,206 --> 01:31:00,211
Death, death, death!

715
01:33:43,414 --> 01:33:46,667
Now death is coming for you!

716
01:33:46,795 --> 01:33:51,299
You wanted to kill Helena Markos?

717
01:33:57,013 --> 01:34:00,016
I'm here, American.
I'm coming!

718
01:34:00,975 --> 01:34:03,978
You're going to meet death now!
The living dead!

719
01:37:26,389 --> 01:37:29,392
Witch, witch.
