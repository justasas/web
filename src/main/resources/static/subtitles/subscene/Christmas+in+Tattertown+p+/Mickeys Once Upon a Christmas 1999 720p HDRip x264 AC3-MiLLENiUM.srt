1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,750
One time a year,
there's a marvellous night,

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,750
When enchantment and wonder
spark and take flight

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,870
Each home fills with joy
on this grand holiday,

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,830
With hearts growing warm
in a magical way

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,430
The rooms are all covered
with garment and wreaths
The mantel is ready with stockings beneath

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,190
Lights twinkle and glow
and bells brightly chime

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,670
The moment's arrived, it's here,
Christmas time

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,670
Three precious gifts
lie under this tree

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,460
What secrets they hold,
Let's look and we'll see

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,710
The first tells a story
for us all to hear

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,830
About laughter and family,
and those we hold dear

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,340
We love Christmas so much,
we want it to stay

13
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,470
But what if we wished
it was here every day?

14
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,150
Anchors aweigh

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,240
Full steam ahead

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,470
Swab the deck, you

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,110
All aboard Next stop, Funnyville

18
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,460
It's here

19
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,030
- The one
- The only

20
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,150
best day of the year
It's Christmas

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,390
Oh, boy Just what we always wanted

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,830
- Hey, look at this
- Cool

23
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,070
Merry Christmas, boys

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,310
You know we have to wait
for the family

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,780
Sorry, Uncle Donald

26
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,510
Ah, it's Christmas,

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,070
and I've got a special surprise
for you

28
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,910
But you didn't even
read the card

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,560
We'll read it later

30
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,230
- Merry Christmas, everybody
- lndeed

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,910
Where are my boys and my kisses?

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,990
I could just eat you up

33
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,950
Oh, Donald?

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,830
Oh, boy

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,350
Aunt Daisy, catch ya later

36
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,790
Last one down the hill's
a rotten egg

37
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,350
Not me

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,380
Boys Dinner

39
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,710
The one thing better

40
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,020
than presents

41
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,710
is Christmas dinner

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,270
Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered
for a wonderful meal

43
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,630
It's my favourite part of Christmas

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,320
- Turkey
- Donald, would you like to carve?

45
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,110
Boys Where are your manners?

46
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,790
- This turkey is so good
- Your gravy never has lumps

47
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,710
We love your cooking,
Aunt Daisy

48
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,630
Donald,
they're just enjoying my dinner

49
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,310
I don't want any

50
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,700
All right, who's for carolling?

51
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,390
We don't wanna sing,
Uncle Scrooge

52
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,310
We wanna play with our toys

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,590
- Bedtime, boys
- Not yet

54
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,140
Christmas can't be over already

55
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,270
Good night, boys

56
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,750
What a great day

57
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,830
We should do it more often

58
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,430
Yeah Once a week should be enough

59
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,190
It'll be another 365 days
until we get more Christmas

60
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,390
Star light, star bright,

61
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,870
first star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might,

62
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,340

63
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,060
We wish it was Christmas
every day

All aboard Next stop, Funnyville

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,110
Boy, those guys

66
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,790
They're gonna
play with it again today?

67
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,870
Let's play with our new toys

68
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,950
They're gone

69
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,190
Hey, what is this?

70
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,270
Didn't we open these yesterday?

71
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,740
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

72
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,400
There's only one way to find out

73
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,100
We're gonna have to open
these presents

74
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,790
Merry Christmas

75
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,870
- Uncle Donald, we did it
- It's Christmas again

76
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,520
It's Christmas again, Uncle Donald

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,790
Two days in a row

78
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,390
You boys must have been dreaming

79
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,750
We almost forgot
about our special surprise

80
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,470
Where are my kisses?
I could just eat you up

81
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,910
We should have seen that coming

82
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,550
Last one down the hill's
a rotten egg

83
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,110
Again

84
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,590
Boys, dinner

Turkey

88
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,230
Boys Where are your manners?

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,230
Donald,
they're just enjoying my dinner

90
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,030
Good night, boys

91
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,390

96
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,590
Where are my boys and my kisses?

97
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,790
No, you don't

98
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,830
I think this is my favourite part
of Christmas

99
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,980

100
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,070

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,670
my favourite part of Christmas

Where are my kisses?

106

Funnyville

107
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,870
my favourite part

108
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,390
Who's for carolling?

109
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,910
Looks like the end of the line

110
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,670
Until tomorrow,
when it happens all over again

111
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,310
You're right Yesterday's today,
and today's tomorrow,

112
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,960
and it's gonna be the same thing

113
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,470
day in and day out

114
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,190
Get a grip

115
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,590
I'm sorry, fellas

116
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,750
That's OK We know how you feel

117
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,990
If I see the same toys again,
I'll go out of my mind

118
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,910
Yeah, and if I eat any more turkey,

119
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,070
I'm gonna need new clothes

120
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,990
We got to do something
to liven things up

121
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,350
Green leader to red leader

122
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,430
Initiate pancake intercept sequence

123
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,070
Roger

124
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,310
Donald, stop playing
with the boys' presents

125
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,470
Where are my boys and my kisses?

126
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,590
Right here, Aunt Gertie

127
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,110
Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered
for a wonderful meal

128
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,910
It's my favourite part of Christmas

129
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,710
Oh Turkey

130
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,350
Not the piano
Not my beloved carols

131
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,870
Well, we still have the tree

132
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,950
Let's run
before Uncle Donald gets mad

133
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,630
We'll be outside
if you need us

134
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,990
Donald, are you all right?

135
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,860
"To Huey, Dewey and Louie,

136
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,830
Christmas isn't about candy canes,

137
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,480
holly or lights all aglow,

138
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,350
it's about the hearts that we touch,

139
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,030
and the care that we show"

140
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,110
"Wishing you lots of love,

141
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,310
Donald and Daisy"'

142
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,670
Some Christmas
this turned out to be

143
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,460
Gee, I don't know about you guys,

144
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,310
but I don't ever
wanna do that again

145
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,790
Me, too

146
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,790
Me, three

147
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,230
Tomorrow, let's have
the best Christmas ever

148
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,070
We're putting
these sleds to good use

149
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,110
Incoming

150
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,790
Merry Christmas, fellas

151
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,180
Look, we made you breakfast

152
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,350
Isn't that nice?

153
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,390
You want to open presents?

154
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,590
No way We've got to
wait for the family to get here

155
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,710
- Merry Christmas, everybody
- lndeed

156
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,790
Don't forget our kisses,
Aunt Gertie

157
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,150
What are they up to?

158
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,510
You boys are so wonderful

159
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,590
- That looks heavy
- Let us help you

160
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,990
Why, isn't that sweet?
Thank you, boys

161
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,430
Ham

162
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,510
Uncle Donald,
would you like to carve?

163
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,310
Something's up for sure

164
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,750
Nothing better than gathering

165
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,470
for a wonderful meal

166
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,830
It's our most favourite part

167
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,910
My feelings exactly

168
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,300
Carols, Uncle Scrooge?

169
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,990
Why, boys,
it's like you could read my mind

170
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,990
What's the big idea?
What are you boys up to?

171
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,910
Donald Duck, you're spoiling
a perfect Christmas

172
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,700
No, Uncle Donald is right
We are up to something

173
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,670
Merry Christmas

174
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,200
See, it's your dream boat

175
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,310
Thank you, boys

176
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,100
How beautiful

177
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,110
Some Christmas this has turned out
to be I'm just so happy

178
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,070
Boys?

179
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,880
Come gimme a push

180
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,990
It's over
Christmas is really over

181
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,380
The day after Christmas

182
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,670
I understand, boys

183
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,710
You must want Christmas every day

184
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,630
No

185
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,430
Anchors aweigh

186
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,300
Full steam ahead

187
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,710
Man overboard

188
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,390
So Christmas was meant
to last just one day

189
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,910
And maybe it's better that way

190
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,910
It's a time to be treasured,
it can't always be here,

191
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,990
But the feeling it gives us
can last the whole year

192
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,100
Now this gift holds a story
both wondrous and rare,

193
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,070
About a father and a son
and the love that they share

194
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,310
This Christmas they'll learn
before the night's through,

195
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,590
If we care for each other,
our dreams can come true

196
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,590
Come on, Maxie,
at least hum a few bars

197
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,900
Dad, hurry up

198
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,230
The mailman comes at noon, Dad

199
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,430
Let's see, now

200
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,760
- How about an electrical recliner?
- Yeah, Dad, whatever

201
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,550
Don't want to turn
into a fancy pants

202
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,190
Yeah, Dad, but Santa won't get
our letter if we don't leave

203
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,340
now

204
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,230
Hold on, Dad
We're taking a short cut

205
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,230
We ought to slow down
before we break the sound barrier

206
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,510
- What?
- We're headed straight for the mall

207
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,060
Great idea

208
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,310
- Low bridge
- Really? Where?

209
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,030
Go ahead and stop the mailman, Son

210
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,790
I'll be right behind ya
Don't worry, I won't let you down

211
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,540
Excuse me

212
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,790
Pardon me, ma'am
Didn't mean to get fresh

213
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,510
Wait

214
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,510
There's a madman
on the ornament

215
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,430
Sorry

216
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,110
Wait Stop

217
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,270
You have to mail our letter
to Santa

218
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,310
Get out of the road, kid

219
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,950
Do you have anything bigger?
I have an empty space right here

220
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,030
I'll take it

221
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,830
My dad'll be here
any minute, honest

222
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,910
Sorry, kid, gotta go

223
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,830
Special delivery
for the North Pole

224
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,590
You really think Santa
will get the letter?

225
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,470
Sure as I stand here

226
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,230
Slippery

227
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,150
I gotta get it, I just gotta

228
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,510
My own one-of-a-kind, carbon fibre,
torque rod, snappy flex,

229
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,390
tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail, wood core,
twin-directional snowboard

230
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,990
That's a mouthful

231
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
With adjustable
forward and high back

232
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,710
skid plate step-in bindings

233
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,390
Look at this All nice and neat
and ready for ol' Santy

234
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,390
Merry Christmas Eve, Pete

235
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,070
Why, if it ain't
the goof master himself

236
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,750
Say, we got us
some more work to do, Max,

237
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,070
or Santy won't find our chimney

238
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,750
Ain't that quaint? The goof brain
thinks there's a Santy Claus

239
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,030
There isn't?

240
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,500
Like father, like goof

241
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,070
Kid's got the goof gene
in his bloodstream

242
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,790
There is too a Santa

243
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,910
Now, son, come here

244
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,990
See, it's an urbane myth,
like that Locked Ness Monstrosity,

245
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,390
and the fella with the sweets
takes cheques

246
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,310
Well, think of it
An old guy in a red suit

247
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,470
cruising the entire world
in one night,

248
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,670
using reindeer what fly
Why, it's impossible

249
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,910
Look, kid, I've been around, see

250
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,910
I've been to foreign lands,
like Brooklyn,

251
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,700
and I've never seen,
nor met a soul who's seen,

252
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,360
this Santy Claus fella

253
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,470
Look, Maxie, I found the front door

254
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,510
So long, neighbours

255
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,750
Have a very merry Christmas

256
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,790
And a happy New Year

257
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,430
Hey, how about giving
your old man a hand?

258
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,950
What is it, Maxie?
Why, you look like Santy Claus

259
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,340
put a lump of coal in your stocking

260
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,950
I heard there isn't any Santa Claus

261
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,310
Who went and told you
a silly thing like that?

262
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,110
Mr Pete

263
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,110
Well, that figures

264
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,310
Of course there's a Santy

265
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,390
Or we'd have out-of-work elves

266
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,670
You think?

267
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,110
Think? Heck, I'm sure

268
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,070
Son, have I ever been wrong?

269
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,390
A broken clock is right
two or three times a day,

270
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,470
and this time I'm right

271
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,910
Believe me, Santa won't let you down

272
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,550
- You really think he'll come?
- Why, as sure as pigs fly

273
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,720
Hey, Dad,
what did you ask for from Santa?

274
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,230
You know, just the usual

275
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,990
What's that?

276
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,310
It's a surprise

277
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,550
Now, plug her in
and let the joy of Christmas shine

278
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,750
That'll put
the spirit of Christmas in you

279
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,310
Course there's a Santa

280
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,790
Believe me,
Santa won't let you down

281
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,670
An old guy in a red suit,

282
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,590
cruising the entire world in
one night, using reindeer what fly

283
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,670
Why, it's impossible

284
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,280
Hiya, Maxie Wanna help?

285
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,670
Did you know that there are
two billion children in the world?

286
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,110
No wonder
I keep tripping over roller skates

287
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,430
That means Santa would have to make
800 visits a second,

288
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,900
not including bathroom breaks

289
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,030
I guess old Santy's
been at it so long,

290
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,420
he figured out the short cuts

291
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,870
Looks like it's gonna be
a white Christmas

292
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,910
Dad, this is serious

293
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,670
I know, son, but

294
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,790
Gosh
Something sure smells mighty tasty

295
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,710
But how can a reindeer fly?

296
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,990
That's easy,
it's those antlers, they

297
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,110
You know, with the wind
and all, that creates lift

298
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,230
Hot

299
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,790
Still, it's a lot of work
for one guy

300
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,870
That's why we leave him cookies,
for a pick-me-up

301
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,510
Just doesn't quite make sense, Dad

302
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,150
Chestnuts

303
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,870
Where are we going, Dad?

304
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,990
To share the joy of Christmas
with those less fortunate

305
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,310
Shouldn't Santa be doing this?

306
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,830
Santy's on a tight schedule
this time of year,

307
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,070
so we're helping him out

308
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,270
Looks like
I might need one, too

309
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,230
Wanna play toy carses? All I got's
two, but you can have one

310
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,630
Santa gave me this one last year

311
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,710
This year, I hope he's gonna
give me another one

312
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,590
Kid, I ain't so sure
there is such a thing as

313
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,140
Christmas Eve dinner is served

314
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,350
- Mr Goofy, that's incredible
- Like magic

315
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,950
Christmas magic

316
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,030
Thank you so much

317
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,980
With things being so tight,
without you, we wouldn't have

318
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,620
Don't mention it
You'd do the same for me

319
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,990
But have you ever really,
actually seen Santa?

320
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,950
He's got a big white beard

321
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,310
But have you ever
actually seen him in person?

322
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,670
Where?

323
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,550
- Merry Christmas
- Santa

324
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,830
Santa?

325
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,910
You made it

326
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,380
Who wants to be the first
to sit on Santy's lap?

327
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,910
Me, me Over here

328
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,030
I'm so glad you came

329
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,430
I almost didn't believe any more,

330
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,830
but now

331
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,830
Everything's OK So

332
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,990
I want my own one-of-a-kind,
carbon fibre, torque rod,

333
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,710
snappy flex,
tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail,

334
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,590
twin-directional snowboard
Please

335
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,710
Dad?

336
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,630
You tricked me How could you?

337
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,990
Santy's got a problem with one
of his elves, but he'll be back

338
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,710
Gosh, Maxie I'm real sorry

339
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,790
I was just trying
to make those kids happy

340
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,710
Remember my tradition of eating one
of Santy's cookies before bedtime?

341
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,270
What's the point?

342
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,750
Remember how we always open
one present on Christmas Eve?

343
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,550
Hiya, Maxie

344
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,390
Lookee here,
it's your old stuffed bear

345
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,550
- Remember what you named him?
- Old Stuffed Bear

346
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,110
- Remember who gave him to ya?
- Yeah Santa

347
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,190
But that's when I was little

348
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,140
No, he's not

349
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,780
Trust me, Max
You just gotta believe

350
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,870
- Santy's real
- No, he's not

351
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,630
- Yes, he is
- No, he's not

352
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,590
I promise

353
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,470
Then prove it

354
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,110
When Santy shows up,
we'll be here to greet him

355
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,110
I'll snap a picture of him

356
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,070
so you'll have
photographic evidence

357
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,430
Yeah You'll fall off the roof first

358
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,510
I won't fall off the roof
You just watch

359
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,320
Santy Claus is coming to town

360
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,270
Bright

361
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,710
Told you you'd fall off the roof

362
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,260
I didn't fall off the roof

363
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,670
Where's Santy?
I didn't miss him, did l?

364
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,270
Nope

365
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,350
Then where is he?

366
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,270
I don't know about you,
but I'm cold and tired,

367
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,950
and Santa Claus is not coming

368
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,750
Why doesn't he just grow up
and face the facts?

369
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,430
"Don't forget

370
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,900
Max"'

371
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,990
Oh, Dad

372
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,350
Max, wake up Look, son

373
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,350
It's him, it really is

374
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,220
Do you see him, Maxie? Do ya?

375
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,030
Over here

376
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,670
- Almost forgot Smile, Santy
- Dad, the lens cap

377
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,950
I'll get it right this time

378
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,550
Come down with your hands up
We have you surrounded

379
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,140
What in the name of Pete is going on,
for Pete's sake?

380
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,800
Maybe he's running a little late

381
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,350
Dad

382
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,430
Are you OK?

383
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,260
You were right about everything
I even fell off the roof

384
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,150
Hey, Dad, it's OK
Santa didn't show No biggie

385
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,670
Well, since he's not coming,

386
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,220
at least we can eat
all his cookies

387
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,470
Not hungry

388
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,430
Hey, Dad,
here's one from me Open it

389
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,830
Maybe later

390
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,230
Max?

391
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,700
Burglars

392
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,230
Santy

393
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,140
Merry Christmas

394
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,190
Santy, I'm so happy you came

395
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,870
Gosh I thought you'd be taller

396
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,790
And you look trimmer
than your pictures

397
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,230
Well, you know

398
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,550
camera adds 50 pounds

399
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,430
You have to meet Maxie

400
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,030
Yeah, love to,
but gotta get going

401
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,870
Two billion kids, 823 a second

402
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,510
Very tight schedule

403
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,510
Wait, Santy,
he's around somewheres

404
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,550
Wait Santy

405
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,110
Santy

406
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,750
- Maxie?
- Hi, Dad

407
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,150
What are you doing
dressed up like Santy Claus?

408
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,510
I just wanted to make you happy,
like you did for our neighbours

409
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,910
Maxie, I might have let you down,
but you sure didn't let me down

410
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,950
Could it be? Do you think?

411
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,870
Gosh It sure looks like

412
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,910
Santa Claus

413
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,270
I believe it is

414
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,510
Wow, my own one-of-a-kind,

415
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,030
carbon fibre, torque rod,
snappy flexed, tip-to-tail,

416
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,430
rail-to-rail, wood core,
twin-directional snowboard

417
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,420
- Thanks, Santa
- What's all the commotion?

418
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,910
If it's another robber,
I'm gonna get him

419
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,440
Santa?

420
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,870
Well, hey, Santa,
I believed in ya all along

421
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,310
For real and for true
So, where are my presents?

422
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,390
Merry Christmas

423
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,230
But what about my squirty gun
and my yo-yo?

424
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,350
I know you can hear me

425
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,460
Santa didn't forget your gift,
did he?

426
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,430
Every year, I ask for the same gift,

427
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,510
and every year I get it

428
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,660
What's that?

429
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,310
Your happiness

430
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,590
What is it, son?

431
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,630
Got you the same thing

432
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,910
Merry Christmas, Dad

433
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,910
Merry Christmas, Max

434
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,830
Where are you going?

435
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,430
To share my present
with little Jimmy next door

436
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,950
That's my boy

437
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,470
So, Christmas is found
in the way we live,

438
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,180
Not what we receive,
but what we can give

439
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,510
Our Iast present may seem small,
Not fancy, flashy or special at all

440
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,140
But this gift can be given
by the rich or the poor,

441
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,590
It's a gift of the heart,
and it means so much more

442
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,990
Thanks, Joe Merry Christmas

443
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,230
Merry Christmas, George
You working?

444
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,510
Not tonight It's Christmas Eve

445
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,990
There it is, Pluto

446
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,950
The perfect gift
to go with Minnie's watch

447
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,220
My Minnie

448
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,430
They close at five
I'm a little short now,

449
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,590
but you and I are gonna make
lots of tips today

450
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,270
- Aren't we, fella?
- Yeah

451
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,590
After work we'll pick it up
Let's get this tree to Minnie's

452
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,910
Figaro, there's nothing but bills

453
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,070
How am I going to afford
to get Mickey a present?

454
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,750
Oh, Mickey

455
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,460
When you play your harmonica,
my heart sings

456
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,630
An instrument like that
deserves a special case

457
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,350
Yeah Some day

458
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,510
Come into the kitchen
Breakfast is almost ready

459
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,990
I'm not eating you
out of house and home?

460
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,590
Course not, silly I have plenty

461
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,990
For me?

462
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,190
Have you got the time, Minnie?

463
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,310
- Let's see, it's
- Gosh, sure is a beautiful watch

464
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,830
My one heirloom

465
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,070
It'd look nice with a gold chain
around your pretty neck

466
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,510
Oh, Mickey My goodness,
I've got to go to work

467
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,230
Madam Your sleigh awaits

468
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,950
Oh, how wonderful

469
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,870
Giddy up, Pluto

470
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,470
See you tonight

471
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,790
Fella, we got work to do

472
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,710

Merry Christmas

477
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,550
I'll be merry when
I've sold all those ten-footers

478
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,070

your face hanging out? Get to work

This here's what you folks need Ten
feet of towering Nova Scotia pine

491
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,510
Wow It's bigger than our house

492
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,310
Well, it's a little more
than we need

493
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,190
Missus, I've got to be honest
with you,

494
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,350
this is all
I've got left on the lot

495
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,230
The others have been reservated

496
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,790
You don't want these kids going
without a tree now, do you?

497
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,550
We are gonna get a tree,
aren't we, Daddy?

498
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,100
This is all we have

499
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,740
Well, that'll be just fine
for a down payment

500
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,070
I'll set you up with a nice
instalment plan Just sign here

501
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,110
We're gonna get a tree

502
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,040
Foot off the brake,
the kids are waiting

503
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,420
Hey, how about this tree?

504
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,190
I found it out back

505
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,950
It hasn't been reservated

506
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,990
It's beautiful

507
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,540

Christmas

512
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,180
I had them on the hook
for a ten-foot tree

513
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,510
I'm taking what I would have made
from you

514
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,950
- But l
- Now, get out of my lot

515
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,020
Chumps

516
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,790
Somebody's burning their ham

517
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,630
More than warm It's hot

518
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,790
Not my ten-footers

519
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,390
Holiday shoppers, don't forget
to bring your purchases

520
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,940
to our gift-wrapping department

521
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,950
I've never seen it so busy

522
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,510
Who made you
Santa's number one helper?

523
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,710
I want to get Mickey
something special

524
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,590
Without that Christmas bonus,
I'm sunk

Mr Mortimer wants to see you

My Christmas bonus

528

00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,390
Santa's best little helper

- That's Minnie

537
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,790
Whatever On behalf of the store,
it gives me great pleasure

538
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,950
to present you
with your Christmas bonus

539
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,900
A fruitcake?

540
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,350
No need to thank me The expression
on your face is thanks enough

541
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,270
Scoot along to the gift-wrapping
department where you belong

542
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,270
And, er, Winnie?

543
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,190
Merry Christmas

544
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,110
Oh, Mickey How am I ever
gonna get your present now?

545
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,540
There must be a way to get Minnie's
present by five o'clock

546
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,000
You got any ideas, fella?

547
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,870
Don't worry We'll come up
with something, we just gotta

548
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,750
Do you think the band
will ever show up?

549
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,990
I don't know They're putting out
a fire at Crazy Pete's

550
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,230
It went up like a Roman candle

551
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,390
Chief, looks like the toy drive
is a big fat bust

552
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,590
Listen That music

553
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,150
Come on

554
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,350
Where are we going?

555
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,670
A concert in the park

556
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,670
Look, Bub, we're desperate

557
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,950
We need music for the toy drive
You're our only hope

558
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,910
I don't have time
I gotta get a gift for my girl

559
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,750
Look, pal, don't do it for us,
do it for the kids

560
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,300
- But l
- Son, to these kids,

561
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,350
the only difference between
a broken heart and a smile is you

562
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,630
You're on Break a leg, pal

563
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,750
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I can't stay

564
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,630
I got Christmas shopping to do and

565
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,500
Gosh

566
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,830
- The band
- Must have been hot at Crazy Pete's

567
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,110
Guess I'll be showing up
at Minnie's empty-handed

568
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,320
Terrific Thanks to you,
this was our best toy drive ever

569
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,270
You and that harmonica
make a great team

570
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,350
She's worth her weight in gold

571
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,350
Holy cow That's it

572
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,910
We've got two minutes to get
to the shop Come on, Pluto

573
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,070
- Thanks, fellas
- Goodbye

574
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,070
- Thanks
- Merry Christmas

575
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,500
Sorry

576
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,990
Hey, what's going on?

577
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,830
This is our stop

578
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,300
Look, there's the shop

579
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,030
Excuse me, sir I was just hoping to
trade this for a gift for my girl

580
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,470
Sorry, that harmonica
isn't worth much

581
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,310
Well, merry Christmas

582
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,630
You're worth a lot to me,
old friend

583
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,070
Say, maybe that harmonica
is worth something after all

584
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,070
Come on in

585
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,150
Can't wait to open your present?
I know how you feel

586
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,550
I love Christmas so much

587
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,630
Say, Mickey,
why don't you play some music?

588
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,550
Isn't it time
we were opening our presents,

589
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,870
and speaking of time,
what time is it?

590
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,990
Well, l I think it's time
for you to open your gift

591
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,670
A case, for my harmonica

592
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,750
A chain for my watch
Mickey, it's beautiful,

593
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,190
but I traded my watch
to get you that case

594
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,470
I traded my harmonica
to get you a watch chain

595
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,780
Oh, Mickey,

596
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,430
I can't believe you gave up what
means the most to you, for me

597
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,630
Minnie, you're all the music
I'll ever need

598
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,870
- Merry Christmas, Mickey
- Merry Christmas, Minnie

599
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,820
Want some fruitcake?

600
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,830
A gift from the heart
is cherished and true

601
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,030
A present is best
when love's given, too

602
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,990
So in the end, love is the reason

603
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,190
That Christmas is more
than a gift-giving season

604
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,630
It's a time with our loved ones
to show that we care,

605
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,150
When families and neighbours
come together to share

606
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,630
So, this Christmas season,
let us all do our parts

607
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,630
To keep Christmas spirit
alive in our hearts
