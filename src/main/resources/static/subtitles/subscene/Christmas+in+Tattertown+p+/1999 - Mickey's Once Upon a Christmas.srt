1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,756
One time a year,
there's a marvellous night,

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,753
When enchantment and wonder
spark and take flight

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,870
Each home fills with joy
on this grand holiday,

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,837
With hearts growing warm
in a magical way

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,436
The rooms are all covered
with garment and wreaths
The mantel is ready with stockings beneath

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,199
Lights twinkle and glow
and bells brightly chime

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,671
The moment's arrived, it's here,
Christmas time

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,679
Three precious gifts
lie under this tree

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,469
What secrets they hold,
Let's look and we'll see

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,716
The first tells a story
for us all to hear

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,839
About laughter and family,
and those we hold dear

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,349
We love Christmas so much,
we want it to stay

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,479
But what if we wished
it was here every day?

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,151
Anchors aweigh

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,240
Full steam ahead

16
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,472
Swab the deck, you

17
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,118
All aboard Next stop, Funnyville

18
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,469
It's here

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,039
- The one
- The only

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,153
best day of the year
It's Christmas

21
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,397
Oh, boy Just what we always wanted

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,835
- Hey, look at this
- Cool

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,070
Merry Christmas, boys

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,315
You know we have to wait
for the family

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,789
Sorry, Uncle Donald

26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,519
Ah, it's Christmas,

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,070
and I've got a special surprise
for you

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,918
But you didn't even
read the card

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
We'll read it later

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,235
- Merry Christmas, everybody
- lndeed

31
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,914
Where are my boys and my kisses?

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,991
I could just eat you up

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,955
Oh, Donald?

34
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,831
Oh, boy

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,356
Aunt Daisy, catch ya later

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,794
Last one down the hill's
a rotten egg

37
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,359
Not me

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,389
Boys Dinner

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,719
The one thing better

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,028
than presents

41
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,712
is Christmas dinner

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,271
Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered
for a wonderful meal

43
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,636
It's my favourite part of Christmas

44
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,320
- Turkey
- Donald, would you like to carve?

45
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,119
Boys Where are your manners?

46
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,794
- This turkey is so good
- Your gravy never has lumps

47
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,713
We love your cooking,
Aunt Daisy

48
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,637
Donald,
they're just enjoying my dinner

49
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,318
I don't want any

50
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,709
All right, who's for carolling?

51
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,394
We don't wanna sing,
Uncle Scrooge

52
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,311
We wanna play with our toys

53
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,598
- Bedtime, boys
- Not yet

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,149
Christmas can't be over already

55
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,276
Good night, boys

56
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,751
What a great day

57
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,831
We should do it more often

58
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,434
Yeah Once a week should be enough

59
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,197
It'll be another 365 days
until we get more Christmas

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,396
Star light, star bright,

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,873
first star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might,

62

63
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,069
We wish it was Christmas

All aboard Next stop, Funnyville

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,115
Boy, those guys

They're gonna
play with it again today?

67
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,871
Let's play with our new toys

68
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,957
They're gone

69
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,196
Hey, what is this?

70
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,278
Didn't we open these yesterday?

71
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,749
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

72
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
There's only one way to find out

73
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,109
We're gonna have to open
these presents

74
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,791
Merry Christmas

75
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,873
- Uncle Donald, we did it
- It's Christmas again

76
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,520
It's Christmas again, Uncle Donald

77
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,795
Two days in a row

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,390
You boys must have been dreaming

79
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,756
We almost forgot
about our special surprise

80
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,473
Where are my kisses?
I could just eat you up

81
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,915
We should have seen that coming

82
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,556
Last one down the hill's
a rotten egg

83
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,119
Again

84
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,590

Turkey

88
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,233
Boys Where are your manners?

89
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,236
Donald,
they're just enjoying my dinner

90
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,039
Good night, boys

91
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,398

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,593
Where are my boys and my kisses?

No, you don't

98
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,831
I think this is my favourite part
of Christmas

99
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,989

100
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,072

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,674
my favourite part of Christmas

Funnyville

107
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,871
my favourite part

108
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,396
Who's for carolling?

109
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,916
Looks like the end of the line

110
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,672
Until tomorrow,
when it happens all over again

111
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,311
You're right Yesterday's today,
and today's tomorrow,

112
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,960
and it's gonna be the same thing

113
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,474
day in and day out

114
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,199
Get a grip

115
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,595
I'm sorry, fellas

116
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,750
That's OK We know how you feel

117
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,991
If I see the same toys again,
I'll go out of my mind

118
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,913
Yeah, and if I eat any more turkey,

119
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,070
I'm gonna need new clothes

120
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,994
We got to do something
to liven things up

121
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,350
Green leader to red leader

122
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,431
Initiate pancake intercept sequence

123
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,073
Roger

124
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,311
Donald, stop playing
with the boys' presents

125
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,477
Where are my boys and my kisses?

126
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,590
Right here, Aunt Gertie

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,115
Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered
for a wonderful meal

128
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,919
It's my favourite part of Christmas

129
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,710
Oh Turkey

130
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,358
Not the piano
Not my beloved carols

131
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,872
Well, we still have the tree

132
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,951
Let's run
before Uncle Donald gets mad

133
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,634
We'll be outside
if you need us

134
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,993
Donald, are you all right?

135
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,868
"To Huey, Dewey and Louie,

136
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,838
Christmas isn't about candy canes,

137
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,480
holly or lights all aglow,

138
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,358
it's about the hearts that we touch,

139
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,034
and the care that we show"

140
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,111
"Wishing you lots of love,

141
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,316
Donald and Daisy"'

142
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,672
Some Christmas
this turned out to be

143
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,468
Gee, I don't know about you guys,

144
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,313
but I don't ever
wanna do that again

145
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,799
Me, too

146
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,791
Me, three

147
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,237
Tomorrow, let's have
the best Christmas ever

148
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,073
We're putting
these sleds to good use

149
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,112
Incoming

150
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,791
Merry Christmas, fellas

151
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,188
Look, we made you breakfast

152
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,356
Isn't that nice?

153
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,396
You want to open presents?

154
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,598
No way We've got to
wait for the family to get here

155
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,711
- Merry Christmas, everybody
- lndeed

156
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,792
Don't forget our kisses,
Aunt Gertie

157
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,157
What are they up to?

158
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,516
You boys are so wonderful

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,594
- That looks heavy
- Let us help you

160
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,990
Why, isn't that sweet?
Thank you, boys

161
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,434
Ham

162
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,518
Uncle Donald,
would you like to carve?

163
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,319
Something's up for sure

164
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,755
Nothing better than gathering

165
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,478
for a wonderful meal

166
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,836
It's our most favourite part

167
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,911
My feelings exactly

168
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,309
Carols, Uncle Scrooge?

169
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,995
Why, boys,
it's like you could read my mind

170
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,997
What's the big idea?
What are you boys up to?

171
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,914
Donald Duck, you're spoiling
a perfect Christmas

172
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,709
No, Uncle Donald is right
We are up to something

173
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,671
Merry Christmas

174
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,200
See, it's your dream boat

175
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,310
Thank you, boys

176
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,108
How beautiful

177
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,115
Some Christmas this has turned out
to be I'm just so happy

178
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,075
Boys?

179
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,880
Come gimme a push

180
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,995
It's over
Christmas is really over

181
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,389
The day after Christmas

182
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,675
I understand, boys

183
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,718
You must want Christmas every day

184
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,631
No

185
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,439
Anchors aweigh

186
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,309
Full steam ahead

187
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,716
Man overboard

188
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,395
So Christmas was meant
to last just one day

189
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,914
And maybe it's better that way

190
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,913
It's a time to be treasured,
it can't always be here,

191
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,993
But the feeling it gives us
can last the whole year

192
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,109
Now this gift holds a story
both wondrous and rare,

193
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,079
About a father and a son
and the love that they share

194
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,310
This Christmas they'll learn
before the night's through,

195
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,598
If we care for each other,
our dreams can come true

196
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,590
Come on, Maxie,
at least hum a few bars

197
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,908
Dad, hurry up

198
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,234
The mailman comes at noon, Dad

199
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,436
Let's see, now

200
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,760
- How about an electrical recliner?
- Yeah, Dad, whatever

201
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,552
Don't want to turn
into a fancy pants

202
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,191
Yeah, Dad, but Santa won't get
our letter if we don't leave

203
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,349
now

204
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,238
Hold on, Dad
We're taking a short cut

205
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,234
We ought to slow down
before we break the sound barrier

206
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,517
- What?
- We're headed straight for the mall

207
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,068
Great idea

208
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,310
- Low bridge
- Really? Where?

209
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,033
Go ahead and stop the mailman, Son

210
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,796
I'll be right behind ya
Don't worry, I won't let you down

211
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,549
Excuse me

212
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,792
Pardon me, ma'am
Didn't mean to get fresh

213
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,512
Wait

214
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,518
There's a madman
on the ornament

215
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,431
Sorry

216
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,112
Wait Stop

217
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,272
You have to mail our letter
to Santa

218
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,316
Get out of the road, kid

219
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,951
Do you have anything bigger?
I have an empty space right here

220
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,034
I'll take it

221
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,838
My dad'll be here
any minute, honest

222
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,912
Sorry, kid, gotta go

223
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,830
Special delivery
for the North Pole

224
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,598
You really think Santa
will get the letter?

225
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,477
Sure as I stand here

226
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,233
Slippery

227
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,153
I gotta get it, I just gotta

228
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,518
My own one-of-a-kind, carbon fibre,
torque rod, snappy flex,

229
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,390
tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail, wood core,
twin-directional snowboard

230
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,999
That's a mouthful

231
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,640
With adjustable
forward and high back

232
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,712
skid plate step-in bindings

233
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,393
Look at this All nice and neat
and ready for ol' Santy

234
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,396
Merry Christmas Eve, Pete

235
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,075
Why, if it ain't
the goof master himself

236
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,755
Say, we got us
some more work to do, Max,

237
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,070
or Santy won't find our chimney

238
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,750
Ain't that quaint? The goof brain
thinks there's a Santy Claus

239
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,034
There isn't?

240
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,508
Like father, like goof

241
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,070
Kid's got the goof gene
in his bloodstream

242
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,798
There is too a Santa

243
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,912
Now, son, come here

244
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,994
See, it's an urbane myth,
like that Locked Ness Monstrosity,

245
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,390
and the fella with the sweets
takes cheques

246
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,314
Well, think of it
An old guy in a red suit

247
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,472
cruising the entire world
in one night,

248
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,678
using reindeer what fly
Why, it's impossible

249
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,911
Look, kid, I've been around, see

250
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,912
I've been to foreign lands,
like Brooklyn,

251
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,709
and I've never seen,
nor met a soul who's seen,

252
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,360
this Santy Claus fella

253
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,476
Look, Maxie, I found the front door

254
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,516
So long, neighbours

255
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,751
Have a very merry Christmas

256
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,791
And a happy New Year

257
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,438
Hey, how about giving
your old man a hand?

258
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,951
What is it, Maxie?
Why, you look like Santy Claus

259
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,349
put a lump of coal in your stocking

260
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,954
I heard there isn't any Santa Claus

261
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,316
Who went and told you
a silly thing like that?

262
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,118
Mr Pete

263
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,111
Well, that figures

264
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,316
Of course there's a Santy

265
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,392
Or we'd have out-of-work elves

266
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,674
You think?

267
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,115
Think? Heck, I'm sure

268
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,078
Son, have I ever been wrong?

269
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,392
A broken clock is right
two or three times a day,

270
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,471
and this time I'm right

271
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,916
Believe me, Santa won't let you down

272
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,553
- You really think he'll come?
- Why, as sure as pigs fly

273
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,720
Hey, Dad,
what did you ask for from Santa?

274
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,234
You know, just the usual

275
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,992
What's that?

276
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,310
It's a surprise

277
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,552
Now, plug her in
and let the joy of Christmas shine

278
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,757
That'll put
the spirit of Christmas in you

279
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,317
Course there's a Santa

280
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,793
Believe me,
Santa won't let you down

281
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,672
An old guy in a red suit,

282
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,595
cruising the entire world in
one night, using reindeer what fly

283
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,671
Why, it's impossible

284
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,280
Hiya, Maxie Wanna help?

285
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,672
Did you know that there are
two billion children in the world?

286
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,118
No wonder
I keep tripping over roller skates

287
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,432
That means Santa would have to make
800 visits a second,

288
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,909
not including bathroom breaks

289
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,037
I guess old Santy's
been at it so long,

290
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,429
he figured out the short cuts

291
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,876
Looks like it's gonna be
a white Christmas

292
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,916
Dad, this is serious

293
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,673
I know, son, but

294
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,799
Gosh
Something sure smells mighty tasty

295
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,716
But how can a reindeer fly?

296
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,997
That's easy,
it's those antlers, they

297
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,119
You know, with the wind
and all, that creates lift

298
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,239
Hot

299
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,795
Still, it's a lot of work
for one guy

300
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,873
That's why we leave him cookies,
for a pick-me-up

301
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,516
Just doesn't quite make sense, Dad

302
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,158
Chestnuts

303
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,871
Where are we going, Dad?

304
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,999
To share the joy of Christmas
with those less fortunate

305
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,310
Shouldn't Santa be doing this?

306
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,836
Santy's on a tight schedule
this time of year,

307
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,070
so we're helping him out

308
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,277
Looks like
I might need one, too

309
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,236
Wanna play toy carses? All I got's
two, but you can have one

310
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,630
Santa gave me this one last year

311
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,712
This year, I hope he's gonna
give me another one

312
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,595
Kid, I ain't so sure
there is such a thing as

313
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,148
Christmas Eve dinner is served

314
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,352
- Mr Goofy, that's incredible
- Like magic

315
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,951
Christmas magic

316
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,032
Thank you so much

317
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,989
With things being so tight,
without you, we wouldn't have

318
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,629
Don't mention it
You'd do the same for me

319
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,998
But have you ever really,
actually seen Santa?

320
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,957
He's got a big white beard

321
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,316
But have you ever
actually seen him in person?

322
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,671
Where?

323
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,550
- Merry Christmas
- Santa

324
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,834
Santa?

325
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,911
You made it

326
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,389
Who wants to be the first
to sit on Santy's lap?

327
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,914
Me, me Over here

328
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,036
I'm so glad you came

329
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,430
I almost didn't believe any more,

330
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,839
but now

331
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,835
Everything's OK So

332
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,992
I want my own one-of-a-kind,
carbon fibre, torque rod,

333
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,719
snappy flex,
tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail,

334
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,598
twin-directional snowboard
Please

335
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,719
Dad?

336
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,634
You tricked me How could you?

337
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,997
Santy's got a problem with one
of his elves, but he'll be back

338
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,716
Gosh, Maxie I'm real sorry

339
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,796
I was just trying
to make those kids happy

340
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,710
Remember my tradition of eating one
of Santy's cookies before bedtime?

341
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,279
What's the point?

342
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,751
Remember how we always open
one present on Christmas Eve?

343
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,559
Hiya, Maxie

344
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,393
Lookee here,
it's your old stuffed bear

345
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,553
- Remember what you named him?
- Old Stuffed Bear

346
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,111
- Remember who gave him to ya?
- Yeah Santa

347
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,191
But that's when I was little

348
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,149
No, he's not

349
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,789
Trust me, Max
You just gotta believe

350
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,872
- Santy's real
- No, he's not

351
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,633
- Yes, he is
- No, he's not

352
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,599
I promise

353
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,476
Then prove it

354
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,115
When Santy shows up,
we'll be here to greet him

355
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,111
I'll snap a picture of him

356
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,078
so you'll have
photographic evidence

357
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,436
Yeah You'll fall off the roof first

358
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,510
I won't fall off the roof
You just watch

359
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,320
Santy Claus is coming to town

360
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,270
Bright

361
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,714
Told you you'd fall off the roof

362
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,268
I didn't fall off the roof

363
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,678
Where's Santy?
I didn't miss him, did l?

364
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,273
Nope

365
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,351
Then where is he?

366
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,270
I don't know about you,
but I'm cold and tired,

367
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,954
and Santa Claus is not coming

368
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,753
Why doesn't he just grow up
and face the facts?

369
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,430
"Don't forget

370
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,909
Max"'

371
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,991
Oh, Dad

372
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,356
Max, wake up Look, son

373
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,351
It's him, it really is

374
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,229
Do you see him, Maxie? Do ya?

375
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,039
Over here

376
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,670
- Almost forgot Smile, Santy
- Dad, the lens cap

377
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,955
I'll get it right this time

378
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,557
Come down with your hands up
We have you surrounded

379
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,149
What in the name of Pete is going on,
for Pete's sake?

380
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
Maybe he's running a little late

381
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,351
Dad

382
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,434
Are you OK?

383
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,269
You were right about everything
I even fell off the roof

384
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,150
Hey, Dad, it's OK
Santa didn't show No biggie

385
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,678
Well, since he's not coming,

386
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,228
at least we can eat
all his cookies

387
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,470
Not hungry

388
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,439
Hey, Dad,
here's one from me Open it

389
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,839
Maybe later

390
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,239
Max?

391
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,708
Burglars

392
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,233
Santy

393
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,148
Merry Christmas

394
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,198
Santy, I'm so happy you came

395
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,872
Gosh I thought you'd be taller

396
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,792
And you look trimmer
than your pictures

397
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,235
Well, you know

398
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,550
camera adds 50 pounds

399
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,438
You have to meet Maxie

400
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,034
Yeah, love to,
but gotta get going

401
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,873
Two billion kids, 823 a second

402
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,516
Very tight schedule

403
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,512
Wait, Santy,
he's around somewheres

404
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,557
Wait Santy

405
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,113
Santy

406
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,753
- Maxie?
- Hi, Dad

407
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,156
What are you doing
dressed up like Santy Claus?

408
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,518
I just wanted to make you happy,
like you did for our neighbours

409
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,911
Maxie, I might have let you down,
but you sure didn't let me down

410
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,958
Could it be? Do you think?

411
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,873
Gosh It sure looks like

412
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,914
Santa Claus

413
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,275
I believe it is

414
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,515
Wow, my own one-of-a-kind,

415
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,036
carbon fibre, torque rod,
snappy flexed, tip-to-tail,

416
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,432
rail-to-rail, wood core,
twin-directional snowboard

417
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,429
- Thanks, Santa
- What's all the commotion?

418
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,910
If it's another robber,
I'm gonna get him

419
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,440
Santa?

420
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,878
Well, hey, Santa,
I believed in ya all along

421
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,316
For real and for true
So, where are my presents?

422
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,397
Merry Christmas

423
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,233
But what about my squirty gun
and my yo-yo?

424
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,356
I know you can hear me

425
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,468
Santa didn't forget your gift,
did he?

426
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,438
Every year, I ask for the same gift,

427
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,511
and every year I get it

428
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,669
What's that?

429
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,318
Your happiness

430
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,599
What is it, son?

431
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,638
Got you the same thing

432
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,915
Merry Christmas, Dad

433
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,911
Merry Christmas, Max

434
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,831
Where are you going?

435
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,435
To share my present
with little Jimmy next door

436
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,957
That's my boy

437
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,477
So, Christmas is found
in the way we live,

438
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,189
Not what we receive,
but what we can give

439
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:26,514
Our Iast present may seem small,
Not fancy, flashy or special at all

440
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,149
But this gift can be given
by the rich or the poor,

441
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,597
It's a gift of the heart,
and it means so much more

442
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,994
Thanks, Joe Merry Christmas

443
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,231
Merry Christmas, George
You working?

444
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,515
Not tonight It's Christmas Eve

445
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,991
There it is, Pluto

446
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,958
The perfect gift
to go with Minnie's watch

447
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,229
My Minnie

448
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,438
They close at five
I'm a little short now,

449
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,592
but you and I are gonna make
lots of tips today

450
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,274
- Aren't we, fella?
- Yeah

451
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,592
After work we'll pick it up
Let's get this tree to Minnie's

452
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,916
Figaro, there's nothing but bills

453
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,079
How am I going to afford
to get Mickey a present?

454
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,757
Oh, Mickey

455
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,469
When you play your harmonica,
my heart sings

456
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,633
An instrument like that
deserves a special case

457
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,359
Yeah Some day

458
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,515
Come into the kitchen
Breakfast is almost ready

459
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,994
I'm not eating you
out of house and home?

460
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,594
Course not, silly I have plenty

461
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,998
For me?

462
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,192
Have you got the time, Minnie?

463
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,319
- Let's see, it's
- Gosh, sure is a beautiful watch

464
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,834
My one heirloom

465
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,072
It'd look nice with a gold chain
around your pretty neck

466
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,517
Oh, Mickey My goodness,
I've got to go to work

467
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,238
Madam Your sleigh awaits

468
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,957
Oh, how wonderful

469
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,874
Giddy up, Pluto

470
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,472
See you tonight

471
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,790
Fella, we got work to do

472
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,719

Merry Christmas

477
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,557
I'll be merry when
I've sold all those ten-footers

478
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,078

your face hanging out? Get to work

This here's what you folks need Ten
feet of towering Nova Scotia pine

491
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,510
Wow It's bigger than our house

492
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,319
Well, it's a little more
than we need

493
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,198
Missus, I've got to be honest
with you,

494
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,352
this is all
I've got left on the lot

495
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,238
The others have been reservated

496
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,792
You don't want these kids going
without a tree now, do you?

497
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,553
We are gonna get a tree,
aren't we, Daddy?

498
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,108
This is all we have

499
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,749
Well, that'll be just fine
for a down payment

500
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,073
I'll set you up with a nice
instalment plan Just sign here

501
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,118
We're gonna get a tree

502
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,040
Foot off the brake,
the kids are waiting

503
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,429
Hey, how about this tree?

504
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,193
I found it out back

505
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,953
It hasn't been reservated

506
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,990
It's beautiful

507
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,548

Christmas

512
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,189
I had them on the hook
for a ten-foot tree

513
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,514
I'm taking what I would have made
from you

514
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,959
- But l
- Now, get out of my lot

515
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,029
Chumps

516
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,798
Somebody's burning their ham

517
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,636
More than warm It's hot

518
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,796
Not my ten-footers

519
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,394
Holiday shoppers, don't forget
to bring your purchases

520
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,948
to our gift-wrapping department

521
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,951
I've never seen it so busy

522
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,510
Who made you
Santa's number one helper?

523
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,717
I want to get Mickey
something special

524
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,598
Without that Christmas bonus,

Mr Mortimer wants to see you

My Christmas bonus

Santa's best little helper

- That's Minnie

537
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,791
Whatever On behalf of the store,
it gives me great pleasure

538
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,953
to present you
with your Christmas bonus

539
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,908
A fruitcake?

540
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,357
No need to thank me The expression
on your face is thanks enough

541
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,272
Scoot along to the gift-wrapping
department where you belong

542
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,271
And, er, Winnie?

543
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,191
Merry Christmas

544
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,110
Oh, Mickey How am I ever
gonna get your present now?

545
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,549
There must be a way to get Minnie's
present by five o'clock

546
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,000
You got any ideas, fella?

547
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,878
Don't worry We'll come up
with something, we just gotta

548
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,752
Do you think the band
will ever show up?

549
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,992
I don't know They're putting out
a fire at Crazy Pete's

550
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,230
It went up like a Roman candle

551
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,390
Chief, looks like the toy drive
is a big fat bust

552
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,592
Listen That music

553
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,159
Come on

554
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,351
Where are we going?

555
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,670
A concert in the park

556
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,671
Look, Bub, we're desperate

557
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,957
We need music for the toy drive
You're our only hope

558
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,918
I don't have time
I gotta get a gift for my girl

559
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,754
Look, pal, don't do it for us,
do it for the kids

560
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,308
- But l
- Son, to these kids,

561
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,359
the only difference between
a broken heart and a smile is you

562
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,639
You're on Break a leg, pal

563
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,758
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I can't stay

564
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,638
I got Christmas shopping to do and

565
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,508
Gosh

566
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,836
- The band
- Must have been hot at Crazy Pete's

567
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,110
Guess I'll be showing up
at Minnie's empty-handed

568
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,320
Terrific Thanks to you,
this was our best toy drive ever

569
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,278
You and that harmonica
make a great team

570
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,352
She's worth her weight in gold

571
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,351
Holy cow That's it

572
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,911
We've got two minutes to get
to the shop Come on, Pluto

573
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,070
- Thanks, fellas
- Goodbye

574
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,071
- Thanks
- Merry Christmas

575
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,509
Sorry

576
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,998
Hey, what's going on?

577
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,831
This is our stop

578
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,308
Look, there's the shop

579
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:18,035
Excuse me, sir I was just hoping to
trade this for a gift for my girl

580
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,475
Sorry, that harmonica
isn't worth much

581
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,313
Well, merry Christmas

582
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,634
You're worth a lot to me,
old friend

583
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,078
Say, maybe that harmonica
is worth something after all

584
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,071
Come on in

585
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,157
Can't wait to open your present?
I know how you feel

586
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,550
I love Christmas so much

587
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,633
Say, Mickey,
why don't you play some music?

588
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,553
Isn't it time
we were opening our presents,

589
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,871
and speaking of time,
what time is it?

590
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,992
Well, l I think it's time
for you to open your gift

591
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,676
A case, for my harmonica

592
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:02,756
A chain for my watch
Mickey, it's beautiful,

593
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,195
but I traded my watch
to get you that case

594
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,471
I traded my harmonica
to get you a watch chain

595
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,788
Oh, Mickey,

596
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,431
I can't believe you gave up what
means the most to you, for me

597
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,638
Minnie, you're all the music
I'll ever need

598
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,874
- Merry Christmas, Mickey
- Merry Christmas, Minnie

599
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,828
Want some fruitcake?

600
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,835
A gift from the heart
is cherished and true

601
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,035
A present is best
when love's given, too

602
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,998
So in the end, love is the reason

603
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,197
That Christmas is more
than a gift-giving season

604
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,636
It's a time with our loved ones
to show that we care,

605
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,156
When families and neighbours
come together to share

606
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,630
So, this Christmas season,
let us all do our parts

607
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,633
To keep Christmas spirit
alive in our hearts
