1
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,259
Have a try at it.

2
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:05,666
Coo, governor, that was a slide.

3
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,402
- It was good, wasn't it?
- I should say.

4
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:09,445
You beat the record, that's what you did.

5
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:10,740
Did I, now?

6
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,179
Look at Albert.

7
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,549
He fell!

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,518
- Don't you like sliding, son?
- Yes, sir. It's great sport.

9
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,319
Come on then. Try and beat my record.

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,156
No, thank you, governor.
I'm not very good at running.

11
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:33,997
Here. Get up on my back.
We'll show them how to slide.

12
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,435
Thank you, sir.

13
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:38,468
- What's your name, youngster?
- Tim, sir. Thank you, sir.

14
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,203
- Well, come on, Tim. Here we go.
- Thank you.

15
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:43,711
We'll really do this slide.
We'll make a record together.

16
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,940
Here we go now!

17
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,671
Hold tight.

18
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:50,886
There we are. Wasn't that lovely?

19
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:54,355
It was wonderful.
It made my stomach all wobbly-like.

20
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,822
- Yes. We're a team, that's what we are.
- I don't suppose you ever fall down.

21
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:01,022
- Like Albert.
- Fall down?

22
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:03,564
Who, me? No.

23
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,634
- Well, sir?
- I am sorry, governor.

24
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:10,764
I didn't mean to hit you, sir.

25
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,502
Please don't be angry with him, sir.
He's my brother.

26
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,840
In that case,
I've only one reason to be angry.

27
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:17,174
He broke my record.

28
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,241
- What's your name?
- Cratchit, sir. Peter Cratchit.

29
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:21,613
He's my brother, Tim Cratchit.

30
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:24,084
- Not Bob Cratchit's sons?
- Why, yes, sir.

31
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:25,781
I know your father well.

32
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:28,688
In truth, I was on my way
to his place of work when we met.

33
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,893
Maybe he'll take the message for us, Pete.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,258
As you'll be seeing him, sir,
you might do me the favor...

35
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,889
of giving him this list of things
my mother wants him to fetch.

36
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,899
- Certainly.
- It's very nice of you to do that, sir.

37
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,696
Not a bit of it, Peter.
I'm more than willing.

38
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,963
Well, that is jolly.

39
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:44,336
Don't you two lads want to see
your father? And on Christmas Eve, too?

40
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,898
It ain't that we don't want to see
our own father, sir.

41
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,537
It's the man our father works for
we don't want to see. Mr. Scrooge.

42
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,945
I don't think he's very fond
of small boys, sir.

43
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,383
Yes. I understand.
You see, I knew Mr. Scrooge...

44
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,784
when I was a small boy. He's my uncle.

45
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:28,472
Come on now, Bob.

46
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,212
Aren't you going to wish me
a merry Christmas?

47
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:33,084
Mr. Fred, I am sorry. When you came in
and stood there like that...

48
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,147
I thought it was your uncle.
A merry Christmas, sir.

49
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:37,818
A merry Christmas to you, Bob,
and to your family.

50
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,795
I've already paid my respects
to part of your brood.

51
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,859
Peter and Tim, their names were.

52
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:46,026
They asked me to give you this list
from their mother.

53
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,366
Thank you. They shouldn't have made it
an errand for you.

54
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:49,905
I was pleased to do it.

55
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,365
It's cold in here.

56
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,602
You think we could have some coal
on the fire?

57
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:56,136
Oh, yes.
It's against the regulations, isn't it?

58
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,578
Mr. Scrooge doesn't like to waste coal, sir.

59
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,115
I foresaw that and provided for it.

60
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:03,209
This'll make the place less bleak.

61
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:06,312
- What might that be?
- It's a wine bottle.

62
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:10,054
A cheering, warming, goodly wine.
A wine that'll race through your veins...

63
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:13,892
with little torches. It's port, Bob.
The fifth essence of the Christmas spirit.

64
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:16,465
But we haven't got a glass.

65
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,557
I'll get one from Mr. Scrooge's office.

66
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,910
- What is this?
- Cough medicine.

67
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,470
Yeah, I thought so.

68
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,408
We will.

69
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:38,613
- We will have some more coal.
- Good man, Bob.

70
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,487
Come on now, Bob.
Let's drink a loving cup. You sweeten it.

71
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,963
- Another merry Christmas, Mr. Fred.
- Yes.

72
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:00,406
A merry Christmas to you, Uncle.
God save you.

73
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:01,465
Humbug!

74
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:04,809
Christmas, humbug?
Uncle, I'm sure you don't mean that.

75
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,974
Humbug I said, and humbug I mean.

76
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,610
Merry Christmas.
What right have you to be merry?

77
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:13,154
- You're poor enough.
- What right have you to be dismal?

78
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:15,053
- You're rich enough.
- Humbug.

79
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:16,923
Now, Uncle, don't be cross.

80
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:20,053
What else can I be
when I live in such a world of fools?

81
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,888
Merry Christmas.

82
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:25,467
What's Christmastime, but a time
for paying bills without money?

83
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,198
A time for finding yourself a year older
and not an hour richer.

84
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,975
If I could work my will, every idiot
that goes about with "merry Christmas"...

85
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,533
on his lips should be boiled
with his own pudding...

86
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:37,841
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

87
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,438
- Uncle!
- Nephew!

88
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,849
Keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.

89
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,311
- But you don't keep it.
- Let me leave it alone then.

90
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,050
Much good it has ever done you.

91
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:52,223
Uncle, there are many things
which have made me happy.

92
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:55,625
Things which have never
fattened my purse by even that much.

93
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,862
Christmas is one of these.

94
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:01,096
I've always looked on Christmas
as a good time...

95
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,704
a kind, charitable, forgiving, pleasant time.

96
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,071
It's the only time
when people open their hearts freely.

97
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,643
The only time
when men and women seem to realize...

98
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:13,580
that all human beings
are really members of the same family.

99
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,850
And that being members
of the same family...

100
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,887
they owe each other
some measure of warmth and solace.

101
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:24,556
And therefore, Uncle, though it's never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pockets...

102
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:28,063
I believe that it has done me good,
and will do me good.

103
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:29,689
And I say, God bless it!

104
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,169
Let me hear another sound from you...

105
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,038
and you'll keep Christmas
by losing your situation.

106
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,748
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.

107
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:52,117
- I wonder you don't go into Parliament.
- Uncle, don't be angry.

108
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:55,089
Come now. Come and dine
with Bess and me tomorrow.

109
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,022
- Bess?
- Yes. Elizabeth, my fiancée.

110
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,187
I'm dining with her people,
I'm sure they'd welcome a visit from you.

111
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,164
- So you're engaged?
- Yes.

112
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:04,799
May I ask why?

113
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:09,905
- Because I fell in love.
- Because you fell in love.

114
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:12,073
You intend to marry?

115
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,270
As soon as I'm earning enough money.

116
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,108
Has she tried her relatives?

117
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,183
- That wasn't the reason for my visit.
- Good afternoon.

118
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,621
Uncle, I ask nothing from you.
I want nothing from you.

119
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,920
There's no reason
why we should be enemies.

120
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,220
Good afternoon.

121
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:34,229
Uncle, I made this visit
in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep...

122
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:38,233
my Christmas spirit to the last.
And so, Uncle, a merry Christmas.

123
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:40,394
- Good afternoon.
- And a happy new year.

124
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,766
Good afternoon!

125
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,204
A merry Christmas to you, Bob.

126
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,303
Thank you, sir. A merry Christmas to you
and to your wife-to-be.

127
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,472
Thank you.

128
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,450
- A merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

129
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:01,581
- And the same to you, sirs.
- Thank you.

130
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:03,318
- Scrooge and Marley's, I believe.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:05,223
I have the pleasure
of addressing Mr. Marley?

132
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,852
- No, sir.
- Then you're Mr. Scrooge.

133
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,090
- No.
- My name is Scrooge.

134
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,665
- And my name is Twill.
- And mine is Rummidge.

135
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:14,861
And Mr. Marley?

136
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:16,905
Mr. Marley's been dead these seven years.

137
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,739
- He died seven years ago this very night.
- On Christmas Eve?

138
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:23,803
As good a time as any.

139
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,337
We have no doubt that Mr. Marley's
liberality is well represented...

140
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,111
by his surviving partner.

141
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,551
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge...

142
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,818
it is more than usually desirable
that some slight provision be made...

143
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,517
for the poor and destitute.

144
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:40,221
Many thousands are in want, sir,
in need of common necessaries.

145
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,359
Hundreds of thousands are in want
of common comforts, sir.

146
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,663
- Are there no prisons?
- Plenty of prisons.

147
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,531
And the workhouses,
are they still in operation?

148
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,336
They are. Though I wish with all my heart
they were not.

149
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,469
I was afraid from what you said at first
that something had occurred...

150
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:57,978
to stop them in their useful course.

151
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:01,312
Under the impression these places
can scarcely furnish Christmas cheer...

152
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,477
for the mind and body of the multitude...

153
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:08,055
a few of us have endeavored to form
a fund for the poor, to buy them food...

154
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,251
and drink, and means of warmth.

155
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:12,591
What can I put you down for, sir?

156
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:13,651
Nothing.

157
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,660
You wish to be anonymous?

158
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,529
I wish to be left alone.

159
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,331
Since you asked me what I wish,
gentlemen, that is my answer.

160
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:24,931
I help to support the institutions
I mentioned. They cost enough...

161
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,134
and those who are badly off
must go there.

162
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,007
Many can't go there,
and many would rather die.

163
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:34,480
If they'd rather die, they'd better do it
and decrease the surplus population.

164
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,108
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

165
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,056
In that case, we must apologize
for interrupting you, sir.

166
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:50,189
Humbug!

167
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,739
You keep close watch on the closing hour.

168
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,405
- It's half an hour past, sir.
- Then close up.

169
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:39,470
Thank you, sir.

170
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:42,381
Don't work overtime.
You might make something of yourself.

171
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:49,253
- You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?
- lf it's quite convenient, sir.

172
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,156
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.

173
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:54,560
If I was to stop half a crown for it,
you'd consider yourself ill-used...

174
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,688
I'll be bound.

175
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,164
It's only once a year, sir.

176
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,828
A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

177
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,736
However, I suppose you'll have to have
the whole day.

178
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,603
Be here all the earlier next morning.

179
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,164
- Yes, sir.
- Then be off.

180
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:11,404
Well?

181
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:15,381
My wages, sir. They fall due today.

182
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,847
Can't wait to spend them?

183
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:25,719
Thank you, sir.

184
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:04,732
You rascal! You want more?

185
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,306
Now look here, boys, just because
a fellow wears a hat, you know...

186
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,467
it doesn't mean he can't throw a snowball.

187
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,272
I used to do a lot of snowballing...

188
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:19,405
and I found the best way to make
a snowball was to take the snow into...

189
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,450
your bare hands, like this, and then...

190
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:23,917
crunch it together
until the warmth from your hands...

191
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:24,975
Here!

192
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,214
Look who's coming down the street.
A blooming topper.

193
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:31,055
- Come on, governor. Show us.
- Right you are. Here, give me room.

194
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,655
Half a more.

195
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:38,531
Let her go!

196
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,732
A bull's-eye!

197
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,143
I had no idea it was you, master.
No idea at all. Truly, master.

198
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,811
No doubt this is your idea
of a Christmas joke.

199
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,218
I'll get your hat, sir.

200
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:08,220
I didn't know, sir. The coach, it...

201
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:12,290
Cratchit, I told you before that I could
find a man more capable than yourself.

202
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,064
- I need say no more.
- You mean, I'm sacked, sir?

203
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,195
Exactly.

204
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:19,941
But in my papers, sir,
it says I must have a week's notice.

205
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:23,843
Your week's salary will recompense me
for the price of a new hat. No.

206
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:27,041
As this hat cost 16 and 6,
and your salary is 15 and 6...

207
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,549
you owe me a shilling.

208
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:40,662
I say, governor, we are sorry.
The old stinker.

209
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,529
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

210
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:26,570
I'd like to buy a goose.
About 5 and 8 pence.

211
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:27,768
Certainly, sir.

212
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,005
- That's the one.
- A very good choice, sir.

213
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:36,414
Here, let me help you.

214
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,914
4 penneth of potatoes,
6 penneth of mixed nuts...

215
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,151
6 penneth of apples.

216
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,420
The special pippins, sir,
or the medium cookers?

217
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:46,927
- The special pippins.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:49,157
And 6... No, 8 penneth of oranges.

219
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:50,255
Thank you, sir.

220
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,134
Chestnuts.

221
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,527
Chestnuts, sir? All hot, sir.

222
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:58,004
They warm the innards
and cheer the heart.

223
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,701
- What's Christmas without chestnuts, sir?
- What indeed.

224
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,038
2 penneth... No, 3 penneth.

225
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,671
- Yes, sir.
- Put them in my back pocket.

226
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,772
- Yes. I will, sir.
- That's it.

227
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,777
- There you are, sir.
- Now the other one.

228
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:15,256
- Here we are.
- And here's your 3 pence.

229
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,758
- And a merry Christmas.
- Thank you, sir.

230
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,228
- Bob, you have got a load.
- Haven't I, though?

231
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,001
And all for tomorrow.

232
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,274
Let me help you.

233
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,540
- Did you get the oranges?
- Yes.

234
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:42,641
- And the lemons?
- Yes.

235
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:44,208
- And the potatoes?
- Yes.

236
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:45,685
Oh, bless me.

237
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,689
- How did you carry it all?
- I really don't know.

238
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,622
- What's this?
- Guess.

239
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,699
- Roast of beef.
- No. Try again.

240
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,893
- Veal.
- No.

241
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:00,957
- Tripe.
- No.

242
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:02,060
- Ribs.
- No.

243
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:05,368
- I know. Sausages.
- No. Goose.

244
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,106
Look!

245
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,546
Now take it all into the kitchen.
Save Mother a step.

246
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,276
Let me carry something.

247
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,148
- Here, Tim, you may carry the neck.
- Thank you.

248
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,249
Go over to the fire and have a warm, Bob.

249
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:22,312
Yes, dear.

250
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:27,424
- Did you get the day off tomorrow?
- Without hardly any trouble at all.

251
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:30,192
- Wasn't Mr. Scrooge angry?
- Well, you might say he was...

252
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,665
- and you might say he wasn't.
- Meaning what, Bob?

253
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:36,694
Meaning I got the day off and we don't
want to talk about Mr. Scrooge tonight.

254
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:39,938
Come here, you monkeys,
and see what I've got.

255
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,474
Chestnuts!

256
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:50,604
Marley!

257
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,120
Humbug.

258
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,936
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.

259
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:35,340
Who were you then?

260
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,542
In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley.

261
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:43,209
Well...

262
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,150
- what do you want?
- Much.

263
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,761
- You don't believe in me?
- I don't.

264
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:03,730
What proof would you have of my reality
beyond that of your own senses?

265
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:06,865
- I don't know.
- Why do you doubt your senses?

266
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,466
Because a little thing affects them.

267
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:11,376
A slight disorder of the stomach
makes them liars.

268
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:16,744
You may be an undigested bit of beef,
a blot of mustard, or a crumb of cheese.

269
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,447
Humbug, I tell you. Humbug!

270
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,349
Silence!

271
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,894
10:00 and all's well.

272
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,868
Watch! There's an intruder in my room.

273
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,070
- Right up, sir. Law and order.
- Here's my key. Make haste.

274
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:44,334
Good.

275
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,484
We'll soon see how real you are.

276
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:54,686
I made this visit for your welfare,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

277
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,428
- In here.
- Right-o.

278
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,162
There he is. Out with him!

279
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:17,010
Your intruder seems to have extruded,
if I may say so, governor.

280
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:21,072
He was here when I opened the door.
He was a spirit. Someone I know.

281
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,844
Of course, a spirit.

282
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,515
A great night for spirits, sir,
of one sort or another.

283
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:30,714
Meaning, governor,
we wouldn't mind a bit of spirit ourselves.

284
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:32,584
You may leave!

285
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:35,627
Indigestion, that's what it was.

286
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:37,122
Out with you!

287
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,394
Sorry we couldn't be of any assistance,
governor.

288
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,595
Perhaps the next spirits you have, we can.

289
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,886
Man of the worldly mind.

290
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:05,324
- Now do you believe in me?
- I do. I must.

291
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:08,493
But why? Why do you trouble me?

292
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:12,426
It is required of every man that the spirit
within him should walk abroad...

293
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:13,866
among his fellow men.

294
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:18,869
If that spirit goes not forth in life,
it must do so after death.

295
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:30,116
- You are bound in heavy chains.
- I wear the chain I forged in life.

296
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:32,677
Is its pattern strange to you?

297
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,385
The chain you will bear
was full as heavy and as long as this...

298
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:39,188
seven Christmas Eves ago.

299
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:43,263
It must be a ponderous chain by now.

300
00:24:46,434 --> 00:24:48,459
Jacob. Old Jacob Marley...

301
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,165
- have you no comfort for me?
- None.

302
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,537
And none for myself.

303
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,672
In life, my spirit never walked beyond...

304
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,213
the narrow limits
of our money-changing hole...

305
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,806
and weary journeys lie before me.

306
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:06,217
- You travel fast?
- On the wings of the wind.

307
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:10,048
You must have covered a great quantity
of ground in seven years.

308
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:15,229
Captive, bound, and double-ironed.

309
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:20,496
No space of regret can make amends
for the wasted opportunities of one life.

310
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,497
Poor and ignorant Scrooge.

311
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:27,266
Yet, such was I.

312
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:30,201
But you were always
a good man of business, Jacob.

313
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,509
Business. Mankind was my business.

314
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:36,480
The common welfare was my business.

315
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:39,478
Charity, mercy, forbearance,
and benevolence...

316
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:41,454
all these were my business.

317
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,952
It is at this time of the year
that I suffer most.

318
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:53,824
To see the want I could have stopped,
the suffering I could have solaced.

319
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:56,430
The hunger I could have satisfied.

320
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,198
Hear me.

321
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:01,201
My time is nearly gone.

322
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,777
If you must go, Jacob,
don't let me keep you.

323
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:09,115
I have sat invisible beside you
many and many a day.

324
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:15,889
I am here to warn you that you have
one chance of escaping my fate.

325
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,325
- One chance, Ebenezer Scrooge.
- What is it?

326
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:23,959
You will be haunted by three spirits.

327
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:27,126
Is that the chance you mentioned, Jacob?

328
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:28,593
It is.

329
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,632
I think I'd rather not.

330
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:36,373
Unless you suffer these three visitations,
your fate will be the same as mine.

331
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,042
Jacob. Don't leave me yet. Jacob!

332
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:44,017
Expect the first when the bell tolls 1:00...

333
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:47,187
the second on the stroke of 2:00...

334
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:50,552
the third on the last vibration of 3:00.

335
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:53,856
Couldn't I take all three at once
and have it over?

336
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:03,232
Remember, the first at 1:00...

337
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:06,938
the second at 2:00, the third at 3:00.

338
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:08,260
Humbug.

339
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:24,175
- Are you the spirit I was told to expect?
- I am.

340
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:29,383
- Who are you?
- I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

341
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,358
The light. It hurts my eyes.

342
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,160
- It blinds me.
- I'm not surprised.

343
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,930
It's the warming light of thankfulness...

344
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:43,160
the light of gratitude to others.

345
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,171
- I've never seen it before.
- Of course not.

346
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:50,269
It's men of greed like you
who have long forgotten gratitude.

347
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:53,304
What's your business with me?

348
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,448
Your welfare. Your reclamation.

349
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,711
Rise and walk with me.

350
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:23,068
- We spirits have no fear.
- But I'm not a spirit.

351
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:28,247
Bear but the touch of my hand
on your heart, and you shall be safe.

352
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:12,891
Good heaven! This is my old school!

353
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:15,160
I was a boy here.

354
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:28,567
Merry Christmas!

355
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:32,204
Harry, Joe, Tommy, Percy and Dick!

356
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,314
Dick Wilkins!

357
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:37,951
These are but shadows
of things that have been.

358
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,418
They have no consciousness of us.
You knew them?

359
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:44,185
I went to school with them, all of them.

360
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,358
- Your lip is trembling.
- The cold.

361
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:53,193
- Let's continue. You remember this way?
- Remember it?

362
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,466
I could walk it blindfold.

363
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,732
Strange to have forgotten it
for so many years.

364
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:12,744
- That is myself.
- Was yourself.

365
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,181
Was.

366
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,992
What is that upon your cheek?

367
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:22,825
Nothing. The cold.

368
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:25,890
Listen.

369
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,525
Goodbye, young Scrooge.
Merry Christmas.

370
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:29,797
- Merry Christmas, Jack.
- Your parents coming for you?

371
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:33,204
- No. I'm staying at school for the holidays.
- You are?

372
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:36,141
Always do, you know?
Father and I talked it over.

373
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,611
We decided that some extra swatting at
my studies would do me more good than...

374
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:43,515
Christmas at home.
Christmas, plum pudding and turkeys...

375
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,141
that's just for children.

376
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:48,382
I say,
your governor must be a crusty old bird.

377
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:50,924
- He knows what's best.
- Jack, hurry!

378
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,689
Right-o. I didn't mean anything
against your father, Eb. Good luck.

379
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:03,196
Merry Christmas!

380
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:57,614
- Master Scrooge.
- Yes, sir?

381
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:59,421
Your sister's come to see you.

382
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:02,653
Ebbie, dear Ebbie.

383
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,561
I've come to bring you home.

384
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:09,029
Home, Fran? Home?

385
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,895
Father is so much kinder
than he used to be...

386
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,463
that home is like heaven.

387
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:17,200
That's why I asked him if you
could come home, and he said, "Yes."

388
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,042
And he sent me to fetch you with a coach.

389
00:33:20,114 --> 00:33:23,083
And, Ebbie, Father says
that you're going to go to work...

390
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:24,641
and never come back here.

391
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:29,122
And we're going to have a turkey
and chestnuts and everything.

392
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:31,848
God bless you, Fran.

393
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,392
Ebbie, it's going to be so glorious.

394
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,022
God bless you.

395
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:39,829
- She loved you.
- She did.

396
00:33:40,168 --> 00:33:42,602
I believe she had children before she died.

397
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,130
- One child.
- Your nephew, Fred.

398
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,402
Come.

399
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:06,223
You remember this place?

400
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,195
Fezziwig's warehouse.
I was apprenticed here.

401
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:17,331
It's old Fezziwig.
It's old Fezziwig alive again.

402
00:34:27,915 --> 00:34:29,780
Ebenezer, Dick!

403
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:35,950
Yes, sir?

404
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,020
Ebenezer Scrooge, Dick Wilkins.

405
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:40,321
Yes, sir?

406
00:34:40,394 --> 00:34:42,191
Do you observe the time, sir?

407
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,390
7:05, sir.

408
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:47,662
Do you know you've let me work you
five minutes overtime?

409
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,562
No more work tonight.

410
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,107
Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer.

411
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,572
Up with the shutters. Close up shop.

412
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:02,208
In the eye, Dick. Cheer up, Ebenezer.

413
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,744
What a lark.

414
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:08,516
He always comes through, doesn't he?

415
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:11,490
- Always comes through does old Fezziwig.
- And royally, too.

416
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,357
And royally, too.
Nothing's too good for Fezziwig.

417
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,827
Closed up tight, sirs?

418
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:21,391
- Tight as a barrel, sir.
- Good.

419
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:22,959
Now, about tomorrow.

420
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,194
It's a holiday, of course.

421
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:28,436
But I shall expect you to spend part of it,
at least, with me...

422
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:30,770
eating Christmas dinner.

423
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,537
Thank you, sir.

424
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:35,104
And as probably you'll eat too much
to be any good next day...

425
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,083
we'll make that a holiday, too.

426
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:39,915
Good night, Ebenezer. Good night, Dick.

427
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:43,256
Good night, sir. And thank you, sir.

428
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:44,757
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

429
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:48,685
- A sovereign.
- A whole sovereign.

430
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:52,392
- Solid gold is old Fezziwig.
- Solid gold, through and through.

431
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:56,534
What is the matter?

432
00:35:57,004 --> 00:35:58,198
Nothing particular.

433
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:01,607
Something, I think.

434
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,241
Yes, there is.

435
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,212
Old Fezziwig was very kind to me.

436
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:10,546
Yes, he was. But he's dead now.

437
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:15,179
Perhaps you feel
you'd like to repay his kindness to you.

438
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,447
Well?

439
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,389
You have a clerk, Bob Cratchit.

440
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:21,221
Old Fezziwig would have been
very happy...

441
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:24,526
if you had shown your gratitude to him
by showing kindness to others.

442
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,896
Your clerk, for instance.

443
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,798
Business is business.

444
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,359
I'm a good businessman!

445
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:31,831
My time grows short.

446
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:34,306
I have yet to show you the black years
of your life.

447
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,468
Your gradual enslavement to greed.

448
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:38,034
- Your ruthlessness.
- No!

449
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,876
Your ingratitude.
Your wretched thirst for gold.

450
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,576
No, leave me. I can't stand more.

451
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:45,645
I can't stand more!

452
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:51,517
Come here.
Come here and know me better, Scrooge.

453
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:55,281
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

454
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:59,483
Have you never seen the like of me before?

455
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:00,952
Never.

456
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:06,261
And have you never known my elder
brothers, born these years before me?

457
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:09,665
I'm afraid I haven't.
Have you had many brothers, Spirit?

458
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:12,467
A huge number. Some...

459
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,743
1,800.

460
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:19,412
A tremendous family to provide for.

461
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:21,612
What are we going to do?

462
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:24,480
Walk into the world this Christmas night,
so that you can...

463
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,818
hear and see and feel Christmas
in the world this night.

464
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,084
Did you say "walk" or "fly"?

465
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,056
Touch my robe.

466
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:45,605
Good morning,
and a merry, merry Christmas to you.

467
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,038
Merry Christmas to you.

468
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:48,905
These people, what are they doing?

469
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:52,776
The poor find it cheaper to bring
their dinners to the baker to be cooked.

470
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:55,278
Now then, watch who you're stepping on.

471
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:58,477
Watch who I'm stepping on? I like that.

472
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:00,713
- Go on, off it.
- I will not!

473
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:02,847
Why you little...

474
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:07,126
- Here, let's make it up.
- Frightened?

475
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:10,027
I wouldn't touch your old hand.
I wouldn't...

476
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:13,659
Well, you're not such a bad sort after all.

477
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:15,725
Thank you, and a merry Christmas to you.

478
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,100
And the same to you.

479
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:20,740
What do you sprinkle from that horn
that made them stop quarreling?

480
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:22,070
It's a spirit...

481
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:25,579
five times distilled,
the spirit of Christmas cheer...

482
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:27,807
of love, of all that's good...

483
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:32,319
of all that makes this time of year
different from any other time.

484
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:39,021
Is there a peculiar flavor
in what you sprinkle?

485
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:40,651
An excellent flavor.

486
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:43,025
Would it apply to any kind of dinner?

487
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:44,496
To a poor one most.

488
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,294
Why to a poor one most?

489
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,358
Because it needs it most.

490
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:51,200
Look where you're going,
you big, clumsy ox, you. I'll...

491
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:53,467
I'll shove those words
down your nasty little throat.

492
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:56,339
Stop shoving, will you?
Stop it, I say, or I'll...

493
00:39:57,411 --> 00:40:00,676
Here we are being silly, aren't we now?

494
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:02,215
Like a couple of infants.

495
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:05,480
I say, I know a nice little pub
where they sell hot rum and gin.

496
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:08,780
- We stopped that.
- Yes, we did, didn't we?

497
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,593
That church.

498
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,893
We have business there. Come.

499
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:11,307
I don't believe for a minute
that they love one another.

500
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,216
What makes you say that, Spirit?

501
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:17,253
It is obvious
that they love each other dearly.

502
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:18,916
Nevertheless, don't you think that...

503
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:21,860
it's lucky that they haven't
the wherewithal to get married?

504
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:23,863
Their love will soon fade.

505
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:25,660
I take exception to that!

506
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:28,699
On the contrary,
I think their love would grow.

507
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:30,633
I... They...

508
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,096
They should be married.

509
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:46,836
- Good morning and merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

510
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:54,984
Merry Christmas to you.

511
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:57,148
Bob, a merry Christmas to you.

512
00:42:57,224 --> 00:43:00,250
This is my fiancée, Bess.
This is Mr. Cratchit, and his son Tim.

513
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,726
How do you do?

514
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:05,026
Now, Tim, no secrets.
What were you saying?

515
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,828
I said, sir...

516
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:09,832
- I said she's very pretty.
- Tim!

517
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,905
- Thank you kindly, Tim.
- Don't you agree with him, Bob?

518
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:16,170
- Yes, sir. She is very pretty.
- Father!

519
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,540
Thank you kindly, Mr. Cratchit.

520
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:20,640
- Good morning.
- Goodbye.

521
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:22,841
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

522
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,318
Come on, darling. Let's have a slide.

523
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:32,620
But, Fred, you can't.

524
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,558
Can't I?
You should have seen me yesterday.

525
00:43:34,628 --> 00:43:37,461
But in front of the church? It isn't right.

526
00:43:37,598 --> 00:43:40,260
But, darling, it looks perfect.

527
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:42,826
It is perfect.

528
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:45,667
- It's as slippery as a codfish's tummy.
- No, Fred, no!

529
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:49,368
But, darling, just one slide. Only one.

530
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:52,576
- Yeah.
- Well, all right.

531
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,811
Boys! Sliding in front of the church?

532
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,278
Now run away home.
And a merry Christmas to you all.

533
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:01,116
- Run home.
- See?

534
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,284
But, darling, he has no soul.

535
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:05,154
He's simply acting like a grownup.

536
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,783
I still say he has no soul.

537
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,556
He just doesn't appreciate the qualities
of a good slide.

538
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,141
Come on.

539
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:35,916
One, two, three.

540
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:47,859
- Giddyap.
- Merry Christmas, Tom.

541
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:49,626
And a merry Christmas to you, Bob.

542
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:53,104
- And to you, too, Tiny Tim.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas, sir.

543
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:58,474
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

544
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:04,043
If the shadows remain unaltered
by the future, the child will die.

545
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,086
No!

546
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,847
Surely he'll be spared.

547
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:11,480
With the kind of care that money can buy,
who could tell?

548
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:16,188
But Bob Cratchit has no money.
Not even a position, I've heard.

549
00:45:17,264 --> 00:45:20,631
If all this remains unaltered by the future...

550
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:24,595
the next Christmas
will not find Tiny Tim here.

551
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:27,473
But what of it?

552
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:31,807
If he be like to die, he'd better do it
and decrease the population.

553
00:45:34,848 --> 00:45:35,906
Come.

554
00:45:43,857 --> 00:45:46,291
Mother! The goose, we smelled it.

555
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,486
Outside the baker's.

556
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:49,586
- We did, didn't we?
- It was ours. We knew.

557
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,891
Because of the smell.

558
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:52,898
Young, sharp noses. Out you go.

559
00:45:55,736 --> 00:45:57,795
What's got into your father and Tim?

560
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:00,669
And Martha wasn't this late last Christmas
by half an hour.

561
00:46:00,808 --> 00:46:02,139
Here's Martha, Mother.

562
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:03,836
Here she is, Mother. Here's Martha.

563
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,072
There's a goose for Christmas, Martha.

564
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:09,147
Bless your heart.
I was afraid you weren't coming.

565
00:46:09,216 --> 00:46:12,117
We'd a deal of sewing to finish
up last night, and this morning...

566
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,653
we had to clear up the shop.

567
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,847
Just so long as you've come.

568
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:17,447
- You're cold, child.
- Not very.

569
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,287
Sit down by the fire and have a warm.

570
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,621
Father's here, Mama.

571
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,594
- Hide.
- Hide in here.

572
00:46:24,998 --> 00:46:26,966
Here we come.

573
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,530
Whoa it is. Hello.

574
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:33,137
There we are.

575
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:34,396
Belinda.

576
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:37,143
- Where's our Martha?
- Not coming.

577
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,237
Not coming?
Not coming on Christmas day?

578
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:42,778
Martha girl.

579
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:45,751
Come, Tim, into the back.
Smell the pudding.

580
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,114
- Was it a good service, Bob?
- Beautiful. That's what it was.

581
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,179
I wish you'd been there.

582
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:54,318
So long as you and Tim were there,
I feel it did us all good.

583
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,659
- Here, I'll give that gravy what for.
- Thank you, dear.

584
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,824
Belinda, you sweeten up the applesauce.

585
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,868
- I have, Mommy. It's on the table.
- Good girl.

586
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:04,130
- Peter, take this chair inside.
- Yes, Mother.

587
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:07,037
Now, I'm going to take one last look
at the table.

588
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:09,667
What a Christmas!
There never was such a Christmas.

589
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,337
Here, Martha, taste this.

590
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,476
Sweet enough?

591
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:18,017
- Well, it's still a wee bit sour.
- So.

592
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:21,153
- Been working hard, Father?
- Yes.

593
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,382
How's old Scrooge?

594
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:27,486
- Same as ever.
- What's the matter?

595
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,822
Not a thing. Not a single blessed thing.

596
00:47:30,898 --> 00:47:32,388
Something at the office?

597
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:34,934
No. Why, it was only yesterday
Mr. Scrooge came to me...

598
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:37,835
shook my hand and, "Cratchit,"
he says, "Cratchit, my lad"...

599
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:39,532
he calls me "my lad"...

600
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,166
"You're one in 1,000. You're..."

601
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:44,436
Something is wrong. What is it?

602
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,449
- I've been sacked, Martha.
- Father!

603
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,187
- When was it?
- Last night.

604
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:02,223
You haven't told Mother?

605
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:04,857
Bad luck.

606
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,234
Sorry I told you. I really shouldn't have.
I thought it might make me feel better.

607
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,293
Bob!

608
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:13,904
There's Mother. Come along. Cheer up.

609
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,339
Here we go.

610
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:17,468
Here we are!

611
00:48:18,378 --> 00:48:19,675
How's that?

612
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:23,045
You know, I don't think there is anyone,
not anyone, who can touch my punch.

613
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:24,276
Nor do I, Bob.

614
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:26,581
- Do you like our table?
- It's beautiful, my dear.

615
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,143
- Peter.
- Yes, Mother?

616
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:29,552
You can go to the baker's now.

617
00:48:29,623 --> 00:48:31,090
- And get the goose?
- Yes.

618
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,648
The goose!

619
00:48:47,774 --> 00:48:50,004
There never was such a goose.

620
00:48:50,644 --> 00:48:53,613
- It's a good bird, Bob.
- And reasonable, too.

621
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:58,344
- I'd like to stroke it.
- Tim.

622
00:49:03,957 --> 00:49:06,983
- We haven't eaten it all at last.
- That we haven't.

623
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,063
And now the pudding.

624
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,030
Belinda and me'll clear, Mother.

625
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:15,000
- I'll help with the pudding, Mother.
- No, I'd rather do it alone.

626
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:18,003
- It might not turn out.
- Of course it will. It always has.

627
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:21,370
Unless someone's climbed into the back
and stolen it.

628
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,143
Stolen it?

629
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,013
Hurry, Mother, hurry!

630
00:49:36,256 --> 00:49:37,780
Pass them over to this side.

631
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:40,224
It's there. The pudding's there.

632
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:41,817
- Hooray!
- Come along.

633
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,295
I smell it. Do you smell it, Peter?

634
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:46,031
That's the cloth coming off.

635
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:47,930
- The holly's in.
- It is?

636
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:49,533
It's blazing.

637
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:52,528
Here it comes! Here comes the pudding.

638
00:49:52,606 --> 00:49:55,166
- Off with the lights.
- Off with the lights. Hurry.

639
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:00,101
Hurry up.

640
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:07,515
It did turn out, and it's not stolen.

641
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:19,459
- It looks so good.
- Tim.

642
00:50:23,336 --> 00:50:25,429
It looks like the best you've ever made,
my dear.

643
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:27,496
Bob, you say that every year.

644
00:50:27,574 --> 00:50:29,064
Every year they get better.

645
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:31,667
How that's possible, don't ask me.
But it's true.

646
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:33,007
So eat.

647
00:50:35,348 --> 00:50:37,111
Mother, you haven't got any.

648
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:38,651
I don't want any, dear.

649
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,246
- You must. Here, have some of mine.
- Just a little spoonful.

650
00:50:46,393 --> 00:50:48,418
I'm sure I'm going to burst.

651
00:50:48,495 --> 00:50:49,826
Not in here, my lad.

652
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:51,830
If you want to burst, you go outside.

653
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:54,030
You've hardly any tummy at all.
Look at mine.

654
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:56,399
Now then, enough of that,
or there will be a calamity.

655
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,529
- Peter, put some chestnuts on the fire.
- Yes, sir.

656
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:00,004
Let's tidy the table, girls.

657
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:02,234
Such a smell.

658
00:51:02,676 --> 00:51:03,802
Sweet enough?

659
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:07,146
Sweet as honey.
Obviously made by an expert.

660
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,915
And are only experts allowed to taste it?

661
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:12,143
My dear. Glasses all. Glasses.

662
00:51:12,919 --> 00:51:15,251
Fill mine, Father. Thank you.

663
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,223
- Three, four.
- Thank you.

664
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:20,088
- Five.
- Thank you.

665
00:51:20,193 --> 00:51:21,785
- Six.
- Thank you.

666
00:51:21,928 --> 00:51:23,395
- Seven.
- Thank you.

667
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:28,061
Well, this is the largest,
but a merry Christmas to us, my dears.

668
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:30,432
And God bless us all.

669
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,564
And here's to next Christmas,
may it bring us luck.

670
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:36,299
And may Mr. Scrooge
give your father a raise.

671
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,138
And a merry Christmas to Mr. Scrooge.

672
00:51:39,212 --> 00:51:40,543
I'll drink to that.

673
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,215
- Delicious.
- How lovely.

674
00:51:48,288 --> 00:51:50,188
And now, Father, a story please.

675
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:52,350
Yes. Please, a story, Father.

676
00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:54,290
Right you are. A story it is.

677
00:51:54,427 --> 00:51:56,258
Come along, kids. Sit here.

678
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:58,354
Now let me see.

679
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:01,967
It seems that once upon a time,
there was a little boy...

680
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,627
about your size, Timmy...

681
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,666
- Come, Scrooge, we must go.
- Must we?

682
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:09,841
Just let me hear Bob's story.

683
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,538
It's about Aladdin and the magic lamp.

684
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:15,038
Please let me stay.

685
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,909
No, Scrooge.

686
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:31,861
And he said that Christmas was humbug.
As I live, he did.

687
00:52:31,932 --> 00:52:34,992
As if anything that gave excuse for this
could be humbug.

688
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:37,796
- Your uncle should be ashamed.
- I'm sorry for him.

689
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:41,534
I couldn't be angry with him if I tried.
After all, he punishes himself.

690
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:43,132
And how does he do that, pray?

691
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,837
- Well, he has money, hasn't he?
- Yes.

692
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,778
And he makes no use of it, mark you,
no use of it whatsoever.

693
00:52:47,848 --> 00:52:50,749
Therefore, he's a far more pathetic
and unhappy case...

694
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:52,580
than a man who has no money at all.

695
00:52:52,652 --> 00:52:54,643
QED, he punishes himself.

696
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:58,814
Now, that's a wonderful idea.

697
00:52:58,892 --> 00:53:01,725
Tom here suggests that we play a game.
Now what shall it be?

698
00:53:01,795 --> 00:53:04,320
- Blindman's buff.
- Blindman's buff? Right.

699
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:07,295
But first, I want you to drink a toast.
To my uncle Scrooge.

700
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:10,302
It seems a shame to waste a toast
on a man like that.

701
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:14,306
But, darling, think how happy
he makes everyone feel, by contrast.

702
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:19,144
- To my uncle, Scrooge.
- To Uncle Scrooge.

703
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:23,714
- Come along now, Tom. You're it.
- Come on, Tom.

704
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,080
You'd best catch us.

705
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:26,448
Tie it tight.

706
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:29,014
- Are you sure you can see?
- Perfectly.

707
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:30,488
That's good.

708
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,192
One, two, three.

709
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,907
Come on, quick.
Quick, he might catch you.

710
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:59,711
Please, let me stay, just until they finish.

711
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:02,846
But you don't like Christmas.
It's a time for fools.

712
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:07,650
I won't go with you. I'm going to stay.
I'm going to stay, I tell you.

713
00:54:07,727 --> 00:54:10,890
Don't be a fool, man.
You don't like Christmas.

714
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:13,859
But I do. I do like Christmas!

715
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:15,401
I love Christmas!

716
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,164
You are the Ghost
of Christmas Yet To Come?

717
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:23,732
You are about to show me things
that have not happened...

718
00:55:23,803 --> 00:55:27,000
but will happen in the future.
Is that so, Spirit?

719
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:32,071
Ghost of the Future,
I know you are here to do me good...

720
00:55:32,145 --> 00:55:34,670
and as I hope to be another man
from what I was...

721
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,683
I'm ready to accompany you.
Won't you speak?

722
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:39,910
Lead on.

723
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,414
I shall follow gladly.

724
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:01,772
No, I don't know much about it either way.
I only know he's dead.

725
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:03,809
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.

726
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:06,437
- What was the matter with him?
- Who knows? Who cares?

727
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:08,708
- What has he done with his money?
- I haven't heard.

728
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,410
He hasn't left it to me. That's all I know.

729
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:13,876
It's likely to be a very cheap funeral.

730
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,444
Upon my life,
I can't think of anybody to go to it.

731
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,648
Suppose we form a party and volunteer.

732
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:20,920
I don't mind going, if a lunch is provided.

733
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:22,894
I'll offer to go if anybody else will.

734
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,159
Now I come to think of it,
I'm not sure I wasn't his best friend.

735
00:56:26,232 --> 00:56:28,632
We used to stop and speak
whenever we met.

736
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:31,332
Goodbye.

737
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:39,309
- How are you?
- How are you?

738
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:41,404
I know them. I know them both.

739
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,880
Business associates.

740
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:46,045
So Old Scratch got his own at last?

741
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:48,849
Yeah, so I've been told. It's cold, isn't it?

742
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:50,514
Seasonable for Christmas.

743
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:54,252
- You're not a skater, I suppose.
- No time for it. Business on my mind.

744
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,485
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.

745
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,116
Is death always like this?

746
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,486
Is it never followed
by sorrow and weeping?

747
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:38,269
It must be getting near your father's time.

748
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:40,602
Past it, Mommy.

749
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:44,706
Though he has walked home slower
these last few evenings.

750
00:57:45,445 --> 00:57:49,211
I've known him walk with Tiny Tim
upon his shoulder very fast indeed.

751
00:57:49,682 --> 00:57:51,809
And so have I, often.

752
00:57:52,118 --> 00:57:56,020
But he was very light to carry,
and his father loved him so.

753
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,515
It was no trouble. No trouble.

754
00:58:01,494 --> 00:58:03,189
There's your father at the door.

755
00:58:09,102 --> 00:58:11,070
There you are, my nippers.

756
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:16,800
Dear.

757
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,046
Here, Father, sit here.

758
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:34,721
I saw Mr. Scrooge's nephew today.

759
00:58:34,794 --> 00:58:35,818
You did?

760
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:40,389
Yes, he is a nice fellow.
He saw I looked a trifle down.

761
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:42,093
Just a trifle, you know.

762
00:58:42,802 --> 00:58:44,770
He asked me what was wrong.

763
00:58:45,672 --> 00:58:47,003
Thank you, dear.

764
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:50,575
I told him about Tim.

765
00:58:51,544 --> 00:58:54,809
He's such a sweet fellow,
somehow I didn't mind telling him.

766
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:57,945
"I'm heartily sorry for it, Bob," he said.

767
00:58:58,384 --> 00:59:01,820
"And heartily sorry for your good wife."

768
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:09,856
By the by, how he ever knew that,
I don't know.

769
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,120
Knew what, my dear?

770
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,965
- That you were a good wife.
- Bob.

771
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,700
It really seemed that he knew our Tim
and felt with us.

772
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:28,676
- I'm sure he's a good soul, Bob.
- He is.

773
00:59:32,352 --> 00:59:33,785
And I'm sure that...

774
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,848
when we remember
how gentle and patient Tim was...

775
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:42,423
we shan't quarrel among ourselves...

776
00:59:43,196 --> 00:59:45,790
and in doing it, forget our Tim.

777
00:59:46,466 --> 00:59:47,660
No, Father.

778
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:51,368
I'm very happy.

779
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:53,834
I am.

780
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:59,138
Poor Tim. Poor Tiny Tim.

781
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:05,141
Everyone who knew him must feel sorrow.
Sorrow they'd never feel for me.

782
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:07,745
Spirit...

783
01:00:08,254 --> 01:00:11,018
tell me the name of the man
we saw lying dead.

784
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:12,815
Tell me!

785
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:39,712
Answer me this, Spirit.
Are these things you've shown me...

786
01:00:39,786 --> 01:00:44,280
are they the shadows of the things
that will be, or of the things that may be?

787
01:00:46,025 --> 01:00:48,493
Men's lives lead to certain ends...

788
01:00:49,162 --> 01:00:52,689
but if those lives be changed,
will not the ends be changed?

789
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:56,024
Tell me that is true! Tell me!

790
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:10,513
Then I was the man who lay upon the bed.

791
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:13,543
No!

792
01:01:13,986 --> 01:01:16,784
Why show me this if I am past all hope?

793
01:01:17,557 --> 01:01:22,051
I shall change my way of living.
I will try to keep Christmas all the year.

794
01:01:22,528 --> 01:01:24,587
I will live in the past, the present,
and the future.

795
01:01:24,664 --> 01:01:27,064
The spirit of all three shall be in my heart.

796
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,693
I shall never forget the lessons
that they teach.

797
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,870
Tell me that this will change my future.

798
01:01:34,073 --> 01:01:36,906
Tell me that this is not my end.

799
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,104
Please!

800
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:29,319
Hello!

801
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,929
Hello, there. What's today?

802
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:35,561
- What's today, my fine fellow?
- Today?

803
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:37,267
Why, Christmas day.

804
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:40,305
Do you know the poulterer's
at the next street but one, at the corner?

805
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:42,967
- I should hope I do.
- An intelligent boy.

806
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:44,566
A remarkable boy.

807
01:02:44,811 --> 01:02:48,008
Do you know whether they've sold
the prize turkey that was hanging there?

808
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,378
Not the little prize turkey, the big one.

809
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:52,417
- It's hanging there now.
- Is it?

810
01:02:52,552 --> 01:02:54,486
- Well, go and buy it.
- What, sir?

811
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:57,079
I'm in earnest. Yes, I am. Go and buy it.

812
01:02:57,156 --> 01:03:00,421
Come back in less than five minutes,
and I'll give you half a crown.

813
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,353
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

814
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:41,431
My dear sirs, how do you do?

815
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:44,634
How do you do?
A merry Christmas to you.

816
01:03:44,704 --> 01:03:45,762
Mr. Scrooge?

817
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:47,999
Yes, that is my name.
It may not be pleasant to you.

818
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,601
Let me ask your pardon.
And will you have the goodness to take...

819
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,948
Why, bless me, Mr. Scrooge.
Are you in earnest?

820
01:03:57,016 --> 01:04:00,213
If you please. Not a farthing less.
There are a great many back payments...

821
01:04:00,286 --> 01:04:01,913
in that amount. Will you do me that favor?

822
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:05,617
My dear Mr. Scrooge,
I don't know what to say. Such...

823
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,090
Such generosity.

824
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,119
Don't say anything, please, but come
and see me. Will you come and see me?

825
01:04:12,198 --> 01:04:13,790
We will, Mr. Scrooge.

826
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:15,959
Thank you. Bless you.

827
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:31,715
Hello, my love.

828
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:35,053
- Would you tell Mr. Fred I wish to see him?
- Yes, sir.

829
01:04:40,192 --> 01:04:41,250
Fred!

830
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:44,261
- Who is this?
- Your uncle.

831
01:04:44,697 --> 01:04:46,358
Your uncle Scrooge.

832
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:50,127
Uncle, I didn't know you.

833
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:52,430
The smile changes me, doesn't it?

834
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:57,170
But, what are we doing out here?
Come in, Uncle, come in.

835
01:04:58,945 --> 01:05:01,379
This is my uncle. My uncle Scrooge.

836
01:05:01,447 --> 01:05:02,505
How do you do?

837
01:05:02,582 --> 01:05:04,379
Fred, you dog. Who is this fellow?

838
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:07,908
Not your uncle, I'll be bound.
He'd never have a smile like that.

839
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,148
- He said that...
- That Christmas was a humbug.

840
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:13,555
- That people who celebrated it were fools.
- Yes, that's what he said.

841
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:16,493
It was stupid of him.
He won't say it again, mark you.

842
01:05:16,562 --> 01:05:18,530
He won't say it again, ever.

843
01:05:20,466 --> 01:05:22,024
And this is Bess.

844
01:05:22,868 --> 01:05:24,392
May I tell you a secret?

845
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:30,972
Here, I say. Now what is this?

846
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:33,879
- No.
- You tell him.

847
01:05:34,313 --> 01:05:35,780
Fred!

848
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,614
Darling!

849
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,456
That's wonderful.

850
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:54,730
Uncle, thank you so much.

851
01:06:11,584 --> 01:06:13,552
- Merry Christmas, Bob.
- What?

852
01:06:13,853 --> 01:06:15,252
Merry Christmas, Bob!

853
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:21,326
Here, give this to your wife.

854
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:23,192
Your good wife.

855
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:26,762
- Where's Tiny Tim?
- He's out in the back with the others.

856
01:06:26,832 --> 01:06:28,629
Well, get him. Bring him here.

857
01:06:28,868 --> 01:06:31,234
- Bring them all here.
- Yes, sir, I shall.

858
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,938
It's Scrooge. It's Mr. Scrooge.

859
01:06:37,176 --> 01:06:39,906
He's crazy. Quite mad.
Off his top. Lost his buttons.

860
01:06:39,979 --> 01:06:42,880
- Don't be stupid, Bob.
- Look, he gave us this, and more besides.

861
01:06:42,948 --> 01:06:44,074
- Gave it to us?
- Yes.

862
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,710
Then he has gone mad.
Bob, what shall we do?

863
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:50,614
Our children, Bob. Save them!

864
01:07:06,972 --> 01:07:09,964
Thank heaven, Mr. Fred. You've come
for him, of course. Poor fellow.

865
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:12,670
Did you think he'd gone barmy, too?
No, we haven't come for him.

866
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:16,236
He told us to wait outside. He said he had
some presents he wanted to give you.

867
01:07:16,315 --> 01:07:17,714
- Then he's all right?
- I hope so.

868
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:20,411
He made me his partner.
We're to be married, Bob.

869
01:07:20,486 --> 01:07:22,147
Isn't that wonderful?

870
01:07:22,221 --> 01:07:24,416
- It is wonderful.
- Yes.

871
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:26,047
My wife.

872
01:07:29,161 --> 01:07:30,150
My dear.

873
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,657
- Has he gone?
- He's all right.

874
01:07:35,735 --> 01:07:38,363
- Come along, you must meet him.
- No.

875
01:07:41,907 --> 01:07:44,842
- Bob Cratchit.
- Yes, sir?

876
01:07:45,444 --> 01:07:47,435
- Pass out the punch.
- Yes, sir.

877
01:07:54,253 --> 01:07:56,585
I'm going to raise your salary, Bob.

878
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,684
Thank you, sir.

879
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,955
Are you sure?

880
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,430
And when Peter, the scoundrel,
when Peter gets a little older...

881
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,466
we'll have a job for him, too.

882
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:09,433
- Won't we, Fred?
- Yes, sir.

883
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:12,963
- Everything for everybody, Fred?
- Yes.

884
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,633
Here it is, sir.

885
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,039
I'm a little rusty at this.

886
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:21,238
- I've never done it before, but may I?
- Yes.

887
01:08:21,313 --> 01:08:22,302
Please do.

888
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,548
To all of us, everywhere.

889
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:29,913
A merry Christmas to us all, my dears.

890
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:33,058
God bless us, every one.
