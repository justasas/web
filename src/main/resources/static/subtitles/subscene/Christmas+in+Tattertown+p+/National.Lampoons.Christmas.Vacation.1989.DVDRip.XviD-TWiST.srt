1
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,784
"It's that time
Christmas time is here

2
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:41,454
"Everybody knows
There's not a better time of year

3
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:44,454
"Hear that sleigh."

4
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,754
"Gonna make this holiday
As perfect as can be

5
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:13,999
"Just wait and see
This Christmas vacation.

6
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,102
"This old house
Sure is looking good

7
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:26,505
"Got ourselves the finest snowman
In the neighborhood.

8
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:29,450
"Ain't it fun?

9
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:34,446
"Always on the run
That's how it's done

10
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,023
"On Christmas vacation.

11
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:40,690
"Let's all deck the halls

12
00:01:40,963 --> 00:01:42,797
"And light the lights

13
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,197
"Get a toasty fire

14
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,469
"Burning bright.

15
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:51,905
"Give Saint Nick

16
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:55,045
"The warmest welcome
That he's ever had

17
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:59,216
"We're so glad it's Christmas vacation.

18
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,481
"And when the nights

19
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,422
"Are peaceful and serene

20
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,729
"We can cuddle up
And do our Christmas dreamin'.

21
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:17,468
"Peace and joy and love

22
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,371
"Are everywhere

23
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:24,008
"You can feel the magic in the air.

24
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,149
"Let the spirit of the season
Carry us away

25
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:35,584
"Hip, hip, hooray
For Christmas vacation."

26
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:27,572
That was beautiful, honey.

27
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:43,326
Take it, Russ.

28
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:49,032
Dad, can you explain again
what we're doing?

29
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:52,842
We're kicking off our fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas...

30
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:56,377
...by heading out to the country
in the front-wheel drive sleigh...

31
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,509
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

32
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:02,690
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

33
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:06,486
We're not driving way out here
so you can get one of those stupid ties...

34
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:08,792
...with the Santa Clauses on it,
are we, Dad?

35
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,999
No, I have one of those at home.

36
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:15,198
What we're looking for today
is the Griswold family Christmas tree.

37
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,076
- What's the matter?
- Some jackass is riding my tail.

38
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,293
Slow down and let him pass.

39
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,329
Don't provoke them.

40
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:50,903
Hey, kids. Look, a deer!

41
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,267
Clark! Slow down!

42
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:16,461
You want to ride behind
somebody like that?

43
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:20,438
I'm going to pull around them...
burn some dust, here.

44
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,342
Eat my rubber.

45
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:26,952
Dad, I think what you mean is,
"Burn rubber" and "Eat my dust."

46
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:28,279
Whatever, Russ.

47
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,955
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

48
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:42,533
That's enough of that.

49
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,839
Speaking of Christmas trees,
can one of you tell me...

50
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,936
...what the first kind of tree
displayed at the White House was?

51
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,006
They're back.

52
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,324
Stop it! I don't want to spend
the holidays dead.

53
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,719
Honey, please. I'll do the driving, okay?

54
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:07,854
Will you just take it easy?

55
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:09,995
I'm in complete control.

56
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:13,333
I'll get around this egg timer.

57
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,098
Uh... Dad?!

58
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,923
We're all right! Thank God!

59
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,286
Clark, we're stuck under a truck!

60
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,361
Do you honestly think I don't know that?!

61
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:38,262
Come on, you guys. Don't fight.

62
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,731
For Christ's sake,
I didn't do this on purpose.

63
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,231
Our Father, who art in heaven...

64
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,980
...hallowed be Thy name.
And forgive my husband.

65
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:53,045
- He knows not what he does.
- Amen!

66
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,897
We made pretty good time.

67
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,748
Dad, didn't they invent
Christmas tree lots...

68
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,981
...so people don't have to drive way out
to nowhere and waste a Saturday?

69
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:28,320
They invented 'em...

70
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,825
...because people forgot how to have
a fun, old-fashioned family Christmas.

71
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:36,022
They're satisfied with scrawny, dead,
overpriced trees with no special meaning.

72
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:37,027
My toes are numb.

73
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,123
This is what our forefathers did.

74
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,199
I can't feel my leg.

75
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,802
They walked out into the woods,
picked out that special tree...

76
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,303
...and they cut it down
with their bare hands.

77
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:47,276
Mom, I can't feel my hips.

78
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:48,869
- Clark?
- Yes, honey?

79
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:51,447
Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

80
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:53,644
That's all part of the experience, honey.

81
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:56,717
There it is.

82
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:18,070
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

83
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,086
Isn't it a little big?

84
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:29,087
It's not big, it's just full.

85
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,851
That thing wouldn't fit in our yard.

86
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:36,354
It's not going in our yard, Russ.
It's going in our living room.

87
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,999
- Look at it.
- It really is beautiful, Clark.

88
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:47,175
- It's something else, huh, Russ?
- Yeah, Dad.

89
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:48,606
Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?

90
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,236
She'll see it later, honey.

91
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:51,876
Her eyes are frozen.

92
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,784
The most enduring traditions
of the season are best enjoyed in...

93
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,550
...the warm embrace of kith and kin.

94
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:03,552
This tree is a symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

95
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,553
Did you bring a saw?

96
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:56,417
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his ceiling.

97
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:09,228
Hey, Griswold!

98
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:11,972
Where will you put a tree that big?

99
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:15,539
Bend over and I'll show you.

100
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:19,109
You got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

101
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:20,908
I wasn't talking to you.

102
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,504
Do you think there's
enough room for the angel?

103
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:44,970
Sure, honey. I have a little more trimming
to do, but that won't be a problem.

104
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,073
Ready?

105
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,647
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

106
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,823
There's a lot of sap in here.

107
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,631
It looks great. A little full.
A lot of sap.

108
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,351
Did I tell you I talked to my mother today?

109
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,526
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas, too.

110
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,157
It's not too late to change our plans...

111
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,827
No, no, that's great.

112
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,231
I think you're forgetting
how difficult it's gonna be...

113
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:44,741
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

114
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:47,571
They're family,
not strangers off the street.

115
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,473
All they do is argue.

116
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:52,684
Christmas is about resolving differences...

117
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:55,515
...and seeing through
the petty problems of family life.

118
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:59,584
And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

119
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:04,256
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip, and...

120
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,128
...then they don't speak to...
- Your mother waxes her upper lip?

121
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,864
She has for years.

122
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,703
It doesn't show.

123
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:14,733
I don't know, Sparky,
I just have this feeling it's not...

124
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,109
I want to have Christmas here,
in our house.

125
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:18,977
It means a lot to me.

126
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:22,509
All my life I've wanted to have
a big family Christmas.

127
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:29,616
It's just that you build things up
in your mind, Sparky.

128
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:34,926
You set standards no family event
can ever live up to.

129
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,725
When have I ever done that?

130
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,431
Parties.

131
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:44,634
Weddings.

132
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,410
- Good night, honey.
- Anniversaries.

133
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:49,139
Funerals.

134
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:51,640
Holidays.

135
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:53,282
Vacations.

136
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:54,954
Graduations.

137
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,113
Guess you'll be lookin' at
a nice fat Christmas bonus this year, huh?

138
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:23,019
Word is you're an excellent choice
to be named...

139
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:24,886
...Food Additive Designer of the Year.

140
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:27,151
- Nah...
- I'm not kidding.

141
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,960
What's that new thing you got
over there at Food 'N' Dry?

142
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,760
The crunch enhancer?
That's a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

143
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,424
It's semi-permeable. It's not osmotic.

144
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,231
What it does is,
it coats and seals the flake.

145
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:38,702
It prevents the milk from penetrating it.

146
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,034
Yeah, it's a beautiful product.

147
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,968
I like it.

148
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:44,542
What are you gonna do
with that big bonus check?

149
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:45,975
You're gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.

150
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,340
Me? Heck, no.

151
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,871
Take a look at this.

152
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,022
I just hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

153
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:59,754
Oh, my God. You're putting in a pool.

154
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:12,904
I went ahead and I put
a $7,500 deposit down on it.

155
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:15,167
You're the last true family man.

156
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:17,706
Mark.

157
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:19,818
Clark.

158
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:22,711
That's Bill, sir.

159
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:26,318
Are you the one who's working
on that non-nutritive cereal varnish?

160
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:27,256
Yes, sir.

161
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:30,659
I've got to give a speech to a trade group.
I'd like to mention it.

162
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:33,893
Write up a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

163
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:34,991
My pleasure.

164
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:39,399
Layman's terms. None of that inside,
bullshit jargon that nobody understands.

165
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,067
Yes, sir.

166
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:45,935
Oh, Mr. Shirley...

167
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:48,249
We got your Christmas card
the other day, and...

168
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:51,583
...my family and I are very flattered
that you remembered us.

169
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:53,315
Corporate cards.

170
00:14:57,895 --> 00:14:59,453
Don't forget that report, Bill.

171
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:01,052
Yes, sir. Merry Christmas.

172
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:06,861
Merry Christmas. Kiss my ass.
Kiss his ass. Kiss your ass.

173
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:08,465
Happy Hanukkah.

174
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,329
Can I show you something?

175
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,142
I was just smelling... smiling.

176
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,940
I was blouse... browsing.

177
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:52,211
For your wife or girlfriend?

178
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:55,987
What? What happened?

179
00:16:02,598 --> 00:16:04,532
I guess it wouldn't be any...

180
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:07,526
It wouldn't be
the Christmas shopping season...

181
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:11,203
...if the stores were any less hooter
than they... Hotter than they are.

182
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:13,405
It is warm in here.

183
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:15,674
- When you have your coat on.
- Do I?

184
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,044
- How did that happen?
- Because it's cold out.

185
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:20,211
Yes. Yes.

186
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:23,120
It is. It's a bit nipply out.
I mean, nippy out.

187
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,419
What am I saying? Nipple?

188
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,420
There is a nip in the air, though.

189
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,621
Can I take something out for you?

190
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:41,472
I was just, uh...

191
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,780
I was looking at something for my wife.

192
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:46,448
God rest her soul.

193
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,242
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

194
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:51,718
Oh, no, no, she's not dead, yet.
We're just divorced.

195
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:53,786
She's history.

196
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,655
Obviously, she doesn't wear underwear...

197
00:16:55,726 --> 00:17:00,094
...there are plenty of shopping days
left until adultery... adulthood.

198
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:03,666
Which is to say, Christmas,
as in Yule. Yule log.

199
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,992
Not a log. I don't have a log, but I mean,
you know...

200
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,373
...if I had a log. Not in the sense
you think I said I did.

201
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,305
Good golly.

202
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:16,079
'Tis the season to be merry.

203
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:17,544
Well, that's my name.

204
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:18,778
No shit.

205
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:37,033
These are cut really high on the hip.

206
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:40,668
Look, I'm wearing something similar.
See? You can't see the line.

207
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:43,871
- You can't see the line, can you, Russ?
- No.

208
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:55,385
Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...

209
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,787
...an angel gets his wings.

210
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,698
Folks!

211
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,498
Merry Christmas.

212
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,581
Look how big you've gotten.

213
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:48,679
Merry Christmas.

214
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,349
Mom.

215
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:52,343
Knock on the door.

216
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,218
Doesn't Nora look old?

217
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:58,851
You promised, you promised...

218
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,061
They took a pint of fluid
out of my lower back.

219
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:04,468
You see this mole? This mole on my neck?
You think it's changing color?

220
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,973
No. You keep touching it.
It's getting redder.

221
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,406
I got hemorrhoids.

222
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:09,473
Could you believe that?

223
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:11,341
- Oh, Mother.
- Isn't that terrible?

224
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:14,071
- You're not getting the space...
- After what you did to my car?

225
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:16,309
I'm doing the parking.
Come and help me with the...

226
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:19,513
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy...

227
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:22,988
Sweetheart, your grandma Nora's got
a real painful burr on her heel.

228
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:25,458
If you rub it for me,
I'll give you a quarter.

229
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,397
- A quarter.
- And I'll give Audrey a quarter, too.

230
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:31,095
I'm going to put my car in the garage!

231
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,069
I'll park the cars.

232
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:36,838
This is what Christmas is all about.

233
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:41,634
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage, and...

234
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,411
I'll be outside for the season.

235
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,611
We'll have the best-looking house in town.

236
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,519
I've always wanted to do this.

237
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,318
That's a lot of lights, Dad.

238
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,329
I'm sure it's a lot of work,
but if I'm out in the cold...

239
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,628
...and I'm committed
to decorating the house...

240
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,535
...I'm gonna do it right
and I'm gonna do it big.

241
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:06,134
You want something
you can be proud of, don't you?

242
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,606
Yeah, I guess so.

243
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,603
Sure you do.

244
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:12,445
You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?

245
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:15,879
Russ, when was the last time
I overdid anything?

246
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,011
Come on, unravel these.

247
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,160
You have to check every bulb.

248
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,891
A little knot here. You work on that.

249
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,824
I'll get the other box.

250
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,673
I hope he falls and breaks his neck.

251
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,381
I'm sure he'll fall. But I don't think we're
lucky enough to have him break his neck.

252
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:54,158
Let's go.

253
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:26,362
These gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with the giant nutcracker float.

254
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,556
At this point, I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.

255
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:35,235
But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.

256
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:37,799
Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.

257
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:58,664
Would it be indecent
to ask the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

258
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:02,700
Can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

259
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:05,533
Alexander called this morning
and Grandpa Clark told him...

260
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:08,837
...I couldn't come to the phone
'cause I was going to the bathroom.

261
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:11,071
We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

262
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:12,315
Everybody?

263
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:16,411
Do you sleep with your brother? Do you
know how sick and twisted that is?

264
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:20,652
I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

265
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:25,596
I have nightmares about what he does in
bed alone when I'm not lying next to him.

266
00:23:25,832 --> 00:23:29,165
I don't know what to say
except it's Christmas...

267
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,432
...and we're all in misery.

268
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:34,897
Ellen, are you smoking again?

269
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:37,241
No!

270
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,959
Dad, where do you want these reindeer?

271
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,455
Just put them on the lawn, Russ.

272
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:57,598
I can't find the Santa Claus.

273
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:01,769
It's in the basement. We'll get it later.

274
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:00,099
Clark? Dinner's ready.

275
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:03,332
Okay, honey. I'm starving.

276
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,831
Obviously something broke the window.
Something hit the stereo.

277
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:39,240
And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?

278
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,749
I don't know, Margo.

279
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,822
You wanna hurry this up, Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

280
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:57,194
Two hundred and fifty strands of lights,
100 individual bulbs per strand...

281
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,200
...for a grand total of 25,000
imported Italian twinkle lights.

282
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,769
Twenty-five thousand.

283
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:07,107
I hope nobody I know drives by...

284
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,908
...and sees me standing in the yard,
staring at my house in my pajamas.

285
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:14,112
If they know your dad,
they won't think anything of it.

286
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:15,677
Fire it up!

287
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:21,120
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

288
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,695
Drum roll, please.

289
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,363
Drum roll.

290
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:47,817
"Joy to the world."

291
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,609
Beautiful, Clark.

292
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:06,739
Talk about pissing your money away.

293
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:11,982
I hope you kids see what a silly waste
of resources this was.

294
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:14,242
He worked really hard, Grandma.

295
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,251
So do washing machines.

296
00:27:21,194 --> 00:27:23,094
Let's get in where it's warm.

297
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:28,432
Clark, baby, I can picture it
in my mind and it's breathtaking.

298
00:27:31,908 --> 00:27:33,068
Thanks, Mom.

299
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:38,805
It's probably a bad bulb. You know, if
one goes out, the whole thing won't work.

300
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,213
If I were you,
I'd personally check each one.

301
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,782
I did that, Dad.

302
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,888
If you need any help, give me a holler.
I'll be upstairs asleep.

303
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,297
I'm sorry, Daddy. It looks good,
even if they're not lit.

304
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:57,494
Thank you, sweetheart.

305
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:06,640
Well, Dad, it was a good try.

306
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:08,312
Thanks, Russ.

307
00:28:10,984 --> 00:28:13,350
We checked every bulb, didn't we?

308
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,249
I'm sure of it.

309
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:22,354
Maybe we ought to go up there and just...

310
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:24,162
Geez! Look at the time.

311
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,558
I have to go to bed.

312
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:28,970
Brush my teeth, feed the hog.

313
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:33,303
I still got some homework to do,
do the laundry, wash the car...

314
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:41,343
Don't stay up too late.

315
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:05,243
Get off me, you little fungus.

316
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,943
Where the hell is that cold coming from?

317
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:34,968
- I need just a few more...
- Pay by check, if you can.

318
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:38,474
- Not a card?
- No, it's a hassle if you have to return.

319
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:46,324
Help!

320
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:48,658
Daddy. Is Clark coming?

321
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,990
How the hell would I know?

322
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:51,032
Is he in the house?

323
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:54,000
If he's not farting around
with the lights, he must be.

324
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:56,936
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

325
00:31:57,006 --> 00:32:01,906
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pill.

326
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,914
I want to take off these clothes,
sit with a glass of wine...

327
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:08,920
...and kiss every inch of your body.

328
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:11,821
- After you shower, of course.
- Of course.

329
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:30,611
- Sparky?
- Yes, honey.

330
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:43,113
Are you out here for a reason,
or are you just avoiding the family?

331
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,296
I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

332
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:49,135
Meantime, I can light the Santa...

333
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:52,467
...and the eight tiny reindeer
and the "Merry Christmas" sign.

334
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:55,030
That should look good. Ready?

335
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:56,969
Want me to do the drum roll thing?

336
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:59,136
No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

337
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:08,513
I don't understand it.

338
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:13,454
The house lights don't work,
the floodlights don't work.

339
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:17,222
Is it plugged in?

340
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:20,400
Do you think I would check
thousands of tiny lights...

341
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,530
...if I wasn't sure
the extension cord was plugged in?

342
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,899
You used more than one cord, didn't you?

343
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:34,114
Maybe the kids have been fooling around
with it. I'll check in the back.

344
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,008
Clark!

345
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,339
- Todd!
- Sorry!

346
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:06,382
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

347
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:23,131
I can't see!

348
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:43,227
This ought to do it.

349
00:38:56,977 --> 00:38:57,966
I fixed it!

350
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:04,347
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

351
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:15,366
- Get a towel.
- Okay!

352
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:20,865
Wait a minute! I don't believe this.

353
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:23,236
What's all that yelling about?

354
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:26,635
What's going on here?!

355
00:39:28,712 --> 00:39:30,542
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

356
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:33,876
What's he doing?

357
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,747
I haven't the foggiest.

358
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,551
What the hell?!

359
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,354
What is wrong with this?!

360
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:45,622
Damn it!

361
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,704
You goddamn thing!

362
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:26,166
Dad, it's beautiful!

363
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,029
Oh, my carpet!

364
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,641
Clark, it's so lovely.

365
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:01,816
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

366
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,479
It's a beaut, Clark. A beaut.

367
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,653
You taught me everything I know
about exterior illumination.

368
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,493
Thank you, thank you.

369
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:17,132
Russ. Audrey.

370
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:23,837
Dear... Francis.

371
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:29,515
I hope this adds
to your enjoyment of the holidays.

372
00:41:29,851 --> 00:41:31,841
It's just wonderful.

373
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:35,348
Arthur.

374
00:41:36,357 --> 00:41:37,346
Art.

375
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:40,187
Dad.

376
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:42,253
Thanks for being here.

377
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,964
The little lights are not twinkling.

378
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:47,693
I know, Art, and thanks for noticing.

379
00:41:52,206 --> 00:41:54,701
The house sure does look swell, Clark.

380
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,109
Thanks, Eddie.

381
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,713
I hope it enhances your holiday spirit.
Dear Catherine.

382
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:02,679
Eddie?

383
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:06,446
The house is gorgeous, Clark.

384
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:08,718
Eddie?

385
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:12,219
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account, Clark.

386
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:16,158
Kids, come on out here and see
what Uncle Clark's done to the house.

387
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,292
Eddie?

388
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:25,713
Eddie?

389
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,575
If you don't remember, this here is Rocky.

390
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,256
- Have you got a kiss for me?
- Take a rain check on that, Art.

391
00:42:36,324 --> 00:42:39,157
He's got a lip fungus
that ain't identified yet.

392
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:43,852
You remember Ruby Sue?

393
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,098
Oh, my gosh!

394
00:42:49,937 --> 00:42:51,737
Her eyes are not crossed anymore.

395
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:53,277
That somethin', ain't it?

396
00:42:53,345 --> 00:42:55,437
She falls in a well, her eyes go cross.

397
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:58,949
A mule kicks her, they go back to normal.
I don't know.

398
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,782
And this here is our pride and joy.

399
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:06,288
Snots.

400
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:08,352
Pretty name.

401
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:11,518
We named him that
'cause he's got this sinus condition.

402
00:43:12,296 --> 00:43:15,629
Snots, you roll over
and let Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

403
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,139
You never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got, Clark.

404
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,603
That's okay, Eddie.

405
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:26,640
That's somethin', ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

406
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:28,909
...and he'll love you till the day you die.

407
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:31,577
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

408
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:36,817
We were going to call,
but Eddie wanted to make it a surprise.

409
00:43:37,058 --> 00:43:38,390
You surprised?

410
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,684
Surprised, Eddie?

411
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,291
If I woke up tomorrow
with my head sewn to the carpet...

412
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,895
...I wouldn't be more surprised
than I am right now.

413
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:49,163
We have plenty of room.

414
00:43:51,343 --> 00:43:54,904
Plenty of towels. Plenty of everything.

415
00:43:56,514 --> 00:44:00,507
We're pretty well set up here in the RV.
It's a little tight but...

416
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:02,609
...we didn't come to impose.

417
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,519
There's plenty of room.

418
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:07,016
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

419
00:44:07,826 --> 00:44:13,092
Catherine and I are pretty comfy in there,
but maybe you folks wouldn't mind...

420
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:14,863
...the youngsters shacking up with you.

421
00:44:14,936 --> 00:44:16,767
After that long drive...

422
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:19,535
...we could use
a little private time together.

423
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:25,642
Honey, why don't you get the kids' things.
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

424
00:44:25,714 --> 00:44:27,545
I'll show you the home.

425
00:45:05,658 --> 00:45:07,649
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.

426
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:09,752
Is it real?

427
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:12,529
I dug it out of the ground myself.

428
00:45:12,601 --> 00:45:13,932
Is that a fact?

429
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:16,131
Get out of there, Snots!

430
00:45:16,204 --> 00:45:17,193
Don't worry about it.

431
00:45:17,272 --> 00:45:19,797
A little tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

432
00:45:19,942 --> 00:45:22,877
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

433
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:25,778
He lifted his leg the next mornin'...

434
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,017
If he drinks the water out of there,
the tree's gonna dry up.

435
00:45:31,086 --> 00:45:32,781
Come on out of there.

436
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:38,620
Get out of there. Go in the kitchen
and get something to eat.

437
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:41,060
He's cute, ain't he?

438
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:45,035
Only problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

439
00:45:45,304 --> 00:45:49,535
If the mood catches him right,
he'll grab your leg and just go to town.

440
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:54,643
You don't want him around
if you're wearing short pants.

441
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:57,304
A word of warning, though.

442
00:45:57,383 --> 00:46:00,613
If he does lay into you,
it's best to just let him finish.

443
00:46:03,321 --> 00:46:06,921
I can't believe you're actually
standing here in my living room, Eddie.

444
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,664
Never thought the day would come.

445
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,563
I'm excited about it, too.

446
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:14,500
It's a cryin' shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

447
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,674
I'll get that.
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

448
00:46:24,979 --> 00:46:29,178
I got the daughter in the clinic
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

449
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,918
The older boy, bless his soul,
is preparing for his career.

450
00:46:34,522 --> 00:46:36,084
- College?
- Carnival.

451
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:38,458
You gotta be proud.

452
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:44,232
Last season, he was a pixie dust spreader
on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

453
00:46:44,537 --> 00:46:47,698
He thinks that maybe next year,
he'll be guessing people's weight...

454
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,833
...or barking for the Yak Woman.

455
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:53,309
- You ever see her?
- No.

456
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,711
She got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

457
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,439
She's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.

458
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:00,713
And a hell of a good cook.

459
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:03,486
Can I refill your eggnog for you?
Get you something to eat?

460
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:06,050
Drive you out to the middle of nowhere
and leave you for dead?

461
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:08,289
No, I'm doing just fine.

462
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,229
Just glad to be here.

463
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:14,564
When did you get
the tenement on wheels?

464
00:47:15,403 --> 00:47:18,237
Oh, that? That's an RV.

465
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,402
I borrowed it off a buddy of mine.

466
00:47:21,477 --> 00:47:24,309
He took my house, I took the RV.

467
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:27,238
It's a good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

468
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,851
It looks so nice parked in the driveway.

469
00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:33,256
It sure does.
Don't you go falling in love with it.

470
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:37,086
We're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

471
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,772
Get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures!

472
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:52,503
Retooling. That's a great excuse.

473
00:47:54,613 --> 00:47:56,946
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

474
00:47:59,956 --> 00:48:01,947
Mr. Shirley, Merry Christmas.

475
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:03,620
Who's that?

476
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,221
It's me, Clark Griswold.

477
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:07,861
What do you want?

478
00:48:08,964 --> 00:48:13,300
My wife and I just came up with
a little something special. It's a gift.

479
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,965
Put it over there
with the others, Greaseball.

480
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:32,114
By the way, I hope my report helped out
at the trade show.

481
00:48:36,995 --> 00:48:38,987
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

482
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:43,066
If you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of an important call.

483
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,369
Get me somebody.

484
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,733
Anybody.

485
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,101
And get me somebody while I'm waiting.

486
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:07,256
This is a new non-caloric,
silicon-based kitchen lubricant...

487
00:49:07,363 --> 00:49:08,694
...my company's been working on.

488
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:12,462
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than cooking oil.

489
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,969
We'll fly down the hill with this stuff.

490
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:17,430
Has anyone ever used it on a sled?

491
00:49:17,507 --> 00:49:18,973
Not that I know of.

492
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:24,538
Don't go puttin' none of that stuff
on my sled, Clark.

493
00:49:24,883 --> 00:49:28,216
- You know the metal plate in my head?
- How could I forget it.

494
00:49:28,387 --> 00:49:32,223
I had it replaced. Every time
Catherine raved up the microwave...

495
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,193
...I'd piss in my pants
and forget who I was.

496
00:49:35,563 --> 00:49:38,462
Over at the V.A., they had it replaced
with a plastic one.

497
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,722
That ain't as strong, so...

498
00:49:41,234 --> 00:49:43,395
I shouldn't go sailing down a hill...

499
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,735
...with nothing between
the ground and my brain...

500
00:49:45,806 --> 00:49:48,036
...but a piece of government plastic.

501
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:51,343
You really think it matters, Eddie?

502
00:49:51,414 --> 00:49:54,247
The plate runs right underneath my part.

503
00:49:56,252 --> 00:49:58,584
Over here is nothing, but...

504
00:49:58,922 --> 00:50:03,756
...if this gets dented,
then my hair just ain't going to look right.

505
00:50:06,428 --> 00:50:07,896
I know the feeling.

506
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:11,734
I better try this first. See how it works.

507
00:50:11,802 --> 00:50:13,631
Be careful there, Clark.

508
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:15,637
Nothing to worry about, Eddie.

509
00:50:15,772 --> 00:50:20,179
Going for a new, amateur-recreational-
saucer-sled land-speed record...

510
00:50:20,613 --> 00:50:23,106
Clark W. Griswold, Junior!

511
00:50:23,784 --> 00:50:27,116
Remember, don't try this at home, kids.
I am a professional.

512
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,623
Later, dudes.

513
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,951
Let her rip. Hang ten.

514
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,117
It's great! I'm dead!

515
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:41,527
Bingo.

516
00:51:54,551 --> 00:51:56,485
- You're staying late?
- Hi, Bill.

517
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:57,884
Yeah. Just...

518
00:51:58,555 --> 00:52:02,047
...finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

519
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:05,559
Have a really Merry Christmas.

520
00:52:06,897 --> 00:52:07,954
You, too.

521
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:11,597
You okay?

522
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:13,662
Yeah.

523
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:17,901
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

524
00:52:18,246 --> 00:52:20,146
Just talked to my son.

525
00:52:20,515 --> 00:52:23,348
Company messenger just brought
something to my house.

526
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,219
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute, huh?

527
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,683
You get yours?

528
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:33,453
If it isn't at the house,
I'm sure it must be on its way.

529
00:52:33,527 --> 00:52:37,363
If I don't get that bonus,
I'm in it up to here.

530
00:52:37,766 --> 00:52:39,531
Don't sweat it. It'll come.

531
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:40,864
Merry Christmas.

532
00:52:40,937 --> 00:52:42,166
Same to you.

533
00:53:02,293 --> 00:53:06,127
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is the thing to say

534
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:08,792
"On a bright Hawaiian

535
00:53:09,036 --> 00:53:10,699
"Christmas day.

536
00:53:11,806 --> 00:53:13,967
"That's the island greeting

537
00:53:14,142 --> 00:53:17,201
"That we send to you
From the land

538
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:20,310
"Where palm trees sway.

539
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:23,273
"Here we know that Christmas

540
00:53:23,517 --> 00:53:25,248
"Will be green and bright

541
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:27,983
"The sun to shine by day

542
00:53:28,155 --> 00:53:30,146
"And all the stars at night.

543
00:53:30,558 --> 00:53:34,720
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is Hawaii's way

544
00:53:35,062 --> 00:53:38,230
"To say 'Merry Christmas' to you."

545
00:54:53,483 --> 00:54:54,815
Santy Claus?

546
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:58,251
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

547
00:54:58,522 --> 00:54:59,387
What?

548
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,754
What? You scared me.

549
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,768
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

550
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:13,502
I wish I was.

551
00:55:15,776 --> 00:55:17,903
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

552
00:55:19,614 --> 00:55:21,275
Rocky bit my thumb.

553
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:24,782
Him's nervous
because Christmas is almost here.

554
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:27,421
Nervous or excited?

555
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,289
Shittin' bricks.

556
00:55:30,629 --> 00:55:32,119
You shouldn't use that word.

557
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,688
Sorry. Shittin' rocks.

558
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:40,927
Him's nervous because he don't know
if he's gettin' nothin'.

559
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:47,139
I don't think he should be nervous,
and you shouldn't be, either.

560
00:55:47,212 --> 00:55:50,045
'Cause if you're good, Santa knows it.

561
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:53,247
If you believe in him and in your mom...

562
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:55,011
...and you believe in...

563
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:56,655
...your dad...

564
00:55:57,826 --> 00:56:02,389
...and you've been good all year round,
Santa Claus will bring you something.

565
00:56:02,998 --> 00:56:06,160
Sometimes I think
all that Santa crap is just bull.

566
00:56:06,668 --> 00:56:10,001
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

567
00:56:10,238 --> 00:56:13,675
We didn't do nothin' wrong
and we still got the shaft.

568
00:56:13,842 --> 00:56:17,834
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

569
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:20,672
And in the next couple of days...

570
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:23,514
...somehow, I'm gonna prove it to you.

571
00:56:24,857 --> 00:56:27,917
Every year, he comes to our house.
I've seen him.

572
00:56:29,195 --> 00:56:30,252
It's true?

573
00:56:30,529 --> 00:56:31,860
Cross my heart.

574
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,795
It's a good idea you came to stay with us.

575
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:42,032
I love it here. You don't gotta put on
your coat to go to the bathroom.

576
00:56:42,205 --> 00:56:45,040
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

577
00:56:48,547 --> 00:56:50,879
I think you better go back to bed, now.

578
00:56:54,723 --> 00:56:56,850
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

579
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,722
I was looking for something.

580
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:08,460
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

581
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:10,967
Nope. How come?

582
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:12,899
Just wondering.

583
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,745
Now you get back to bed. Come here.

584
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:30,357
Are you sure you ain't Santy Claus?

585
00:57:31,597 --> 00:57:32,620
I'm sure.

586
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,938
I can't even afford to be an elf.

587
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,283
I had two containers of K-rations...
two containers...

588
00:57:55,624 --> 00:57:59,060
...and I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears!

589
00:58:10,305 --> 00:58:12,170
Aren't you having any breakfast?

590
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,901
No. Not in the mood.

591
00:58:15,478 --> 00:58:17,177
What are you looking at?

592
00:58:19,653 --> 00:58:22,815
The silent majesty of a winter's morn.
The clean...

593
00:58:22,989 --> 00:58:25,081
...cool chill of the holiday air.

594
00:58:25,258 --> 00:58:28,920
An asshole, in a bathrobe,
emptying a chemical toilet into my sewer.

595
00:58:34,234 --> 00:58:35,757
The shitter was full.

596
00:58:36,669 --> 00:58:38,603
Have you checked our shitters, honey?

597
00:58:38,671 --> 00:58:41,162
Clark, please.
He doesn't know any better.

598
00:58:41,507 --> 00:58:43,700
He ought to know it's illegal.
It's a storm sewer.

599
00:58:43,775 --> 00:58:48,183
If it fills with gas, I pity the person
who lights a match within ten yards of it.

600
00:59:10,705 --> 00:59:12,371
Merry Christmas.

601
00:59:12,813 --> 00:59:14,336
The shitter was full.

602
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:33,597
I have this suspicion that Catherine and
Eddie don't have presents for their kids.

603
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:38,330
Rocky said Eddie told him
Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

604
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:45,346
Ruby Sue said the same thing last night.
How can they have nothing for their kids?

605
00:59:45,413 --> 00:59:47,507
He's been out of work
for almost seven years.

606
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,849
In seven years he couldn't find a job?

607
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,754
Catherine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

608
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,523
So, how's the live bait business?

609
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:02,428
I can't complain. How you doing?

610
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,760
Not that good, actually.

611
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:08,701
Your company kill off all them people
in India not long ago?

612
01:00:08,943 --> 01:00:11,207
No, we missed out on that one.

613
01:00:11,711 --> 01:00:14,203
You're pretty set so far as shopping goes?

614
01:00:14,614 --> 01:00:16,946
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark.

615
01:00:17,283 --> 01:00:19,878
The truth is, things ain't goin'
too good at all.

616
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:23,389
You know I told you I borrowed
the RV from a neighbor?

617
01:00:24,022 --> 01:00:25,012
It's mine.

618
01:00:25,591 --> 01:00:26,785
We live in it.

619
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,621
I had to sell off the house,
the barn, the ten acres...

620
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:36,125
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

621
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:42,138
If I only had back the money
me and Catherine sent that TV preacher...

622
01:00:42,212 --> 01:00:44,611
...that was screwin' the hockey players.

623
01:00:45,815 --> 01:00:47,145
What about the kids?

624
01:00:47,616 --> 01:00:49,641
His kids can fend for themselves.

625
01:00:49,919 --> 01:00:51,251
Your kids.

626
01:00:52,556 --> 01:00:55,286
That's the bitch of it.
I don't know what to do.

627
01:00:55,325 --> 01:00:59,819
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Guerney.

628
01:01:04,066 --> 01:01:07,268
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

629
01:01:07,341 --> 01:01:09,501
No, Clark, I couldn't do that.

630
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:11,101
We insist.

631
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:13,778
No, I'm not one for charity.

632
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:17,449
I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

633
01:01:19,686 --> 01:01:21,620
I don't know about that.

634
01:01:21,856 --> 01:01:25,848
Now, come on, if you don't tell me
what they want, I'll get it on my own.

635
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,866
This is a surprise, Clark.

636
01:01:33,536 --> 01:01:35,698
This is a real nice surprise.

637
01:01:36,638 --> 01:01:39,200
Just a real nice surprise.

638
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:45,471
Here's a list.

639
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:48,039
Alphabetical, starting with Catherine.

640
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:52,385
If it wouldn't be too much,
I'd like to get something for you, Clark.

641
01:01:52,524 --> 01:01:55,014
Something really nice.

642
01:02:12,713 --> 01:02:14,509
Is your house on fire, Clark?

643
01:02:14,748 --> 01:02:16,773
No Bethany, those are Christmas lights.

644
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,648
Don't throw me down, Clark.

645
01:02:18,752 --> 01:02:20,083
I'll try not to.

646
01:02:20,754 --> 01:02:22,584
Is this the airport?

647
01:02:22,855 --> 01:02:24,084
We're here!

648
01:02:24,191 --> 01:02:27,751
Me and Bethany figured out
the perfect gift for you.

649
01:02:27,861 --> 01:02:30,698
Uncle Louis, you didn't have to
buy me anything.

650
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:33,099
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

651
01:02:33,769 --> 01:02:35,362
That was fun.

652
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:38,105
I love riding in cars.

653
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:41,442
When did you move to Florida?

654
01:02:44,548 --> 01:02:46,912
Are you still dating Clark?

655
01:02:50,553 --> 01:02:52,714
You know you shouldn't have done that.

656
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:55,281
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

657
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,990
Jesus, did the room clear out, Bethany?
Hell, no.

658
01:03:00,134 --> 01:03:03,229
She means presents.
You shouldn't have bought presents.

659
01:03:03,303 --> 01:03:07,239
It isn't every day somebody moves
into a new house.

660
01:03:07,406 --> 01:03:09,568
They didn't move into a new house.

661
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,107
In the living room.

662
01:03:15,149 --> 01:03:17,482
This house is bigger than your old one.

663
01:03:19,219 --> 01:03:21,380
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

664
01:03:22,656 --> 01:03:26,994
Why don't you go into the living room
and say hello to everybody?

665
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:30,425
Hello, everybody! I should say it?

666
01:03:34,704 --> 01:03:36,103
- Mom?
- What?

667
01:03:36,507 --> 01:03:38,337
This box is meowing.

668
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:46,775
She wrapped up her damn cat.

669
01:03:47,017 --> 01:03:49,952
- Take it in the kitchen. Open it up.
- And have a cat running around?

670
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,453
We can't leave it in the box.

671
01:03:51,521 --> 01:03:54,017
Why would somebody wrap up
a cat in a box?

672
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:56,330
She gets confused. She's old.

673
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:59,524
They don't have much money,
so she takes things from the house...

674
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:01,761
...wraps them up,
gives them away as presents.

675
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:03,393
Can't wait to see what I got!

676
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:05,131
This one here...

677
01:04:05,372 --> 01:04:06,634
...is leaking.

678
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,509
Lime.

679
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:15,449
It's her Jell-O mold.

680
01:04:15,516 --> 01:04:19,713
I'll take it, Eddie. Go into
the living room and enjoy yourself.

681
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,723
Let's go find your sister.

682
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,110
Before we begin...

683
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,415
...since this is Aunt Bethany's
80th Christmas...

684
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:53,894
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

685
01:04:58,033 --> 01:04:59,159
What, dear?

686
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:02,065
Grace!

687
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:07,006
Grace? She passed away 30 years ago.

688
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:10,272
They want you to say grace.

689
01:05:13,112 --> 01:05:15,276
The blessing.

690
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,569
"I pledge allegiance...

691
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:37,467
"...to the flag of
the United States of America...

692
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:39,569
"...and to the republic...

693
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:44,076
"...for which it stands,
one nation under God, indivisible...

694
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:47,986
"...with liberty and justice for all."

695
01:05:50,157 --> 01:05:50,886
Amen.

696
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:01,101
Catherine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

697
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:03,930
...I think we're all
in for a very big treat.

698
01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:09,940
Save the neck for me, Clark.

699
01:06:26,463 --> 01:06:27,624
I'm sorry.

700
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:29,724
Why are you crying?

701
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,292
I told you we put it in too early.

702
01:06:32,938 --> 01:06:35,202
It's just a little dry. It's fine.

703
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:39,000
Here's the heart.

704
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:41,312
Aunt Bethany...

705
01:07:42,951 --> 01:07:45,078
Does your cat happen to eat Jell-O?

706
01:07:47,389 --> 01:07:49,290
I don't know about the cat...

707
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:51,056
...but I'm enjoying it.

708
01:08:04,405 --> 01:08:05,240
Kids...

709
01:08:06,145 --> 01:08:07,237
...I heard on the news...

710
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:11,943
...that an airline pilot spotted Santa's sled
on its way in from New York.

711
01:08:17,822 --> 01:08:19,050
You serious, Clark?

712
01:08:22,094 --> 01:08:25,586
Load me up with a little more there.
It's good.

713
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,173
What's wrong with the dog?

714
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:46,617
He's just yackin' on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

715
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,983
Maybe if you wouldn't feed him
from the table...

716
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,189
No.

717
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:58,022
He's probably just nosing
through the trash.

718
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,547
If you're not doing anything constructive...

719
01:09:10,617 --> 01:09:13,245
...run into the living room, get my stogie.

720
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,654
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Uncle Louis?

721
01:09:18,089 --> 01:09:20,455
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

722
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,392
He keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

723
01:09:58,138 --> 01:09:59,434
That should be it.

724
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:18,414
I told you, you had
too many plugs in one outlet.

725
01:10:20,993 --> 01:10:21,925
What is it?

726
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:27,136
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

727
01:10:29,905 --> 01:10:32,964
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

728
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,973
If you don't mind,
I'd like to try to fumigate this here chair.

729
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:44,482
It's a good quality item.

730
01:10:46,589 --> 01:10:50,650
If you don't mind me askin',
how much it set you back?

731
01:10:51,693 --> 01:10:53,285
Do you smell something?

732
01:10:55,568 --> 01:10:57,001
Fried pussycat.

733
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:03,367
It's not the chair, it's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

734
01:11:53,365 --> 01:11:54,662
My tree!

735
01:11:56,868 --> 01:11:58,896
So, what's the matter with you?

736
01:11:59,906 --> 01:12:01,999
Look what you've done to my tree!

737
01:12:17,389 --> 01:12:19,361
It was an ugly tree anyway.

738
01:12:20,196 --> 01:12:22,254
At least it's out of its misery.

739
01:12:22,931 --> 01:12:24,957
- Dad's gonna flip out.
- Nobody's gonna flip out.

740
01:12:25,034 --> 01:12:27,501
We're gonna have a wonderful Christmas.

741
01:12:31,074 --> 01:12:32,473
What the hell do you want?

742
01:12:32,543 --> 01:12:35,340
I have a delivery for Clark W. Griswold.

743
01:12:35,513 --> 01:12:37,742
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

744
01:12:37,881 --> 01:12:42,214
...but it fell between the seats
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

745
01:12:49,397 --> 01:12:50,727
Merry Christmas.

746
01:12:51,965 --> 01:12:53,294
Merry Christmas.

747
01:12:57,236 --> 01:12:59,000
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

748
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:02,506
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nuthouse?

749
01:13:03,143 --> 01:13:04,337
It's from my company.

750
01:13:05,145 --> 01:13:05,940
Your bonus.

751
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:07,577
My bonus.

752
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:15,155
Open it, Clarkie. Open it.

753
01:13:15,827 --> 01:13:17,987
I hope it's a fortune.

754
01:13:18,661 --> 01:13:19,924
I bet you do.

755
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:25,825
I was afraid...

756
01:13:26,103 --> 01:13:29,934
Are you going to bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

757
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:36,043
I was gonna wait till tomorrow
to tell you all this, but what the heck?

758
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:40,281
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

759
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:46,855
That's it. That's the big one!

760
01:13:49,296 --> 01:13:50,354
Open it!

761
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,535
I'm sorry if I've been
a little short with everyone lately.

762
01:13:57,104 --> 01:13:58,900
I've been waiting for this bonus.

763
01:13:59,172 --> 01:14:01,299
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

764
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:03,366
...I had to lay out the money in advance.

765
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:07,608
Until this arrived, I didn't have enough
to cover the check.

766
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:10,146
Tear the sucker open, Dad.

767
01:14:11,889 --> 01:14:12,719
Drum roll.

768
01:14:21,632 --> 01:14:25,727
If there's enough left,
I'll fly you all down to help us dedicate it.

769
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,397
I can't swim, Clark.

770
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:34,073
I know that, Eddie.

771
01:14:49,063 --> 01:14:50,258
What's wrong?

772
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:55,932
It's bigger than you expected?

773
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:00,606
Smaller?

774
01:15:03,444 --> 01:15:04,603
What is it?

775
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:10,216
A one-year membership
in the Jelly-of-the-Month Club.

776
01:15:11,388 --> 01:15:15,381
That's the gift that keeps on giving
the whole year.

777
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:18,596
That it is, Edward.

778
01:15:19,563 --> 01:15:20,723
That it is, indeed.

779
01:15:21,632 --> 01:15:22,792
I'm sorry.

780
01:15:24,969 --> 01:15:29,805
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got! Goddamn it!

781
01:15:30,841 --> 01:15:31,636
Son.

782
01:15:45,092 --> 01:15:46,753
It's good.

783
01:15:55,702 --> 01:15:59,297
If any of you are looking
for any last-minute gift ideas for me...

784
01:15:59,373 --> 01:16:00,670
...I have one.

785
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,175
I'd like Frank Shirley,
my boss, right here, tonight.

786
01:16:05,183 --> 01:16:09,516
Brought from his happy holiday slumber
on Melody Lane with all the rich people.

787
01:16:09,686 --> 01:16:11,678
I want him brought right here...

788
01:16:12,023 --> 01:16:16,357
...with a big ribbon on his head and
I want to look him straight in the eye...

789
01:16:16,627 --> 01:16:20,118
...and I want to tell him
what a cheap, lying, no good, rotten...

790
01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:23,394
...low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating,
inbred, overstuffed...

791
01:16:23,533 --> 01:16:28,062
...ignorant, bloodsucking,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

792
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,205
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

793
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:35,371
...worm-headed sack of monkey shit he is!

794
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:37,048
Hallelujah!

795
01:16:37,485 --> 01:16:39,886
Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?

796
01:16:53,501 --> 01:16:55,435
He has that crazy look in his eye.

797
01:16:55,503 --> 01:16:57,834
I told you we should have gone to Hawaii.

798
01:16:58,172 --> 01:17:00,736
Turn that thing off and get in the house!

799
01:17:01,512 --> 01:17:03,172
I'll talk to him, Mom.

800
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:08,116
You know, Dad...

801
01:17:08,252 --> 01:17:09,844
...I've been thinking.

802
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:12,855
Good talk.

803
01:17:18,697 --> 01:17:21,665
Aren't you a teeny bit sorry
we didn't get a Christmas tree?

804
01:17:21,766 --> 01:17:24,928
Even though they're dirty and messy
and corny and clichd?

805
01:17:25,436 --> 01:17:28,603
Where are you going to find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

806
01:17:47,928 --> 01:17:48,826
What's the matter?

807
01:17:51,132 --> 01:17:52,395
Was that really necessary?

808
01:17:54,907 --> 01:17:56,169
We needed a tree.

809
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:57,902
May I remind you that...

810
01:17:58,077 --> 01:18:01,239
That this was all my idea?
No, no. I'm well aware of that.

811
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,313
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

812
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:08,813
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

813
01:18:11,089 --> 01:18:12,647
We needed a coffin.

814
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:17,587
A tree. There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

815
01:18:17,996 --> 01:18:21,931
Louis burned down my tree
so I replaced it as best I could. Voil...

816
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:23,732
Are you okay?

817
01:18:23,838 --> 01:18:25,431
I'm fine, honey.

818
01:18:50,031 --> 01:18:51,696
I fixed the newel post.

819
01:19:14,759 --> 01:19:16,158
What's that sound?

820
01:19:38,086 --> 01:19:39,418
Do you hear it?

821
01:19:40,421 --> 01:19:42,855
It's a funny, squeaking sound.

822
01:19:43,592 --> 01:19:48,088
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

823
01:19:49,601 --> 01:19:50,898
I hear it, too.

824
01:19:59,911 --> 01:20:00,935
I don't hear it anymore.

825
01:20:06,285 --> 01:20:07,615
Squirrel!

826
01:20:15,398 --> 01:20:17,298
What was it? Oh, my God!

827
01:20:23,638 --> 01:20:24,969
Quiet! Shut up!

828
01:20:38,652 --> 01:20:39,984
Mom, don't move.

829
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:44,621
We can't let it out of the living room.

830
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,665
Where's Eddie?
He usually eats these goddamn things.

831
01:20:49,002 --> 01:20:52,596
Not recently, Clark. He read that squirrels
were high in cholesterol.

832
01:20:53,839 --> 01:20:55,101
Thank you, Catherine.

833
01:20:56,608 --> 01:20:57,836
I'll try and trap it.

834
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:59,067
Russ!

835
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:00,335
We're here, Dad.

836
01:21:00,979 --> 01:21:02,003
There you are.

837
01:21:03,183 --> 01:21:04,581
Go get the hammer.

838
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:06,784
What do you need a hammer for?

839
01:21:07,018 --> 01:21:10,789
I'll catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

840
01:21:18,201 --> 01:21:19,793
I'm going in with him.

841
01:21:23,537 --> 01:21:24,698
Nora?

842
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,299
Is it gone?

843
01:21:29,378 --> 01:21:31,870
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

844
01:21:32,648 --> 01:21:34,377
Squirrel!

845
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:17,259
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

846
01:22:17,434 --> 01:22:18,958
I can't just attack someone.

847
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:23,267
All right, then. If you're not man enough
to put an end to this shit, then I am.

848
01:22:45,063 --> 01:22:45,757
Gone.

849
01:22:51,304 --> 01:22:52,896
Oh, my God.

850
01:22:56,075 --> 01:22:57,565
What happened to you?

851
01:23:10,493 --> 01:23:13,154
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

852
01:23:13,495 --> 01:23:16,363
Nobody walks out
on this old-fashioned family Christmas.

853
01:23:16,431 --> 01:23:18,832
No, we're all in this together.

854
01:23:19,169 --> 01:23:22,161
This is a full-blown,
four-alarm holiday emergency.

855
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:25,771
We're going to press on
and have the happiest Christmas...

856
01:23:25,941 --> 01:23:28,774
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny fucking Kaye.

857
01:23:28,844 --> 01:23:31,874
And when Santa squeezes
his fat, white ass down the chimney...

858
01:23:31,951 --> 01:23:35,944
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nuthouse.

859
01:23:36,156 --> 01:23:37,383
You're goofy.

860
01:23:37,691 --> 01:23:39,351
Don't piss me off, Art.

861
01:23:40,527 --> 01:23:43,622
- It's over.
- Not according to Santa's watch, it isn't.

862
01:23:43,696 --> 01:23:44,958
Stay out of this, Dad.

863
01:23:45,031 --> 01:23:48,125
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

864
01:23:48,468 --> 01:23:50,060
Before things get worse.

865
01:23:50,135 --> 01:23:53,128
Worse?! How could they get any worse?

866
01:23:53,373 --> 01:23:57,366
Look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell!

867
01:24:15,398 --> 01:24:16,387
Son.

868
01:24:18,234 --> 01:24:20,566
I love you. We all love you.

869
01:24:20,903 --> 01:24:24,396
But this is a terrible night.
Nothing's gone right. It's a disaster.

870
01:24:25,176 --> 01:24:28,011
But losing your temper
only makes things worse.

871
01:24:28,248 --> 01:24:30,910
You're too good a father to act like this.

872
01:24:32,919 --> 01:24:37,583
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us...

873
01:24:37,857 --> 01:24:40,917
...and how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

874
01:24:41,528 --> 01:24:43,120
You just cocked it up.

875
01:24:46,099 --> 01:24:48,431
It's okay. It happens.

876
01:24:50,536 --> 01:24:52,870
All our holidays were always such a mess.

877
01:24:54,941 --> 01:24:56,741
How did you get through it?

878
01:24:57,615 --> 01:24:59,606
I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels.

879
01:25:09,293 --> 01:25:10,623
I love you.

880
01:25:15,231 --> 01:25:17,392
Will you recite
"The Night Before Christmas"?

881
01:25:17,467 --> 01:25:19,799
No. It's your house.

882
01:25:20,069 --> 01:25:21,628
It's your Christmas.

883
01:25:22,805 --> 01:25:24,402
I'm retiring.

884
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:28,646
"The children were nestled
All snug in their beds

885
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:31,974
"While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

886
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:34,076
"And Mama in her kerchief

887
01:25:34,154 --> 01:25:38,148
"And I in my cap, just settled our brains
For a long winter's nap

888
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:41,917
"When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter

889
01:25:42,028 --> 01:25:44,259
"I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

890
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:46,458
"Away to the window I flew like a flash

891
01:25:46,633 --> 01:25:48,965
"Tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash

892
01:25:49,169 --> 01:25:51,159
"The moon on the breast of
the new-fallen snow

893
01:25:51,237 --> 01:25:53,766
"Gave a luster of midday to objects below

894
01:25:53,943 --> 01:25:56,276
"When what to my wondering eyes
should appear

895
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:58,075
"But a miniature sleigh..."

896
01:25:59,817 --> 01:26:00,681
...and Eddie.

897
01:26:01,018 --> 01:26:03,679
And a man in his pajamas
with a dog chain...

898
01:26:03,854 --> 01:26:06,287
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the...?

899
01:26:08,692 --> 01:26:09,853
Stay here.

900
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:18,257
Merry Christmas, Clark.

901
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:22,373
You about ready to do some kissin'?

902
01:26:24,044 --> 01:26:26,809
Officer, it seems
my husband has been abducted.

903
01:26:27,047 --> 01:26:30,710
The man was wearing a blue leisure suit...

904
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:37,156
...and the plates were from Kansas.
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

905
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:39,823
I have never been treated
like this in my life.

906
01:26:40,059 --> 01:26:42,392
I'm sorry.
This is our family's first kidnapping.

907
01:26:43,429 --> 01:26:44,658
You're fired.

908
01:26:45,065 --> 01:26:46,896
Where's the phone? I'm calling the police.

909
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:48,961
Just hold your wad there, fella.

910
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:53,073
Clark had nothin' to do with this.
This here was my idea.

911
01:26:53,344 --> 01:26:56,905
All right. He's still fired
and you are going to jail.

912
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,342
It was my fault.

913
01:27:01,419 --> 01:27:05,583
I lost my temper when I got my bonus
and I said a few things I shouldn't have.

914
01:27:05,755 --> 01:27:10,420
Bonus? How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

915
01:27:11,596 --> 01:27:13,120
Thanks for telling us.

916
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:16,534
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

917
01:27:17,104 --> 01:27:21,097
In 17 years with the company, I've gotten
a bonus every year, but this one.

918
01:27:21,442 --> 01:27:23,376
You don't want to give bonuses, fine!

919
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:25,910
When people count on them
as part of their salary...

920
01:27:26,147 --> 01:27:27,876
What you did just plain...

921
01:27:28,016 --> 01:27:29,073
Sucks.

922
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:32,282
Thank you, Russ.

923
01:27:35,957 --> 01:27:38,789
My cousin-in-law,
whose heart is bigger than his brain...

924
01:27:39,059 --> 01:27:40,616
I appreciate that.

925
01:27:41,962 --> 01:27:45,059
...is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this...

926
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:49,464
...on behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

927
01:28:11,599 --> 01:28:14,501
Sometimes things look good
on paper, but...

928
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:18,670
...lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

929
01:28:19,674 --> 01:28:22,165
A healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much if...

930
01:28:22,243 --> 01:28:25,337
...to get it, you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

931
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:32,009
It's people that make the difference.
Little people, like you.

932
01:28:34,622 --> 01:28:36,613
So, Carl...

933
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:40,388
...whatever you got last year...

934
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:43,363
...add 20 percent.

935
01:29:36,429 --> 01:29:38,419
Go away, Todd.

936
01:29:39,564 --> 01:29:44,091
If you want to come in, you are gonna
have to break down the goddamn door!

937
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,442
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

938
01:30:09,965 --> 01:30:11,125
Freeze!

939
01:30:13,301 --> 01:30:15,132
Not you! Them!

940
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:26,311
This way, please.

941
01:30:29,317 --> 01:30:31,250
I think you've made a terrible mistake.

942
01:30:31,585 --> 01:30:33,080
I told you to freeze, mister.

943
01:30:33,325 --> 01:30:34,553
May we blink?

944
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:44,324
- Thank God you're all right.
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

945
01:30:44,668 --> 01:30:46,660
There was a big
misunderstanding tonight.

946
01:30:47,205 --> 01:30:51,643
Excuse me. Would you and Mrs. Shirley
like to step outside so we can finish here?

947
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:55,271
- Don't bother. I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

948
01:30:56,347 --> 01:30:57,645
It was a mistake.

949
01:30:57,715 --> 01:31:00,449
Mistake? Honey, you were kidnapped.

950
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:02,848
I did something I shouldn't have...

951
01:31:03,025 --> 01:31:07,621
...and these people called me on it.
This is Clark Griswold and his family.

952
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,521
Welcome to our home.

953
01:31:10,866 --> 01:31:12,265
What's left of it.

954
01:31:12,367 --> 01:31:13,732
Release B Squad.

955
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:15,469
What's going on here?

956
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:20,039
Remember how I was toying with the
notion of suspending Christmas bonuses?

957
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:22,040
You didn't.

958
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,644
Of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

959
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,314
That's pretty low, mister.

960
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:29,478
If I had a rubber hose...

961
01:31:29,554 --> 01:31:31,886
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating all the bonuses.

962
01:31:37,496 --> 01:31:39,157
Look!

963
01:31:41,567 --> 01:31:42,726
Look!

964
01:31:49,407 --> 01:31:51,070
It's Santy Claus.

965
01:31:54,912 --> 01:31:57,079
Uncle Clark, it's Santy Claus.

966
01:31:58,587 --> 01:32:00,281
It's the Christmas star.

967
01:32:00,756 --> 01:32:02,587
And that's all that matters tonight.

968
01:32:04,258 --> 01:32:08,093
Not bonuses or gifts or turkeys or trees.

969
01:32:08,697 --> 01:32:10,028
See, kids...

970
01:32:11,033 --> 01:32:13,433
It means something different
to everybody.

971
01:32:15,704 --> 01:32:17,501
Now I know what it means to me.

972
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,774
That ain't the frigging Christmas star.

973
01:32:21,944 --> 01:32:25,112
It's the light
on the sewage treatment plant.

974
01:32:25,384 --> 01:32:26,715
Sewer gas.

975
01:32:28,721 --> 01:32:30,086
Don't drop that!

976
01:32:40,133 --> 01:32:42,624
"And the rocket's red glare

977
01:32:43,635 --> 01:32:46,798
"The bombs bursting in air

978
01:32:47,573 --> 01:32:49,802
"Gave proof through the night

979
01:32:50,909 --> 01:32:54,405
"That our flag was still there

980
01:32:55,485 --> 01:32:57,645
"Oh, say does that

981
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:02,315
"Star-spangled banner yet wave

982
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:07,651
"O'er the land of the free

983
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:14,325
"And the home of the brave?"

984
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,436
Play ball!

985
01:33:28,521 --> 01:33:30,512
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

986
01:33:31,524 --> 01:33:33,150
Merry Christmas, honey.

987
01:34:02,258 --> 01:34:03,384
I did it.
