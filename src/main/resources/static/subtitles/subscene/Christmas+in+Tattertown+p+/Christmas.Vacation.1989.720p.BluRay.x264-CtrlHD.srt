1
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,406
That was beautiful--

2
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:32,422
Take it, Russ.

3
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,635
Dad, can you explain again
what we're doing?

4
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:41,472
Sure, Russ. We're kicking off our fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas...

5
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,143
...by heading out into the country
in the old front-wheel drive sleigh...

6
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,812
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

7
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,107
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

8
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:55,320
We're not driving all the way out here so
you can get one of those stupid ties...

9
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:59,657
...with the Santa Clauses on it, are we?
No, I have one of those at home.

10
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:04,370
What we're looking for today is the
Griswold family Christmas tree.

11
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:17,008
What's the matter?
Some jackass is riding my tail.

12
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,347
Slow down and let him pass.

13
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,569
Clark! Don't provoke them.

14
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,072
Hey, kids, look a deer.

15
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:02,178
Clark, slow down!

16
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,889
You wanna ride behind somebody
who does that?

17
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:07,392
I'll pull around them
and leave them behind us.

18
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:11,229
Burn some dust here. Eat my rubber.

19
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:15,400
Dad, I think what you mean is,
"Burn rubber," and, "Eat my dust."

20
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,193
Whatever, Russ. Whatever.

21
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,410
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

22
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,415
Okay. That's enough of that.

23
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,089
Speaking of Christmas trees, kids,
can one of you tell me...

24
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,800
...what the first tree displayed
at the White House was?

25
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,136
Dad, they're back.

26
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:51,269
Clark, stop it! I don't want
to spend the holidays dead.

27
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,772
Honey, please!
I'll do the driving, okay?

28
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:58,234
Will you just take it easy, Ellen?
I'm in complete control.

29
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,237
I'll get around this egg timer.

30
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,744
Dad. Dad.

31
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,623
We're all right!
Thank God, we're all right!

32
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,500
Clark, we're stuck
under a truck!

33
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,637
Do you honestly think I don't know that?
Come on, you guys, don't fight.

34
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,182
For chrissake,
I didn't do this on purpose!

35
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:37,190
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

36
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,276
And forgive my husband.
He knows not what he does.

37
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,111
Amen!

38
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,532
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

39
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,714
Made pretty good time.

40
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:12,558
Dad, didn't they invent Christmas tree
lots so people wouldn't have to drive...

41
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:15,770
...all the way out to nowhere
and waste a whole Saturday?

42
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:20,191
They invented them because people forgot
how to have an old-fashioned Christmas...

43
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,735
...and are satisfied with scrawny,
overpriced trees...

44
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:25,613
...that have no special meaning.
My toes are numb.

45
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,700
Kids, this is what our forefathers did.
I can't feel my leg.

46
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,621
They walked out into the woods, picked out
the tree and cut it with their hands.

47
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:36,582
Mom, I can't feel my hips.
Clark.

48
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,669
Yes, honey?
Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

49
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,380
That's all part of the
experience, honey.

50
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,675
There it is.

51
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,446
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

52
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:17,957
Isn't it a little big?
It's not big, it's just full.

53
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:23,129
Dad, that thing wouldn't fit in our yard.
It's not going in our yard, Russ.

54
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,756
It's going in our living room.

55
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:33,097
Look at it.
It really is beautiful, Clark.

56
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:35,766
It's something else, huh, Russ?
Yeah, Dad.

57
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,603
Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?
She'll see it later, honey.

58
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,189
Her eyes are frozen.

59
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,942
Most enduring traditions of the season
are best enjoyed in the warm embrace...

60
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,278
...of kith and kin.

61
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,616
This tree is the symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

62
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,620
Dad, did you bring a saw?

63
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:44,669
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his living room ceiling.

64
00:09:56,514 --> 00:10:00,810
Hey, Griswold. Where do you think
you're gonna put a tree that big?

65
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,355
Bend over and I'll show you.

66
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,400
You've got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

67
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,236
I wasn't talking to you.

68
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:28,254
Clark, do you think there's
enough room for the angel?

69
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,216
Oh, sure, honey. I have
a little more trimming to do...

70
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,760
...but that won't be a problem.
Ready?

71
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,556
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

72
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,941
There's a lot of sap in here.

73
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,112
It looks great. A little full.
A lot of sap.

74
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:18,354
Did I tell you I talked
to my mother today?

75
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,080
And?

76
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,767
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas too.

77
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:27,897
It's not too late to change our plans.
No, no, that's great. That's great.

78
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,816
You're forgetting how difficult
it's gonna be...

79
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,152
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

80
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,155
Honey, they're family. They're
not strangers off the street.

81
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,661
All they do is argue.

82
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:40,810
Christmas is about
resolving differences...

83
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,204
...and seeing through the problems
of family life.

84
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:47,792
Yeah. And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

85
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,962
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip.

86
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,549
And then they don't speak to each other--
Your mother waxes her upper lip?

87
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,970
She has for years.
It doesn't show.

88
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,539
I don't know, Sparky.
I have this feeling--

89
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:03,165
Ellen.

90
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,976
I want to have Christmas
here in our house.

91
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:10,356
It means a lot to me. All my life I've
wanted to have a big family Christmas.

92
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,400
I know.

93
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:18,823
It's just that I know how you build
things up in your mind, Sparky.

94
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:24,203
You set standards that no family
event can ever live up to.

95
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,831
When have I ever done that?

96
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:36,215
Parties. Weddings. Anniversaries.
Good night, honey.

97
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:40,511
Funerals. Holidays.
Oh, great.

98
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:43,764
Vacations. Graduations.

99
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,290
You should be looking at a fat
Christmas bonus this year, huh?

100
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:13,210
Word is you're an excellent choice to be
named Food Additive Designer of the Year.

101
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,046
I'm not kidding.

102
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,382
What's that new thing you got
at Food and Drug?

103
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,219
Oh, the crunch enhancer? Yeah, it's
a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

104
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,389
It's semipermeable, not osmatic.
It coats and seals the flake...

105
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,058
...prevents the milk from penetrating it.
Yeah.

106
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,519
It's a beautiful product.
I like it, yeah.

107
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,022
The question is,
what will you do with that bonus?

108
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,567
Gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.
Me? Heck, no.

109
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,736
Take a look at this.

110
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,242
I hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

111
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,537
Oh, my God, you're
putting in a pool.

112
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,342
I went ahead and I put a $7500
deposit down on it.

113
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,427
You're the last true family man.

114
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:08,891
Mark.
Clark.

115
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,352
That's Bill, sir.

116
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,230
Were you working on that
non-nutritive cereal varnish?

117
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,239
Yes, sir.

118
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:17,466
I've got to give a
speech to a trade group.

119
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:22,196
I'd like to mention it. Write a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

120
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,156
My pleasure.
Layman's terms.

121
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:26,992
None of that inside bullshit jargon
nobody understands.

122
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,828
Yes, sir.

123
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:36,085
Oh, Mr. Shirley. We got
your Christmas card the other day...

124
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:39,296
...and my family and I are very
flattered that you remembered us.

125
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,633
Corporate cards.

126
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:49,473
Don't forget that report, Bill.
Yes, sir. Thank you. Merry Christmas.

127
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,976
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

128
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:57,481
Kiss my ass. Kiss his ass.
Kiss your ass. Happy Hanukkah.

129
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,593
Can I show you something?

130
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:37,479
I was just smelling-- Smiling.
I was just blouse-- Browsing.

131
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,525
For your wife or your girlfriend?

132
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,279
What? What happened?

133
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,704
I guess it wouldn't be any--

134
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,541
Wouldn't be the Christmas shopping
season if stores were less hooter--

135
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,377
Hotter than they are.

136
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,130
It is warm in here.
You have your coat on.

137
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,091
Yes. Oh, do I? How did that happen?
Because it's cold out.

138
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:12,014
Yes. Yes. It is. It's a bit
nipply out. I mean, nippy out.

139
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,600
What did I say, nipple?

140
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:18,896
There is a nip in the air though.
Can I take something out for you?

141
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:33,369
I was just.... I was just looking
at something for my wife.

142
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,580
God rest her soul.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

143
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:42,461
Oh, no, no, she's not dead.
We're just divorced. She's history.

144
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:46,465
Obviously she doesn't wear underwear. And
there are plenty of shopping days left...

145
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:51,303
...until adultery-- Adulthood.
Which is to say Christmas, as in Yule.

146
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,750
Yule log. Not a log,
I don't have a log.

147
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:56,333
But, I mean, you know,
just if I had a log...

148
00:16:56,475 --> 00:17:01,730
...not in the sense that you think
I said I did. Good golly.

149
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,775
'Tis the season to be merry.

150
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,277
Well, that's my name.
No shit.

151
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:20,499
What do these do?
Do they clip on here? Down there?

152
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,085
Would you like this one?
Sure.

153
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:27,131
These are cut really high on the hip.
Look, I'm wearing something similar.

154
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,174
See? You can't see the line.

155
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,844
You can't see the line, can you, Russ?
No.

156
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,637
No.

157
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,851
<i>That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.</i>

158
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:43,647
<i>Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...</i>

159
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,316
<i>...an angel gets his wings.</i>

160
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:23,020
Folks! Folks! Folks! Merry Christmas.

161
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:29,526
Hey! How you doing, son?
Fine.

162
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,197
There he is! Oh, my boy.

163
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:37,201
Look at how big you've gotten.
Merry Christmas.

164
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,161
Mom.
Sweetheart.

165
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:43,499
Oh, knock on the door.
Lift up the ladder.

166
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,959
Listen. Doesn't Nora look old?
You promised.

167
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,379
Of course I do.
They took a pint of fluid out of my back.

168
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,715
Do you see this mole?
This mole on my neck?

169
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,383
Think it's changing color?
No.

170
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,721
You keep touching it, it's getting redder.
I got hemorrhoids. Can you believe that?

171
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,932
Oh, Mother.
Isn't that terrible?

172
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,601
You're not getting the garage space.
After what you did--

173
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,645
I'm doing the parking.
Russ, you want to help?

174
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,856
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy, Mom.

175
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,360
Sweetheart. Your grandma Nora's
got a real painful burr on my heel.

176
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,862
If you rub it for me,
I'll give you a whole quarter.

177
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,782
A quarter. A quarter.
I'll give Audrey a quarter too.

178
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,327
I'm gonna put my car in the garage!
He damaged my car, you believe that?

179
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,578
I'll park the cars.

180
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,666
This is what Christmas is all about.

181
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,795
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage...

182
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,423
...and yeah, I'll be
outside for the season.

183
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:39,012
We're gonna have the
best-looking house in town.

184
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,683
I've always wanted to do this.
That's a lot of lights, Dad.

185
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,769
I'm sure it's a lot of work too,
but if I'm out in the cold...

186
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:49,106
...and I'm committed to decorating
the house, I'm gonna do it right...

187
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,733
...and I'm gonna do it big.

188
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,611
You want something you can
be proud of, don't you?

189
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,447
Yeah, I guess so.
Sure you do.

190
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:04,454
You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?
When was the last time I overdid anything?

191
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,584
Come on, unravel these.

192
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,423
You have to check every bulb.
Got a little knot here. You work on that.

193
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,511
I'll get the other box.

194
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,985
I hope he falls and breaks his neck.
I'm sure he'll fall.

195
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,946
But I don't think we're lucky enough
to have him break his neck.

196
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,160
Let's go.

197
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,816
<i>Boy, these gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with that giant nutcracker float.</i>

198
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:19,196
<i>At this point I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.</i>

199
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:23,533
<i>But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.</i>

200
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,913
<i>Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.
These look like giant nuts to me.</i>

201
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,625
<i>Yeah, I'm reminded of a couple years
ago, the winds were so high here...</i>

202
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,211
<i>...we almost lost Santa's reindeer.</i>

203
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:39,216
<i>Rudolph's red nose took out a third
floor window at Marshall Field's.</i>

204
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:43,553
<i>They better keep their eyes out on
their nuts before someone gets hurt.</i>

205
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:46,616
Would it be indecent to ask
the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

206
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,285
Audrey.

207
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,121
Well, can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

208
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:55,208
Alex called this morning. Grandpa Clark
told him I couldn't come to the phone...

209
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:59,713
...because I was going to the bathroom.
We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

210
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,049
Everybody?
Do you sleep with your brother?

211
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,634
Do you know how sick and twisted
that is, Mom?

212
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:09,181
Well, I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

213
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,017
I have nightmares about
what he does in his bed...

214
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:14,061
...when I'm not lying
right next to him.

215
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:20,358
Well, I don't know what to say except
it's Christmas and we're all in misery.

216
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,987
Ellen, are you smoking again?

217
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,531
No!

218
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,169
Hey, Dad, where do you want
these reindeer?

219
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,255
Just put them down there
on the lawn, Russ.

220
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,009
I can't find the Santa Claus.

221
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:51,014
It's in the basement.
We'll get it later.

222
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:52,617
Clark. Dinner's ready.
Okay, honey. I'm starving.

223
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,929
Obviously something
had to break the window!

224
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:16,099
Something had to hit the stereo!

225
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:30,906
And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?
I don't know, Margo.

226
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,124
You want to hurry this up, Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

227
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:45,921
Two hundred and fifty strands of light,
100 individual bulbs per strand...

228
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:50,884
...for a grand total of 25,000
imported Italian twinkle lights.

229
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,180
Twenty-five thousand.
Well, I hope nobody I know drives by...

230
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:59,226
...and sees me standing in the yard,
staring at the house in my pajamas.

231
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,145
If they know your dad,
they won't think anything of it.

232
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,147
Fire it up, Dad!

233
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:09,819
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

234
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,741
Drum roll, please.

235
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,662
Drum roll.

236
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:55,031
Beautiful, Clark.
Talk about pissing your money away.

237
00:26:55,991 --> 00:27:00,412
I hope you kids see what a silly
waste of resources this was.

238
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:04,666
He worked really hard, Grandma.
So do washing machines.

239
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,881
Let's get in where it's warm.

240
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:17,846
Clark, baby, I can picture it in my mind.
And it's breathtaking.

241
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:23,601
Thanks, Mom.
It's probably a bad bulb, son.

242
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:27,063
You know, if one goes out,
the whole thing doesn't work.

243
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,567
Now, if I were you
I'd personally check each one.

244
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,737
I did that, Dad. I can't--
Now, look, if you need any help...

245
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:38,199
...give me a holler. I'll be upstairs, asleep.
Thanks.

246
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:43,663
Sorry, Daddy. It looks good
even if they're not lit.

247
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,749
Thank you, sweetheart.

248
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:57,260
Well, Dad, it was a good try.
Thanks, Russ.

249
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,220
Russ.
Yeah?

250
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:05,435
We checked every bulb, didn't we?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm sure of it.

251
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:10,231
I thought so. Well, maybe we ought
to go up there and just get--

252
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:17,364
Jeez! Look at the time. I gotta get
to bed. Brush my teeth. Feed the hog.

253
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,826
I've still got some homework to do.
Do the laundry. Wash the car.

254
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,746
I've still got those bills to pay....

255
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:29,459
Clark, don't stay up too late.

256
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,818
Get off me, you little fungus.

257
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,941
Where the hell is that
cold coming from?

258
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,296
Hello?

259
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,132
I need to get a few more--
Pay by check.

260
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:27,679
I will. Not a card?
No. If they return it, then it's a hassle....

261
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,098
Russ!

262
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:37,230
Help!
Daddy, is Clark coming?

263
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,440
How would I know?
Is he in the house?

264
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,443
If he isn't farting around
with his lights, he must be inside.

265
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,363
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

266
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:51,494
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pills.

267
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:24,736
Ellen! Hey! Ellen!

268
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:57,490
I want to take off these clothes, sit
with a glass of wine and kiss your body.

269
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,909
After you shower, of course.
Of course.

270
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,803
Sparky?
Yes, honey.

271
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:31,941
Are you out here for a reason,
or are you just avoiding the family?

272
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:35,611
No. I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

273
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:40,074
In the meantime, I can light the Santa and
the reindeer and the Merry Christmas sign.

274
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,870
That should look good. Ready?

275
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:49,292
You want me to do the drum roll thing?
No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

276
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,800
I don't understand it.

277
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:02,305
The house lights don't work,
the flood lights don't work.

278
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,975
Is it plugged in?

279
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:08,769
Do you honestly think I would check
thousands of lights...

280
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,188
...if the extension
cord wasn't plugged in?

281
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,777
You used more than one
cord, didn't you?

282
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:23,409
Maybe the kids have been fooling
around with it. I'll check in back.

283
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,640
Clark!

284
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,851
Todd! What's that light?!

285
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,395
Clark!

286
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,023
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

287
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,375
I can't see.

288
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,378
No, no, no--
Oh, my God--

289
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,687
This ought to do it.

290
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,200
Ellen, I fixed it!

291
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:49,912
Oh, God!

292
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,541
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

293
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:04,802
Get a towel.
Okay!

294
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:10,808
Wait a minute. I don't believe this!
What's all the yelling about?

295
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:14,729
What?! But--
What's going on here?

296
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,983
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

297
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:23,988
What's he doing, Clark?
I haven't the foggiest.

298
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:26,282
What?

299
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:31,120
What the hell?
What is wrong with this?

300
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,624
Damn it! Damn it!

301
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,714
You goddamn light!

302
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:00,941
Go! Go! Do it!

303
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,456
Dad, it's beautiful!

304
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:32,681
Oh, my carpet!

305
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:46,695
Oh, Clark, it's so lovely.
Mom.

306
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:51,784
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

307
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,124
It's a beaut, Clark. It's a beaut.
Dad, Dad, Dad.

308
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,085
You taught me everything
I know about exterior illumination.

309
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:04,004
Thank you, thank you.

310
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:07,133
Russ. Audrey.

311
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:13,055
Dear, dear Francis.

312
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:18,185
I hope this adds to your enjoyment
of the holidays.

313
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:21,730
It's just wonderful.
Yeah.

314
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:26,110
Arthur. Art.

315
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:28,654
Dad.

316
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:33,325
Thanks for being here.
The little lights are not twinkling.

317
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:36,579
I know, Art, and
thanks for noticing.

318
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,918
The house sure does
look swell, Clark.

319
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:49,258
Thanks, Eddie. I hope it enhances
your holiday spirit. Dear Cathrine.

320
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:52,052
Eddie?

321
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:57,433
Oh, the house is gorgeous, Clark.
Eddie?

322
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,895
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account, Clark.

323
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:04,607
Kids, come on out here and see what
Uncle Clark's done to the house.

324
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,275
Eddie?

325
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:14,992
Eddie?

326
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:20,956
Yeah. If you don't remember,
this here is Rocky.

327
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:24,585
You got a kiss for me?
Better take a rain check on that, Art.

328
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:27,129
He's got a lip fungus
they ain't identified yet.

329
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:34,470
You remember Ruby Sue?
Oh, yeah.

330
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,597
Oh, my gosh!

331
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:41,602
Her eyes aren't crossed anymore.
That's something, ain't it?

332
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:46,357
Falls in a well, eyes go crossed. She gets
kicked by a mule, they go back to normal.

333
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,984
I don't know.

334
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:54,698
And this here's our pride and joy.
Snots.

335
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:56,867
Pretty name, Ed.

336
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,954
We named him that because he's
got this sinus condition.

337
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:04,124
Snots, you roll over and let
Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

338
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:10,339
You ain't never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got, Clark.

339
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:11,882
That's okay, Eddie.

340
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:15,010
That's something, ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

341
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,388
...and he'll love you
till the day you die.

342
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,516
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

343
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:24,561
We were gonna call, but Eddie
wanted to make it a surprise.

344
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:28,524
Yeah. You surprised?
Surprised, Eddie?

345
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:33,362
If I woke up with my head sewn to the
carpet, I wouldn't be more surprised.

346
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:38,742
We have plenty of room.

347
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:43,372
We have plenty of towels.
We have plenty of everything.

348
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:49,336
We're pretty well set up here
in the RV. It's a little tight...

349
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:53,048
...but we didn't come to impose.
Hell, there's plenty of room.

350
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,926
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

351
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:59,805
Cathrine and I, we're pretty
comfy in there, you know.

352
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:03,392
But maybe you wouldn't mind
the youngsters shacking up with you.

353
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:08,772
After that long drive, we could
use a little private time together.

354
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:13,777
Why don't you run and get the kids' things?
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

355
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:16,572
Come on. I wanna show you the home.

356
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,742
Audrey, help me get some
hot chocolate. It's cold.

357
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:58,113
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.
Is it real?

358
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,991
Yeah. Yeah, I dug it out
of the ground myself.

359
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:04,787
Is that a fact?
Hey, get out of there. Snots! Yo!

360
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:08,290
Don't worry about it, Clark. A little
tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

361
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:11,168
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

362
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:16,465
Boy, when he lifted his leg
the next morning....

363
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:20,177
If he drinks the water, the tree's
gonna dry up. Come on, out of there.

364
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:22,429
Snots.
Out, out, out.

365
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,473
Get out of there.
Get in the kitchen now.

366
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,810
Get in the kitchen there and get
you something to eat. Go on.

367
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:33,649
He's cute, ain't he? Problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

368
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:38,821
If the mood catches him right, he'll
grab your leg and just go to town.

369
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:43,575
Don't want him around if you're wearing
short pants, if you know what I mean.

370
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:50,165
A word of warning, though. If he does lay
into you, it's best to just let him finish.

371
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:55,587
I can't believe you're actually standing
here in my living room, Eddie.

372
00:45:55,754 --> 00:46:00,008
Never thought the day would come.
Yeah, I'm excited about it too.

373
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:03,887
It's a crying shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

374
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,936
I'll get that. Don't worry about it.
Let me get it.

375
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:18,318
Yeah, I got the daughter in the clinic,
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

376
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:23,031
And the older boy, bless his soul,
is preparing for his career.

377
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,700
College?
Carnival.

378
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,370
You gotta be proud.
Oh, yeah.

379
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:32,583
Yeah, last season he was a pixie-dust
spreader on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

380
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,543
He thinks maybe next year...

381
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,921
...he'll be guessing people's weight
or barking for the Yak Woman.

382
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:41,758
You ever see her?
No.

383
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:45,429
She's got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

384
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:49,183
Yeah, she's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.
And a hell of a good cook.

385
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,894
Can I refill your eggnog?
Get you something to eat?

386
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:54,563
Drive you out to nowhere
and leave you for dead?

387
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:58,859
No, I'm doing just fine, Clark.
Just glad to be here.

388
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:03,864
Yeah. So when did you get
the tenement on wheels?

389
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:07,117
Oh, that there? That's an RV.

390
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:11,371
Yeah, yeah. I borrowed it off a
buddy of mine. He took my house...

391
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:15,792
...I took the RV. It's a
good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

392
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:18,253
Yeah. Looks so nice parked
in the driveway.

393
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,508
Yeah, it sure does. But don't
you go falling in love with it now.

394
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:25,886
Because we're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

395
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:38,899
Well, get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures.

396
00:47:39,066 --> 00:47:41,610
Oh, retooling.
That's a great excuse.

397
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:46,907
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

398
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:52,162
Mr. Shirley, merry Christmas.
Who's that?

399
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,624
It's me, Clark Griswold.
What do you want?

400
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:01,838
My wife and I came up with a little
something special. It's a gift.

401
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:06,635
Put it over there with the others,
greaseball.

402
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:20,649
By the way, I hope my report
helped out at the trade show.

403
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:28,240
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

404
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:32,160
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in
the middle of an important call.

405
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,831
Get me somebody. Anybody.

406
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,375
And get me somebody while I wait.

407
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:57,102
This is a new silicon-based kitchen
lubricant my company's been working on.

408
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:01,023
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than any cooking oil.

409
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:03,525
We're gonna fly down
the hill with this stuff.

410
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:07,362
Has anyone ever used it on a sled?
Not that I know of, Russ.

411
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:13,535
Well, don't go putting none of
that stuff on my sled, Clark.

412
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:16,788
You know that metal plate in my head?
How could I forget?

413
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:20,751
I had to have it replaced because every
time Cathrine revved up the microwave...

414
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:24,046
...I'd piss my pants and forget
who I was for a half-hour or so.

415
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:29,593
Over at the V.A. they had to replace it with
a plastic one and it ain't as strong, so....

416
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,013
I don't know if I ought to go down
no hill with nothing between...

417
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,391
...the ground and my brain
but a piece of government plastic.

418
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:44,399
You really think it matters, Eddie?
The plate runs underneath my part here.

419
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,402
Over here it's, you know, nothing.

420
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:52,366
But here, if this gets dented, then
my hair just ain't gonna look right.

421
00:49:55,077 --> 00:50:00,207
Yeah, I know the feeling. I better
try this first, see how it works.

422
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:03,585
Well, you be careful there.
There's nothing to worry about, Eddie.

423
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:08,757
Going for a new amateur recreational
saucer-sled land-speed record:

424
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:11,760
Clark W. Griswold Jr.!

425
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:16,765
Remember, don't try this at home, kids.
I am a professional.

426
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:23,605
Later, dudes. Let her rip. Hang 10.

427
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:27,109
Oh, shit!

428
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:43,291
This is great! It's great!
It's great! I'm dead!

429
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:04,187
Look out!

430
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:30,589
Bingo.

431
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:47,022
Clark? You staying late?
Oh, hi, Bill. Yeah.

432
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:50,984
Just finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

433
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:54,446
Well, have a really Merry Christmas.

434
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:56,740
You too.

435
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:02,370
Are you okay?
Yeah.

436
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,583
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

437
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,044
I just talked to my son.

438
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:12,380
Company messenger brought something
to the house. I guess that's it.

439
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:17,010
Nothing like waiting till the
last minute, huh? Did you get yours?

440
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:21,556
If it isn't at the house,
I'm sure it's on its way.

441
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:26,186
If I don't get that bonus,
I'm in it up to here.

442
00:52:26,353 --> 00:52:31,399
Don't sweat it. It'll come. Merry Christmas.
Same to you.

443
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:48,768
<i>Me?</i>

444
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:44,366
Santy Claus!

445
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,868
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

446
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:49,037
What?

447
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,042
You scared me.

448
00:54:55,377 --> 00:54:57,253
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

449
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:03,468
I wish I was.

450
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:06,930
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

451
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,392
Rocky bit my thumb.
What?

452
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:13,353
Him's nervous because
Christmas is almost here.

453
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:17,774
Nervous or excited?
Shitting bricks.

454
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:23,071
You shouldn't use that word.
Sorry. Shitting rocks.

455
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,907
I see. Good.

456
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:29,995
Him's nervous because he don't
know if he's getting nothing.

457
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,709
I don't think he should be nervous
and you shouldn't be either.

458
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,586
Because if you're
good, Santa knows it.

459
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:43,758
If you believe in him and you believe
in your mom and you believe in your....

460
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:46,261
Your dad.

461
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:50,932
If you've been good all year round, Santa
Claus is gonna bring you something.

462
00:55:51,725 --> 00:55:55,103
Sometimes I think all that
Santa crap is just bull.

463
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,648
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

464
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:01,484
We didn't do nothing wrong
and we still got the shaft.

465
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,322
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

466
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:09,576
And in the next couple of days...

467
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:11,911
...somehow I'm gonna
prove it to you.

468
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:16,458
You know, every year he comes
to our house. I've seen him.

469
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:21,504
That's true?
Cross my heart.

470
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:27,886
So it's good you came to stay with us.
I love it here.

471
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:30,764
You don't gotta put on your coat
to go to the bathroom.

472
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,433
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

473
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:40,065
I think you'd better
go back to bed now.

474
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:44,778
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

475
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:50,241
Oh, I was just looking
for something.

476
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:57,540
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

477
00:56:57,707 --> 00:56:59,751
Nope. How come?

478
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:02,253
Oh, just wondering.

479
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:09,677
Now you get back to bed. Come on.

480
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:18,686
Uncle Clark, are you sure
you ain't Santy Claus?

481
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:22,107
I'm sure.

482
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:29,614
I can't even afford to be an elf.

483
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,545
Two containers of K rations!
Two containers of K rations!

484
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:47,215
Then I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears.

485
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:49,342
Oh, bullshit!

486
00:57:58,935 --> 00:58:03,565
Aren't you having any breakfast?
I'm not in the mood.

487
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:06,568
What are you looking at?

488
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:10,446
Oh, the silent majesty
of a winter's morn.

489
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:13,783
The clean, cool chill
of the holiday air.

490
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:17,620
And an asshole in his bathrobe emptying
a chemical toilet into my sewer.

491
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:25,753
Shitter was full!
Yeah.

492
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,673
Have you checked our shitters, honey?
Clark, please.

493
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,259
He doesn't know any better.
It's illegal.

494
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:35,597
It's a storm sewer. If it fills with gas, I pity
the person who lights a match near it.

495
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:03,958
Merry Christmas. Shitter was full.

496
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:21,768
<i>I have a terrible suspicion Cathrine and
Eddie don't have presents for their kids.</i>

497
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:27,690
Rocky said something about Eddie telling
him Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

498
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:32,111
Yeah. Ruby Sue said something
like that last night.

499
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:36,032
How can they have nothing for the kids?
He's been out of work for seven years.

500
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:38,326
In seven years he
couldn't find a job?

501
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:42,622
Cathrine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

502
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:51,673
So how's the live-bait business, Eddie?
Well, I can't complain. How you doing?

503
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,633
Not that good, actually.

504
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,136
Your company kill off all them
people over in India not long ago?

505
00:59:57,303 --> 01:00:03,017
No. We missed out on that one. You're
pretty set so far as shopping goes?

506
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:08,439
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark. The truth
is, things ain't going too good at all.

507
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:13,903
You know, I told you I borrowed the RV
from my neighbor? Nope. It's mine.

508
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:19,909
We live in it. I had to sell off
the house, the barn, the 10 acres.

509
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:26,499
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

510
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,377
If only I had back the money
that me and Cathrine...

511
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:34,007
...sent that TV preacher that was
screwing the hockey players.

512
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:36,050
What about the kids?

513
01:00:36,217 --> 01:00:39,887
His kids can fend for themselves.
No, your kids.

514
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:43,558
Oh, well, that's the bitch of it.
See, I don't know what to do.

515
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:48,938
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Gurnee.

516
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,649
Eddie....

517
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:56,112
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

518
01:00:56,279 --> 01:00:59,741
Clark, I couldn't do that.
No, no, we insist.

519
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:02,410
Oh, no. I'm not one
for charity, now.

520
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:06,080
Oh, I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

521
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:11,586
I don't know about that.
Now, come on.

522
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:15,548
If you don't tell me what they want,
I'll go out and get it on my own.

523
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:21,596
Oh, boy.
This is a surprise, Clark.

524
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:27,977
This is just a real nice surprise.
Just a real nice surprise.

525
01:01:33,066 --> 01:01:37,111
Here's a little list. Alphabetical,
starting with Cathrine.

526
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:41,240
And if it wouldn't be too much, I'd
like to get something for you, Clark.

527
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:44,285
Something really nice.

528
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:05,223
Is your house on fire, Clark?
No, Bethany. Those are Christmas lights.

529
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:08,768
Don't throw me down, Clark.
I'll try not to, Aunt Bethany.

530
01:02:09,477 --> 01:02:12,355
Is this the airport, Clark?
We're here!

531
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:16,317
Hey, Gris, me and Bethany figured
out the perfect gift for you.

532
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:19,153
Oh, Uncle Lewis, you didn't
have to buy me anything.

533
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,323
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

534
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,786
Oh, that was fun.
I love riding in cars.

535
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:30,665
When did you move to Florida?

536
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:35,420
Ellen, are you still dating Clark?

537
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:41,175
Oh, Aunt Bethany, you know
you shouldn't have done that.

538
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:44,011
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

539
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:47,849
Jesus, did the room
clear out, Bethany?

540
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,561
Hell, no. She means presents.
You shouldn't have brought presents.

541
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:55,898
It isn't every day somebody
moves into a new house.

542
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:58,192
They didn't move into a new house.

543
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,529
Mom?
In the living room, Russ.

544
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:07,368
This house is bigger
than your old one.

545
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:09,954
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

546
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:14,167
Aunt Bethany, why don't you go with
Francis and Cathrine into the living room...

547
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,836
...and say hello to everybody.
Hello, everybody?

548
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:19,130
Just in the living room.
I should say it?

549
01:03:19,297 --> 01:03:22,258
You should say it.
Hello, everybody!

550
01:03:23,426 --> 01:03:25,011
Mom.
What?

551
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:28,389
This box is meowing.
Let me see it.

552
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:36,898
She wrapped up her cat.
Take it in the kitchen and open it up.

553
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,067
Then we'll have a cat running around.
You can't leave it in the box.

554
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,653
Why would somebody
wrap up a cat in a box?

555
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,365
She gets confused, Rusty. She and
Uncle Lewis don't have much money...

556
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:49,785
...so she takes things from the
house and gives them as presents.

557
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:51,871
Great. Can't wait to see what I got.

558
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:55,124
This one here is leaking.

559
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:04,800
It's lime.
That's her Jell-O mold. I'll take it, Eddie.

560
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:08,763
Why don't you go back in the living
room and enjoy yourself? Russ?

561
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,264
Come on, boy.

562
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:13,434
Let's go find your sister.

563
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:39,460
Before we begin, since this is
Aunt Bethany's 80th Christmas...

564
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:43,673
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

565
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:44,924
Great.

566
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:48,719
What, dear?

567
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,472
Grace!

568
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:56,477
Grace? She passed away
30 years ago.

569
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,980
They want you
to say grace.

570
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:03,985
The blessing.

571
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:26,215
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America...

572
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:30,094
...and to the republic
for which it stands...

573
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:32,680
...one nation under God,
indivisible...

574
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:38,102
...with liberty
and justice for all.

575
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,688
Amen.
Amen.

576
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:49,739
Cathrine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

577
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:52,783
...I think we're all in
for a very big treat.

578
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:55,161
Thank you.

579
01:05:56,829 --> 01:06:00,374
Save the neck for me, Clark.
Okay, Eddie.

580
01:06:09,258 --> 01:06:10,593
Look at that.

581
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:16,724
Sorry.

582
01:06:17,183 --> 01:06:21,187
Why are you crying?
I told you we put it in too early.

583
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:25,566
Oh, it's just a little dry. It's fine.
It looks good to me.

584
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,610
Here's the heart.

585
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:30,256
Aunt Bethany?

586
01:07:31,507 --> 01:07:33,592
Does your cat, by any chance,
eat Jell-O?

587
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:39,640
Well, I don't know about the cat,
but I sure am enjoying it.

588
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:54,155
Hey, kids?

589
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:59,785
I heard on the news that a pilot spotted
Santa's sled on its way in from New York.

590
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,210
You serious, Clark?

591
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:15,634
Art, you want to load me up with
a little more there. It is good.

592
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,019
Ed?
Yeah, Clark.

593
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:27,021
What's wrong with the dog?

594
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:35,237
Oh, he's just yacking on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

595
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:39,700
Maybe if you wouldn't
feed him from the table.

596
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,537
No, no.

597
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:46,707
He's probably just nosing
through the trash there.

598
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:58,844
Hey, Gris, if you're not doing
anything constructive...

599
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:02,348
...run into the living room,
get my stogy.

600
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:06,268
Is there anything else I can
do for you, Uncle Lewis?

601
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:09,855
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

602
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:12,817
If he keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

603
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,561
That should be it.

604
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,610
Honey?

605
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:08,372
You had too many plugs in one outlet.
Oh, God.

606
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,458
What is it?

607
01:10:12,668 --> 01:10:16,171
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

608
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:21,969
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

609
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:30,853
If you don't mind, Clark, I'd like to see
if I can fumigate this here chair.

610
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,814
It's a good, quality item.

611
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:39,987
If you don't mind me asking,
how much it set you back?

612
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,989
You smell something?

613
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:46,118
Fried pussycat.

614
01:10:48,162 --> 01:10:51,665
It's not the chair. It's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

615
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,798
Lewis?

616
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:43,592
My tree!

617
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:46,887
So, what's the matter with you?

618
01:11:48,389 --> 01:11:50,933
Look what you've done to my tree!

619
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,062
Lewis.

620
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:08,325
It was an ugly tree, anyway.

621
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:10,869
At least it's out of its misery.

622
01:12:11,245 --> 01:12:13,372
Dad's gonna flip out.
Nobody's gonna flip out.

623
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:16,208
We're gonna have
a wonderful Christmas.

624
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:20,879
What the hell do you want?

625
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:26,218
I have a delivery for Clark W. Grisman.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

626
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:31,432
...but it fell between the seats,
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

627
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:39,940
Merry Christmas.

628
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:42,359
Merry Christmas.

629
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:47,990
I can't believe it.
What is it?

630
01:12:48,157 --> 01:12:51,326
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nut house?

631
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:53,454
It's from my company.

632
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,165
Your bonus.
My bonus.

633
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:03,797
Open it, Clarkie.
Open it.

634
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:06,967
Yeah, I hope it's a fortune, Clark.

635
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:09,094
I bet you do, Eddie.

636
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,391
I was afraid....

637
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:17,478
Are you gonna bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

638
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:24,651
I was gonna wait till tomorrow to
tell you all this, but what the heck.

639
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,864
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

640
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:35,996
That's it. That's the big one!

641
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:39,374
Open it!

642
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:45,047
I'm sorry if I've been a little
short with everyone lately.

643
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:47,341
I've been waiting
for this bonus.

644
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:50,177
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

645
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:53,013
...I had to pay in advance.
And until this arrived...

646
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,350
...I didn't have enough in my
account to cover the check.

647
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:58,727
Tear the sucker open, Dad.
Yeah.

648
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,732
Drum roll. Just kidding.

649
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:14,326
If there's enough left over, I'm gonna fly
you all down here to help us dedicate it.

650
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:20,541
I can't swim, Clark.

651
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,127
I know that, Eddie.

652
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:39,434
Clark, what's wrong?

653
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:41,061
Honey?

654
01:14:42,146 --> 01:14:44,857
It's bigger than you expected?

655
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:49,653
Smaller?

656
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,657
What is it?

657
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,662
It's a one-year membership
in the Jelly of the Month Club.

658
01:14:58,829 --> 01:14:59,830
Oh, God.

659
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:04,418
Clark, that's the gift that keeps
on giving the whole year.

660
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:09,798
That it is, Edward.
That it is, indeed.

661
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:13,051
I'm sorry. Clark....

662
01:15:13,552 --> 01:15:19,099
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got. Goddamn it!

663
01:15:19,266 --> 01:15:20,726
Son.

664
01:15:33,614 --> 01:15:37,951
That's good. That's good.
That's good.

665
01:15:41,914 --> 01:15:43,290
Hey!

666
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:49,630
If any of you are looking for any
last-minute gift ideas for me, I have one.

667
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:52,633
I'd like Frank Shirley, my boss,
right here, tonight.

668
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,137
I want him brought from his happy
holiday slumber on Melody Lane...

669
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,390
...with all the other rich people,
and I want him right here.

670
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,976
With a big ribbon on his head.

671
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,646
I wanna look him straight
in the eye and tell him...

672
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:08,690
...what a cheap, lying, no good,
rotten, four-flushing...

673
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:11,985
...low-life, snake-licking,
dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed...

674
01:16:12,152 --> 01:16:16,907
...ignorant, bloodsucking, dog-kissing,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

675
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:20,827
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

676
01:16:20,994 --> 01:16:23,997
...worm-headed sack
of monkey shit he is!

677
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:28,460
Hallelujah! Holy shit!
Where's the Tylenol?

678
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:46,561
He's got that crazed look in his eye.
I told you we should've gone to Hawaii.

679
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:49,982
Turn that thing off
and get in the house!

680
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:52,192
I'll talk to him, Mom.

681
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:58,031
You know, Dad.
I've been thinking.

682
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:01,410
Good talk, Dad.

683
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:09,835
Aren't you a bit sorry we didn't
get a Christmas tree?

684
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:13,547
Even though they're dirty and
messy and corny and clichéd.

685
01:17:13,714 --> 01:17:17,217
Well, where you gonna find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

686
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,238
What's the matter?

687
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:41,908
Was that really necessary?

688
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:45,871
We needed a tree.
May I remind you that--

689
01:17:46,038 --> 01:17:50,250
That this was all my idea. No.
No, no. I'm well aware of that, honey.

690
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:53,879
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

691
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:57,424
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

692
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:04,097
We needed a coffin.
I mean, a tree.

693
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:06,350
There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

694
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:10,479
Lewis burned down my tree, so I
replaced it as best I could. <i>Voilà.</i>

695
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:14,441
Are you okay?
I'm fine, honey.

696
01:18:38,632 --> 01:18:40,759
Fixed the newelpost.

697
01:19:03,156 --> 01:19:04,616
What's that sound?

698
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:31,309
Do you hear it?
It's a funny squeaky sound.

699
01:19:32,227 --> 01:19:36,565
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

700
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:39,943
I hear it too.

701
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:50,245
I don't hear it anymore.

702
01:20:03,884 --> 01:20:05,760
What was it?! Oh, my God!

703
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:14,478
Quiet! Shut up!

704
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,409
Mom, don't move.

705
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:33,413
We can't let it get out
of the living room.

706
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:36,917
Where's Eddie? He usually eats
these goddamn things.

707
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:42,088
Oh, not recently, Clark. He read that
squirrels were high in cholesterol.

708
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:44,090
Thank you, Cathrine.

709
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:46,384
I'll try and trap it.

710
01:20:46,635 --> 01:20:48,470
Russ!
Right here, Dad.

711
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:51,097
Oh, there you are.

712
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:53,266
Go get the hammer.

713
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:55,560
Clark, what do you need
a hammer for?

714
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:59,272
I'm gonna catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

715
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:08,990
I'm going in with him.

716
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:13,787
Nora?

717
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:17,582
Nora!
Is it gone?

718
01:21:17,749 --> 01:21:20,794
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

719
01:21:21,086 --> 01:21:22,963
Squirrel!

720
01:22:01,585 --> 01:22:05,797
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

721
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:09,009
I can't just attack someone.
If you're not man enough...

722
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:12,095
...to put an end to this shit,
then I am.

723
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:42,000
Oh, my God!

724
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:46,796
What happened to you?

725
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:57,390
Beautiful. God.

726
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:01,978
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

727
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:04,814
Nobody's walking out
on this family Christmas.

728
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:07,400
No, no. We're all in this together.

729
01:23:07,651 --> 01:23:10,570
This is a full-blown, four-alarm
holiday emergency here.

730
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:14,366
We're gonna press on, and we're gonna
have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas...

731
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:16,868
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny Kaye.

732
01:23:17,369 --> 01:23:20,330
And when Santa squeezes his ass
down that chimney tonight...

733
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:24,459
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nut house.

734
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:26,127
You're goofy.

735
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:28,088
Don't piss me off, Art.
Clark?

736
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,341
It's over.
Not according to Santa's watch.

737
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:33,343
Come on, son.
Stay out of this, Dad.

738
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:36,554
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

739
01:23:37,097 --> 01:23:40,100
Before things get worse.
Worse?

740
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:41,768
How could they
get any worse?

741
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:46,314
Take a look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell.

742
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,458
Son?

743
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:09,254
I love you.
We all love you.

744
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:13,675
But this is a terrible night. Nothing's
gone right. It's a disaster.

745
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:17,137
You losing your temper with the whole
family only makes things worse.

746
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:20,306
You're too good a father
to act like this.

747
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:26,146
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us.

748
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:29,149
And how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

749
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:32,318
Well, I just--
You just cocked it up.

750
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:37,115
Oh, it's okay. It happens.

751
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,996
Our holidays were always such a mess.
Oh, yeah.

752
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,540
How did you
get through it?

753
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:49,169
I had a lot of help
from Jack Daniels.

754
01:24:57,886 --> 01:24:59,804
I love you.

755
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:03,349
Dad?
Yeah.

756
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:07,353
Are you gonna recite
<i>The Night Before Christmas</i>?

757
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,565
It's your house.
It's your Christmas.

758
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:13,359
I'm retiring.

759
01:25:14,402 --> 01:25:17,280
"The children were nestled
all snug in their beds...

760
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:20,909
...while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads.

761
01:25:21,075 --> 01:25:23,745
And Mama in her kerchief
and I in my cap...

762
01:25:23,912 --> 01:25:26,706
...had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap.

763
01:25:26,998 --> 01:25:29,918
When out on the lawn,
there arose such a clatter...

764
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:32,545
...I sprang from my bed to see
what was the matter.

765
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:35,006
Away to the window,
I flew like a flash...

766
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:37,842
...tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash.

767
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:42,263
The moon on the new-fallen snow gave
a luster of midday to objects below.

768
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:48,394
When what to my wondering eyes should
appear but a miniature sleigh and...."

769
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:52,232
And Eddie with a man in his
pajamas with a dog chain...

770
01:25:52,398 --> 01:25:54,984
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the--?

771
01:25:57,237 --> 01:25:58,905
Stay here.

772
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:07,247
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Clark.

773
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:10,959
You about ready to do some kissing?

774
01:26:12,627 --> 01:26:15,255
Yes, officer, it seems my husband's
been abducted.

775
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:17,423
The man was...

776
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:22,136
...wearing a blue leisure suit,
and the plates were from Kansas.

777
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:25,765
He was a huge, beastly,
bulging man and--

778
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:28,351
I've never been treated
like this in my life.

779
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:31,938
I'm sorry. This is our family's
first kidnapping.

780
01:26:32,105 --> 01:26:35,275
You're fired. And where's the phone?
I'm calling the police.

781
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:39,445
Hey, just hold your wad there, fella.
Clark had nothing to do with this.

782
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:41,781
This here was my idea.

783
01:26:41,948 --> 01:26:45,785
All right. He's still fired,
and you are going to jail.

784
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:49,247
Oh, no. Eddie, it was my fault.

785
01:26:50,081 --> 01:26:52,208
I lost my temper
when I got my bonus.

786
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:55,461
I guess I said some things I shouldn't have.
Bonus?

787
01:26:55,628 --> 01:26:58,965
How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

788
01:26:59,132 --> 01:27:01,342
Yeah. Thanks for telling us.

789
01:27:01,759 --> 01:27:05,597
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

790
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:09,851
Seventeen years with the company. I've
gotten a bonus every year but this one.

791
01:27:10,018 --> 01:27:11,811
You don't wanna give bonuses, fine!

792
01:27:11,978 --> 01:27:14,772
But when people count on them
as part of their salary...

793
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:17,483
...well, what you did just plain--
Sucks.

794
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:21,154
Thank you, Russ.

795
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,324
My...

796
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:27,493
...cousin-in-law, whose heart
is bigger than his brain--

797
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,913
I appreciate that, Clark.

798
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:33,917
Is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this.

799
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:38,671
On behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

800
01:27:57,023 --> 01:27:58,691
Look...

801
01:28:00,026 --> 01:28:03,196
...sometimes things look
good on paper...

802
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:07,367
...but lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

803
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:10,578
I guess a healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much...

804
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:13,998
...if to get it you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

805
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,920
It's people that make the difference.

806
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:21,214
Little people, like you.

807
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:26,010
So, Carl...

808
01:28:26,886 --> 01:28:29,305
...whatever you got last year...

809
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:32,058
...add 20 percent.

810
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:34,560
Our pool!

811
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:40,525
Dad.

812
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:27,572
Go away, Todd.

813
01:29:27,739 --> 01:29:32,493
If you wanna come in, you are gonna
have to break down the goddamn door!

814
01:29:43,713 --> 01:29:46,924
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

815
01:29:58,478 --> 01:30:00,313
Freeze!

816
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:04,150
Not you, them!
Them!

817
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,286
This way, please.

818
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:21,709
I think you've made a terrible mistake.
I told you to freeze, mister.

819
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:23,503
May we blink?

820
01:30:27,048 --> 01:30:28,758
Frank.

821
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:30,927
Helen!
Thank God, you're all right.

822
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:32,929
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

823
01:30:33,096 --> 01:30:35,264
It was a big
misunderstanding tonight.

824
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:38,684
Excuse me. Would you and
Mrs. Shirley like to step outside...

825
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:40,937
...so we can take care
of business here?

826
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:43,689
There's no business.
I'm not pressing any charges.

827
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:45,942
What?
It was a mistake.

828
01:30:46,109 --> 01:30:49,153
Mistake? Frank, honey,
you were kidnapped.

829
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:53,032
I did something I shouldn't have,
and these people called me on it.

830
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:56,244
This is Clark Griswold
and his family.

831
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:58,538
Welcome to our home.

832
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:00,748
What's left of it.

833
01:31:00,915 --> 01:31:03,876
Release B Squad.
What's going on here?

834
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:09,090
Remember how I was toying with the notion
of suspending the Christmas bonuses?

835
01:31:09,257 --> 01:31:14,095
You didn't. Well, of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

836
01:31:14,262 --> 01:31:17,890
That's pretty low, mister. If I had
a rubber hose, I would beat you to--

837
01:31:18,057 --> 01:31:20,184
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating the bonuses.

838
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:24,230
Look!

839
01:31:25,982 --> 01:31:27,900
Look, look!

840
01:31:30,111 --> 01:31:31,571
Look!

841
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:34,448
Ruby Sue, sweetheart.

842
01:31:37,952 --> 01:31:40,413
It's Santa Claus.
What? What's wrong?

843
01:31:42,248 --> 01:31:45,376
What?
She thinks she sees Santa.

844
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:48,421
No, it's the Christmas star.

845
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:51,591
And that's all that matters tonight.

846
01:31:52,758 --> 01:31:57,054
Not bonuses or gifts
or turkeys or trees.

847
01:31:57,221 --> 01:31:59,015
See, kids...

848
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:02,268
...it means something different
to everybody.

849
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,480
Now I know what it means to me.

850
01:32:08,024 --> 01:32:10,902
That ain't the frigging
Christmas star, Gris.

851
01:32:10,928 --> 01:32:13,679
It's a light on the
sewage treatment plant.

852
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:15,281
Sewer gas.

853
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:19,076
Don't drop that!

854
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:08,834
Play ball!

855
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:19,345
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

856
01:33:20,096 --> 01:33:22,056
Merry Christmas, honey.

857
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:25,351
Come here.

858
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,295
I did it.

859
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:10,201
