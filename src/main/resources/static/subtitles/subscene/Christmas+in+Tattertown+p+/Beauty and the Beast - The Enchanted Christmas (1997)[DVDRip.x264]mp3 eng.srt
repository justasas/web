1
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,771
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

2
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,531
Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,530
'Tis the season
to be jolly

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,405
Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,364
Don we now
our gay apparel

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,926
Fa-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,044
Troll the ancient
Yuletide carol

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,846
Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,928
Whoa!

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,089
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,010
Ha-ha. There must be
much, much more holly.

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,771
Tis the season to be--
Wh-What's this? There's too much holly.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,326
Whoa!
Slow down, lad.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,966
Don we now
our gay apparel

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,368
No, no, no,
no more mistletoe.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,400
Chip, away from
those presents, dear.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,490
Mama, I found one
for me!

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,523
Can I open it, Mama?
Can I?

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,644
- Well, just one.
- Oh, boy!

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,843
It's good to see the boy
having a proper Christmas.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,883
Not like last year.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,163
Yes. This is much
more agreeable.

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,011
Well, I thought last year
was quite nice.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,886
Yes, well, I suppose I--
I did manage to save Christmas.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,446
- You?
- Yes, me.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,450
If not for my skilful
and decisive leadership,

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,369
all would've been lost.

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,007
Leadership? Ha! You could
not lead a horse to water.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,567
What are you yammering about?
It was all my idea.

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,411
Your idea? Everyone
knows it was mine.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,889
Heavens. How many times are we going
to have to go over this story?

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,050
- Story?
- Until someone gets his facts straight.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,811
- Why don't you tell it, Mama?
- Capital idea.

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,843
Well, I don't know.

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,284
Come now, Mrs Potts. Surely you
recall how I saved Christmas.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,402
Tut-tut-tut-tut.
No leading the witness.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,091
Please, Mama,
tell the story.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,168
Oh, all right.

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,001
Ahh, now we will hear
what really happened.

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,248
Well, let's see.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,409
Belle, terrified
by the master's anger,

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,443
ran away
from the castle...

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,609
straight into
a pack of wolves.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
But the master saved her.

45
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,210
- They began to be friends.
- Ah-ah-ah.

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,561
That's where I came in.

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,370
- Where could he be?
- Goodness knows.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,801
We've searched
every last corner.

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,641
I'm beginning to think
he's not in the castle at all.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,002
Voila! There he is!

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,090
- Wonderful!
- No time to waste.

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,043
We must find a way
to get them together.

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,640
Let's go!
Love will not wait.

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,684
You really think she's the one?
Will she break the spell?

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,485
I knew it from the moment
I set eyes on her.

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,527
If anyone can reach the master,
Belle can. Such a kind soul.

57
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,041
And her looks don't hurt either.

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,527
Wait for me! Uh, eh.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,211
- Hi, Belle.
- Oh, hello.

60
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,891
Chip, do you know
what day it is?

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,402
Well, it's not Tuesday--

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,603
No, silly.
Today is December 24th.

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,203
- The day before Christmas.
- And what a beautiful day it is.

64
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,085
A wonderful day
for a morning stroll.

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,807
Yes, yes. Nothing starts the day like
a brisk walk around the grounds.

66
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,526
Yeah! or you could
go ice-skating.

67
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,768
Yes, fresh air, exercise.

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,042
In moderation, of course.

69
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,846
Come along, Belle dear.
The great outdoors awaits.

70
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,769
Yeah, let's go!

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,443
<i>Mer oi, monsieur.</i>

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,166
Oh. Good morning.

73
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,089
Huh?

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
Oh, dear.
Are you all right?

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,362
I fell and I landed
on my-- on, on the ice.

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,926
It's pretty slippery.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,249
Yes, it's slippery.

78
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,489
This is a perfect day
for skating.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,728
Come on.

80
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,850
Come on.

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,724
No.

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,370
- Go on, Master. It might be fun.
- Go for it!

83
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,130
- Come on!
- Not so fast.

84
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,724
Come on. Why don't you
try it like this?

85
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,368
One, two, three.
One, two, three. See? It's easy.

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,450
One, two, three.

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,690
One, two, three.

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,566
Yes, I think
this may work.

89
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,246
Bravo! Bravo! Encore!

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,730
Fife, you approve?

91
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,525
Oh, maestro,
it's magnificent!

92
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,849
Oh, come along.
It's merely an opera...

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,641
to bring the house down.

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,403
Is there a part
for a piccolo?

95
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,807
Absolutely.

96
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,008
Solo for Fife,
in B-flat.

97
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,920
- Ooh. I'd do anything for a solo.
- Yes.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,288
I know. Now, Fifey,

99
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,482
in the midst
of my crescendo...

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,888
I thought I heard merriment
outside the window.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,321
Have a little look-see,
will you?

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,211
Wow! Would you
look at that?

103
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,008
Well, I think I might. I'll
just pick myself up and-- Oh!

104
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,691
What's this?
Heavens, look.

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,246
I'm bolted to the wall!

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,443
Oh, right.

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,325
Urn, the master
is skating.

108
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,649
Skating? Why on earth
would he do a thing like that?

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,969
Probably because that
pretty girl is holding his hand.

110
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,447
- What? Belle?
- Hey.

111
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,485
Maybe if she falls in love with
him, the spell will be broken,

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,602
and we'll be human again!

113
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,409
Trust me, Fife.

114
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,808
Humanity is
entirely overrated.

115
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,446
Before the enchantment,
there was no need...

116
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,281
for my particular
brand of genius.

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,643
But now the master
needs my melodies...

118
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,082
to feed
his tormented soul.

119
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,124
I am his confidant...

120
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,846
and his best friend.

121
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,807
And I won't let some
peasant girl ruin it for me!

122
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,925
Fife, see to it that
this blossoming love...

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,486
withers on the vine.

124
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,843
Yes, Maestro Forte.

125
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,122
One, two, three.

126
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,005
One, two, three. One,
two, three. One, two, three.

127
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,043
I think I've got it!

128
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,727
Hey, down in front.
I wanna see.

129
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,127
Let me see.
I wanna see too!

130
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,763
- Quiet.
- Oh, this is very promising.

131
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,486
Ah, yes, there is
something in the air.

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,443
Could it be love?

133
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,403
Love?

134
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,089
I've got to stop them.

135
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,640
Help!

136
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,403
What's that
little toot up to?

137
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,000
Aah! Whoa!

138
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,562
Stop!

139
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,768
It's a Christmas angel, see?

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,562
This is no angel.

141
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,331
It's the shadow
of a monster.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,083
Oh, Forte is going to be
so proud of me.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,890
I don't know
why I bother.

144
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,122
Now he's worse
than ever.

145
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,005
Don't lose heart,
dearest.

146
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,886
I hate Christmas.

147
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,326
The music helps?

148
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,525
Your music is the only thing
that helps me forget.

149
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,881
Don't worry,
old friend.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,082
I'm here for you,

151
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
just as I have been,

152
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,883
just as I always will be.

153
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,882
Why is the beast
such a grump?

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,606
I don't know.
He's always like that.

155
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,008
- Even at Christmas?
- Yep.

156
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,566
Belle, what's Christmas?

157
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,286
Oh, Chip, you must know
about Christmas.

158
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,529
Stockings in front
of the fire? Tree?

159
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,722
Tinsel? Presents?

160
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,366
Presents?
Do I get one?

161
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,450
Of course. Everyone gets
a present on Christmas.

162
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,643
- Oh, even the master?
- Yes, even the master.

163
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,730
- What are you gonna get him?
- I don't really know him well enough...

164
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,002
to know what he would want.

165
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,045
- What would you want?
- Well, what I love most...

166
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,767
in the world are my books,
my stories.

167
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,928
Why don't you get
the master a story?

168
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,647
You're right, Chip.
A story.

169
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,525
When I get to know him

170
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,849
We'll find more things
to say

171
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,804
One day
I will reach him

172
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,208
There has to be a way

173
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,130
Everyone needs someone

174
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,528
He must need someone too

175
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,530
When I get
to know him better

176
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,008
Here's what
I will do

177
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,926
I'll read him stories

178
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,123
From picture books
all filled with wonder

179
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,244
Magic worlds
where the impossible

180
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,330
Becomes the everyday

181
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,330
We'll find
a mountaintop

182
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,410
And some moonbeams
to sit under

183
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,527
I'll lead because
I know the way

184
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,644
So much to discover

185
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,809
I do it all the time

186
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,969
I could live
inside bright pages

187
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,686
Where the words
all rhyme

188
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,531
We will slay the dragons

189
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,689
That still
follow him around

190
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,929
And he'll smile
Yes, he'll smile

191
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,964
As his dreams
leave the ground

192
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,050
Stories and stories

193
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,289
About mermaids, kings
and sunken treasure

194
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,244
Magic worlds
where the impossible

195
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,489
Becomes the everyday

196
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,729
I know a tiny place

197
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,049
Just a dot
too small to measure

198
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,003
I'll take him there

199
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,205
I know the way

200
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,403
Stories about heroes

201
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,842
Who overcame
their deepest sorrow

202
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,804
They'll put hope
into his heart again

203
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,083
He'll cherish every day

204
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,443
He'll find
a better world

205
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,723
And the strength
to face tomorrow

206
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,643
I'm sure that
when he knows the way

207
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,808
He'll want

208
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:39,931
To stay

209
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,484
Do you think the master
will like his gift?

210
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,525
- I do.
- So does this mean we're gonna have a Christmas?

211
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,563
Uh-huh. Absolutely.

212
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,682
Absolutely not.

213
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,723
Why not?

214
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,925
Out of the question. Not a chance.
Dream on. An impossibility. Forget it.

215
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,442
Aw, come on!

216
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,044
- Suck in that gut.
- Mon ami. Get with the spirit. Unwind.

217
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,130
- Oh, dear.
- Come on, love. Have a heart.

218
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,449
Yeah. Come on.

219
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,610
No, no, and-- let me think--

220
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,370
No!

221
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,290
This is where
I put my foot down.

222
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,880
Wait. Get outta-- Uh!

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,004
The master has
forbidden Christmas!

224
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,044
- Oh, dear me.
- Forbid Christmas?

225
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,561
No one can forbid Christmas.

226
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,523
He doesn't wish to be
reminded of his past,

227
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,201
and Christmas is
a most painful reminder of it.

228
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,005
I, for one,
do not wish to torture him.

229
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,646
I, for one, think a little Christmas
cheer would do him some good.

230
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,967
- Yeah.
- 0h? Hmm.

231
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,210
The girl is right.
It is up to us to do something.

232
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,324
Uh! It's not our place
to get involved.

233
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,047
No, no, no, no! We just can't
mind our own beeswax, can we?

234
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,404
Just have to stick our wick
where it doesn't belong.

235
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,563
- Oh, humiliating.
- Pish posh.

236
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,682
I think it's
a wonderful idea.

237
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,044
But the master doesn't want it.
His castle, his rules.

238
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,208
It's not fair.

239
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,120
He's right.
It's not fair!

240
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,447
Don't whine, glasses.

241
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,927
Sorry.

242
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,123
Look at us,
squabbling and bickering.

243
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,005
Breaks my heart
to see it, it does.

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,851
And we used to be
at our very best at Christmas.

245
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,965
Why, we used to prepare
a feast for the entire castle.

246
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,402
Ah, you could have
some stuffed turkey.

247
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,921
- Cranberry sauce.
- Shortbread cookies.

248
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,929
- Mince pies.
- Potatoes.

249
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,088
- Gravy.
- And Christmas pudding!

250
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,647
Uh, pudding?
With, with custard?

251
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,526
What do you think we are, barbarians?
Of course with custard.

252
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,211
And raisins
and brandy...

253
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,244
and all those things
you like.

254
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,091
- All right.
- Yes!

255
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,488
But if the master finds out
about this, he will be furious,

256
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,206
so, everybody, keep quiet.

257
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,130
Come on! What are we
waiting for, Christmas?

258
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,686
Good heavens, we don't have
much time. It's Christmas Eve!

259
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,407
- I'll see to the dinner.
- I'll get some mistletoe.

260
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,249
We need to brighten
this place up.

261
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,647
Belle, I know someone
who will help.

262
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,889
Now, now, wait for me. I'm
in charge here. I'm in charge.

263
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,003
Wait for me!

264
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,250
One-thousand one,
one-thousand two,

265
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,169
one-thousand three--

266
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,001
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

267
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,169
Oh, boy, there sure
are a lot of stairs here.

268
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,931
One-thousand seven,
one-thousand eight,

269
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,408
one-thousand nine,
one-thousand ten--

270
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,329
Hello?

271
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,408
Hello?

272
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,201
Do not be afraid,
mes amis.

273
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,245
It is I, Lumiere. We have come
to pay you a little visit.

274
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,042
- Lumiere?
- Angelique.

275
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,289
Ah, Lumiere,
finally.

276
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,609
I thought we were to be locked away
in this dusty attic forever.

277
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,200
Ah, Angelique,
mon amour.

278
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,640
Your eyes are still so lovely
after all these years.

279
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,683
Lumiere, please!

280
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,451
You'll tarnish
the halo.

281
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,087
Oh, yes.
This is Belle, our guest.

282
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,807
- Pleased to meet you.
- And this is Angelique.

283
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,888
She is the
castle decorator.

284
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,401
You mean was
the castle decorator.

285
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,967
I am not responsible
for this baroque atrocity.

286
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,048
When I was in charge,

287
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,881
the castle was full
of light and beauty.

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,924
Ah, but, cherie,
that is why we have come.

289
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,281
Gather around,
mes enfants.

290
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,930
We are planning the greatest
Christmas celebration ever.

291
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,131
- No, stop!
- What is it, cherie?

292
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,163
Why do you raise my hopes--

293
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,842
I, I mean, their hopes
only to have them dashed?

294
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,964
Well, no more.

295
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,642
But it's Christmas Eve. Without you, we'll
never get the castle decorated in time.

296
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,163
Ha! Christmas? Hmph!
I refuse to hope for it any more.

297
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,362
I will not
be disappointed again.

298
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,370
But this is to be the
greatest celebration ever.

299
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,562
We cannot do it
without you.

300
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,082
Well, but of course
you cannot.

301
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,170
Christmas takes planning
and organization.

302
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,444
No. No, I won't do it.
It won't change anything.

303
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,131
I believe it will.

304
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,290
There is more to

305
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,006
This time of year

306
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,488
Than sleigh bells
and holly

307
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,570
Mistletoe and snow

308
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,490
Those things come
and go

309
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,888
Much deeper than snow

310
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,530
Stronger than the
strongest love we'll know

311
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,611
We'll ever know

312
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,045
As long as
there's Christmas

313
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,085
I truly believe

314
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,171
That hope
is the greatest

315
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,729
Of the gifts
we'll receive

316
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,765
As long as
there's Christmas

317
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,726
We'll all be just fine

318
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,606
A star shines above us

319
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,725
Lighting your way
and mine

320
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,327
Just as long as there's Christmas
there will be Christmas pud

321
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,923
- Tons of turkey
- And cranberry sauce and mince pies if we're good

322
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,487
- Lots of logs on the fire
- Lots of gifts on the tree

323
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,807
All wrapped up
in red ribbons

324
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,763
Wonder if there's
one for me

325
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,044
We're due for a party
Where on earth do we start

326
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,767
I may wear my tiara
you brought me in Montmarte

327
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,848
All the silver
will sparkle

328
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,122
And the china
will gleam

329
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,040
And we'll be as shiny
as a brand-new centime

330
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,767
- After dinner we'll play games
- Till the morning breaks through

331
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,848
Then we'll meet
in the garden

332
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,566
- This is what we shall do
- We will build

333
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,127
We will build a snowman
that'll reach to the sky

334
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,450
It will stay up
until July

335
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,570
What are you doing?
Stop, stop, stop.

336
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,002
Put me down. Put me down.
Uh, this is ridiculous.

337
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,124
Everyone knows that
the lights go on first.

338
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,444
I don't want to go
all the way up there on the top.

339
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,962
As long as
there's Christmas

340
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,051
I truly believe

341
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,085
That hope is
the greatest

342
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,602
Of the gifts
we'll receive

343
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,805
As long as
there's Christmas

344
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,924
We'll all be just fine

345
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:06,288
There'll always
be Christmas

346
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,361
So there always
will be a time

347
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,289
When the world

348
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,165
ls filled with peace

349
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,650
And warmth

350
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,647
We're gonna have
the greatest Christmas ever.

351
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,650
Oh, I hope so, Chip.

352
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,365
You on the left,
you on the right, follow me.

353
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,721
There is decorating
to be done.

354
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,084
Yes, yes, yes, yes. But keep in mind,
the master mustn't find out.

355
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,721
Oooh, yes.

356
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,607
Christmas?
She's planning Christmas?

357
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,247
Yes. Awful, isn't it?

358
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,924
Perhaps she doesn't know
how I feel about Christmas.

359
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,042
But she does know.

360
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,721
She just doesn't care
like I do.

361
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,845
She's actually trying to bring
Christmas back to the castle.

362
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,249
And you know how much
we despise Christmas.

363
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,011
The day my life ended.

364
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,841
- Bring me my presents!
- Your Highness,

365
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,806
please accept this humble gift
as a token of our appreciation.

366
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,809
I know I speak
for everyone when--

367
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,163
Ah, just give it to me!

368
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,727
A storybook?
You call this a present?

369
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,684
I hope you have something
better for me, Forte.

370
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,043
Yes, sir.
Urn, of course, Master.

371
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,926
What is that?

372
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,089
A small piece
in your honour, Master.

373
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,444
Eeew! I hate it.
Forte, that stuff is gloomy.

374
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,441
Who disturbs my Christmas?

375
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,487
Please, take this rose...

376
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,764
in exchange for shelter
from the bitter cold.

377
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,729
I don't need a rose.

378
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,649
Go away,
you wretched old hag!

379
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,249
You have been deceived
by your own cold heart.

380
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,569
A curse upon your house
and all within it.

381
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,641
Until you have found one
to love you as you are,

382
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,129
you shall remain
forever a beast.

383
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,165
But we've come so far
since then.

384
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,887
We've risen above
the tragedy.

385
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,241
Where is she?

386
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,682
I believe she's gone
to the boiler room,

387
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,770
or so a little birdie
told me.

388
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,283
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Get outta the way.

389
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,641
We're workin' here.

390
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,003
- Excuse me.
- Let's go. Let's go.

391
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,126
All right, you guys. Now, get back to work.
The castle doesn't heat itself, you know.

392
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,040
Aye, gevault.
So, what can I do you for, lady?

393
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,448
- I'm looking for a log.
- All right. Logs we got.

394
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,325
What do you want? Hard wood?
Soft wood? We got it all.

395
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,442
We got birch, maple,
pine, oak--

396
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,403
Doi! Concrete.

397
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,490
My head. Don't worry.
It'll pass.

398
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,648
So, make up your mind
already.

399
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,491
Is it all right
if I just browse?

400
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,729
Suit yourself. Take your time.
Me, I got work to do.

401
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,249
Hey, what am I payin'
you for, being boring?

402
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,001
Do that on your own time.
Get outta here!

403
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,487
Yes.

404
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,489
Oh!

405
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,641
What are you hiding?

406
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,963
- It's a Yule log.
- Huh?

407
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,560
A-A Yule log.

408
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,967
It's a wonderful
tradition.

409
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,845
One log is chosen and everyone
in the house touches it...

410
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,008
and makes a Christmas wish.

411
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,723
Wishes are stupid.

412
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,571
You made a Christmas wish
last year.

413
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,002
Is this what
you wished for?

414
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,087
No.

415
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,241
But I will keep wishing.

416
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,331
- And when the log is burned on Christmas morning--
- There won't be no Christmas.

417
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,445
- But--
- No! I am the master here.

418
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,484
How can you be
so selfish?

419
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,206
You cannot possibly
understand.

420
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,847
You have no idea what
it's like to lose everything,

421
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,928
to be trapped
in your own castle,

422
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,361
to be, uh, uh, uh--

423
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,211
Prisoner?

424
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,290
The only one holding
us prisoner here is you.

425
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,368
Well, I'm not giving up.

426
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,689
Prisoner.

427
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,045
Hiya, Belle. You should
see the ballroom.

428
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,606
It's all decorated and pretty
and there's garlands everywhere.

429
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,883
I think the master's gonna be really
excited when he finds out about Christmas.

430
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,243
Well, he, he already knows.

431
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,125
Really?
Was he excited?

432
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,926
Actually, Chip,
he's forbidden it.

433
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,601
But I thought
he couldn't forbid Christmas.

434
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,521
You know, Chip, he can't.

435
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,961
We'll have Christmas
with or without him.

436
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,802
Hurray! Can we get a tree now, Belle?
It's the only thing we're missing.

437
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,163
All right, then.
Let's go get a tree.

438
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,248
But first--

439
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,331
Belle.
The master. Hurry.

440
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,289
What about this one?

441
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,845
Nah, too skinny.
Come on.

442
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,921
- Ohh, Lumiere.
- She's beautiful, no?

443
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,646
Yes, and I'm hideous.

444
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,842
Not to mention
ill-tempered.

445
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,123
What? What is that?

446
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,244
Ooh, it looks like
a Christmas present.

447
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,206
Oh-ho-ho.
It's for you, Master.

448
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,721
It's from a girl.

449
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,802
- Mrs Potts?
- No. From Belle.

450
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,489
Belle?

451
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,410
Uh-uh-uh. Master,
you can't open it.

452
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,727
Well, why not?
It's for me, isn't it?

453
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,842
Because it's
not yet Christmas.

454
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,804
Master, we all understand
how you feel about Christmas.

455
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,608
But when a woman gives a man a gift,
she's saying, "I care about you."

456
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,088
Hmm. But I don't
have a gift for her.

457
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,647
It is not too late.

458
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,685
Well, I guess I could
get her a little something.

459
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,286
Forte, stop the noise!

460
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,051
Noise? Noise?

461
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,323
This is my masterpiece.

462
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,283
Master.

463
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,846
I, I want you
to compose a song.

464
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,204
- It's a present for Belle.
- What? Belle?

465
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,800
And make it happy!

466
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,244
Oh, but happiness
is so depressing.

467
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,443
What's next?
Love songs?

468
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,723
Wedding marches?

469
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,561
It's all that girl's fault.

470
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,722
What about this one?

471
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,004
- Hmm, too wiggly
- Too wiggly-

472
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,286
Fife!
Pay attention.

473
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,849
I need you to pace when I think.
The girl is evil, I tell you.

474
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,042
She pulls him
from my grasp.

475
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,561
She fills his head
with dreams of love...

476
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,331
and hope and Christmas!

477
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,808
Well, what you gonna do?
You can't stop Christmas.

478
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,608
No, but I can stop
the girl.

479
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,683
Chip, this is
the last one.

480
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,521
That's not it. That's just
a weed wishing it was a tree.

481
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,042
Chip, we've looked
at every tree on the grounds.

482
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,606
But it's more
this way than that.

483
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,200
It will have to do.

484
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,291
- What a headache I have.
- I'm sorry.

485
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,209
L-- I'll get a saw.

486
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,483
No, that's fine. I don't want
I should put you out.

487
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,331
Oh, all right.

488
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,922
Do you have some oil? I just
thought a little massage--

489
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,771
But if it's no, it's no. Go on.
What are you waiting for?

490
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,087
Knock yourself out.

491
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,124
You never get headaches,
I guess. Lucky you.

492
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,084
- Really, I can get a saw.
- Who wants a saw?

493
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,602
I said go ahead with the whacking
and the hitting. Who's stopping you?

494
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,122
Shh. What is that?

495
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,640
It's beautiful.

496
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,651
And now for
a little Fife.

497
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,767
Sultan, wait!

498
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,329
Don't worry yourself about me.
I'll just sit here. Snow is fine.

499
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,442
A little wet,
but who's complaining?

500
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,088
Yes, my dear.
Come to me.

501
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,965
Come here, boy.
Come here.

502
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,609
Good doggy-
Nice doggy-

503
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,008
- Sultan?
- Back off, doggy.

504
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,442
Oh. Hello?

505
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,769
Hello?

506
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,724
Well, maybe there's
nobody here.

507
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,640
Maybe we should go.

508
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,809
What's the matter, Sultan?

509
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,085
Oh, hello. I don't believe
we've met. I-I'm Belle.

510
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,841
- And you are?
- Fife.

511
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,928
Down, boy, down.

512
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,202
We heard the most
beautiful music.

513
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,130
- Was it you?
- Me?

514
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,165
You thought
that was me?

515
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,806
Mademoiselle, please.

516
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,003
I am Maestro Forte,

517
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,170
court composer and
your most humble servant.

518
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,363
Pleased to meet you,
Monsieur Forte. I'm Belle.

519
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,530
Yes. The entire castle
is talking about you, child.

520
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,282
They say you're planning a
Christmas gala. Marvellous idea.

521
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,167
The very thing to shatter the
master's dark and gloomy past.

522
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,171
But you must make this
the grandest celebration ever.

523
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,884
- Have you gifts?
- Yep.

524
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,331
- Food?
- Yep.

525
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,044
- Garlands, ribbons, wreaths?
- Check.

526
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,367
Spangles and "fandangles"?

527
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,006
The trinkets, the trimmings,
the trappings?

528
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,602
- Yep, we got 'em all.
- A tree?

529
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,563
See, Belle?
I told ya.

530
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,523
Well, we found one.

531
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,689
But it was on the
piddlin' side of puny.

532
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,088
N-- But did you look
in the Black Forest?

533
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,567
There you will find
a tree...

534
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,843
better than any
you can dream of.

535
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,122
Better? We gotta go, Belle!

536
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,288
- We gotta!
- Chip, we can't.

537
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,247
L-I promised your master I wouldn't leave
the castle grounds. I gave my word.

538
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,490
Chin up, son.
There's a profound lesson here.

539
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,130
Keeping your word is much more important
than bringing joy to another.

540
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,447
You're twisting
what I said.

541
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,040
Not at all.
I agree with you.

542
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,085
Look after yourself.
Let the master do the same.

543
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,168
Never mind that the tree...

544
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,330
was always his favourite
part of Christmas.

545
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,126
Please, Belle? Please?

546
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,966
It looks dangerous.

547
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,482
Mademoiselle, you are
in more danger...

548
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,811
- in this very room, I assure you.
- All right.

549
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,729
- Yes!
- We'll take Phillipe.

550
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,286
If we hurry,
we can be back by nightfall.

551
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,246
<i>- Hurray'.
- Au revolt, Monsieur Forte.</i>

552
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,204
You'll keep my secret,
won't you?

553
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,527
Of course, mademoiselle.

554
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,610
The master will remain
completely in the dark.

555
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,529
Au revoir, Fife.

556
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,128
Fife! I want you
to follow her.

557
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,801
Make sure they don't
come back.

558
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,083
Oh, yeah, but, uh,
maestro, she's so nice.

559
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,248
When you're finished
fawning, Fife,

560
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,161
perhaps you can recommend
someone else to play your solo.

561
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,965
No! I'm going.
I'm going.

562
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,124
- Cogsworth!
- Oh, dear. Yes. Oh, oh, coming. Corning.

563
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,402
Cogsworth!

564
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,570
Running, running. Almost there.
You bellowed, sir?

565
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,570
Find Belle. I, uh--

566
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,605
Well, I--
She has to hear a song.

567
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,769
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir. Uh, uh, yes.

568
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,963
Splendid.
Yes, well-- Splendid.

569
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,966
Belle. Belle?

570
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,686
Where is she?
Belle?

571
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,041
Careful, careful.

572
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,767
Too fast!
Get out of the way! Stop!

573
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,167
Huh! Amateurs.

574
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,330
Belle? Here--
Excuse me. Hello?

575
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,489
Has anyone seen Belle?
I can't find her anywhere.

576
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,571
And the master is demanding to see her now.
He's got a song he wants her to hear.

577
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,409
C'est magnifique!

578
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,208
Last I saw of her, she was going with
Chip to look for a Christmas tree.

579
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,811
Right. We must conduct
a search of the grounds.

580
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,605
- Lumiere, you're with me.
- Cogsworth!

581
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,961
I'm waiting!

582
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,766
0h, dear. Uh, running, running, running.
I'm almost there, sir. Uh, uh--

583
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,486
Mrs Potts, stall the master.
All right, Lumiere, we're--

584
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,807
Lumiere?
Wait, I'm leading.

585
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,207
Me first,
you second.

586
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,801
Belle! Belle!
Where is she?

587
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,491
Belle? Belle?

588
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,409
Belle,
where are you?

589
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,000
Lumiere, wait.

590
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,645
The Black Forest!

591
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,127
Come along. Hurry now!

592
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,049
Oh, no.

593
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,731
This is catastrophic!

594
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,081
Cogsworth, quit dawdling.

595
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,328
I'm not dawdling.
I'm waddling.

596
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,809
Well, don't waddle then. We're
in a hurry, you lazy old clock.

597
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,123
Why am I still waiting?

598
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,323
- Mrs Potts!
- Corning, sir! Corning!

599
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,647
What a brisk day!

600
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,321
Why, you look positively
chilled to the bone.

601
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,329
Where's Belle?

602
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,161
How about a nice cup of tea,
sir? Just a spot.

603
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,047
Hmm. Forte,
play Belle's song!

604
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,330
Hot.

605
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,090
You're not singing!

606
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,961
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

607
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,321
Fa-la-la-la-la

608
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,727
- La-la-la-la
- Louder!

609
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,802
'Tis the season

610
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,130
- A bit more tea, sir? Good for the heart, you know.
- No, thank you.

611
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,322
- Just a spot?
- No more.

612
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,330
- Well, there's always room for tea, love.
- I said, "No more."

613
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,647
- Oh, dearie me!
- Mrs Potts,

614
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,570
are you trying
to distract me?

615
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,081
Goodness, no, sir.

616
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,249
Heavens. Is that a yellow-bellied,
double-breasted sapsucker?

617
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,523
- Rare this time of year.
- Enough! Where's Cogsworth?

618
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,563
- Where's Belle?
- Belle?

619
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,288
- We can't find her, sir.
- What?

620
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,846
Leave me!

621
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,767
Show me the girl.

622
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,087
- I will bring her back!
- No!

623
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,168
Urn, she's abandoned you.

624
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,489
Listen to your old friend,
won't you?

625
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,683
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Led you astray?

626
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,406
No. But the girl--

627
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,926
The quickest way
to break your heart

628
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,647
Make you depressed
and ill

629
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,765
ls to get tangled up
inside

630
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,441
The side effects
could kill

631
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,167
All passion
is a waste of time

632
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,966
A deadly game pour vous

633
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,165
I am your friend
Your cher ami

634
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,650
I wouldn't lie to you

635
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,809
If you must love someone
may I suggest

636
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,003
You love yourself
Just think it through

637
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,363
You'll never leave and you
will find you'll get more rest

638
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,848
You'll always feel
as good as new

639
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,691
Your freedom is the most
important thing, my friend

640
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,247
You must be strong
You mustn't bend

641
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,010
Don't talk for hours
Don't send flowers

642
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,168
Don't write poems
Don't sing songs and dance

643
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,851
Beneath the stars
that shine above

644
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,725
Don't fall in love

645
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,606
Oh, don't do it.

646
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,284
As soon as your heart
rules your head

647
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,609
Your life is not your own

648
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,361
It's hell when
someone's always there

649
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,326
It's bliss to be alone

650
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,126
And love of any kind
is bad

651
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,562
A dog, a child, a cat

652
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,208
They take up so much
precious time

653
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,370
Now, where's the sense
in that

654
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,609
Love takes the wildest heart
and makes it tame

655
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,200
If you're turned on
then just turn off

656
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,006
Emotions are a thing
all great men overcame

657
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,044
Please, don't make
this grande catastrophe

658
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,801
Don't get attached
to anyone or anything

659
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,730
There's nothing worse
than things that cling

660
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,683
You'll go to pot
You'll turn to drink

661
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,165
You'll never rest
You'll end up mad

662
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,841
And looking like
some poor demented dove

663
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,251
Don't fall in love

664
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,330
Don't fall in love!

665
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,250
No, no, no,
"0, "0, no, no.

666
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,364
They cannot mix bells
with holly.

667
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,927
Still, I have to admit,
not bad for amateurs.

668
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,649
I knew this was hopeless.

669
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,567
There. That's it!
That's it!

670
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,729
Oh, Chip, it's perfect.

671
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,570
- Do you see her?
- Not yet. Now, come along. Hurry!

672
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,730
You go on.
I'll never make it.

673
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,931
Save yourself.

674
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,761
- Ah, it will be summer before we reach them.
- What the--

675
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,450
<i>- Whoa'.
- Mons'.!</i>

676
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,040
Oh, dear!

677
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,051
Allez! Allez!
Faster! Faster!

678
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,367
I think we finally
found a use for you.

679
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,848
Clock boarding!
No, snow clocking!

680
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,725
Whatever!

681
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,891
- It's the best tree ever!
- Chip, you're right.

682
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,005
Merry Christmas!
And a happy Hanukkah!

683
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,363
We better hurry.
It's getting very stormy.

684
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,211
Again with the chopping.

685
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,724
Oh, I gotta do something.
Forte's counting on me.

686
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,841
Timber!

687
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,846
Take it away, Phillipe!

688
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,446
Oh, no!

689
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,248
- Fife?
- Uh, hi, Belle.

690
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,567
Uh, nice tree.

691
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,523
What are you doing
way out here?

692
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,530
Uh, nothin'.
I just was, uh, walkin'.

693
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,847
I mean, uh, I love
the bitter cold.

694
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,769
I mean, uh--

695
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,408
Phillipe!

696
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,248
Oh, no!

697
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,403
The tree, Belle!
We're gonna lose the tree!

698
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,568
Whoa !

699
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,241
Chip! Oh!
Where is he?

700
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,085
- Hold on, cherie. I will save you!
- Oh, dear!

701
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,921
Oh, no. Oh, gosh. Oh, no.
Oh, gosh. Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

702
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,611
Oh, no!

703
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,404
- Oh, Chip, thank goodness you're safe.
- I wasn't scared.

704
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,686
Oh, no! No!

705
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,089
Belle!

706
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,760
Oh, no, what have I done?

707
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,689
It's all my fault.

708
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,849
We all share
some blame, mon ami,

709
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,043
for daring to hope
for a Christmas.

710
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,563
You said you'd never leave.

711
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,925
I wasn't trying to leave.

712
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,771
I just wanted
to make you happy.

713
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,884
You broke your word.

714
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,291
And for that, you will rot
in this dungeon forever.

715
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,688
I should have known you'd
never be anything but a beast.

716
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,643
Midnight.

717
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,366
Merry Christmas,
Cogsworth.

718
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,211
If only it were.

719
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,250
Oh, my dear old friend,
I told you not to feel for her.

720
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:45,161
Things were so much simpler
before she came along,

721
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,922
before we dared to hope.

722
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,284
Oh, I thought
she was the one.

723
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,849
- Belle?
- Allo, cherie.

724
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,769
There she is.

725
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,727
- Merry Christmas.
- Doesn't look so special to me.

726
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,925
Oh, Chip, I'm sorry.

727
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,122
Nothing's changed.

728
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,641
I told you
nothing would change.

729
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,603
I told you the master
would not allow this.

730
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,009
I told you Christmas
was a hopeless folly!

731
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,441
But...

732
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,040
I was wrong.

733
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,161
When I felt lost

734
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,250
And lonely

735
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,491
Not a dream in my head

736
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,163
Your words
lifted my spirits

737
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,408
High

738
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,251
Remember what

739
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,967
You said

740
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:00,087
As long as
there's Christmas

741
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,967
I truly believe

742
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,570
That hope is the greatest

743
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:18,165
Of the gifts
we'll receive

744
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,682
- As long as
- As long as

745
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,883
Our guiding star

746
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,688
Shines above

747
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,122
There'll always be

748
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,327
Christmas

749
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,762
So there always

750
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,770
Will be a time

751
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,967
When the world
is filled with peace

752
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:58,964
And love

753
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,967
Ah, it tears me up
to see you this way, Master.

754
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,128
Why do you torment yourself?

755
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,164
There's the symbol
of your curse.

756
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,841
Destroy it, and end
these adolescent notions...

757
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,930
of love and redemption.

758
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,284
End your pain forever.

759
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,328
Yes! Do it!

760
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,568
Smash it!

761
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,924
Belle?

762
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,642
What are you doing?
What is it?

763
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,883
Oh, a storybook.

764
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,971
Does this one have
pretty pictures you can color?

765
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,367
Utterly dreadful, Master.

766
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,122
No! This one's different.
It's from Belle.

767
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,687
Well, that would account
for the creative wrapping.

768
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,488
Quiet! I want to read.

769
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,091
"Once upon a time,
there was an enchanted castle.

770
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,762
Its master seemed as cold as winter.
Deep inside his heart--

771
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,645
His cries of anger echoed through
the stone wall of the castle.

772
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,890
Though surrounded by servants,
he was all alone.

773
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,731
And in that
simple act of kindness,

774
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,320
he knew someone cared.

775
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,126
Christmas that year was spent
exchanging humble gifts.

776
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,323
But the greatest gift
that anyone received...

777
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,125
was the gift of hope.”

778
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,561
Hmm. Hope.

779
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,249
No, Master!
Come back!

780
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,523
She'll only prolong
your torment!

781
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,487
You know what, Belle? I don't need
a tree to celebrate Christmas.

782
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,446
And I can do
without mistletoe.

783
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,211
- Well, I don't need tinsel.
- Oh, I don't need holly.

784
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,561
- And I don't need a wreath.
- I don't need ornaments!

785
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,445
- And I don't need turkey!
- I don't need stuffing!

786
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,530
I don't need pudding!

787
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,564
To each his own, my friend
You know how to get me stressed

788
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,762
But when it comes to
making Christmas special

789
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,564
I'm a cut above
the rest

790
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,809
If you could see things clearly
you would say that I've been blessed

791
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,651
You can't hold a candle
to my timing

792
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,728
I'm a cut above
the rest

793
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,640
You belong side by side
You should never be apart

794
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,845
'Cause when you're both together
you're really twice as smart

795
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,884
"Twice as smart."
She does have a point.

796
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,129
Yes, well, two heads
are better than one.

797
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,164
They say that as a team
we have got to be the best

798
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,726
Now we found something
we both agree on

799
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,330
We're a cut above
the rest

800
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,728
There's no doubt that as a team
we two are the very best

801
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,842
Everyone who knows us
must agree

802
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,769
We're a cut above
the rest

803
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,009
There's no doubt that as a team
you two are the very best

804
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,487
Everyone who knows you
must agree

805
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,523
- We're a cut
- A cut above

806
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,768
Above the rest

807
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,007
Uh-oh! It's the master!

808
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,442
Uh, Belle--

809
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,727
Can you forgive me?

810
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,007
Of course.
Merry Christmas.

811
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,281
Let's give Belle the Christmas
she's always wanted.

812
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,000
So, Beast gets girl,

813
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,681
and it's a happy ending
for everyone.

814
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,690
Enchantment lifted,

815
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,441
and Forte fades
into the background.

816
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,487
No longer important.
No longer needed.

817
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,046
I think not!

818
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,048
What is it, Mama?
What's happening?

819
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,882
Watch out!

820
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,207
Forte!

821
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,482
- Whoa!
- Hurry, now. Hurry.

822
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,850
Can you believe
I never took a lesson?

823
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,722
Belle!

824
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,730
- Oh, no!
- Belle!
- Help!

825
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,682
Oh, no.

826
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,322
Maestro! Stop!

827
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,126
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't you see, Fife?

828
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,528
They can't fall in love
if they're dead.

829
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,531
I'll tell you what I see.
A big, old windbag!

830
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,206
You could've joined me, Fife,

831
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,041
but I see my triumph
is a solo act.

832
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,321
My solo-- It's blank!

833
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,805
So naive.

834
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,491
- No! N-N-No, no!
- You're second fiddle, Fife,

835
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,285
and that's all
you'll ever be.

836
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,607
Forte!

837
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,241
We can remain as we are...

838
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,840
forever and ever!

839
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,851
Forte!

840
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,649
Enough!

841
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,047
Heavens! Master.

842
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,931
You're not singing.

843
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,523
Careful.

844
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,123
Oh, no, the bell jar!

845
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,761
- Got it. Got it.
- Oh, careful.

846
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,531
Is this happy enough
for you, Master?

847
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:52,441
I know I'm downright giddy!

848
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,161
Master, the keyboard.

849
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,966
- You got it?
- Got it. Got it.

850
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,128
Whoa, whoo!

851
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,651
Ooh, help!

852
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,164
No!

853
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,287
Forte.

854
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,924
Oh, yes, it is lovely.

855
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,327
And you said it was impossible.

856
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,404
I said it was impossible
without me.

857
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,444
- Everyone, shh, shh, shh! Here they come.
- Wow!

858
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,402
The setting is perfect.

859
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,887
Oh, aren't they beautiful?

860
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,847
It's wonderful!

861
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,008
Hurray!

862
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,770
And what a wonderful
Christmas it was.

863
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,046
I suppose if anyone
saved Christmas, it was Belle.

864
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,481
Merry Christmas, one and all!

865
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,444
- Merry Christmas.
- And merry Christmas to you, sir.

866
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,961
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

867
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,482
I believe we have a little
something for you, Chip.

868
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,729
A present? Oh, boy! Thank you.

869
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,571
Open it!

870
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,241
Look, Mama! A storybook!
Would ya read it to me?

871
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,840
- I'd love to, son.
- Oh, boy!

872
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,649
Maestro?

873
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,242
- Yes, Master?
- Would you do us the honour, old friend?

874
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,488
I'd be delighted.

875
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,643
There is more

876
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,526
To this time of year

877
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,725
Than sleigh bells and holly

878
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,731
Mistletoe and snow

879
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,684
Those things

880
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,883
Will come and go

881
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,761
Don't look inside

882
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,644
A stocking

883
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,651
Don't look under the tree

884
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,526
The one thing
we're looking for

885
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,087
ls something we can't see

886
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,285
Far more precious than silver

887
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,291
And more splendid than gold

888
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,121
This is something to treasure

889
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,768
But it's something
we can't hold

890
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,123
Oh, as long as

891
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,083
There's Christmas

892
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,966
I truly believe

893
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,880
That hope is the greatest

894
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,482
Of the gifts we'll receive

895
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,046
We'll receive

896
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,605
As we all pray together

897
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,247
It's a time to rejoice

898
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,524
And though we
may look different

899
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,884
We'll all sing
with one voice

900
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,280
As long as there's Christmas

901
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,086
I truly believe

902
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,000
That hope is the greatest

903
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,011
Of the gifts we'll receive

904
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,841
As long as there's Christmas

905
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,851
We'll all be just fine

906
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,760
A star shines above us

907
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,769
Lighting your way

908
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,043
And mine

909
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,169
Light my way

910
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,886
You know I will

911
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,565
As long as there's Christmas

912
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,526
I truly believe

913
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,531
That hope is the greatest

914
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,486
Of the gifts we'll receive

915
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:54,083
As long as our guiding star

916
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,443
Shines above

917
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,690
There'll always be Christmas

918
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,245
So there always
will be a time

919
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,410
When the world
is filled with peace

920
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,763
And love
