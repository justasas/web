1
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:57,252
<i>Ah, there it is. My house.</i>

2
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:01,558
<i>And good old Cleveland Street.
How could I ever forget it?</i>

3
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:05,128
<i>And there I am,
with that dumb round face and...</i>

4
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,028
<i>that stupid stocking cap.</i>

5
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:10,835
<i>But no matter. Christmas was on its way.</i>

6
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:13,935
<i>Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas...</i>

7
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>around which the entire kid year revolved.</i>

8
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:44,502
<i>Downtown Hohman was prepared
for its yearly bacchanalia of...</i>

9
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:47,234
<i>peace on earth and good will to men.</i>

10
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:40,895
<i>Higbees' corner window
was traditionally a high-water mark...</i>

11
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,959
<i>of the pre-Christmas season.</i>

12
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:48,538
<i>First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff,
jostled in wonderment...</i>

13
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:52,444
<i>before a golden tinkling display...</i>

14
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,909
<i>of mechanized, electronic joy.</i>

15
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:42,296
<i>Wow, there it is.</i>

16
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:45,803
<i>The holy grail of Christmas gifts.</i>

17
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:48,773
<i>The Red Ryder 200-shot range model...</i>

18
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:50,002
<i>air rifle.</i>

19
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,879
<i>And there he is.</i>

20
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,870
<i>Red Ryder himself.</i>

21
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:59,616
<i>In his hand was the knurled stock
of as coolly deadly-looking...</i>

22
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:03,680
<i>a piece of weaponry
as ever I had laid eyes on.</i>

23
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:12,390
<i>For weeks, I had been scheming
to get my mitts on one of these...</i>

24
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,197
<i>fearsome blue-steel beauties.</i>

25
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:19,636
<i>My fevered brain seethed
with the effort of trying to come up with...</i>

26
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:23,577
<i>the infinitely subtle devices
necessary to implant...</i>

27
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,844
<i>the Red Ryder range model
air rifle indelibly...</i>

28
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,516
<i>into my parents' subconscious.</i>

29
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:30,753
Ralphie!

30
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,256
Randy!

31
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,254
Down here in two minutes!

32
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,627
And I mean two minutes!

33
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,162
Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!

34
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:46,802
Cut it out.

35
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:15,798
<i>My mother, grabbing for her copy
of Look magazine...</i>

36
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:20,504
<i>would find herself cleverly trapped
into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.</i>

37
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:25,745
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.

38
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,542
What's that?

39
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,848
Well, for Christ's sake,
the Sox traded Bullfrog...

40
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,047
the only player they've got,
for Shottenhoffer.

41
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,749
"Four Eyes" Shottenhoffer,
a utility infielder.

42
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:38,984
Got a whole goddamned team
of utility infielders.

43
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,461
That's nice.

44
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,530
Ralphie, on the double!

45
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,397
Did you hear about this guy
who swallowed a yo-yo?

46
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:49,166
- Swallowed a yo-yo?
- On a bet.

47
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,765
Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.

48
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:55,841
They write the silliest things
in the newspapers.

49
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:58,875
What do you mean, silly?
I mean that's real news.

50
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,077
That's not like that politics slop.

51
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:06,851
What is the name
of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

52
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,356
Victor. His name is Victor.

53
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:12,755
- How the hell did you know that?
- Everybody knows that.

54
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:17,062
That's another one of your silly puzzles?

55
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,602
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.

56
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:23,040
Could be worth $50,000.

57
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,941
What kind is it this time?

58
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,508
Name the great characters
in American literature.

59
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:33,743
Victor?
The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

60
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:37,254
<i>Meanwhile, I struggled
for exactly the right BB gun hint.</i>

61
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,758
<i>It had to be firm, but subtle.</i>

62
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:42,020
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears
near Pulaski's candy store.

63
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:51,771
<i>They looked at me as if
I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.</i>

64
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:56,609
<i>I could tell that I was in imminent danger
of over-playing my hand.</i>

65
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:59,348
<i>Casually, I switched tactics.</i>

66
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,109
Hey, Dad!

67
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:05,684
I'll bet you'll never guess
what I got you for Christmas.

68
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:08,556
A new furnace.

69
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:11,953
That's a good one, Dad.

70
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:16,595
<i>My old man was one
of the most feared furnace-fighters...</i>

71
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,432
<i>in northern Indiana.</i>

72
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:21,534
Hurry up,
you're going to be late for school.

73
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,207
Yeah. I'm running late already.

74
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,001
<i>Round one was over.</i>

75
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,005
<i>Parents, one.</i>

76
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,206
<i>Kids, zip.</i>

77
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,617
<i>I could feel the Christmas noose
beginning to tighten.</i>

78
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,923
<i>Maybe what happened next
was inevitable.</i>

79
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,584
Ralphie, what would you like
for Christmas?

80
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,922
<i>Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.</i>

81
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,056
I want an official Red Ryder carbine action
200-shot range model air rifle.

82
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,235
No. Shoot your eye out.

83
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:53,070
<i>Oh, no! It was
the classic mother-BB gun block.</i>

84
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,033
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out."</i>

85
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:58,906
<i>That deadly phrase uttered
many times before by hundreds...</i>

86
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,982
<i>of mothers was not surmountable...</i>

87
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,075
<i>by any means known to kid-dom.</i>

88
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:07,053
<i>But such was my mania,
my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...</i>

89
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:10,421
<i>that I immediately began
to rebuild the dike.</i>

90
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:14,623
I was just kidding.
Even though Flick is getting one.

91
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:16,732
I'd just like some Tinkertoys.

92
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
<i>I couldn't believe my own ears.
Tinkertoys?</i>

93
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:20,902
<i>She'd never buy it.</i>

94
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:23,169
BB guns are dangerous.

95
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,833
I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.

96
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:34,549
Randy, will you eat?
There are starving people in China.

97
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:46,659
<i>Mothers know nothing
about creeping marauders...</i>

98
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,824
<i>burrowing through the snow
toward the kitchen...</i>

99
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:52,429
<i>where only you, and you alone,
stand between your tiny...</i>

100
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:55,336
<i>huddled family and insensate evil.</i>

101
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:06,448
Save us, Ralphie!
I just knew those bad guys...

102
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:08,956
would be coming for us in the end!

103
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:13,089
Don't worry, Dad.
As long as I got OI' Blue...

104
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,199
What've we got here, folks?

105
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,204
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.

106
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,836
Well, just me and my trusty old...

107
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:28,638
Red Ryder carbine-action
200-shot range model air rifle.

108
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:31,706
Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.

109
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:34,179
Well, I think I better have a look here.

110
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:49,293
Oh, no!

111
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:52,066
It's OI' Blue!

112
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:53,771
Oh, no!

113
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,166
Cheese it, boys!

114
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,952
There's another one!
He's a dead-eye, ain't he?

115
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,725
Okay, Ralphie!

116
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:23,896
You win this time, but we'll be back!

117
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,310
<i>Adiós, Bart.</i>

118
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:34,676
But if you do come back,
you'll be pushing up daisies!

119
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:41,090
And don't you forget it!

120
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:42,716
<i>Well, son, you saved us!</i>

121
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,819
<i>We were goners for sure!
And you saved us!</i>

122
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,670
Oldsmobile!

123
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:57,598
A pile of junk!

124
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:01,039
That goddamned Olds is froze up again!

125
00:11:01,113 --> 00:11:05,914
<i>Some men are Baptists, others Catholics.
My father was an Oldsmobile man.</i>

126
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:10,279
That son of a bitch would freeze up
in the middle of summer on the Equator!

127
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:13,319
- Little pitchers...
- Hold it!

128
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:28,231
It's a clinker!

129
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:32,171
That blasted, stupid furnace.

130
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:33,578
Dadgummit!

131
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,310
Damn skates!

132
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:45,421
For Christ's sake,
open up the damper, will you?

133
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,191
Who the hell turned it
all the way down again?

134
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:50,189
Blasted!

135
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:04,576
<i>In the heat of battle,
my father wove a tapestry of obscenity...</i>

136
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:09,185
<i>that as far as we know is still hanging
in space over Lake Michigan.</i>

137
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,999
<i>Preparing to go to school
was like getting ready...</i>

138
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,536
<i>for extended deep-sea diving.</i>

139
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:48,928
- Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!
- Just wait, Ralph!

140
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:52,725
<i>My kid brother looked like
a tick about to pop.</i>

141
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:53,597
What?

142
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:55,633
What is it?

143
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:58,266
What is it?

144
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:05,544
- What is it?
- I can't put my arms down!

145
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:19,687
Well, put your arms down
when you get to school.

146
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,153
Hey, Flick! Wait up.

147
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,526
Wait up!

148
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,291
So what are you doing?

149
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,969
What does it look like I'm doing?
Picking goobers?

150
00:13:57,205 --> 00:14:00,606
Hey, listen, smart ass.
I asked my old man about sticking...

151
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,075
your tongue to metal light poles
in winter...

152
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:06,545
and he says it will freeze right to the pole
just like I told you.

153
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:07,805
Baloney.

154
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:09,851
What would your old man know
about anything?

155
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,217
He knows because he once saw a guy
stick his tongue...

156
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:15,883
to a railroad track on a bet
and the fire department had to come...

157
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,827
to get the guy's tongue off the track
because he couldn't get it off.

158
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:21,659
Come on, guys, wait up!

159
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:23,221
Come on, guys!

160
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,930
Come on, guys, wait up!

161
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:32,574
I can't get up!

162
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:35,641
I can't get up!

163
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:36,645
Help!

164
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:40,346
I can't get out! Help me!

165
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:43,414
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.

166
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:45,319
I can't get up!

167
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:49,590
Come on.

168
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:51,993
Get up. Sit up. Come on.

169
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,266
You're okay. Come on, let's go.

170
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:56,666
Come on, you're all right!

171
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:06,880
Miss Shields!

172
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:08,939
All right, everyone...

173
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:10,677
take your seats, please.

174
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,524
Good morning, class.

175
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:23,928
Good morning, Miss Shields.

176
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:01,171
Open your books to Page 32.

177
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,107
And as you'll remember, Silas Marner...

178
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:17,215
You're full of beans and so's your old man.

179
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:20,621
- Says who?
- Says me.

180
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,594
Well, I double-dare you.

181
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:25,257
<i>The exact exchange and nuance...</i>

182
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,857
<i>of phrase in this ritual is very important.</i>

183
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,663
Are you kidding?
Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?

184
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:32,740
That's dumb.

185
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,776
That's 'cause you know it will stick!

186
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,468
You're full of it.

187
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:39,139
Well, I double dog-dare you!

188
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:42,912
<i>Now it was serious. A double dog-dare.</i>

189
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,580
<i>What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?</i>

190
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,213
<i>And finally,
the coup de grâce of all dares...</i>

191
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,691
<i>the sinister triple dog-dare!</i>

192
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:53,854
I triple dog-dare you!

193
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,333
<i>Schwartz created
a slight breach of etiquette...</i>

194
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:01,063
<i>by skipping the triple-dare
and going right for the throat.</i>

195
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:02,469
All right, all right.

196
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:15,516
- Go on, smart ass, and do it!
- I'm going!

197
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:20,249
<i>Flick's spine stiffened,
his lips curled in a defiant sneer.</i>

198
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:22,761
<i>There was no going back now.</i>

199
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:27,390
This is nothing.

200
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,398
Stuck? Stuck!

201
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:35,566
Stuck! Stuck!

202
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:42,574
Jeez!

203
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:44,150
It really works!

204
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:45,651
Look at him!

205
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:57,397
Ralphie, come back!

206
00:17:57,466 --> 00:18:00,868
- Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!
- But the bell rang!

207
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:04,496
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know! The bell rang!

208
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:15,947
Where's Flick?

209
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,019
Has anyone seen Flick?

210
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,919
<i>Flick? Flick who?</i>

211
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:23,119
He was at recess, wasn't he?

212
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:27,254
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?

213
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:36,306
I said has anyone seen Flick?

214
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:40,305
Yes, Esther Jane?

215
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:47,978
Oh, my God!

216
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:11,335
Holy cow, it's the fire department!

217
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:20,184
Wow, it's the cops!

218
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,708
Now, I know that some of you
put Flick up to this.

219
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,981
But, he has refused to say who.

220
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:27,221
But those who did it know their blame.

221
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:32,425
And I'm sure the guilt you feel...

222
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:36,628
is far worse than any punishment
you might receive.

223
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:43,071
Now, don't you feel terrible?

224
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:47,014
Don't you feel remorse
for what you have done?

225
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,184
That's all I'm going to say
about poor Flick.

226
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:58,685
<i>Adults love to say things like that.
But kids know better.</i>

227
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:02,598
<i>We knew darn well
it was always better not to get caught.</i>

228
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:05,966
Now, boys and girls,
I'm going to give you an assignment.

229
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,867
I want you to write...

230
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:11,137
a theme.

231
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:17,046
"What I want for Christmas."

232
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:19,908
<i>The clouds lifted.</i>

233
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:22,854
And I want it handed in
tomorrow morning...

234
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:26,017
<i>I saw a faint gleam of light
at the other end of...</i>

235
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:27,958
<i>the black cave of doom.</i>

236
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:32,056
<i>I knew that when Miss Shields
read my magnificent, eloquent theme...</i>

237
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,932
<i>that she would sympathize
with my plight...</i>

238
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,200
<i>and everything would work out, somehow.</i>

239
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:56,025
Boy, did you see how it stuck?

240
00:21:56,593 --> 00:21:59,824
- Did it hurt, Flick?
- No. I never felt a thing.

241
00:21:59,897 --> 00:22:01,524
It just caught me off-guard.

242
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:04,226
- You sure were bawling.
- I never bawled!

243
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:05,836
Baloney.

244
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,542
Scut Farkus!

245
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:24,748
<i>Scut Farkus! What a rotten name.
We were trapped.</i>

246
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:27,726
<i>There he stood, between us and the alley.</i>

247
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:30,854
<i>Scut Farkus, staring out at us
with his yellow eyes.</i>

248
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:34,429
<i>He had yellow eyes!
So help me God, yellow eyes.</i>

249
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,648
<i>Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady.</i>

250
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,211
<i>Mean. Rotten.</i>

251
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,689
<i>His lips curled over his green teeth.</i>

252
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,192
<i>Randy lay there like a slug.</i>

253
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:01,321
<i>It was his only defense.</i>

254
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:08,296
- Say "uncle."
- Uncle!

255
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,174
Louder!

256
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:22,018
<i>In our world, you were
either a bully, a toady...</i>

257
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:24,749
<i>or one of the nameless rabble of victims.</i>

258
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,016
All right.

259
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:27,782
Who's next?

260
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:54,949
<i>In the jungles of kid-dom,
the mind switches gears rapidly.</i>

261
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:57,850
<i>Weeks ago I had sent away
for my Little Orphan Annie...</i>

262
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:59,951
<i>secret society decoder pen.</i>

263
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:02,195
<i>Oh, skunked again.</i>

264
00:24:02,263 --> 00:24:04,891
<i>No matter. Today I had serious work to do.</i>

265
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:07,695
"What I want for Christmas."

266
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,898
"What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun
with a compass in the stock...

267
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:12,838
"and this thing which tells time."

268
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:14,407
Wow, that's great.

269
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:17,502
"I think that everybody should have
a Red Ryder BB gun.

270
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,479
"They're very good for Christmas.

271
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,610
"I don't think that a football's
a very good Christmas present."

272
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,913
<i>Oh, rarely had the words poured
from my penny pencil...</i>

273
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:29,789
<i>with such feverish fluidity.</i>

274
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,758
I've won! I've won!

275
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,208
<i>The Bumpus hounds.</i>

276
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,178
<i>Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses,
had at least...</i>

277
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:55,117
<i>785 smelly hound dogs.</i>

278
00:24:55,722 --> 00:24:59,488
<i>And they ignored every other human being
on earth but my old man.</i>

279
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:03,760
I won!

280
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,159
I won!

281
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,428
- What?
- A major prize!

282
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:10,663
I won!

283
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:14,499
Hey, look at that. Look at that.
A Western Union telegram.

284
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:17,773
<i>Tonight, he's coming tonight.
Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!</i>

285
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:19,507
What does this mean here?

286
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:21,377
It means it's coming tonight!

287
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:23,383
I called Ernie McClosky
at the freight depot.

288
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:26,285
He said the telegram was late,
the prize was already there...

289
00:25:26,355 --> 00:25:28,550
he was going to send it on tonight.

290
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:32,058
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me.
It's my gift.

291
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:37,430
You know, maybe it'll be one of those
Spanish adobe houses down in Coral...

292
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:44,172
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.

293
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:46,435
Or it could be a bowling alley.

294
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:49,206
A guy down in Terre Haute
won a bowling alley.

295
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,077
How are they going to deliver
a bowling alley here tonight?

296
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,917
They could send the deed,
for cripesake. I mean...

297
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,555
I didn't expect they were going
to send the whole damn bowling alley.

298
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,458
Yeah, well. How about eating?
I'm starving to death.

299
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,458
Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.

300
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,534
<i>Every family has a kid who won't eat.</i>

301
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,937
<i>My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily
in over three years.</i>

302
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:25,150
Oh, Randy, don't play
with your food, eat it!

303
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:30,387
Starving people would be happy
to have that.

304
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,488
Can I have some more red cabbage?

305
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:42,632
Stop playing with your food,
or I'll give you something to cry about.

306
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,235
You better stop fooling around with it
and eat it or you'll be sorry.

307
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:52,979
Can I please have some more?

308
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,577
<i>My mother had not had a hot meal
for herself in 15 years.</i>

309
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:01,782
Meatloaf, double beetloaf.

310
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:03,984
I hate meatloaf.

311
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:07,754
All right. I'll get that kid to eat.

312
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,929
Where's my screwdriver
and plumber's helper?

313
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:12,367
I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.

314
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:14,696
<i>My mother was more subtle.</i>

315
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,505
How do the little piggies go?

316
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:20,644
That's right. Oink, oink.

317
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:24,045
Now, show me how the piggies eat.
This is your trough.

318
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,118
Show me how the piggies eat.

319
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,354
Be a good boy.
Show Mommy how the piggies eat.

320
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,350
Oh, my.

321
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:02,792
Mommy's little piggy.

322
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:24,546
It's here.

323
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:33,054
Are you Parker?

324
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,719
- All right, sign here.
- Yeah. Well, what is it?

325
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:37,056
I don't know.

326
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,788
What's in it?

327
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:40,730
Here. Bring it in.

328
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,200
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.
Move your tails.

329
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:46,762
Bring it right on in. Right here.
Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.

330
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:47,965
That's right.

331
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:50,234
Right.

332
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,108
Here, bring it right in, fellas.
That's it. Here we go.

333
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,307
A little more. Little more.

334
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:56,407
That's it.

335
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:00,882
Watch the lady.

336
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,293
Thanks a lot, guys.

337
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:12,698
Merry Christmas.

338
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:15,669
Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.
Go on.

339
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,265
"Fra-gi-ley."

340
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:22,809
- That must be Italian.
- I think that says "fragile."

341
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:24,638
Oh, yeah.

342
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:27,415
Here we go.

343
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,420
They did a job on this, you know?

344
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,998
No, here, Ralph, hold this.

345
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:53,470
There could be anything in there!

346
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:54,706
Jesus!

347
00:29:57,717 --> 00:29:59,048
Maybe they forgot.

348
00:29:59,285 --> 00:30:02,119
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.

349
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,262
- Would you look at that?
- What?

350
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:13,698
Would you look at that?

351
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:17,794
What is it?

352
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,905
It's a leg!

353
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,501
But what is it?

354
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:23,845
Well, it's a leg.

355
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,579
You know, like in a statue.

356
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:28,139
- Statue?
- Yeah, statue!

357
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,479
Yeah, statue!

358
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,210
Ralphie!

359
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:36,592
<i>My mother was trying to insinuate herself
between us and the statue.</i>

360
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,852
Holy smoke, would you...

361
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:40,897
Do you know what this is?

362
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,432
This is a lamp.

363
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:46,332
<i>It was indeed a lamp.</i>

364
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:49,271
Isn't that great? What a great lamp!

365
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:52,138
I don't know.

366
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:55,671
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.

367
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,447
<i>The old man's eyes boggled...</i>

368
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,175
<i>overcome by art.</i>

369
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:03,220
I know just the place for it.

370
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:06,280
Right in the middle
of our front room window!

371
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:26,943
Jesus, God.

372
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:33,216
- Honey?
- No. It's all right.

373
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,557
Let's see...

374
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:41,295
This goes to the radio
and this goes to the...

375
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,889
Well, it's just one too many.

376
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:49,860
Well, let's see.

377
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:53,171
<i>The snap of a few sparks,
a quick whiff of ozone...</i>

378
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:56,701
<i>and the lamp blazed forth
in unparalleled glory.</i>

379
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:59,438
Look at that! Will you look at that?

380
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,811
Isn't that glorious?

381
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:07,349
It's indescribably beautiful.
It reminds me of the Fourth of July!

382
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:09,160
Turn off all the lights.

383
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,161
I wanna see what it looks like
from the street.

384
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,027
- I'll go get the dining room.
- Couldn't we talk this over?

385
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:37,920
Move it a little bit to the right.
A little that way.

386
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:42,220
Just a little... More to the right.

387
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:45,288
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!

388
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:47,663
Right there. That's wonderful.

389
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:49,428
Parker, what is that?

390
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:51,405
Don't bother me now.
Can't you see I'm busy?

391
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:54,269
- Yeah, but what is that?
- It's a major award.

392
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:56,675
A major award?

393
00:32:57,713 --> 00:33:00,274
Shucks, I wouldn't have known that.
It looks like a lamp.

394
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,751
It is a lamp, you nincompoop.
But it's a major award.

395
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,082
I won it.

396
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:08,052
- Damn, hell, you say you won it?
- Yeah.

397
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:10,887
Mind power, Sweed, mind power.

398
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:13,726
<i>The entire neighborhood was turned on.</i>

399
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:16,698
You should see what it looks like
from out here!

400
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:19,836
<i>It could be seen
up and down Cleveland Street.</i>

401
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:21,873
<i>The symbol of the old man's victory.</i>

402
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:24,168
Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.

403
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:27,734
Isn't it about time
for somebody's favorite radio program?

404
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,746
<i>Holy smokes, it was 6:45.</i>

405
00:33:31,883 --> 00:33:34,045
<i>Only one thing that
could've dragged me away...</i>

406
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,113
<i>from the soft glow of electric sex
gleaming in the window.</i>

407
00:33:50,537 --> 00:33:52,835
<i>Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.</i>

408
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,569
<i>Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.</i>

409
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,508
<i>I could still taste it.</i>

410
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:01,044
Hey, you turned the light off!

411
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:21,170
<i>I knew I was handing Miss Shields
a masterpiece.</i>

412
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:24,939
<i>Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy,
would excuse me from theme writing...</i>

413
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:27,568
<i>for the rest of my natural life.</i>

414
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:37,048
You call this a paragraph?

415
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:41,620
Margins! Margins! "F"!

416
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:45,359
My life's work down the drain.

417
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:48,163
A semicolon, you dolt!

418
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,325
A period.

419
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:50,398
"F"!

420
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:54,939
Oh, I should weep
if I have to read one more "F"!

421
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:58,134
Ralphie Parker.

422
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:16,423
The theme I've been waiting for all my life.

423
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,456
Listen to this sentence.

424
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:23,237
"A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass
in the stock...

425
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:27,203
"and this thing which tells time."

426
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:30,506
Poetry.

427
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:32,046
Sheer poetry.

428
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:35,613
Ralph, an "A+."

429
00:35:36,086 --> 00:35:37,644
My Ralph!

430
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:40,890
Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.

431
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:44,225
"A+"!

432
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:24,160
Is there something you want, Ralph?

433
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,467
I'm just turning in my theme.

434
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,306
Well, you can take your seat now.

435
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:35,543
Take your seat.

436
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:55,666
Come on, you guys.

437
00:37:01,478 --> 00:37:03,379
Get in the car. Get in the car.

438
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:07,446
If we don't hurry
we're going to miss all the good trees!

439
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:13,081
<i>My mother was about to make
another brilliant maneuver...</i>

440
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:16,160
<i>in the legendary battle of the lamp.</i>

441
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:21,130
<i>The epic struggle which followed lives
in the folklore of Cleveland Street...</i>

442
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:22,530
<i>to this very day.</i>

443
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:25,400
Don't want to waste electricity.

444
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,334
"Don't want to waste electricity."

445
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:30,134
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.

446
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:37,842
You folks looking for a tree?
We got 300 trees.

447
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:41,184
This is the Christmas tree emporium
of the entire Midwest.

448
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:44,782
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree
than this here tree.

449
00:37:45,193 --> 00:37:47,252
This here tree is built to last.

450
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:49,159
Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.

451
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,562
Okay. Now here's a tree.

452
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:56,501
This here is a tree.

453
00:37:56,605 --> 00:38:00,975
- That's a little skimpy in the front.
- Well, you just put it in the corner.

454
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:04,773
- Haven't you got a big tree?
- Hell, this ain't no tree.

455
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:07,715
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.

456
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:12,982
- Wait'll the dogs see that one.
- Don't you think it's a little large?

457
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,356
Listen, Christmas only comes
once a year. Why not?

458
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,625
- How much?
- I'll knock off $2...

459
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,823
because I can see you're a man
who knows his trees.

460
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:24,299
This isn't one of those trees
that all the needles falls off, is it?

461
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,097
No, that's them balsams.

462
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,900
<i>The old man loved bargaining
as much as an Arab trader...</i>

463
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,703
<i>and he was twice as shrewd.</i>

464
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,176
You know, Dew Lock just bought
one of those brand new...

465
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,474
green plastic trees.

466
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,110
Darn thing looks like it was made out of...

467
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,652
green pipe cleaners.

468
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:44,382
This is a very nice tree.

469
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,992
I'll throw in some rope
and tie it to your car for you.

470
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,527
You got a deal.

471
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:49,559
Deal.

472
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:11,146
Damn it. Blow out!

473
00:39:19,596 --> 00:39:21,154
Not again.

474
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:23,798
Four minutes!

475
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:25,391
Time me.

476
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:28,368
<i>Actually, my old man loved it.</i>

477
00:39:28,472 --> 00:39:31,771
<i>He always saw himself in the pits
at the Indianapolis Speedway...</i>

478
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:32,865
<i>in the 500.</i>

479
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:40,851
<i>My old man's spare tires
were actually only tires...</i>

480
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:42,113
<i>in the academic sense.</i>

481
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:44,881
<i>They were round.
They had once been made of rubber.</i>

482
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:52,423
Ralphie, why don't you
go help your father?

483
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:54,492
- Really? Can I?
- Yes.

484
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,969
- Watch the traffic, there.
- Okay.

485
00:39:57,804 --> 00:40:00,329
<i>It was the first time that
it had been suggested that...</i>

486
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:02,773
<i>I go help my father with anything.</i>

487
00:40:06,981 --> 00:40:09,677
- What are you doing here?
- Mom says I should help.

488
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:13,879
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.

489
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:16,053
Yeah, that's it.

490
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:18,054
Here. Hold this.

491
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,223
No, not that way.
Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.

492
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:26,233
- How?
- Like this.

493
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:28,202
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.

494
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,262
There's four of them. And we got it!

495
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,109
There it is.

496
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:38,542
That son of a gun.
I'm gonna get that dirty...

497
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:39,779
There we go.

498
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:43,350
<i>For one brief moment
I saw all the bolts silhouetted...</i>

499
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,946
<i>against the lights of the traffic.
And then they were gone.</i>

500
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,821
Oh, fudge!

501
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:55,431
<i>Only I didn't say "fudge."</i>

502
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,365
<i>I said the word.</i>

503
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:00,800
<i>The big one.
The queen mother of dirty words.</i>

504
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,540
<i>The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.</i>

505
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:05,509
What did you say?

506
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:11,144
That's what I thought you said.

507
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,417
Get in the car.

508
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:19,349
Go on.

509
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:21,691
<i>It was all over. I was dead.</i>

510
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:24,557
<i>What would it be?
The guillotine? Hanging?</i>

511
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:27,533
<i>The chair? The rack?
The Chinese water torture?</i>

512
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:32,029
<i>Mere child's play
compared to what surely awaited me.</i>

513
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:37,140
Everything go all right?

514
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:53,557
Eight minutes.

515
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:59,199
- Do you know what your son just said?
- No. What?

516
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,235
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!

517
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,638
Ralphie!

518
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:11,648
<i>Over the years,
I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.</i>

519
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,949
<i>My personal preference is for Lux,
but I found Palmolive had a nice...</i>

520
00:42:16,122 --> 00:42:18,215
<i>piquant, after-dinner flavor.</i>

521
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,817
<i>Heady, but with just a touch
of mellow smoothness.</i>

522
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:27,632
<i>Lifebuoy, on the other hand...</i>

523
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:31,501
You ready to tell me?

524
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,770
All right. Where did you hear that word?

525
00:42:38,946 --> 00:42:42,848
<i>Now I had heard that word at least
10 times a day from my old man.</i>

526
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:45,315
<i>My father worked in profanity the way...</i>

527
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:47,854
<i>other artists might work in oils or clay.</i>

528
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:50,652
<i>It was his true medium. A master.</i>

529
00:42:50,726 --> 00:42:53,126
<i>But I chickened out. And I blurted out...</i>

530
00:42:53,295 --> 00:42:55,263
<i>the first name that came to mind.</i>

531
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,592
Schwartz!

532
00:42:58,301 --> 00:42:59,893
I see.

533
00:43:11,282 --> 00:43:14,149
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.

534
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:18,143
Mrs. Schwartz,
do you know what Ralph just said?

535
00:43:19,957 --> 00:43:20,925
No.

536
00:43:21,193 --> 00:43:22,717
He said...

537
00:43:24,696 --> 00:43:26,220
<i>Not that!</i>

538
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:27,693
Yes, that.

539
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:30,802
<i>- Do you know where he heard it?
- Probably from his father.</i>

540
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:33,394
No! He heard it from your son!

541
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:34,461
<i>What?</i>

542
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:43,811
<i>What'd I do, Mom?</i>

543
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:46,553
<i>Why? I didn't do nothing!</i>

544
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:55,256
<i>Another shot of mysterious,
inexorable, official justice.</i>

545
00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:00,597
Rinse out and go to bed.
Am I glad you finished your homework!

546
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:03,703
Get right into bed,
and I don't want to see any lights on.

547
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:06,741
You are being punished,
so no comic book reading!

548
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:08,833
I'll come in, and if any lights are on...

549
00:44:08,944 --> 00:44:11,845
Don't you give me that look!
You're gonna get it!

550
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,368
<i>Three blocks away,
Schwartz was getting his.</i>

551
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,410
<i>There has never been a kid
who didn't believe...</i>

552
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:44,480
<i>vaguely but insistently,
that he would be stricken blind...</i>

553
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,450
<i>before he reached 21.
And then they'd be sorry.</i>

554
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:01,030
Why, it's Ralph!

555
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:05,133
Well, come on in, Ralph.
Where've you been?

556
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:11,476
Why, he's carrying a cane!

557
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:13,036
What is it, Ralph? What happened?

558
00:45:13,114 --> 00:45:14,979
Why, he's blind!

559
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,881
Blind? Oh, my God!

560
00:45:20,021 --> 00:45:21,682
Ralph, is it something we did?

561
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,624
What brought you to this lonely state?

562
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:28,863
Ralph, please tell us no matter
how it hurts. What did we do?

563
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:31,495
Look, I can't.

564
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,468
Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.

565
00:45:33,704 --> 00:45:35,604
What brought you to this?

566
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:47,277
Soap poisoning.

567
00:45:54,292 --> 00:45:56,488
Oh, how could we do it?

568
00:45:57,162 --> 00:46:00,222
I'll manage to get along, somehow.

569
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,634
- I'll never forgive myself.
- Thanks, Mom.

570
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,397
I told you not to use Lifebuoy.

571
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:09,271
I feel awful!

572
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:35,166
Thank you, Heather.

573
00:46:35,237 --> 00:46:37,034
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

574
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:38,635
Thank you, Flick.

575
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:40,832
Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.

576
00:47:05,904 --> 00:47:08,930
I just thought that you'd be getting tired
of the same old stuff.

577
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,305
<i>Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.</i>

578
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:14,904
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.

579
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:22,149
Merry Christmas.

580
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:26,153
Happy New Year.

581
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:31,054
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

582
00:47:54,656 --> 00:47:57,717
<i>The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine,
in order to get...</i>

583
00:47:57,827 --> 00:48:01,263
<i>the Ovaltine inner seal to send off
for my Little Orphan Annie...</i>

584
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:04,858
<i>secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.</i>

585
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:08,331
I got it. "Master Ralph Parker."

586
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:10,134
My decoder pen!

587
00:48:14,512 --> 00:48:15,979
All right!

588
00:48:21,286 --> 00:48:24,119
"Be it known to all
that Ralph Parker is hereby appointed...

589
00:48:24,189 --> 00:48:26,953
"a member of
the Little Orphan Annie secret circle and...

590
00:48:27,025 --> 00:48:29,926
"is entitled to all the honors
and benefits occurring thereto."

591
00:48:30,462 --> 00:48:32,590
<i>Signed, Little Orphan Annie.</i>

592
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:35,198
<i>Countersigned, Pierre Andre!</i>

593
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:36,865
<i>In ink!</i>

594
00:48:37,036 --> 00:48:40,597
<i>Honors and benefits.
Already at the age of nine.</i>

595
00:48:46,446 --> 00:48:47,777
<i>Come on. Let's get on with it.</i>

596
00:48:47,848 --> 00:48:50,817
<i>I don't need all that jazz
about smugglers and pirates.</i>

597
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:54,413
<i>Listen tomorrow night
for the concluding adventure of...</i>

598
00:48:54,522 --> 00:48:57,514
<i>The Black Pirate Ship. Now it's time...</i>

599
00:48:57,659 --> 00:49:01,720
<i>for Annie's secret message
for you members of the secret circle.</i>

600
00:49:02,497 --> 00:49:04,591
<i>Remember, kids, only members of...</i>

601
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:08,728
<i>Annie's secret circle
can decode Annie's secret message.</i>

602
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:12,032
<i>Remember, Annie is depending on you.</i>

603
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:15,137
<i>Set your pins to B-2.</i>

604
00:49:15,512 --> 00:49:17,639
<i>Here is the message.</i>

605
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,279
<i>12. 11. 2...</i>

606
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:21,817
<i>I am in my first secret meeting.</i>

607
00:49:21,885 --> 00:49:24,649
<i>... 25. 14. 11. 18.</i>

608
00:49:25,722 --> 00:49:26,485
<i>16. 23...</i>

609
00:49:26,557 --> 00:49:28,252
<i>Pierre was in great voice tonight.</i>

610
00:49:28,326 --> 00:49:32,092
<i>I could tell that tonight's message
was really important.</i>

611
00:49:32,496 --> 00:49:33,554
<i>... 3. 25.</i>

612
00:49:33,664 --> 00:49:37,829
<i>That's a message from Annie herself.
Remember, don't tell anyone.</i>

613
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,609
<i>Ninety seconds later
I'm in the only room in the house...</i>

614
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:47,975
<i>where a boy of nine can sit in privacy
and decode.</i>

615
00:49:50,483 --> 00:49:53,043
<i>Ah! "B." I went to the next.</i>

616
00:49:54,053 --> 00:49:56,681
<i>"E." The first word is "be"!</i>

617
00:49:57,156 --> 00:50:00,251
<i>"S." It was coming easier now. "U."</i>

618
00:50:02,062 --> 00:50:04,656
Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.

619
00:50:05,332 --> 00:50:07,061
I'll be right down, Ma.

620
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:08,566
Gee whiz.

621
00:50:11,072 --> 00:50:13,165
"T. O."

622
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:16,609
<i>"Be sure to." Be sure to what?</i>

623
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:19,441
<i>What was Little Orphan Annie
trying to say? Be sure to what?</i>

624
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:22,641
Ralphie! Randy has got to go!
Will you please come out?

625
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:25,448
All right, Ma! I'll be right out!

626
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:27,288
<i>I was getting closer now.</i>

627
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,359
<i>The tension was terrible. What was it?</i>

628
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:32,657
<i>The fate of the planet
may hang in the balance.</i>

629
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,255
Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!

630
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,827
I'll be right out, for crying out loud!

631
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,932
<i>Almost there! My fingers flew.</i>

632
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,701
<i>My mind was a steel trap.</i>

633
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:45,207
<i>Every pore vibrated.</i>

634
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,271
<i>It was almost clear.</i>

635
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:48,469
<i>Yes!</i>

636
00:50:55,654 --> 00:50:56,882
Ovaltine?

637
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:02,355
A crummy commercial?

638
00:51:04,997 --> 00:51:06,522
Son of a bitch!

639
00:51:08,768 --> 00:51:11,259
<i>I went out to face the world again.</i>

640
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:12,837
<i>Wiser.</i>

641
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:27,253
Red cabbage?

642
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:30,291
No, that's for tomorrow night.
You love red cabbage, Ralphie.

643
00:51:32,227 --> 00:51:34,195
You filthy system!

644
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:35,923
I hate it!

645
00:51:36,098 --> 00:51:38,726
Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!

646
00:51:47,443 --> 00:51:51,813
<i>What happened next
was a family controversy for years.</i>

647
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:09,859
What was that? What happened?

648
00:52:14,106 --> 00:52:15,539
What happened?

649
00:52:16,308 --> 00:52:17,798
What broke?

650
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:19,840
I don't know what happened.

651
00:52:19,912 --> 00:52:22,176
I was watering my plant and...

652
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:25,246
I broke your lamp.

653
00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:42,096
Don't you touch that!

654
00:52:43,104 --> 00:52:45,231
You were always jealous of this lamp.

655
00:52:45,974 --> 00:52:47,441
Jealous of a plastic leg?

656
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:48,703
Jealous!

657
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:51,107
Jealous because I won.

658
00:52:53,015 --> 00:52:54,505
That's ridiculous! Jealous?

659
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,776
Jealous of what?

660
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,317
That is...

661
00:52:58,388 --> 00:53:02,347
the ugliest lamp
I have ever seen in my entire life!

662
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:04,283
<i>Now it was out.</i>

663
00:53:04,694 --> 00:53:05,991
Get the glue.

664
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,828
We're out of glue.

665
00:53:11,135 --> 00:53:15,469
You used up all the glue on purpose!

666
00:53:17,308 --> 00:53:19,709
<i>The old man stood quivering with fury...</i>

667
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:22,245
<i>stammering as he tried
to come up with a real crusher.</i>

668
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:23,909
<i>All he got out was:</i>

669
00:53:23,982 --> 00:53:25,279
Not a finger!

670
00:54:06,028 --> 00:54:08,258
<i>With as much dignity as he could muster...</i>

671
00:54:08,364 --> 00:54:10,924
<i>the old man gathered up the sad remains...</i>

672
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:13,558
<i>of his shattered major award.</i>

673
00:54:14,437 --> 00:54:17,235
<i>Later that night, alone in the backyard...</i>

674
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,472
<i>he buried it next to the garage.</i>

675
00:54:20,076 --> 00:54:21,737
<i>Now I could never be sure...</i>

676
00:54:22,212 --> 00:54:25,808
<i>but I thought that I heard
the sound of taps being played...</i>

677
00:54:26,117 --> 00:54:27,379
<i>gently.</i>

678
00:54:27,785 --> 00:54:29,514
Know what I'm getting my old man
for Christmas?

679
00:54:29,587 --> 00:54:31,384
- What?
- A rose that squirts.

680
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:33,514
People come to smell it, it squirts them.

681
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:37,219
- I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.
- A Flit gun?

682
00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:41,726
Stop right there!

683
00:54:41,934 --> 00:54:45,870
<i>Ordinarily, if Dill so much as
said "hi" to you, you felt great...</i>

684
00:54:46,371 --> 00:54:49,899
<i>warm inside.
But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.</i>

685
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:52,838
I can't now, Grover.
I've gotta go see Miss Shields.

686
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:56,080
Hey, come here! Get over here!

687
00:54:56,516 --> 00:54:58,450
Come on, you! Hey, come here!

688
00:54:59,954 --> 00:55:00,886
You! Come here!

689
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:01,849
Who, me?

690
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:04,990
- No, your Aunt Tilly.
- Yeah, you. Get over here!

691
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:08,184
<i>I left Flick to certain annihilation.</i>

692
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:11,721
<i>But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.</i>

693
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,168
Uncle! Uncle!

694
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,164
All right, class.

695
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,204
I have your Christmas themes for you.

696
00:55:24,246 --> 00:55:25,611
I'm pleased.

697
00:55:26,215 --> 00:55:28,410
In general, you did very well.

698
00:55:31,587 --> 00:55:35,115
However, I was disappointed
in the margins.

699
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:39,353
<i>This is it.</i>

700
00:55:40,731 --> 00:55:42,926
<i>"C+"? No, it can't be.</i>

701
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:44,767
C+?

702
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:46,961
C+!

703
00:55:54,747 --> 00:55:55,975
<i>Oh, no!</i>

704
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:58,810
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out"?</i>

705
00:56:01,153 --> 00:56:03,121
<i>My mother
must have gotten to Miss Shields.</i>

706
00:56:03,288 --> 00:56:04,880
<i>There could be no other explanation.</i>

707
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:09,288
You'll shoot your eye out.
You'll shoot your eye out.

708
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:15,596
<i>Was there no end to this conspiracy
of irrational prejudice...</i>

709
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:17,968
<i>against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?</i>

710
00:56:18,172 --> 00:56:22,370
These multiplication questions
were most missed in our last math test.

711
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:24,034
Would you answer in unison, please?

712
00:56:24,345 --> 00:56:27,246
<i>I was surrounded by happier kids
who were all going to get...</i>

713
00:56:27,348 --> 00:56:28,907
<i>what they wanted for Christmas.</i>

714
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:30,512
...fifty-six.

715
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:02,710
Hey, four-eyes!

716
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:05,347
How'd you like your snowball sandwich?

717
00:57:06,024 --> 00:57:08,015
Maybe you'd like another one!

718
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:14,555
Listen, jerk.

719
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,099
When I tell you to come, you better come!

720
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:21,773
What? Are you going to cry now?

721
00:57:21,974 --> 00:57:25,741
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.

722
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:27,603
Cry!

723
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:29,545
<i>Deep in the recesses of my brain...</i>

724
00:57:29,683 --> 00:57:33,050
<i>a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.</i>

725
00:57:46,802 --> 00:57:47,928
<i>Something had happened.</i>

726
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:52,096
<i>A fuse blew
and I had gone out of my skull.</i>

727
00:58:01,217 --> 00:58:03,651
I'm telling my dad!

728
00:58:05,054 --> 00:58:07,147
Hey, Ralphie!

729
00:58:13,998 --> 00:58:16,125
Beat him up! Beat him up!

730
00:58:30,616 --> 00:58:32,880
Did you hear what he said?

731
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,924
<i>I have since heard of people under...</i>

732
00:58:40,026 --> 00:58:43,690
<i>extreme duress speaking
in strange tongues.</i>

733
00:58:43,997 --> 00:58:47,455
<i>I became conscious
that a steady torrent of obscenities...</i>

734
00:58:47,634 --> 00:58:51,935
<i>and swearing of all kinds
was pouring out of me as I screamed.</i>

735
00:59:00,782 --> 00:59:02,340
Ralphie!

736
00:59:19,236 --> 00:59:21,101
We're going home. Come on.

737
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:43,194
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.

738
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,133
Put your head down in here.

739
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:51,730
Come on, get down in here.

740
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,397
Settle down.

741
00:59:56,709 --> 01:00:00,441
I want you to go in there
and lie down in your room for a while.

742
01:00:01,548 --> 01:00:03,675
Ralphie, just settle down.

743
01:00:07,388 --> 01:00:09,151
Here, dry off.

744
01:00:09,391 --> 01:00:11,359
All right, calm down.

745
01:00:11,493 --> 01:00:13,927
All right. Now go lie down.

746
01:00:33,684 --> 01:00:36,244
<i>The light was getting purple
and soft outside.</i>

747
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:39,219
<i>Almost time for my father
to come home from work.</i>

748
01:00:59,611 --> 01:01:01,203
What's the matter? What you crying for?

749
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:04,615
Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.

750
01:01:05,218 --> 01:01:06,685
No, he's not.

751
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,185
Yes, he is, too.

752
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:09,846
No, he's not.

753
01:01:09,956 --> 01:01:14,154
I promise you
Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.

754
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:16,553
Why don't you come on out of there?

755
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,294
Would you like some milk?

756
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,899
You would?

757
01:01:31,546 --> 01:01:32,740
Here you go.

758
01:01:34,082 --> 01:01:35,106
All right?

759
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,548
I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.

760
01:01:50,868 --> 01:01:54,531
<i>I heard the car roar up the driveway,
and a wave of terror broke over me.</i>

761
01:01:54,772 --> 01:01:57,798
<i>He'll know what I said,
the awful things that I said.</i>

762
01:01:58,042 --> 01:01:59,839
Get out of here!

763
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:03,777
Go on home, you mangy mutts.
Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...

764
01:02:04,049 --> 01:02:04,777
Hey, Bumpus!

765
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:07,317
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!

766
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,481
Hey, come on, what's for dinner?
I'm starving to death.

767
01:02:31,378 --> 01:02:34,007
Well, what happened today?

768
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:36,046
Where's your glasses?

769
01:02:37,485 --> 01:02:39,146
Did you lose your glasses again?

770
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,452
Ralphie.

771
01:02:40,788 --> 01:02:43,882
Remember, you left these
on the radio again.

772
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,959
Now try not to do that anymore.

773
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:49,554
So what else happened today?

774
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:52,465
Nothing much.

775
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:53,999
Ralphie had a fight.

776
01:02:54,803 --> 01:02:55,565
A fight?

777
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,103
What kind of a fight?

778
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:01,601
You know how boys are.

779
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:05,146
I gave him a talking to.

780
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,917
I see that the Bears
are playing Green Bay on Sunday.

781
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:12,551
Oh, yeah.

782
01:03:12,723 --> 01:03:14,748
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.

783
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:16,959
He'll freeze his keister off out there.

784
01:03:20,031 --> 01:03:23,523
<i>I slowly began to realize
I was not about to be destroyed.</i>

785
01:03:23,902 --> 01:03:25,369
The Chicago Bears.

786
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:27,461
The terror of the midway.

787
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,933
<i>From then on, things were different
between me and my mother.</i>

788
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:37,273
More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.

789
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,576
But Bears, never.

790
01:03:40,554 --> 01:03:41,543
<i>Strange.</i>

791
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:45,553
<i>Even something as monumental
as "The Scut Farkus Affair"...</i>

792
01:03:45,792 --> 01:03:47,316
<i>as it came to be known...</i>

793
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:50,088
<i>was pushed out of my mind
as I struggled for a way out...</i>

794
01:03:50,164 --> 01:03:52,998
<i>of the impenetrable BB gun web...</i>

795
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:55,126
<i>in which my mother had me trapped.</i>

796
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,562
Santa!

797
01:03:57,272 --> 01:03:59,001
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.

798
01:03:59,707 --> 01:04:01,368
<i>Of course! Santa.</i>

799
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:03,736
<i>The big man. The head honcho.</i>

800
01:04:03,979 --> 01:04:05,207
<i>The connection.</i>

801
01:04:05,481 --> 01:04:08,075
<i>My mother had slipped up this time.</i>

802
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,868
Mickey!

803
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:51,488
The store's going to close soon
and Santa will be gone.

804
01:04:51,564 --> 01:04:55,591
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.
Just be still!

805
01:05:05,246 --> 01:05:07,680
Mom, this is just
the same old dumb parade as last year.

806
01:05:07,781 --> 01:05:10,979
- Ralphie, will you please calm down.
- Mom...

807
01:05:11,386 --> 01:05:13,013
- Hush!
- Shut up, Ralphie!

808
01:05:22,632 --> 01:05:23,428
There he is!

809
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:25,660
Santa!

810
01:05:32,976 --> 01:05:35,467
Have you been a good boy? Have you?

811
01:05:35,612 --> 01:05:38,445
- Can we go now? Can we go?
- Yes, we can go now.

812
01:05:38,582 --> 01:05:40,777
Come on, Ralphie.

813
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:54,524
Merry Christmas!

814
01:05:57,236 --> 01:05:59,602
Come on, Randy, hurry up.

815
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,914
Ralphie, look over there.

816
01:06:14,988 --> 01:06:18,015
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.

817
01:06:18,092 --> 01:06:20,959
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him.
We'll see you later, okay?

818
01:06:21,028 --> 01:06:24,191
Stay together, you hear?
And don't get lost.

819
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:28,861
Come on.

820
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:30,471
Let's go.

821
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,002
Young man.

822
01:06:35,177 --> 01:06:36,303
Hey, kid.

823
01:06:36,678 --> 01:06:40,240
- Just where do you think you're going?
- We're going up to see Santa.

824
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,882
The line ends here. It begins there.

825
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,015
Merry Christmas!

826
01:06:46,222 --> 01:06:49,317
Come on, come up, boys and girls.
Hurry up.

827
01:06:55,232 --> 01:06:56,665
Come on.

828
01:07:00,572 --> 01:07:05,373
<i>The line waiting to see Santa stretched
all the way back to Terre Haute!</i>

829
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:07,910
<i>And I was at the end of it.</i>

830
01:07:10,248 --> 01:07:12,308
I like Santa.

831
01:07:16,689 --> 01:07:18,884
<i>Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers.</i>

832
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:23,987
<i>Moments before zero hour,
it did not pay to take chances.</i>

833
01:07:24,931 --> 01:07:29,061
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.

834
01:07:30,804 --> 01:07:32,362
My pretty...

835
01:07:32,606 --> 01:07:34,734
What a tasty little boy.

836
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,911
Don't bother me. I'm thinking.

837
01:07:43,317 --> 01:07:45,445
<i>I like The Wizard of Oz.</i>

838
01:07:48,724 --> 01:07:50,658
I like the Tin Man.

839
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:58,960
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute
past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.

840
01:08:00,603 --> 01:08:02,662
Come on up on Santa's lap.

841
01:08:02,772 --> 01:08:07,210
There's a wet one.
And what's your name, little boy?

842
01:08:07,411 --> 01:08:08,400
Billy.

843
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:09,673
Come on, Randy.

844
01:08:11,248 --> 01:08:14,445
And what do you want for Christmas,
Billy? A toy truck?

845
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:16,486
Get him off my lap.

846
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,418
Quick, get me a towel.

847
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:28,257
I hate the smell of tapioca.

848
01:08:29,802 --> 01:08:33,238
<i>Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00
and our store is closing.</i>

849
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:36,574
<i>9:00! Great Scott!
The store is gonna close!</i>

850
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:40,205
Santa can't wait all night.

851
01:08:40,781 --> 01:08:42,874
Come on up on Santa's lap.

852
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,786
Get moving, kid.

853
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:56,824
Quit dragging your feet.

854
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,503
Get him out of here.

855
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,989
Come on, kid.

856
01:09:30,067 --> 01:09:32,558
Come on up.

857
01:09:42,915 --> 01:09:46,408
And what's your name, little boy?

858
01:09:46,553 --> 01:09:49,989
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!

859
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:57,691
Listen, little boy, we got
a lot of people waiting here, so get going!

860
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,869
What do you want for Christmas,
little boy?

861
01:10:03,237 --> 01:10:05,330
<i>My mind had gone blank.</i>

862
01:10:05,472 --> 01:10:07,702
<i>Frantically I tried to remember
what it was I wanted.</i>

863
01:10:07,775 --> 01:10:09,334
<i>I was blowing it, blowing it.</i>

864
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,440
How about a nice football?

865
01:10:15,584 --> 01:10:18,576
<i>Football. What's a football?</i>

866
01:10:19,288 --> 01:10:21,415
<i>Without conscious will,
my voice squeaked out:</i>

867
01:10:21,524 --> 01:10:22,752
Football.

868
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:24,884
Okay, get him out of here.

869
01:10:25,428 --> 01:10:28,761
<i>A football! Oh, no. What was I doing?</i>

870
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:31,198
<i>Wake up, stupid, wake up!</i>

871
01:10:39,009 --> 01:10:42,104
I want an official Red Ryder
carbine-action 200-shot...

872
01:10:42,213 --> 01:10:43,271
range model air rifle.

873
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,045
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

874
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,583
Merry Christmas.

875
01:11:06,306 --> 01:11:08,103
I'll see you in Oz, folks.

876
01:11:16,684 --> 01:11:18,652
Well, did you see Santa Claus?

877
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,654
Did you tell him
what you wanted for Christmas?

878
01:11:21,756 --> 01:11:25,487
Did he ask you if you'd been
a good boy all year?

879
01:11:25,894 --> 01:11:26,622
No.

880
01:11:27,462 --> 01:11:29,589
Don't worry, he knows.

881
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:31,822
He always knows.

882
01:11:34,603 --> 01:11:37,232
Merry Christmas.

883
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:40,506
Okay, down you go.

884
01:11:40,777 --> 01:11:41,937
Bye, Chris.

885
01:11:52,289 --> 01:11:54,587
That's fine.

886
01:11:55,392 --> 01:11:57,952
Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!

887
01:11:59,864 --> 01:12:01,491
Well, the green string is out.

888
01:12:01,599 --> 01:12:03,863
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.

889
01:12:04,135 --> 01:12:06,228
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.

890
01:12:06,337 --> 01:12:07,497
I'm not color blind.

891
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:09,763
I'm not color blind, either.

892
01:12:13,446 --> 01:12:14,936
There, see, I told you it was green.

893
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:19,577
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

894
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:22,453
Hold it right there!

895
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,853
A fuse is out.

896
01:12:25,358 --> 01:12:29,055
<i>The old man could replace fuses
quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.</i>

897
01:12:29,129 --> 01:12:30,756
<i>He bought them by the gross.</i>

898
01:12:36,671 --> 01:12:38,400
Oh, Ralph.

899
01:12:38,706 --> 01:12:41,072
My, isn't that pretty?

900
01:12:41,242 --> 01:12:42,539
That son of a gun.

901
01:12:44,513 --> 01:12:45,707
Yeah. No.

902
01:12:45,848 --> 01:12:47,509
That star is crooked.

903
01:12:47,783 --> 01:12:49,717
That star is perfectly straight.

904
01:12:52,221 --> 01:12:54,314
- Oh, you've got to be careful.
- I am.

905
01:12:57,026 --> 01:13:00,154
It's just... Let me get it fixed.
That's all right.

906
01:13:06,237 --> 01:13:07,761
Perfect.

907
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:12,472
Oh, goodness, look at the time.

908
01:13:12,543 --> 01:13:14,534
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up
this house...

909
01:13:14,612 --> 01:13:17,639
just because some boys
weren't in bed when he came by.

910
01:13:17,783 --> 01:13:20,377
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells...

911
01:13:20,452 --> 01:13:22,977
a little while ago,
going up the other side of the street.

912
01:13:24,055 --> 01:13:25,386
All right, you two, upstairs.

913
01:13:26,525 --> 01:13:28,551
Go on the double, on the double.

914
01:13:40,073 --> 01:13:41,165
Okay, let's get them.

915
01:14:44,543 --> 01:14:46,603
Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!

916
01:14:57,499 --> 01:14:59,592
<i>Santa Claus had come!</i>

917
01:15:03,172 --> 01:15:05,367
Wow! A truck! That's mine!

918
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:08,172
Wow, look over here! That's mine!

919
01:15:08,244 --> 01:15:09,734
What's in here?

920
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,104
It's hard.

921
01:15:11,448 --> 01:15:14,508
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!

922
01:15:23,594 --> 01:15:24,891
Does this raise?

923
01:15:40,078 --> 01:15:41,307
Merry Christmas.

924
01:15:42,782 --> 01:15:45,114
Merry Christmas, you two.

925
01:15:45,918 --> 01:15:48,614
Randy, no.
Wait for Christmas to start, honey.

926
01:15:49,055 --> 01:15:52,116
- I want to play Santa!
- Well, wait a minute, Randy.

927
01:15:52,192 --> 01:15:54,092
He played Santa last year, didn't he?

928
01:15:54,461 --> 01:15:56,588
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.

929
01:15:56,864 --> 01:15:58,798
- Come on, Ralphie.
- Who should I start with?

930
01:15:59,099 --> 01:16:01,397
Well, give Randy a present.

931
01:16:01,502 --> 01:16:05,667
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you
right over there.

932
01:16:05,773 --> 01:16:08,207
She always sends you
such wonderful presents.

933
01:16:08,576 --> 01:16:11,272
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.

934
01:16:28,165 --> 01:16:32,659
<i>Christmas had come. Officially.
We plunged into the cornucopia...</i>

935
01:16:32,736 --> 01:16:36,605
<i>quivering with desire
and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.</i>

936
01:16:36,741 --> 01:16:38,174
Didn't I get a tie this year?

937
01:16:45,316 --> 01:16:48,616
- A zeppelin!
- A can of Simonize.

938
01:16:49,421 --> 01:16:52,584
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?
Show everybody.

939
01:16:57,763 --> 01:16:58,628
I don't want to.

940
01:16:59,232 --> 01:17:01,666
Ralphie, show everybody
what Aunt Clara gave you.

941
01:17:02,602 --> 01:17:05,435
<i>Aunt Clara had for years labored
under the delusion that...</i>

942
01:17:05,505 --> 01:17:10,034
<i>I was not only perpetually four years old,
but also a girl.</i>

943
01:17:10,544 --> 01:17:14,412
She just always gives you
the nicest things, Ralphie.

944
01:17:18,919 --> 01:17:21,718
Oh, isn't that sweet?

945
01:17:22,157 --> 01:17:24,955
- Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you...
- I don't want to!

946
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,460
Go upstairs right now
and try on that present!

947
01:17:27,562 --> 01:17:30,929
She went to all that trouble to make it!
Now go on.

948
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:42,772
While Ralphie is changing,
I'm going to play Santa Claus.

949
01:17:42,845 --> 01:17:44,473
Now, let me see what can I find.

950
01:17:44,681 --> 01:17:48,242
I see something! Randy.

951
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:50,248
This is for you, honey.

952
01:17:51,121 --> 01:17:53,055
And this is for Daddy.

953
01:17:55,994 --> 01:17:56,688
Here.

954
01:17:56,761 --> 01:17:58,626
From me to you.

955
01:18:00,898 --> 01:18:02,729
Thanks a lot.

956
01:18:03,134 --> 01:18:05,365
I wonder what it could be?

957
01:18:06,372 --> 01:18:09,364
Only one way to find out, isn't there?

958
01:18:09,642 --> 01:18:11,837
Well, it's a blue ball!

959
01:18:13,512 --> 01:18:15,275
It's a bowling ball.

960
01:18:16,283 --> 01:18:17,545
Thank you, darling.

961
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,779
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much. Very much.

962
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:22,386
Ralphie.

963
01:18:22,589 --> 01:18:24,614
We're waiting.

964
01:18:24,791 --> 01:18:26,349
Oh, come on, Mom.

965
01:18:26,793 --> 01:18:28,455
Right now!

966
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:42,169
<i>Immediately my feet began to sweat
as those two fluffy little bunnies...</i>

967
01:18:42,244 --> 01:18:45,611
<i>with the blue button eyes
stared sappily up at me.</i>

968
01:18:46,348 --> 01:18:49,044
Come down here so I can see you better.

969
01:18:49,886 --> 01:18:51,683
<i>I just hoped Flick would never spot them...</i>

970
01:18:51,821 --> 01:18:55,120
<i>as the word of this humiliation
could easily make life...</i>

971
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:58,024
<i>at Warren G. Harding School
a veritable hell.</i>

972
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:01,203
Isn't that cute?

973
01:19:01,882 --> 01:19:05,511
That is the most precious thing
I've ever seen in my life.

974
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,218
Shut up, Randy.

975
01:19:08,047 --> 01:19:10,140
He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.

976
01:19:12,352 --> 01:19:14,047
- He does not!
- He does, too.

977
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:15,816
He looks like a pink nightmare.

978
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,481
Are you happy wearing that?

979
01:19:18,825 --> 01:19:19,814
Do you want to take it off?

980
01:19:20,027 --> 01:19:21,255
You tell the kid to take it off.

981
01:19:21,328 --> 01:19:24,298
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
Go on and take it off.

982
01:19:24,365 --> 01:19:26,026
Take it off!

983
01:19:29,637 --> 01:19:31,537
My God, will you look at that mess?

984
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,375
- Who's going to clean the papers up?
- Not me.

985
01:19:35,778 --> 01:19:38,110
- Randy did it last year.
- Well, he can do it again.

986
01:19:40,683 --> 01:19:43,584
You know, this wine is not bad.
It's not good either, but...

987
01:19:43,652 --> 01:19:46,213
- You want a sip?
- No, you don't.

988
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:48,783
Did you have a nice Christmas?

989
01:19:49,526 --> 01:19:50,493
Yeah, pretty nice.

990
01:19:50,593 --> 01:19:52,060
Did you get everything you wanted?

991
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:55,692
- Well, almost.
- Almost?

992
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,427
Well, that's life.

993
01:19:58,102 --> 01:19:59,797
Well, there's always next Christmas.

994
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,405
That's funny.

995
01:20:05,309 --> 01:20:07,107
What's that over there behind the desk?

996
01:20:08,146 --> 01:20:09,078
Where?

997
01:20:09,147 --> 01:20:10,978
Behind the desk,
against the wall over there.

998
01:20:13,819 --> 01:20:15,150
Why don't you go check it out?

999
01:20:31,839 --> 01:20:33,136
What did we put over there, honey?

1000
01:20:34,608 --> 01:20:36,701
Santa Claus probably put it.

1001
01:21:13,584 --> 01:21:17,418
<i>Oh, it was beautiful.
I could hardly wait to try it out.</i>

1002
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:19,850
Do you know how to load it?

1003
01:21:23,294 --> 01:21:24,557
That's right.

1004
01:21:32,237 --> 01:21:33,135
Be careful.

1005
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:35,038
Don't. They run all over.

1006
01:21:41,881 --> 01:21:43,143
Close her up. Close it up.

1007
01:21:44,217 --> 01:21:46,914
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?

1008
01:21:47,021 --> 01:21:48,488
- Sure.
- Okay.

1009
01:21:48,956 --> 01:21:50,082
But outside.

1010
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:52,056
I still say those things are dangerous.

1011
01:21:53,561 --> 01:21:56,155
Put on your galoshes and your coat.
It's cold out.

1012
01:21:59,601 --> 01:22:02,536
I had one when I was eight years old.

1013
01:22:03,138 --> 01:22:05,663
What if he hurts himself?
Ralphie, your coat!

1014
01:22:06,975 --> 01:22:10,878
- Don't shoot any animals or birds!
- Except the Bumpuses' dogs!

1015
01:22:12,482 --> 01:22:14,473
Be careful, Ralphie!

1016
01:22:15,151 --> 01:22:18,245
<i>Now it is well known throughout
the Midwest that the old man...</i>

1017
01:22:18,321 --> 01:22:20,187
<i>is a turkey junkie.</i>

1018
01:22:21,058 --> 01:22:25,358
<i>A bona fide garley turkicanus freak.
A few days before Christmas...</i>

1019
01:22:25,496 --> 01:22:29,592
<i>his eyes would begin to gleam
with a wild and ravenous light.</i>

1020
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:37,871
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.

1021
01:22:51,857 --> 01:22:53,792
<i>Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!</i>

1022
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,518
<i>You'll shoot your eye out, kid.</i>

1023
01:22:55,996 --> 01:23:00,262
<i>You'll shoot your eye out,
you'll shoot your eye out!</i>

1024
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:04,399
Ralphie, you be careful out there.
Don't shoot your eye out!

1025
01:23:04,472 --> 01:23:06,531
<i>She hadn't seen! She didn't know!</i>

1026
01:23:07,175 --> 01:23:09,769
<i>My eye's all right.
The BB must've hit my glasses.</i>

1027
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:12,874
<i>My glasses! Oh, no!</i>

1028
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:14,608
<i>Where are my glasses?</i>

1029
01:23:16,251 --> 01:23:19,015
<i>Few things brought such swift
and terrible retribution...</i>

1030
01:23:19,121 --> 01:23:22,090
<i>on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!</i>

1031
01:23:26,429 --> 01:23:27,691
Stop!

1032
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:41,377
Oh, no!

1033
01:23:43,847 --> 01:23:46,111
<i>Oh, no! Pulverized.</i>

1034
01:23:57,996 --> 01:24:02,161
<i>For a moment I thought, I'll fake it.
They'll never know the lens is gone!</i>

1035
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:07,670
<i>Randomly, my mind evolved
a spectacular plot.</i>

1036
01:24:07,873 --> 01:24:10,034
<i>Let's see, an icicle!</i>

1037
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:12,743
<i>Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!</i>

1038
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:17,278
<i>It would work. It had to work.
Quickly, I whipped up some tears.</i>

1039
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,322
What's the matter, honey?
What happened?

1040
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:27,622
What happened? Let me see that.

1041
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:31,461
There was this icicle
and it fell off the garage and it hit me.

1042
01:24:35,838 --> 01:24:39,069
- What is it?
- No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.

1043
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,736
Wake up, Randy.

1044
01:24:49,519 --> 01:24:50,850
Oh, God.

1045
01:24:51,021 --> 01:24:54,081
It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.

1046
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:58,289
And I tried to get out of the way, but I...

1047
01:25:00,231 --> 01:25:04,133
There, see, it's just a little bump.

1048
01:25:04,502 --> 01:25:06,164
You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.

1049
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:08,365
Those icicles have been known
to kill people.

1050
01:25:14,613 --> 01:25:18,015
- What's going on up there?
- Nothing. We'll be right down.

1051
01:25:18,318 --> 01:25:20,980
You stay away from that turkey!
It's got an hour to cook.

1052
01:25:21,087 --> 01:25:22,247
You'll get worms!

1053
01:25:27,427 --> 01:25:28,918
But what about my glasses?

1054
01:25:29,496 --> 01:25:31,828
You can wear the old ones
with the crack in them...

1055
01:25:31,899 --> 01:25:33,730
until we get you some new ones.

1056
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:38,470
<i>I had pulled it off!</i>

1057
01:25:39,874 --> 01:25:41,739
But I left my gun outside.

1058
01:25:43,044 --> 01:25:45,911
When you get dressed
you can go out and get your gun.

1059
01:25:46,114 --> 01:25:47,479
Hold that on there.

1060
01:25:47,982 --> 01:25:49,574
<i>Life is like that.</i>

1061
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:54,989
<i>Sometimes at the height of our reveries,
when our joy is at its zenith...</i>

1062
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:57,992
<i>when all is most right with the world...</i>

1063
01:25:58,127 --> 01:26:01,460
<i>the most unthinkable disasters
descend upon us.</i>

1064
01:26:16,914 --> 01:26:18,472
Oh, turkey!

1065
01:26:33,332 --> 01:26:36,530
Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!

1066
01:26:51,752 --> 01:26:55,347
<i>The heavenly aroma still hung heavy
in the house. But it was gone.</i>

1067
01:26:55,489 --> 01:26:58,516
<i>All gone. No turkey.
No turkey sandwiches.</i>

1068
01:26:58,593 --> 01:27:02,620
<i>No turkey salad. No turkey gravy,
turkey hash, turkey à la king...</i>

1069
01:27:02,731 --> 01:27:04,028
<i>or gallons of turkey soup.</i>

1070
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:04,827
<i>Gone.</i>

1071
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,162
<i>All gone.</i>

1072
01:27:10,807 --> 01:27:11,796
All right.

1073
01:27:12,275 --> 01:27:13,173
Everybody upstairs.

1074
01:27:13,409 --> 01:27:14,706
Get dressed.

1075
01:27:16,879 --> 01:27:18,369
We are going out to eat.

1076
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:47,135
No! Not, "ra ra ra ra ra." "La la la la la."

1077
01:27:47,546 --> 01:27:48,342
Sing like this:

1078
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:58,280
Try again.

1079
01:28:08,302 --> 01:28:09,496
Stop!

1080
01:28:10,271 --> 01:28:12,034
Sing something else.

1081
01:28:25,621 --> 01:28:26,680
No!

1082
01:28:26,756 --> 01:28:27,848
Stop!

1083
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,989
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.

1084
01:28:40,137 --> 01:28:41,468
Oh, I'm sorry.

1085
01:28:44,308 --> 01:28:45,969
It's a beautiful duck.

1086
01:28:46,377 --> 01:28:48,039
It really is.

1087
01:28:48,847 --> 01:28:50,474
But you see...

1088
01:28:52,984 --> 01:28:53,780
What?

1089
01:28:53,852 --> 01:28:55,820
It's smiling at me.

1090
01:29:01,394 --> 01:29:02,486
Okay?

1091
01:29:03,896 --> 01:29:05,329
Beautiful!

1092
01:29:08,868 --> 01:29:10,894
<i>That Christmas would live
in our memories...</i>

1093
01:29:11,004 --> 01:29:14,440
<i>as the Christmas when
we were introduced to Chinese turkey.</i>

1094
01:29:15,876 --> 01:29:17,867
<i>All was right with the world.</i>

1095
01:29:38,834 --> 01:29:41,132
Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.

1096
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:43,940
Is that beautiful!

1097
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:34,156
<i>Next to me in the blackness
lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.</i>

1098
01:30:34,928 --> 01:30:37,260
<i>The greatest Christmas gift
I had ever received...</i>

1099
01:30:37,364 --> 01:30:38,797
<i>or would ever receive.</i>

1100
01:30:39,968 --> 01:30:43,631
<i>Gradually, I drifted off to sleep,
pranging ducks on the wing...</i>

1101
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:46,230
<i>and getting off spectacular hip shots.</i>
