1
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,430
<i>Ah, there it is.</i>

2
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,600
<i>My house</i>
<i>at good old Cleveland Street.</i>

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,970
<i>How could I ever forget it?</i>

4
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,850
<i>And there I am,</i>
<i>with that dumb, round face...</i>

5
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,980
<i>...and that stupid stocking cap.</i>

6
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,940
<i>But no matter.</i>
<i>Christmas was on its way.</i>

7
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,940
<i>Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas,</i>
<i>around which the entire kid year revolved.</i>

8
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,100
<i>Downtown Hohman was prepared</i>
<i>for its yearly bacchanalia...</i>

9
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,140
<i>...of peace on Earth</i>
<i>and goodwill to men.</i>

10
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,820
<i>Higbees' corner window</i>
<i>was traditionally a high-water mark...</i>

11
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,990
<i>...of the pre-Christmas season.</i>

12
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,120
<i>First-nighters,</i>
<i>packed earmuff to earmuff...</i>

13
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,500
<i>...jostled in wonderment</i>
<i>before a golden, tinkling display...</i>

14
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,500
<i>...of mechanized, electronic joy.</i>

15
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,130
<i>Ah, there it is.</i>

16
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,470
<i>The holy grail of Christmas gifts.</i>

17
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,560
<i>The Red Ryder 200-shot range</i>
<i>model air rifle.</i>

18
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,140
<i>And there he is.</i>

19
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,310
<i>Red Ryder himself.</i>

20
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,650
<i>In his hand was the knurled stock...</i>

21
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,650
<i>...of as coolly, deadly looking a piece</i>
<i>of weaponry as ever I had laid eyes on.</i>

22
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,370
<i>For weeks, I had been scheming</i>
<i>to get my mitts...</i>

23
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,330
<i>...on one of these fearsome</i>
<i>blue-steel beauties.</i>

24
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,340
<i>My fevered brain seethed</i>
<i>with the effort of trying to come up...</i>

25
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,800
<i>...with the infinitely</i>
<i>subtle devices necessary...</i>

26
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,010
<i>...to implant the Red Ryder</i>
<i>range model air rifle indelibly...</i>

27
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,560
<i>...into my parents' subconscious.</i>

28
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,310
Ralphie! Randy!

29
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,480
Down here in two minutes.

30
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,520
And I mean two minutes.

31
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,400
Come on, Ralphie! I got here first!

32
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,020
Cut it out.

33
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,910
<i>My mother, grabbing for her copy</i>
<i>of Look magazine...</i>

34
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,810
<i>...would find herself cleverly trapped</i>
<i>into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.</i>

35
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,280
They traded Bullfrog.
I don't believe it.

36
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,740
What's that?

37
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,390
Well, for chrissakes,
the Sox traded Bullfrog...

38
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,010
...the only player they've got,
for Shottenhoffer.

39
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,750
Four Eyes Shottenhoffer,
utility infielder.

40
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,000
Got a whole goddamned team
of utility infielders.

41
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,420
That's nice.

42
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,250
Ralphie, on the double!

43
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,590
MR. PARKER: Did you hear about this guy
who swallowed a yo-yo?

44
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,730
- Swallowed a yo-yo?
- Yeah, on a bet.

45
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,720
Some clodhopper
down in Griffith, Indiana.

46
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,380
Boy, they write
the silliest things in the newspapers.

47
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,980
What do you mean silly?
I mean, that's real news.

48
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,060
That's not like that politics slop.

49
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,450
What is the name
of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

50
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,310
Victor. His name is Victor.

51
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,200
How the hell did you know that?

52
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,160
Everybody knows that.

53
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,120
Is that another
one of your silly puzzles?

54
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,460
Yeah, it's another
one of my silly puzzles.

55
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,050
Could be worth 50,000 bucks.

56
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,170
What kind is it this time?

57
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,510
Name the great characters
in American literature.

58
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,540
- Victor?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,130
The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

60
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,170
<i>Meanwhile, I struggled</i>
<i>for exactly the right BB gun hint.</i>

61
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,910
<i>It had to be firm, but subtle.</i>

62
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,980
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears
near Pulaski's candy store.

63
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,950
<i>They looked at me as if</i>
<i>I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.</i>

64
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,160
<i>I could tell I was in imminent danger</i>
<i>of overplaying my hand.</i>

65
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,870
<i>Casually, I switched tactics.</i>

66
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,200
Hey, Dad.

67
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,090
I'll bet you'll never guess
what I got for you for Christmas.

68
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,160
A new furnace.

69
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,390
That's a good one, Dad.

70
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,850
<i>My old man was one of the most feared</i>
<i>furnace fighters in Northern Indiana.</i>

71
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,690
Hurry up,
you're gonna be late for school.

72
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,360
Yeah, yeah. I'm running late already.

73
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,650
<i>Round one was over.</i>

74
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,440
<i>Parents, one. Kids, zip.</i>

75
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,740
<i>I could feel the Christmas noose</i>
<i>beginning to tighten.</i>

76
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,700
<i>Maybe what happened next</i>
<i>was inevitable.</i>

77
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,450
Ralphie,
what would you like for Christmas?

78
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,790
<i>Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.</i>

79
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,130
I want an official Red Ryder carbine
action 200-range model air rifle. Ooh.

80
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,300
No. Shoot your eye out.

81
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,220
<i>Oh, no, it was the classic</i>
<i>mother BB-gun block:</i>

82
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,140
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out."</i>

83
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,100
<i>That deadly phrase</i>
<i>uttered many times before...</i>

84
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,850
<i>...by hundreds of mothers</i>
<i>was not surmountable...</i>

85
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,980
<i>...by any means known to Kid-dom.</i>

86
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,110
<i>But such was my mania,</i>
<i>my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...</i>

87
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,360
<i>...that I immediately began</i>
<i>to rebuild the dike.</i>

88
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,900
I was just kidding.

89
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,870
Even though Flick is getting one.

90
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,030
I guess I'd just like some Tinkertoys.

91
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>I couldn't believe my own ears.</i>
<i>Tinkertoys?</i>

92
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,200
<i>She'd never buy it.</i>

93
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,120
BB guns are dangerous.

94
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,500
I don't want anybody
shooting his eye out.

95
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,210
Randy, will you eat?

96
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,750
There are starving people in China.

97
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,460
<i>Mothers know nothing</i>
<i>about creeping marauders...</i>

98
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,160
<i>...burrowing through the snow</i>
<i>toward the kitchen...</i>

99
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,020
<i>...where only you and you alone...</i>

100
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,020
<i>...stand between your tiny,</i>
<i>huddled family and insensate evil.</i>

101
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,930
<i>Save us.</i>

102
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,290
Save us, Ralphie.

103
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,590
I just knowed those bad guys
would be coming for us in the end.

104
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,950
Don't worry, Dad.
As long as I got Ol' Blue.

105
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,140
Well, now,
what have we got here, folks?

106
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,390
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.

107
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,270
Well, just me and my trusty
old Red Ryder carbine action...

108
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,020
...200-shot range model air rifle.

109
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,650
Lucky I got a compass in the stock.

110
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,880
- Well, I think I better have a look here.
- Don't worry, son.

111
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,040
- Oh, no, it's Ol' Blue.
- Ol' Blue.

112
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,090
Oh, no.

113
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:59,650
Seize him, boys! The jig is up!

114
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,110
Killed another one.
Oh, he's a deadeye, ain't he?

115
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,560
He's getting him.

116
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,450
Okay, Ralphie.

117
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,340
You win this time, but we'll be back.

118
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,620
Adiós, Bart.

119
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,930
But if you do come back,
you'll be pushing up daisies.

120
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,300
- And don't you forget it.
- Well, son, you saved us.

121
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,890
We were goners for sure.

122
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,560
And you saved us.

123
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,770
RANDY:
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

124
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,990
Go on! Beat it!

125
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:58,270
The Olds. Nothing but Oldsmobile.
That pile of junk.

126
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,610
That goddamned Olds
has froze up again.

127
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,240
<i>Some men are Baptists,</i>
<i>others Catholics.</i>

128
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,740
<i>My father was an Oldsmobile man.</i>

129
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,290
That son of a bitch would freeze up
in the middle of summer on the equator.

130
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,170
- Little pitchers.
- And hold it!

131
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,130
Shh.

132
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,770
Aha! Aha! It's a clinker!

133
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,980
That blasted stupid furnace.

134
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,270
Goddamn it.

135
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,310
Damn skates.

136
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,120
Oh, for chrissake,
open up the damper, will you?

137
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,410
Who the hell turned it
all the way down again?!

138
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,700
Oh, blast it!

139
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,120
Blurred rattle crash camel flirt!

140
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,550
You block-head battled piece
jerk off trash!

141
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,270
<i>In the heat of battle, my father</i>
<i>wove a tapestry of obscenity...</i>

142
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,970
<i>...that, as far as we know...</i>

143
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,300
<i>...is still hanging in space</i>
<i>over Lake Michigan.</i>

144
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Gollywop-dopter-crop-dop-
fratenhouse-stickelfeiffer!

145
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,030
<i>Well, preparing to go to school...</i>

146
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,960
<i>...was like getting ready</i>
<i>for extended deep-sea diving.</i>

147
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,550
Come on, Mom, we're gonna be late.

148
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,330
All right, Ralph.

149
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,430
<i>My kid brother</i>
<i>looked like a tick about to pop.</i>

150
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,440
RANDY: Mm!
- What?

151
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,270
- What is it?
- Mm!

152
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,650
What is it?

153
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,990
MRS. PARKER: What is it?
- I can't put my arms down.

154
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,670
Well, put your arms down
when you get to school.

155
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,500
Goddamn it! You...

156
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,080
Hey, Flick, wait up. Wait up.

157
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
So, what are you doing?

158
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,160
What does it look like I'm doing,
picking goobers?

159
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,820
Hey, listen, smartass.

160
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,860
I asked my old man about sticking
your tongue to metal light poles in winter.

161
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,470
And he says it will freeze
right to the pole, just like I told you.

162
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,450
Ah, baloney. What would your old man
know about anything?

163
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,390
He knows
because he once saw a guy...

164
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,000
...stick his tongue
to a railroad track on a bet.

165
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,970
And the fire department had to come
to get the guy's tongue off the track.

166
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,660
Because he couldn't get it off.

167
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,560
Come on, guys, wait up!

168
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,400
Come on, guys!

169
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,150
- Come on, guys, wait up.
- Out of the way, kid.

170
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,660
Hey, kid.

171
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,580
I can't get up.

172
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,410
I can't get up!

173
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,790
Ralph! Hey!

174
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,240
- I can't get up, Ralphie!
- Oh.

175
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,390
RALPHIE:
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.

176
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,260
I can't get up!

177
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,590
Ralph! Hey!

178
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,630
- Come on, get up. Sit up. Come on.
- I can't get up.

179
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,240
You're okay. Come on, let's go.
Come on, you're all right.

180
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,110
Shh. Miss Shields.

181
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,530
Miss Shields, Miss Shields.

182
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:13,340
All right, everyone,
take your seats, please.

183
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,410
Good morning, class.

184
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,430
Good morning, Miss Shields.

185
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,000
MISS SHIELDS:
Open your books to page 32.

186
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,970
And as you'll remember,
Silas Marner...

187
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,720
You're full of beans
and so is your old man.

188
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,100
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

189
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,600
- Says who?
- Says me.

190
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,020
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

191
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,730
Well, I double-dare you.

192
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,440
<i>The exact exchange and nuance</i>
<i>of phrase in this ritual is very important.</i>

193
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,860
Heh. Are you kidding?

194
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,440
Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?
That's dumb.

195
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,570
That's because you know it will stick.

196
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,570
- You're full of it.
- Oh, yeah?

197
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,660
- Yeah.
- Well, I double-dog dare you!

198
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,170
<i>Now it was serious.</i>
<i>A double-dog dare.</i>

199
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,420
<i>What else was left</i>
<i>but a triple dare you?</i>

200
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,940
- And finally, the coup de grâce-

201
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,090
<i>- The sinister triple-dog dare.</i>
- You guys are really dumb.

202
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,720
I triple-dog dare you!

203
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,220
<i>Schwartz created a slight breach</i>
<i>of etiquette...</i>

204
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,810
<i>...by skipping the triple dare</i>
<i>and going right for the throat.</i>

205
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,300
All right, all right.

206
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,190
Come on, kid.

207
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,110
Well, go on, smartass, and do it.

208
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,950
I'm going, I'm going.

209
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,240
<i>Flick's spine stiffened,</i>
<i>his lips curled in a defiant sneer.</i>

210
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,350
<i>There was no going back now.</i>

211
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,710
This is no...

212
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,300
Stuck? Stuck? Stuck!

213
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,720
Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!

214
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,370
Stuck!

215
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,770
- Stuck! Stuck!
- Geez. It really works.

216
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,020
- Look at him.
- It's stuck!

217
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,580
SCHWARTZ:
Hey, what have I done?

218
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,610
FLICK:
Don't leave, come back.

219
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,070
- Come back. Don't leave me. Come back.
- But the bell rang.

220
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,490
What are we gonna do?!

221
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,200
- I don't know. The bell rang.
- Yeah.

222
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,460
Hey, don't leave me. Come back!

223
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,850
Come back! Come back.

224
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,060
Where's Flick?

225
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,180
Has anyone seen Flick?

226
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,970
<i>Flick? Flick who?</i>

227
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,810
He was at recess, wasn't he?

228
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,780
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?

229
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,700
I said, has anyone seen Flick?

230
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,280
Yes, Esther Jane?

231
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,480
Oh, my God.

232
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,600
Holy cow, it's the fire department.

233
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,320
Oh, no.

234
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,770
Wow, it's the cops.

235
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,540
MISS SHIELDS: Now, I know that
some of you put Flick up to this.

236
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,650
But he has refused to say who.

237
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,750
But those who did it
know their blame.

238
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,770
And I'm sure that the guilt you feel
is far worse...

239
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,360
...than any punishment
you might receive.

240
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,990
Now, don't you feel terrible?

241
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,990
Don't you feel remorse
for what you have done?

242
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,990
Well, that's all I'm going to say
about poor Flick.

243
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,670
<i>Adults love to say things like that,</i>
<i>but kids know better.</i>

244
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,510
<i>We knew darn well it was always better</i>
<i>not to get caught.</i>

245
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,090
Now, boys and girls,
I'm going to give you an assignment.

246
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,850
I want you to write a theme.

247
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,560
"What I Want for Christmas."

248
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,020
<i>Aha! The clouds lifted.</i>

249
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,820
And I want it handed in
tomorrow morning...

250
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,030
<i>I saw a faint gleam of light...</i>

251
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,070
<i>...at the other end</i>
<i>of the black cave of doom.</i>

252
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,370
<i>I knew that when Miss Shields read</i>
<i>my magnificent, eloquent theme...</i>

253
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,040
<i>...that she would sympathize</i>
<i>with my plight...</i>

254
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,150
<i>...and everything</i>
<i>would work out somehow.</i>

255
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,430
Boy, did you see how it stuck?

256
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,850
Did it hurt, Flick?

257
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,730
No. I never felt a thing.

258
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,400
It just caught me off-guard.

259
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,980
You sure were bawling.

260
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,480
I never bawled.

261
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,120
Ah, baloney.

262
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,250
Scut Farkus.

263
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,590
<i>Scut Farkus. What a rotten name.</i>

264
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,010
<i>We were trapped.</i>

265
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,380
<i>There he stood,</i>
<i>between us and the alley.</i>

266
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,260
<i>Scut Farkus, staring out at us</i>
<i>with his yellow eyes.</i>

267
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,640
<i>He had yellow eyes.</i>

268
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,190
<i>So help me, God, yellow eyes.</i>

269
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,780
<i>Grover Dill,</i>
<i>Farkus' crummy little toady.</i>

270
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,290
<i>Mean, rotten.</i>
<i>His lips curled over his green teeth.</i>

271
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,120
<i>Randy lay there like a slug.</i>

272
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,390
<i>It was his only defense.</i>

273
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,010
- Say uncle.
- Uncle.

274
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,970
- Uncle.
- Uncle!

275
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,300
SCUT: Louder!
- Come on, get up. Now.

276
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,100
- Louder!
- Uncle!

277
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,930
- Louder.
- Uncle!

278
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,730
<i>In our world,</i>
<i>you were either a bully, a toady...</i>

279
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,770
<i>...or one of the nameless rabble</i>
<i>of victims.</i>

280
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,200
All right, who's next?

281
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,590
Ow!

282
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,050
Man.

283
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,980
<i>In the jungles of Kid-dom,</i>
<i>the mind switches gears rapidly.</i>

284
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,680
<i>Weeks ago, I had sent away...</i>

285
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,020
...for my Little Orphan Annie
<i>secret society decoder pin.</i>

286
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,190
<i>Oh, skunked again.</i>

287
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,480
<i>No matter.</i>
<i>Today, I had serious work to do.</i>

288
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,530
"What I want for Christmas."

289
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,190
What I want for Christmas
is a Red Ryder BB gun...

290
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,520
"...with a compass in the stock,
and this thing which tells time."

291
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,700
Wow, that's great.

292
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,650
"I think that everybody
should have a Red Ryder BB gun."

293
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,870
They're very good for Christmas.

294
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,080
"I don't think that a football's
a very good Christmas present."

295
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,460
<i>Oh, rarely had the words poured</i>
<i>from my penny pencil...</i>

296
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,610
<i>...with such feverish fluidity.</i>

297
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,980
I've won, I've won, I've won!
Hey, go on now.

298
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,370
Get out of here, you...!

299
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,940
I've won, I've won.

300
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,530
<i>Aha! The Bumpus hounds.</i>

301
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,490
<i>Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses,</i>
<i>had at least 785 smelly hound dogs.</i>

302
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,870
<i>And they ignored every other</i>
<i>human being on earth but my old man.</i>

303
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,540
Dumb dogs. Get.

304
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,660
I won. I won.

305
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,920
- I won, I won, I won!
- What? What is it? What?

306
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,130
A major prize, a major prize.
I won, I won, I won!

307
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,470
Hey, look at that. Look at that.
A Western Union telegram.

308
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,470
<i>Tonight tonight is gonna be the night</i>

309
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,930
<i>Tonight tonight hot damn tonight</i>

310
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,510
- What does this mean here?
- It means it's coming tonight!

311
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,730
I called Ernie McClosky
at the freight depot.

312
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,520
He said that the telegram was late,
the prize was there, he'll send it on tonight.

313
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,240
Come on, have a chew, fellas, on me.
It's my gift.

314
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,860
You know, maybe it'll be one of those
Spanish adobe houses down Coral Gate...

315
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,200
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.

316
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,370
Or it could be a bowling alley.

317
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,130
You know, a guy on Terre Haute
won a bowling alley.

318
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,420
How are they gonna deliver
a bowling alley here tonight?

319
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,710
They could send the deed
for chrissake.

320
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,430
I mean, I didn't expect they were gonna
send the whole damn bowling alley.

321
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,600
Yeah, well, how about eating, huh?
I'm starving to death.

322
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,190
Getting rich is hard work, kid.
Come on.

323
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,780
<i>Every family has a kid who won't eat.</i>

324
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,120
<i>My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily</i>
<i>in over three years.</i>

325
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,750
Oh, Randy, don't play
with your food, eat it.

326
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,000
Aw, gee.

327
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,630
Starving people
would be happy to have that.

328
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,860
Can I have some more red cabbage?

329
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,180
You stop playing with your food,
or I'll give you something to cry about.

330
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,860
You better stop fooling around
with that and eat it, or you'll be sorry.

331
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,860
Can I please have some more?

332
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,860
<i>My mother had not had a hot meal</i>
<i>for herself in 15 years.</i>

333
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,200
Meat loaf, smeetloaf, double beetloaf.

334
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,950
I hate meat loaf.

335
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,000
All right.
All right, I'll get that kid to eat.

336
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,040
Where's my screwdriver
and my plumber's helper?

337
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,790
- I'll open up his mouth and shove it in.
- Randy.

338
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,040
<i>My mother was more subtle.</i>

339
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,130
How do the little piggies go?

340
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,720
- Oink! Oink!
- That's right. Oink, oink.

341
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,050
Now, show me how the piggies eat.
This is your trough.

342
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,520
Show me how the piggies eat.

343
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,080
Be a good boy.
Show Mommy how the piggies eat.

344
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,340
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

345
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,480
Mommy's little piggy.

346
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,360
It is here.

347
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,910
- Yeah.
- Are you Parker?

348
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,830
- Yeah.
- All right, sign here, will you?

349
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,090
- Well, what is it?
- I don't know.

350
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,750
What's in it?

351
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,630
Here. Bring it in, huh?

352
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,090
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.
Move your tails.

353
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,130
Yeah. Bring it right on in. Right here.

354
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,970
Bring it ahead.
Straight ahead. That's right.

355
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,470
- Right.
- Here, bring it right, right on in, fellas.

356
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,060
That's it. Here we go.

357
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,480
A little more.

358
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,160
A little more. That's it.

359
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,150
Watch the lady.

360
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,620
- That's it.
- Thanks a lot, guys. Merry Christmas.

361
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,000
- Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.
- Okay.

362
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,340
"Fragile."

363
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,920
- It must be Italian.
- I think that says fragile, honey.

364
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,640
Oh, yeah.

365
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,810
Here we go.

366
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:36,430
Jeez, they really did a job on this,
you know?

367
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,210
No, here, Ralph, hold that.

368
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,950
Here we go.

369
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,120
Honey, there could be
anything in there.

370
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,510
Jesus.

371
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,790
Maybe they forgot.

372
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,510
No, it's in there.
It's gotta be in there.

373
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,140
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- What?

374
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,100
- Would you look at that?
- What?

375
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,010
Would you look at that?

376
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,850
What is it?

377
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,230
Well, it's a leg.

378
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,690
But what is it?

379
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,530
Well, it's a leg.
You know, like in a statue.

380
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,740
- Statue?
- Yeah, statue.

381
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,910
Yeah, statue.

382
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,370
Ralphie...

383
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,540
<i>My mother was trying</i>
<i>to insinuate herself...</i>

384
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,580
<i>...between us and the statue.</i>

385
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,750
Holy smoke, would you...?

386
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,750
Do you know what this is?

387
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,420
This is a lamp.

388
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,760
<i>- It was indeed a lamp.</i>
- Isn't that great?

389
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,720
What a great lamp.

390
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,790
Well, I don't know.

391
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,850
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.

392
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,270
<i>The old man's eyes boggled...</i>

393
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,440
Oh, wow!

394
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,940
<i>...overcome by art.</i>

395
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,110
And I know just the place for it.

396
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,940
Right in the middle
of our front-room window.

397
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,210
Uh...

398
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,960
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

399
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,460
Watch it.

400
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,130
Yeah, let's see.

401
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,790
Uh-huh.

402
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,050
Oh, Jesus, God.

403
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,730
Whew!

404
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,220
- Oh, honey?
- No. It's all right. It's all right.

405
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,760
It's all right.

406
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,720
Let's see...

407
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,640
This goes to the radio...

408
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,140
...and this goes to... And this goes...

409
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,510
- Well, it's just one too many.
- One is tough, yeah.

410
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,900
Well, let's see.

411
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,990
<i>The snap of a few sparks,</i>
<i>a quick whiff of ozone...</i>

412
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,700
<i>...and the lamp blazed forth</i>
<i>in unparalleled glory.</i>

413
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, look at that. Will you look at that?
Isn't that glorious?

414
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,080
It's indescribably beautiful.

415
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,630
It reminds me of the Fourth of July.
Turn off all the lights.

416
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,920
I wanna see
what it looks like from the street.

417
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,220
- I'll go get the dining room.
- Couldn't we talk this over?

418
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,430
Honey...

419
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,370
Move it a little bit to the right.

420
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,120
Yeah. A little that way.

421
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,830
Just a little more to the right.

422
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,210
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop.
Right there. That's wonderful.

423
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,130
Hey, Parker, what is that?

424
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,210
Don't bother me now, Swede.
I'm busy.

425
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,760
SWEDE: Yeah, but what is that?
MR. PARKER: It's a major award.

426
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,350
A major award?

427
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,220
Shucks, I wouldn't have knowed that.
It looks like a lamp.

428
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,140
Well, it is a lamp, you nincompoop.

429
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,190
But it's a major award. I won it.

430
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,900
- Damn, hell, you say you won it?
- Yeah.

431
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,070
Yeah, mind power, Swede, mind power.

432
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,490
<i>The entire neighborhood</i>

433

Oh, you should see what it looks like
from out here.

434
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,410
<i>It could be seen up and down</i>
<i>Cleveland Street.</i>

435
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,740
<i>The symbol of the old man's victory.</i>

436
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,870
Yeah, he won that.
It's a major award.

437
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,250
Isn't it about time
for somebody's favorite radio program?

438
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,670
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

439
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,590
<i>Holy smokes, it was 6:45.</i>

440

<i>The one with pretty auburn locks?</i>

<i>Whom do you see?</i>
<i>It's Little Orphan Annie</i>

445

Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.

F!

My life's work down the drain.

458

A semicolon, you dolt. A period.

Oh, F.

for all my life.

464
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,530
Listen to this sentence.

465
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:24,070
"A Red Ryder BB gun
with a compass in the stock...

466
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,750
...and this thing which tells time."

467
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,040
Poetry. Sheer poetry.

Ain't no needles coming off
this here tree.

Okay. Now, here's a tree.
This here is a tree.

- That's a little skimpy in the front there.
- Well, you just put it in the corner.

499
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,900
- Haven't you got a big tree?
- Yeah. Hell, this ain't no tree.

500

Now, here's a tree. This here is a tree.

501
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,370
- Well, did I choose that one, huh?
- Well, don't you think it's a little large?

502
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,700
No. What the hell. Listen, Christmas
only comes once a year. Why not?

503
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,330
- Why not?
- Yeah, well, how much?

504
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,380
I'll knock off $2 because
you're a man who knows his trees.

505
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,050
This isn't one of those trees
that all the needles falls off, is it?

506
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,710
No, that's them balsams.

507
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,510
<i>The old man loved bargaining</i>
<i>as much as an Arab trader...</i>

508
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,300
<i>...and he was twice as shrewd.</i>

509
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,180
You know, Dew Lock just bought one
of those brand-new, green plastic trees.

510
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,730
Oh, no.

511
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,560
Darn thing looks like it was made
out of green pipe cleaners.

512
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,730
This is a very nice tree.

513
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,320
- I'll throw in a rope and tie it to your car.
- You got a deal.

514
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,290
Deal.

515
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,540
Damn it, blow out.

516
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,980
- Aha!
- Not again.

517
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:26,070
Four minutes. Time me.

518
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,610
<i>Actually, my old man loved it.</i>
<i>He always saw himself in the pits...</i>

519
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,490
<i>...at the Indianapolis Speedway</i>
<i>in the 500.</i>

520
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,370
Uh-huh. Yeah.

521
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,830
<i>My old man's spare tires were actually</i>
<i>only tires in the academic sense.</i>

522
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,540
<i>They were round,</i>
<i>they had once been made of rubber.</i>

523
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,260
Here we go.

524
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,380
Ralphie.
Why don't you go help your father?

525
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,600
- Really? Can I?
- Yes.

526
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,600
- Watch the traffic there.
- Okay.

527
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,100
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>that it had been suggested...</i>

528
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:05,340
<i>...that I go help my father</i>
<i>with anything.</i>

529
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,610
- What are you doing here?
- Mom said I should help.

530
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,990
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

531
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,240
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.

532
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,740
Yeah, that's it. Now we've got it.

533
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,750
- Here you are. Hold this. Here.
- Okay.

534
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,500
No, not that way. Go on.
Come on, rat-trap, hold it like this. See?

535
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,960
- How?
- Like this. I want to put the nuts in it.

536
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,760
- Okay.
- See, there we are. There's four of them.

537
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,990
And we got it! Ha-ha-ha!

538
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,970
There it is. Oh, that son of a gun.

539
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,680
I'm gonna get that dirty...

540
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,520
There we go. And...

541
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,680
<i>For one brief moment,</i>
<i>I saw all the bolts...</i>

542
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,020
<i>...silhouetted against the lights</i>
<i>of the traffic, and then they were gone.</i>

543
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:53,020
Oh, fudge.

544
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,200
<i>Only I didn't say "fudge."</i>
<i>I said the word.</i>

545
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,830
<i>The big one.</i>
<i>The queen mother of dirty words.</i>

546
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,290
<i>The F-dash-dash-dash word.</i>

547
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,210
What did you say?

548
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,170
Uh, um...

549
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,220
That's what I thought you said.

550
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,930
Get in the car.

551
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,060
- Go on.
<i>- It was all over.</i>

552
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,390
<i>I was dead. What would it be?</i>
<i>The guillotine? Hanging?</i>

553
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,940
<i>The chair? The rack?</i>
<i>The Chinese water torture?</i>

554
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,690
<i>Mere child's play compared</i>
<i>to what surely awaited me.</i>

555
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,170
Everything go all right?

556
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,400
Ah!

557
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,990
Eight minutes.

558
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,600
- You know what your son just said?
- No. What?

559
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,540
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!

560
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,510
Ralphie!

561
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,440
<i>Over the years,</i>
<i>I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.</i>

562
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,400
<i>My personal preference is for Lux...</i>

563
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,990
<i>...but I found Palmolive had a nice,</i>
<i>piquant, after-dinner flavor.</i>

564
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:23,990
<i>Heady, but with just a touch</i>
<i>of mellow smoothness.</i>

565
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,830
<i>Lifebuoy, on the other hand....</i>

566
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,030
Ugh!

567
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,150
You ready to tell me?

568
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,970
All right.
Where did you hear that word?

569
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,720
<i>Now, I had heard that word at least</i>
<i>10 times a day from my old man.</i>

570
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,640
<i>My father worked in profanity the way</i>
<i>other artists might work in oils or clay.</i>

571
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,600
<i>It was his true medium. A master.</i>

572
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,020
<i>But I chickened out.</i>

573
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,690
<i>And I blurted out the first name</i>
<i>that came to mind.</i>

574
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,700
Schwartz.

575
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,530
Oh. I see.

576
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,460
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.

577
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,720
Mrs. Schwartz, do you know
what Ralph just said?

578
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,930
No. He said:

579
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,180
<i>No, not that!</i>

580
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,930
Yes, that.
Do you know where he heard it?

581
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,770
<i>Probably from his father.</i>

582
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,020
No. He heard it from your son.

583
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,690
<i>What?! What?!</i>

584
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,570
<i>What?!</i>

585
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,850
SCHWARTZ: What did I do,
<i>Mom? Why, I didn't do nothing.</i>

586
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:55,670
<i>Another shot of mysterious,</i>
<i>inexorable, official justice.</i>

587
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,880
Rinse out and go to bed.

588
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,590
Am I glad you finished your homework
this afternoon.

589
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,550
I want you getting right into bed.
I don't wanna see any lights on.

590
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:06,560
You are being punished,
so no comic book reading.

591
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,720
I'm gonna come in.
If there are lights on...

592
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:12,500
Don't you give me that look.
You're gonna get it.

593
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,740
Kids.

594
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,710
<i>Three blocks away,</i>
<i>Schwartz was getting his.</i>

595
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,380
<i>There has never been a kid</i>
<i>who didn't believe...</i>

596
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,550
<i>...vaguely but insistently...</i>

597
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,800
<i>...that he would be stricken blind</i>
<i>before he reached 21 .</i>

598
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,650
<i>And then, they'd be sorry.</i>

599
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,860
Why, it's Ralph.

600
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:06,480
Well, come on in, Ralph.
Where you been?

601
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,990
Why, he's carrying a cane.

602
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,040
Yeah. What is it, Ralph?
What happened?

603
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,540
- Why, he's blind!
- Blind?! Oh, my God.

604
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,670
Ralph.

605
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:25,300
- Ralph, is it something we did?
- What brought you to this lowly state?

606
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,800
Ralph, please tell us,
no matter how it hurts.

607
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,720
- What did we do?
- No, I can't.

608
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,390
Oh, please, Ralph.
I must know what we did.

609
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,640
- What brought you to this?
- Please.

610
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,690
Please.

611
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,860
Please?

612
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:43,900
- It was...
- Yes?

613
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,330
- Yes?
- Soap poisoning.

614
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,500
That's terrible. How could we do it?

615
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,790
Well, I'll manage
to get along somehow.

616
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,590
I'll never forgive myself.

617
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:06,590
- Thanks, Mom.
- I told you not to use Lifebuoy.

618
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:11,050
Oh, I feel awful.

619
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,930
Oh, God.

620
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,370
Thank you, Heather.

621
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,660
HEATHER: Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

622
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,830
- Thank you, Flick.
- Thank you.

623
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,170
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.

624
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,950
Merry Christmas.

625
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,740
Well, I just thought that you'd be
getting tired of the same old stuff.

626
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,570
<i>Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.</i>

627
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:17,490
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.

628
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,010
Merry Christmas.

629
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,890
Happy New Year.

630
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,750
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

631
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,870
<i>The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine</i>
<i>in order to get the Ovaltine inner seal...</i>

632
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,790
...to send off for my Little Orphan Annie
<i>secret decoder pin...</i>

633
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,340
<i>...was about to pay off.</i>

634
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,750
I got it.

635
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:12,250
"Master Ralph Parker."
My decoder pin.

636
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,410
All right.

637
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,350
"Be it known to all and sundry
that Ralph Parker..."

638
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,980
...is hereby appointed a member

"...and is entitled to all the honors
and benefits occurring thereto."

640
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,570
<i>Signed, Little Orphan Annie.</i>

641
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,240
<i>Countersigned, Pierre Andre.</i>

642
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,660
<i>In ink.</i>

643
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:41,210
<i>Honors and benefits.</i>
<i>Already at the age of 9.</i>

644
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,670
<i>But first, let's throw her overboard!</i>

645
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,250
<i>Hold fast, then overboard!</i>

646
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,960
<i>Come on, let's get on with it.</i>

647
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,510
<i>I don't need all that jazz</i>
<i>about smugglers and pirates.</i>

648
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,180
PIERRE: Listen tomorrow night
<i>for the concluding adventure...</i>

649
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,220
...of The Black Pirate Ship.

650
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,060
<i>Now it's time</i>
<i>for Annie's secret message...</i>

651
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,180
<i>...for you</i>
<i>members of the secret circle.</i>

652
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,560
<i>Remember, kids...</i>

653
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,480
<i>...only members of Annie's secret circle</i>
<i>can decode Annie's secret message.</i>

654
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,570
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>Annie is depending on you.</i>

655
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:15,880
<i>Set your pins to B-2.</i>

656
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,040
<i>Twelve. Eleven. Two.</i>

657
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,540
<i>I am in my first secret meeting.</i>

658
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,870
PIERRE:
<i>Fourteen. Eleven. Eighteen. Sixteen.</i>

659
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,920
<i>Pierre was in great voice tonight.</i>

660
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,300
<i>I could tell that tonight's message</i>
<i>was really important.</i>

661
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,380
<i>Three. Twenty-five.</i>

662
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:38,680
<i>That's a message from Annie herself.</i>
<i>Remember, don't tell anyone.</i>

663
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,140
Ninety seconds later,
<i>I'm in the only room in the house...</i>

664
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,950
<i>...where a boy of 9 could sit</i>
<i>in privacy and decode.</i>

665
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,110
<i>Aha! B.</i>

666
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,650
<i>I went to the next. E.</i>

667
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,780
<i>The first word is "be."</i>

668
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,410
<i>S. It was coming easier now.</i>

669
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,200
<i>U.</i>

670
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,910
- Aw, come on, Ralphie. I gotta go.
- Ralph?

671
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:10,150
I'll be right down, Ma. Gee, whiz.

672
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,670
T.

673
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,880
O.

674
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,380
<i>"Be sure to." Be sure to what?</i>

675
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,260
<i>What was Little Orphan Annie</i>
<i>trying to say? Be sure to what?</i>

676
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,100
Ralphie! Randy has got to go.
Will you please come out?

677
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,600
All right, Ma. I'll be right out.

678
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,270
<i>I was getting closer now.</i>

679
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:30,360
<i>The tension was terrible.</i>
<i>What was it?</i>

680
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,860
<i>The fate of the planet may hang</i>
<i>in the balance.</i>

681
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,780
Ralphie, Randy's gotta go!

682
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,780
I'll be right out, for crying out loud!

683
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,490
<i>Gee, almost there.</i>

684
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,700
<i>My fingers flew.</i>
<i>My mind was a steel trap.</i>

685
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,330
<i>Every pore vibrated.</i>
<i>It was almost clear.</i>

686
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,830
<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>

687
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:55,460
"Be sure to drink your Ovaltine."

688
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,630
Ovaltine?

689
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,530
A crummy commercial?

690
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,390
Son of a bitch.

691
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,980
<i>I went out to face the world again.</i>

692
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,950
<i>Wiser.</i>

693
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,330
- Red cabbage?
- That's for tomorrow night.

694
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,610
You love red cabbage, Ralphie.

695
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,500
You filthy system...!

696
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,970
Smelly watt-buster...

697
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:53,140
<i>What happened next</i>
<i>was a family controversy for years.</i>

698
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,760
What was that? what happened?

699
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,000
What happened?

700
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,630
What broke?

701
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,760
I don't know what happened.

702
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,760
I was watering my plant
and I broke your lamp.

703
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,740
Don't you touch that.

704
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,570
You were always jealous of this lamp.

705
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,490
- Jealous of a plastic leg?
- Jealous!

706
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,180
Jealous because I won.

707
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,710
That's ridiculous. Jealous.
Jealous of what?

708
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,550
That is the ugliest lamp
I have ever seen...

709
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,170
...in my entire life!

710
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,300
<i>Now it was out.</i>

711
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,260
Get the glue.

712
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:10,640
- We're out of glue.
- Get...!

713
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:16,640
You used up all the glue on purpose!

714
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,230
<i>The old man stood quivering</i>
<i>with fury...</i>

715
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:23,110
<i>...stammering, as he tried to come up</i>
<i>with a real crusher.</i>

716
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,690
Not a finger!

717
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,030
<i>With as much dignity</i>
<i>as he could muster...</i>

718
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,580
<i>...the old man gathered up</i>
<i>the sad remains...</i>

719
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,000
<i>...of his shattered major award.</i>

720
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,750
<i>Later that night, alone in the backyard,</i>
<i>he buried it next to the garage.</i>

721
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,840
<i>Now, I could never be sure...</i>

722
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,800
<i>...but I thought that I heard</i>
<i>the sound of "Taps" being played.</i>

723
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,510
<i>Gently.</i>

724
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,510
Know what I'm getting
my old man for Christmas?

725
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,140
- No. What?
- A rose that squirts.

726
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,350
People come to smell it,
it squirts them.

727
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,100
I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.

728
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,100
- A Flit gun?
- Yeah.

729
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,560
GROVER:
Stop right there.

730
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,990
<i>- If Dill said hi to you, you felt great.</i>
- Who, me?

731
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,950
<i>- Warm inside.</i>
- Yeah, you. Get over here.

732
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:51,030
<i>- But mostly, he just hit you in the mouth.</i>
- I can't now, Grover.

733
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,870
- I've gotta see Miss Shields.
- Yeah.

734
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,540
- Hey, come here! Get over here.
- Come back here. Come on, you!

735
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,080
SCUT: Yeah, come on!
GROVER: Hey, come here!

736
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,830
- You. Come here.
- Who, me?

737
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,130
No, your Aunt Tilly.
Yeah, you. Get over here.

738
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,800
<i>I left Flick to certain annihilation.</i>

739
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,590
<i>But BB-gun mania knows no loyalties.</i>

740
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,720
Uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle.

741
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,280
Uncle! Uncle!

742
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,230
All right, class...

743
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,860
...I have your Christmas themes
for you.

744
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,860
I'm pleased.

745
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,970
In general, you did very well.

746
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:36,910
However, I was disappointed
in the margins.

747
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:40,370
<i>Huh-huh-huh, this is it.</i>

748
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,960
<i>C plus? Oh, no, it can't be.</i>

749
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,590
C plus?

750
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,170
C plus?

751
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,980
C plus!

752
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,810
<i>Oh, no!</i>

753
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,640
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out"?</i>

754
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,060
Oh, no.

755
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,190
<i>My mother must have gotten</i>
<i>to Miss Shields.</i>

756
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,020
<i>There could be no other explanation.</i>

757
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:11,020
<i>You'll shoot your eye out</i>
<i>You'll shoot your eye out</i>

758
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:15,280
<i>Was there no end to this conspiracy</i>
<i>of irrational prejudice...</i>

759
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,870
<i>...against Red Ryder</i>
<i>and his peacemaker?</i>

760
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,620
These multiplication
questions were most missed...

761
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,040
...in our last math test.

762
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,000
Would you answer in unison, please?

763
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,880
<i>I was surrounded by happier kids...</i>

764
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,960
<i>...who were all going to get</i>
<i>what they wanted for Christmas.</i>

765
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,680
Fifty-six.

766
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,620
GROVER:
Hey, four-eyes.

767
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,670
How'd you like
your snowball sandwich?

768
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:10,060
Maybe you'd like another one.

769
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,550
Listen, jerk.

770
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:18,850
When I tell you to come,
you better come.

771
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,520
What, are you gonna cry now?

772
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,600
Come on, crybaby, cry for me.

773
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,400
Come on. Cry.

774
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,320
<i>Deep in the recesses of my brain...</i>

775
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:35,070
<i>...a tiny, red-hot little flame</i>
<i>began to grow.</i>

776
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,750
- Hey!
<i>- Something had happened.</i>

777
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:53,030
<i>A fuse blew</i>
<i>and I had gone out of my skull.</i>

778
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,180
Hey. Hey!

779
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,570
Hey, kid!

780
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,300
I'm telling my dad.

781
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:10,070
Hey, Ralphie! All right, Ralphie.

782
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,070
Beat him up! Beat him up!

783
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:21,370
- Come on, hit him!
- Hit him!

784
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:24,080
- Hang him!
- Hit him! Kill him!

785
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,250
You no-good damn knuckle!
Fanged dongs stinking bitch!

786
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,210
- Come on.
- Enough with you, dork head.

787
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,930
Did you hear what he said?

788
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,590
Holy smokes!

789
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,930
<i>I have since heard of people</i>
<i>under extreme duress...</i>

790
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:43,510
<i>...speaking in strange tongues.</i>

791
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,980
<i>I became conscious</i>
<i>that a steady torrent of obscenities...</i>

792
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:52,980
<i>...and swearing of all kinds</i>
<i>was pouring out of me as I screamed.</i>

793
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,680
Ralph, shh, your mother.

794
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,780
Ralphie! Ralphie! Ralphie!

795
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,630
Ralphie!

796
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,790
Ralphie!

797
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:10,170
Ralphie!

798
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:12,250
Ralphie!

799
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,840
Ralphie?

800
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:23,550
Come on. We're going home.
Come on.

801
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,050
Uh-oh.

802
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:39,820
Let's go, man. Come on.
Let's go.

803
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,160
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.

804
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,170
Get in there.

805
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,540
Okay. Put your head down in there.

806
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,580
Come on. Get down in here.

807
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,590
Settle down.

808
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,670
Honey, I want you to go in there...

809
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:01,300
...and lie down in your room
for a while.

810
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,500
Ralphie, just settle down.

811
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,520
Come on. Here, dry off.

812
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,230
Calm down.

813
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:15,040
All right. Now go lie down.

814
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,130
<i>The light was getting purple</i>
<i>and soft outside.</i>

815
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:42,130
<i>Almost time for my father</i>
<i>to come home from work.</i>

816
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:56,730
Randy.

817
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,070
Hi.

818
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:02,030
What's the matter?
What are you crying for?

819
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,990
Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie.

820
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,570
No, he's not.

821
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,700
- Yes, he is too.
- No, he's not.

822
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:14,750
I promise you,
Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.

823
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,420
Why don't you come on out of there?

824
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,740
Huh?

825
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,880
Would you like some milk?

826
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,460
You would?

827
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,590
Here you go.

828
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,440
All right?

829
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,940
I'll see you later?

830
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,430
Okay. Bye-bye.

831
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:54,540
<i>I heard the car roar up the driveway,</i>
<i>and a wave of terror broke over me.</i>

832
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:57,790
<i>He'll know what I said,</i>
<i>the awful things that I've said.</i>

833
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,290
Get out of here. Go on.
Get out of here!

834
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,840
Go on home, you mangy mutts.
Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...!

835
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,220
Hey, Bumpus. Get over here
and get your stinking dogs!

836
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:13,000
Hey, come on, what's
for dinner? I'm starving to death.

837
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,450
Well, what happened today?

838
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,290
Where's your glasses?

839
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,960
Did you lose your glasses again?

840
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,750
Uh, Ralphie, remember you left these
on the radio again.

841
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,720
Now, try not to do that anymore.

842
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,760
So, what else happened today?

843
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,510
Oh, nothing much.

844
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,520
Ralphie had a fight.

845
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,310
A fight? What kind of a fight?

846
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:01,690
Oh, you know how boys are.

847
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:06,280
I gave him a talking-to.

848
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:11,410
I see that the Bears
are playing Green Bay on Sunday.

849
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:14,790
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.

850
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,950
Oh, well, he'll freeze his keister off
out there.

851
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:23,670
<i>I slowly began to realize</i>
<i>I was not about to be destroyed.</i>

852
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,880
The Chicago Bears.

853
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,340
The terror of the midway.
What a laugh...

854
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:33,010
<i>From then on, things were different</i>
<i>between me and my mother.</i>

855
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:37,140
Well, more like
the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.

856
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,050
But Bears, never.

857
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,650
<i>Strange.</i>

858
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:45,570
<i>Even something as monumental</i>
<i>as the Scut Farkus affair...</i>

859
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,490
<i>...as it came to be known,</i>
<i>was pushed out of my mind...</i>

860
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:52,740
<i>...as I struggled for a way out</i>
<i>of the impenetrable BB-gun web...</i>

861
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,080
<i>...in which my mother</i>
<i>had me trapped.</i>

862
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,990
Santa!

863
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,410
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.

864
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,420
<i>Of course. Santa.</i>

865
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,710
<i>The big man. The head honcho.</i>

866
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,250
<i>The connection.</i>

867
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,710
<i>My mother had slipped up this time.</i>

868
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:34,320
- Mickey! Mickey!
- Yeah!

869
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:51,470
Mom, the store's gonna close soon
and Santa's gonna be gone.

870
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:57,310
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.
Just be still.

871
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:07,610
Mom, this is just the same
old dumb parade as last year.

872
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,070
Ralphie, will you please calm down?

873
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,490
- Mom!
- Hush!

874
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:14,590
Shut up, Ralphie.

875
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:24,330
- There he is.
- Santa, Santa!

876
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,210
Yeah.

877
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:31,340
Hey, Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho!

878
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,720
Santa.

879
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,300
Have you been a good boy? Have you?

880
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,680
Can we go now? Can we go?

881
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,470
- Yes.
- Yes, we can go now.

882
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,860
Come on, Ralphie.

883
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:54,280
SANTA:
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas.

884
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,450
Merry Christmas. Ho-ho-ho!

885
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,870
RALPHIE:
Come on, Randy, hurry up.

886
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:03,740
SANTA:
Santa can't wait all night. Let's go.

887
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:06,110
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

888
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,590
Ralphie, look over there.

889
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:17,050
- See, the line's not so long.
- Yeah.

890
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,800
Go get in it. Take Randy's hand
and hold on to him.

891
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,060
- We will see you later, okay?
- Yeah, stay together, don't get lost.

892
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,930
Okay.

893
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,680
Come on. Let's go.

894
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,900
Young man.

895
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,240
Hey, kid.
Just where do you think you're going?

896
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,700
Going up to see Santa.

897
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,410
The line ends here.

898
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,950
It begins there.

899
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,040
Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho!

900
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,790
Come on, come up, boys and girls.

901
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:50,570
Hurry up.

902
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,170
Let's go.

903
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,840
Oh, no.

904
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,970
Come on.

905
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:03,180
<i>The line waiting to see Santa Claus</i>
<i>stretched all the way...</i>

906
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,770
<i>...back to Terre Haute.</i>

907
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:08,690
<i>And I was at the end of it.</i>

908
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,650
- Merry Christmas.
- I like Santa.

909
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:14,610
Yeah.

910
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,490
Come on. Welcome. Come on.

911
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,900
<i>Let's face it.</i>
<i>Most of us were scoffers.</i>

912
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:24,790
<i>But moments before zero hour,</i>
<i>it did not pay to take chances.</i>

913
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:29,330
The chocolate snowman
eats little boys.

914
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:32,330
I'll get you, my pretty.

915
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,670
What a tasty little boy.

916
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:37,260
Don't bother me.

917
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:40,940
I'm thinking.

918
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:46,270
I like The Wizard of Oz.

919
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,480
Yeah.

920
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,680
I like the Tin Man.

921
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:59,410
If Higbee thinks I'm working
one minute past 9, he can kiss my foot.

922
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,660
Come on, up on Santa's lap.

923
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,660
There's a wet one.

924
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:07,120
And what's your name, little boy?

925
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,910
- Have you been a good boy?
- Come on, Randy.

926
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,080
And what do you want
for Christmas, Billy?

927
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,750
A toy truck? Get him off my lap.

928
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,550
Quick, get me a towel.

929
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:20,340
Bye, Billy. Ho-ho-ho!

930
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:28,900
Oh, I hate the smell of tapioca.

931
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:33,350
Attention, shoppers.
<i>It is now 9 p.m. and our store is closed.</i>

932
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,190
<i>Nine o'clock? Great Scott!</i>

933
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:37,320
<i>The store's gonna close.</i>

934
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,490
Santa can't wait all night. Let's go.

935
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:43,030
Come on up on Santa's lap.

936
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:45,620
Ho-ho-ho!

937
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,920
Get moving, kid.

938
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,630
Quit dragging your feet.

939
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:01,090
Come up. Ho-ho-ho!

940
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:04,430
Ho-ho-ho!

941
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:07,480
Ho-ho-ho!

942
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,900
Uh-oh. Get him out of here.

943
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,950
Come on, kid.

944
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,620
Ho-ho-ho!

945
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,880
Come on.

946
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,370
Come on up. Come on up there.

947
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:34,830
Ho-ho-ho!

948
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:38,670
Ho-ho-ho!

949
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:42,590
Ho-ho-ho!

950
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:46,550
And what's your name, little boy?

951
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:50,760
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing.

952
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,700
Come on!

953
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:57,020
Listen, little boy, we got a lot of people
waiting here, so get going.

954
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,610
Come on. Yeah. Come on.

955
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:02,900
What do you want for Christmas,
little boy?

956
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,110
<i>My mind had gone blank.</i>

957
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:07,820
<i>Frantically, I tried to remember</i>
<i>what it was I wanted.</i>

958
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,830
<i>I was blowing it, blowing it.</i>

959
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,990
Come on, kid.

960
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,290
How about a nice football?

961
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,920
<i>Football. Football. What's a football?</i>

962
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,170
<i>Without conscious will,</i>
<i>my voice squeaked out:</i>

963
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,800
- Yeah.
- Football.

964
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,130
Okay, get him out of here.

965
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,470
<i>A football. Oh, no.</i>
<i>What was I doing?</i>

966
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:34,470
<i>- Wake up, stupid, wake up. No!</i>
- No!

967
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,400
No, no! I want an official...

968
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,110
...Red Ryder carbine action
200-shot range model air rifle.

969
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:48,020
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

970
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:50,990
Merry Christmas.

971
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,410
Ho-ho-ho!

972
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:59,410
No!

973
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:02,000
Ho-ho-ho!

974
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,170
And we're here to see the Wizard
<i>The wonderful wizard of Oz...</i>

975
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:10,570
I'll see you in Oz, folks.

976
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,310
Well, did you...?

977
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,730
Up.

978
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,940
- Did you see Santa Claus?
- Yeah.

979
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,270
Did you tell him
what you wanted for Christmas?

980
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:25,650
- Yeah.
- Did he ask you if you'd been a good boy?

981
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,190
No.

982
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,990
Don't worry, he knows.

983
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,070
He always knows.

984
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,370
Merry Christmas.

985
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:38,040
Merry Christmas. Ho-ho-ho.

986
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,210
Okay, down you go. Bye-bye, Chris.

987
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:47,640
Merry Christmas. Ho-ho-ho!

988
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:55,060
That's fine.

989
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,720
Now, wait a minute.
All right. Plug her in.

990
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,560
It is, it is.

991
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,310
Well, the green string is out.

992
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,860
No, the green is on.
It's the blue that's out.

993
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:08,070
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.
I'm not colorblind.

994
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,990
I'm not colorblind either.

995
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,160
There.

996
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,980
There, see, I told you it was green.

997
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,750
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

998
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,750
Hold it right there!

999
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,130
A fuse is out.

1000
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:28,920
<i>The old man could replace fuses</i>
<i>quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.</i>

1001
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,610
<i>He bought them by the gross.</i>

1002
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,010
Ha.

1003
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:38,430
- Ah.
- Oh, well.

1004
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,710
My, isn't that pretty?

1005
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,020
Hot son of a gun.

1006
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:47,440
No, that star is crooked.

1007
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,780
That star is perfectly straight.

1008
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:52,360
- Careful!
- That'll do it. It's all right. That's it.

1009
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,410
- Oh, be careful.
- I am, I am. It's...

1010
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:58,490
Come on, let's set up the other thing.
Just let me get it fixed.

1011
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:02,290
That's all right.

1012
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:04,790
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1013
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:08,610
Hey! Perfect.

1014
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,470
Oh, goodness, look at the time.

1015
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,970
I hope Santa hasn't had
to pass up this house...

1016
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,720
...just because some boys
weren't in bed when he came by.

1017
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,470
Yeah, I thought I heard
Santa's sleigh bells...

1018
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,770
...a little while ago going up
the other side of the street.

1019
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:26,480
- All right, you two, upstairs.
- Come on.

1020
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,260
Come on. On the double,
on the double:

1021
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,430
Okay, let's get them.

1022
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,430
Wow.

1023
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,090
Wow.

1024
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:48,790
Randy. Randy, come on.
Get up, Randy.

1025
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,730
<i>Santa Claus had come.</i>

1026
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,950
Wow, a truck. That's mine!

1027
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,170
Wow, look over here! That's mine!

1028
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,080
Oh, what's in here?

1029
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,500
Oh, it's hard.

1030
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,100
Fire truck. Oh, boy, that's mine!

1031
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:20,830
Hey!

1032
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:26,810
Does this raise?

1033
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:36,220
Dad, Dad.

1034
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:42,700
Merry Christmas!

1035
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,870
- Merry Christmas, you two.
- Merry Christmas.

1036
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:49,040
Now, Randy, no.
Wait for Christmas to start, honey.

1037
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,000
- I wanna play Santa.
- Well, wait a minute, Randy.

1038
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,710
You played Santa.
He played Santa last year, didn't he?

1039
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:57,050
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Ralphie, you play Santa this time.

1040
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:59,550
- Come on, Ralphie.
- Well, who should I start with?

1041
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,590
- Well, give Randy a present.
- Yeah! Yeah!

1042
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,720
And I think I see Aunt Clara's gift
to you right over there.

1043
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,520
She always sends you
such wonderful presents, Ralphie.

1044
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,890
- Give me mine, Ralphie. Come on.
- Okay.

1045
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,900
Come on, Ralph.

1046
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,830
<i>Christmas had come. Officially.</i>

1047
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:34,080
<i>We plunged into the cornucopia,</i>
<i>quivering with desire...</i>

1048
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,920
<i>...and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.</i>

1049
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,760
Didn't I get a tie this year?

1050
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,590
Wow. Whoopee!

1051
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,550
A zeppelin.

1052
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,180
A can of simonize.

1053
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:54,100
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?
Show everybody.

1054
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,030
I don't want to.

1055
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,570
Ralphie, show everybody
what Aunt Clara gave you.

1056
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:05,370
<i>Aunt Clara had for years labored</i>
<i>under the delusion...</i>

1057
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:10,700
<i>...that I was not only perpetually</i>
<i>4 years old, but also a girl.</i>

1058
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:16,710
She just always gives you
the nicest things, Ralphie.

1059
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:18,880
Oh, my God.

1060
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,880
Oh, isn't that sweet?

1061
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,680
Ralph, go upstairs and try it on if you...

1062
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,180
I don't want to.

1063
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,510
Go upstairs right now
and try on that present.

1064
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:31,720
She went to all that trouble to make it.
Now, go on.

1065
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,820
While Ralphie is changing,
I'm gonna play Santa Claus.

1066
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:46,950
Now, let me see. What can I fi...?
Oh, I see something.

1067
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:50,620
- Randy. This is for you, honey.
- Oh, Jesus.

1068
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:55,920
- Oh, and this is for Daddy.
- Oh, boy.

1069
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,830
- Here. From me to you.
- Oh!

1070
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,590
Thanks a lot.

1071
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:06,760
I wonder what it could be.

1072
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,510
Only one way to find out, isn't there?

1073
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:12,430
Well, it's a blue ball.

1074
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:16,390
Oh, it's a bowling ball.

1075
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,230
- Thank you, darling.
- Do you like it?

1076
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:21,360
Yes, very much. Very much.

1077
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,650
Ralphie! We're waiting!

1078
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:26,780
Oh, come on, Mom.

1079
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,110
Right now!

1080
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:42,050
<i>Immediately, my feet began to sweat</i>
<i>as those two fluffy little bunnies...</i>

1081
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:46,260
<i>...with the blue button eyes</i>
<i>stared sappily up at me.</i>

1082
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:49,800
Come down here
so I can see you better.

1083
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,140
<i>I just hoped that Flick</i>
<i>would never spot them...</i>

1084
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,060
<i>...as the word of this humiliation</i>
<i>could easily make life...</i>

1085
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,140
<i>...at Warren G. Harding School</i>
<i>a veritable hell.</i>

1086
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,520
Oh! Isn't that cu...?

1087
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,350
That is the most precious thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1088
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,820
Shut up, Randy.

1089
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:11,120
He looks
like a deranged Easter bunny.

1090
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,830
- He does not.
- He does too.

1091
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:16,290
He looks like a pink nightmare.

1092
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,330
Are you happy wearing that?

1093
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:21,290
Do you want to take it off?
Tell the kid to take it off.

1094
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:24,500
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
Go on and take it off.

1095
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,090
Take it off!

1096
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,640
My God, would you look at that mess?

1097
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,350
- Who's gonna clean the papers up?
- Not me.

1098
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:36,850
- Oh, no?
- Randy did it last year.

1099
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:40,210
Well, he can do it again.

1100
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,310
You know, this wine is not bad.

1101
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,440
It's not good either, but...
You want a sip?

1102
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,240
- Yeah.
- No, you don't.

1103
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,030
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Yeah, pretty nice.

1104
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:52,660
Yeah? Did you get everything
you wanted?

1105
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,030
Well, almost.

1106
01:19:54,030 --> 01:20:00,000
Almost, huh? Well, that's life.
Well, there's always next Christmas.

1107
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,040
Yup.

1108
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,960
Hey, that's funny.

1109
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,800
- What's that over there behind the desk?
- Where?

1110
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,870
Over behind the desk
against the wall over there.

1111
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,760
Why don't you go check it out?

1112
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,220
Go on.

1113
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,320
What did we put over there, honey?

1114
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,280
Santa Claus probably put it.

1115
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:39,130
You...

1116
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,380
Wow.

1117
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:17,950
<i>Oh, it was beautiful.</i>
<i>I could hardly wait to try it out.</i>

1118
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,080
- Do you know how to load it?
- Yeah.

1119
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,400
Yeah?

1120
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:25,750
Be careful. That's right.

1121
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:33,470
Be careful.

1122
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:36,310
Don't. They run all over.

1123
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,940
Close her up. Close it up.

1124
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,650
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?

1125
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:49,770
- Sure.
- Okay. But outside.

1126
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:52,900
Oh, I still say those things
are dangerous.

1127
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:58,900
No, no! Put on your galoshes
and your coat. It's cold out.

1128
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:02,800
I had one when I was 8 years old.

1129
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,680
- What if he hurts himself?
- Hey!

1130
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,650
Ralphie, your coat!

1131
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:10,750
- Don't shoot any animals or birds.
- Except the Bumpuses' dogs.

1132
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:14,720
Oh, you hush. Be careful, Ralphie.

1133
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:17,300
<i>Now, it is well-known</i>
<i>throughout the Midwest...</i>

1134
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:20,580
<i>...that the old man</i>
<i>is a turkey junkie.</i>

1135
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:23,830
<i>- A bona fide garley turkicanus freak.</i>
- Go fix your plumbing.

1136
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:27,050
<i>A few days before Christmas</i>
<i>his eyes would begin to gleam...</i>

1137
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:31,820
<i>- ...with a wild and ravenous light.</i>
- Go in the other room.

1138
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:39,280
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.

1139
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,670
<i>Oh, my God! I shot my eye out.</i>

1140
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:55,590
<i>You'll shoot your eye out, kid.</i>

1141
01:22:55,590 --> 01:23:00,730
<i>You'll shoot your eye out</i>
<i>You'll shoot your eye out</i>

1142
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:03,960
Ralphie, you be careful out there.
Don't shoot your eye out.

1143
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:06,930
<i>She hadn't seen. She didn't know.</i>

1144
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,940
<i>My eye's all right.</i>
<i>The BB must have hit my glasses.</i>

1145
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:15,870
<i>My glasses.</i>
<i>Oh, no, where are my glasses?</i>

1146
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:19,340
<i>Few things brought such swift</i>
<i>and terrible retribution on a kid...</i>

1147
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:23,220
<i>...as a pair of busted glasses.</i>

1148
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,920
Stop!

1149
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,730
Oh, no.

1150
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:48,490
<i>Oh, no. Pulverized.</i>

1151
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,820
Oh, no.

1152
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:03,280
<i>For a moment, I thought, I'll fake it.</i>
<i>They'll never know the lens is gone.</i>

1153
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,660
Oh, no.

1154
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:07,700
<i>Rapidly my mind evolved</i>
<i>a spectacular plot.</i>

1155
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,290
<i>Let's see, an icicle. Yeah.</i>

1156
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:12,920
<i>Falls off the garage</i>
<i>and hits me in the eye.</i>

1157
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,310
<i>It would work. It had to work.</i>
<i>Quickly, I whipped up some tears.</i>

1158
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:20,190
Ralphie?

1159
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,000
What's the matter, honey?

1160
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,680
Oh, what happened? What is it?

1161
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,240
Let me see that. What is it?

1162
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,400
There was this icicle
and it fell off the garage and hit me.

1163
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,830
Come on inside out of the cold.
What is this?

1164
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:37,530
- What?
- No, it's okay.

1165
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:41,240
Just read your funnies. It's all right.

1166
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:47,060
Randy. Wake up, Randy.

1167
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:50,540
Oh, God.

1168
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:54,460
It hit my cheek
and it broke my glasses.

1169
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:59,170
- And I tried to get out of the way, but I...
- Let's try this. Wait a second.

1170
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:03,010
There, see, it's just a little bump.

1171
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:06,010
Ralphie, you're lucky
it didn't cut your eye.

1172
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:09,890
Those icicles have been known
to kill people.

1173
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,050
- What's going on up there?
- Nothing. We'll be right down.

1174
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:19,830
You stay away from that turkey.

1175
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,680
It's got an hour to cook.
You'll get worms.

1176
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,190
But what about my glasses?

1177
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:31,890
You can wear the old ones
with the crack in them...

1178
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:35,950
...until we get you
some new ones, okay?

1179
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:39,710
<i>I had pulled it off.</i>

1180
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:41,630
But I left my gun outside.

1181
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:46,180
Yeah. Well, when you get dressed
you can go out and get your gun, okay?

1182
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,890
Hold that on there.

1183
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:49,890
<i>Life is like that.</i>

1184
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:54,890
<i>Sometimes at the height of our revelries</i>
<i>when our joy is at its zenith...</i>

1185
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,940
<i>...when all is most right</i>
<i>with the world...</i>

1186
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:03,940
<i>...the most unthinkable disasters</i>
<i>descend upon us.</i>

1187
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:18,160
The turkey!

1188
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:25,560
Oh, my God.

1189
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,280
You sons of...!

1190
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:39,050
Sons of bitches! Bumpuses!

1191
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:54,410
<i>The heavenly aroma</i>
<i>still hung heavy in the house.</i>

1192
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,290
<i>But it was gone. All gone.</i>

1193
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:59,580
<i>No turkey. No turkey sandwiches.</i>
<i>No turkey salad.</i>

1194
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,590
<i>No turkey gravy, turkey hash...</i>

1195
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:04,210
<i>...turkey à la king,</i>
<i>or gallons of turkey soup.</i>

1196
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:08,350
<i>Gone! All gone!</i>

1197
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:16,640
All right! Everybody upstairs.
Get dressed.

1198
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,620
We are going out to eat.

1199
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:42,750
No, no, no.

1200
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:45,800
No, no, no.
Not "ra, ra, ra, ra"...

1201
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,340
...la, la, la, la.

1202
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,100
Sing like this:

1203
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,050
Try again.

1204
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,150
Stop, stop, stop.

1205
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,130
Sing something else.

1206
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,550
No, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1207
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:31,780
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.

1208
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

1209
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,060
- Oh, yes.
- Look at that.

1210
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:47,070
It's a beautiful duck. Yes, it really is.

1211
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:52,950
It's... But you see, it's...

1212
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:58,890
- What?
- It's smiling at me.

1213
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:03,860
Okay?

1214
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,630
- Beautiful.
- Yeah. Yes, it's...

1215
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:08,490
- Wonderful, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

1216
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:11,770
<i>That Christmas would live</i>
<i>in our memories as the Christmas...</i>

1217
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15,010
<i>...when we were introduced</i>
<i>to Chinese turkey.</i>

1218
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,560
<i>All was right with the world.</i>

1219
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,790
Oh, honey, come over here.
Look at this.

1220
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:45,500
Ooh, is that beautiful.

1221
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,700
Oh!

1222
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,890
Merry Christmas.

1223
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:34,420
<i>Next to me in the blackness</i>
<i>lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.</i>

1224
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:37,180
<i>The greatest Christmas gift</i>
<i>I had ever received...</i>

1225
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,760
<i>...or would ever receive.</i>

1226
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,010
<i>Gradually, I drifted off to sleep...</i>

1227
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:48,020
<i>...pranging ducks on the wing</i>
<i>and getting off spectacular hip shots.</i>

1228
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,920
