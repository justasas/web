1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,750
One time a year,
there's a marvelous night,

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,750
When enchantment and wonder
spark and take flight

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,470
Each home fills with joy
on this grand holiday,

4
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,857
With hearts growing warm
in a magical way

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,230
The rooms are all covered
with garment and wreaths
The mantel is ready with stockings beneath

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,690
Lights twinkle and glow
and bells brightly chime

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,170
The moment's arrived, it's here,
Christmas time

8
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,170
Three precious gifts
lie under this tree

9
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,200
What secrets they hold,
Let's look and we'll see

10
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,610
The first tells a story
for us all to hear

11
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,730
About laughter and family,
and those we hold dear

12
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,640
We love Christmas so much,
we want it to stay

13
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:30,170
But what if we wished
it was here every day?

14
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:38,600
Anchors aweigh

15
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,940
Full steam ahead

16
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,971
Swab the deck, you

17
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,010
All aboard Next stop, Funnyville

18
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,160
It's here

19
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,730
- The one
- The only

20
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,850
best day of the year
It's Christmas

21
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,690
Oh, boy Just what we always wanted

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,130
- Hey, look at this
- Cool

23
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:39,600
Merry Christmas, boys

24
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:53,710
You know we have to wait
for the family

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,180
Sorry, Uncle Donald

26
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:03,910
Ah, it's Christmas,

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,470
and I've got a special surprise
for you

28
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:22,310
But you didn't even
read the card

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,960
We'll read it later

30
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,530
- Merry Christmas, everybody
- Merry Christmas, indeed

31
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,210
Where are my boys and my kisses?

32
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,914
I could just eat you up

33
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:47,742
Oh, Donald?

34
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,330
Oh, boy

35
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,850
Aunt Daisy, catch ya later

36
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,990
Last one down the hill's
a rotten egg

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,550
Not me

38
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,114
Boys Dinner

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,310
The one thing better

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,620
than presents

41
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,310
is Christmas dinner

42
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,285
Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered
for a wonderful meal

43
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,630
It's my favorite part of Christmas

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,320
- Turkey
- Donald, would you like to carve?

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,914
Boys Where are your manners?

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,790
- This turkey is so good
- Your gravy never has lumps

47
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,710
We love your cooking,
Aunt Daisy

48
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:01,914
Donald,
they're just enjoying my dinner

49
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,714
I don't want any

50
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,200
All right, who's for carolling?

51
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:10,890
We don't wanna sing,
Uncle Scrooge

52
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,810
We wanna play with our toys

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
- Bedtime, boys
- Not yet

54
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:29,640
Christmas can't be over already

55
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,485
Good night, boys

56
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,850
What a great day

57
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,314
We should do it more often

58
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:44,530
Yeah Once a week should be enough

59
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,290
It'll be another 365 days
until we get more Christmas

60
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,771
Star light, star bright,

61
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,570
first star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might,

62
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,040
have the wish I wish tonight

63
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,760
We wish it was Christmas
every day

All aboard Next stop, Funnyville

65
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,142
Boy, those guys

66
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:34,057
They're gonna
play with it again today?

67
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:35,970
Let's play with our new toys

68
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,650
They're gone

69
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:46,890
Hey, what is this?

70
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,970
Didn't we open these yesterday?

71
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:01,971
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

72
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,800
There's only one way to find out

73
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,500
We're gonna have to open
these presents

74
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,590
Merry Christmas

75
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,457
- Uncle Donald, we did it
- It's Christmas again

76
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,885
It's Christmas again, Uncle Donald

77
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,742
Two days in a row

78
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,400
You boys must have been dreaming

79
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:45,750
We almost forgot
about our special surprise

80
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,600
Where are my kisses?
I could just eat you up

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,714
We should have seen that coming

82
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,514
Last one down the hill's
a rotten egg

83
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:13,910
Again

84
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:18,190
Boys, dinner

Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered
for a wonderful meal

86
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,230
This is my favorite part
of Christmas

Turkey

88
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,830
Boys Where are your manners?

89
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,430
Donald,
they're just enjoying my dinner

90
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,830
Good night, boys

91
00:08:57,742 --> 00:09:00,790

96
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,000
Where are my boys and my kisses?

97
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:37,000
No, you don't

98
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,830
I think this is my favorite part
of Christmas

99
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,580
Merry Christmas, boys

100
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,670

101
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,270
my favorite part of Christmas

102

All aboard Next stop, Funnyville

Please

105
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,670
Where are my kisses?

106
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,350
Funnyville

107
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,270
my favourite part

108
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,790
Who's for carolling?

109
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,310
Looks like the end of the line

110
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:52,370
Until tomorrow,
when it happens all over again

111
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,410
You're right Yesterday's today,
and today's tomorrow,

112
00:10:57,714 --> 00:11:00,060
and it's gonna be the same thing

113
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,570
day in and day out

114
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,290
Get a grip

115
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:08,690
I'm sorry, fellas

116
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,450
That's OK. We know how you feel

117
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:15,690
If I see the same toys again,
I'll go out of my mind

118
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,514
Yeah, and if I eat any more turkey,

119
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,770
I'm gonna need new clothes

120
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:25,290
We got to do something
to liven things up

121
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,650
Green leader to red leader

122
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:37,330
Initiate pancake intercept sequence

123
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:38,571
Roger

124
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:57,210
Donald, stop playing
with the boys' presents

125
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,171
Where are my boys, and my kisses?

126
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,371
Right here, Aunt Gertie

127
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,210
Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered
for a wonderful meal

128
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,010
It's my favourite part of Christmas

129
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,410
Oh Turkey

130
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,228
Not the piano
Not my beloved carols

131
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,257
Well, we still have the tree

132
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,350
Let's run
before Uncle Donald gets mad

133
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,285
We'll be outside
if you need us

134
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,390
Donald, are you all right?

135
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:06,260
"To Huey, Dewey and Louie,

136
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,571
Christmas isn't about candy canes,

137
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:12,428
holly or lights all aglow,

138
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,350
it's about the hearts that we touch,

139
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:18,030
and the care that we show"

140
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,110
"Wishing you lots of love,

141
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,910
Donald and Daisy"'

142
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,270
Some Christmas
this turned out to be

143
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:40,060
Gee, I don't know about you guys,

144
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,542
but I don't ever
wanna do that again

145
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:45,085
Me, too

146
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:46,628
Me, three

147
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,430
Tomorrow, let's have
the best Christmas ever

148
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,914
We're putting
these sleds to good use

149
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,110
Incoming

150
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,790
Merry Christmas, fellas

151
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:13,771
Look, we made you breakfast

152
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:16,857
Isn't that nice?

153
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:20,857
You want to open presents?

154
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,390
No way We've got to
wait for the family to get here

155
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:31,510
- Merry Christmas, everybody
- Merry Christmas, indeed

156
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,590
Don't forget our kisses,
Aunt Gertie

157
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,750
What are they up to?

158
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,110
You boys are so wonderful

159
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:50,428
- That looks heavy
- Let us help you

160
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,990
Why, isn't that sweet?
Thank you, boys

161
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,430
Ham

162
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,828
Uncle Donald,
would you like to carve?

163
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,910
Something's up for sure

164
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:07,550
Nothing better than gathering

165
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,270
for a wonderful meal

166
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,630
It's our most favourite part

167
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,710
My feelings exactly

168
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,500
Carols, Uncle Scrooge?

169
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,190
Why, boys,
it's like you could read my mind

170
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:34,542
What's the big idea?
What are you boys up to?

171
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:39,228
Donald Duck, you're spoiling
a perfect Christmas

172
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:42,700
No, Uncle Donald is right
We are up to something

173
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,670
Merry Christmas

174
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:51,685
See, it's your dream boat

175
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:57,085
Thank you, boys

176
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,900
How beautiful

177
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,910
Some Christmas this has turned out
to be I'm just so happy

178
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,228
Boys?

179
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,480
Come gimme a push

180
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,542
It's over
Christmas is really over

181
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,580
The day after Christmas

182
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,270
I understand, boys

183
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,600
You must want Christmas every day

184
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,230
No

185
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,030
Anchors aweigh

186
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,500
Full steam ahead

187
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,428
Man overboard

188
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:45,400
So Christmas was meant
to last just one day

189
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:47,885
And maybe it's better that way

190
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,310
It's a time to be treasured,
it can't always be here,

191
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,390
But the feeling it gives us
can last the whole year

192
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,500
Now this gift holds a story
both wondrous and rare,

193
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:06,070
About a father and a son
and the love that they share

194
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,310
This Christmas they'll learn
before the night's through,

195
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,590
If we care for each other,
our dreams can come true

196
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,190
Come on, Maxie,
at least hum a few bars

197
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,885
Dad, hurry up

198
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,057
The mailman comes at noon, Dad

199
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:35,030
Let's see, now

200
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:41,960
- How about an electrical recliner?
- Yeah, Dad, whatever

201
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:45,750
Don't want to turn
into a fancy pants

202
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,990
Yeah, Dad, but Santa won't get
our letter if we don't leave

203
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,140
now

204
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,857
Hold on, Dad
We're taking a short cut

205
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,428
We ought to slow down
before we break the sound barrier

206
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,510
- What?
- We're headed straight for the mall

207
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,060
Great idea

208
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:31,910
- Low bridge
- Really? Where?

209
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:39,630
Go ahead and stop the mailman, Son

210
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,390
I'll be right behind ya
Don't worry, I won't let you down

211
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,114
Excuse me

212
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:05,342
Pardon me, ma'am
Didn't mean to get fresh

213
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:17,914
Wait

214
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:32,171
There's a madman
on the ornament

215
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,030
Sorry

216
00:21:57,457 --> 00:21:59,114
Wait Stop

217
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:01,971
You have to mail our letter
to Santa

218
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,510
Get out of the road, kid

219
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,450
Do you have anything bigger?
I have an empty space right here

220
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,000
I'll take it

221
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,485
My dad'll be here
any minute, honest

222
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:06,410
Sorry, kid, gotta go

223
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,930
Special delivery
for the North Pole

224
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,085
You really think Santa
will get the letter in time?

225
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,828
Sure as I stand here

226
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:30,730
Slippery

227
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,650
I gotta get it, I just gotta

228
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,410
My own one-of-a-kind, carbon fibre,
torque rod, snappy flex,

229
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,514
tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail, wood core,
twin-directional snowboard

230
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,628
That's a mouthful

231
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:48,940
With adjustable
forward and high back

232
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,010
skid plate step-in bindings

233
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:57,090
Look at this! All nice and neat
and ready for ol' Santy

234
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,690
Merry Christmas Eve, Pete

235
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:16,685
Why, if it ain't
the goof master himself

236
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,457
Say, we got us
some more work to do, Max,

237
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:23,085
or Santy won't find our chimney

238
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:33,250
Ain't that quaint? The goof brain
thinks there's a Santy Claus

239
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:34,530
There isn't?

240
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:38,800
Like father, like goof

241
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:42,685
Kid's got the goof gene
in his bloodstream

242
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,290
There is too a Santa

243
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,571
Now, son, come here

244
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:54,457
See, it's an urbane myth,
like that Locked Ness Monstrosity,

245
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:57,690
and the fella with the sweets
takes cheques

246
00:24:57,885 --> 00:25:01,828
Well, think of it
An old guy in a red suit

247
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:04,971
cruising the entire world
in one night,

248
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:09,257
using reindeer what fly!
Why, it's impossible.

249
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:12,810
Look, kid, I've been around, see

250
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,000
I've been to foreign lands,
like Brooklyn,

251
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:19,600
and I've never seen,
nor met a soul who's seen,

252
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:22,260
this Santy Claus fella

253
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,228
Look, Maxie, I found the front door

254
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,828
So long, neighbors.

255
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,285
Have a very merry Christmas

256
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,171
And a happy New Year

257
00:25:46,971 --> 00:25:49,885
Hey, how about giving
your old man a hand?

258
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:54,971
What is it, Maxie?
Why, you look like Santy Claus

259
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,040
put a lump of coal in your stocking

260
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,650
I heard there isn't any Santa Claus

261
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,010
Who went and told you
a silly thing like that?

262
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:04,828
Mr. Pete

263
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,810
Well, that figures

264
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,457
Of course there's a Santy

265
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,690
Or we'd have out-of-work elves

266
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,970
You think?

267
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,410
Think? Heck, I'm sure

268
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:19,742
Son, have I ever been wrong?

269
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,285
A broken clock is right
two or three times a day,

270
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:26,200
and this time I'm right.

271
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,810
Believe me, Santa won't let you down

272
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:35,050
- You really think he'll come?
- Why, as sure as pigs fly

273
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,220
Hey, Dad,
what did you ask for from Santa?

274
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,730
You know, just the usual

275
00:26:43,057 --> 00:26:44,490
What's that?

276
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,810
It's a surprise

277
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:51,285
Now, plug her in
and let the joy of Christmas shine

278
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,850
That'll put
the spirit of Christmas in you

279
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:14,010
Course there's a Santa

280
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:20,971
Believe me,
Santa won't let you down

281
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:24,742
An old guy in a red suit,

282
00:27:24,971 --> 00:27:30,114
cruising the entire world in
one night, using reindeer what fly

283
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:32,257
Why, it's impossible

284
00:27:45,885 --> 00:27:48,428
Hiya, Maxie Wanna help?

285
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,170
Did you know that there are
two billion children in the world?

286
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,800
No wonder
I keep tripping over roller skates

287
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:01,257
That means Santa would have to make
800 visits a second,

288
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:04,000
not including bathroom breaks

289
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,130
I guess old Santy's
been at it so long,

290
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,520
he figured out the short cuts

291
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:19,970
Looks like it's gonna be
a white Christmas

292
00:28:20,314 --> 00:28:22,285
Dad, this is serious

293
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:24,600
I know, son, but

294
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:30,090
Gosh
Something sure smells mighty tasty

295
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,010
But how can a reindeer fly?

296
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,457
That's easy,
it's those antlers, they

297
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:47,171
You know, with the wind
and all, that creates lift

298
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,485
Hot

299
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,690
Still, it's a lot of work
for one guy

300
00:28:56,228 --> 00:29:00,370
That's why we leave him cookies,
for a pick-me-up

301
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:05,010
But it just doesn't quite make sense, Dad

302
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:07,650
Chestnuts

303
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,970
Where are we going, Dad?

304
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,090
To share the joy of Christmas
with those less fortunate

305
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,410
Shouldn't Santa be doing this?

306
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,057
Santy's on a tight schedule
this time of year,

307
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:27,170
so we're helping him out

308
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,370
Looks like
I might need one, too

309
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,657
Wanna play toy carses? All I got's
two, but you can have one

310
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:58,228
Santa gave me this one last year

311
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:01,400
This year, I hope he's gonna
give me another one

312
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,490
Kid, I ain't so sure
there is such a thing as

313
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,040
Christmas Eve dinner is served

314
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,057
- Mr Goofy, that's incredible
- Like magic

315
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,742
Christmas magic

316
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,371
Thank you so much

317
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:45,800
With things being so tight,
without you, we wouldn't have

318
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:50,114
Don't mention it
You'd do the same for me

319
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,690
But have you ever really,
actually seen Santa?

320
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:57,085
He's got a big white beard

321
00:30:57,142 --> 00:31:00,285
But have you ever
actually seen him in person?

322
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,971
Where?

323
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,200
- Merry Christmas
- Santa

324
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,730
Santa?

325
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,810
You made it

326
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:19,171
Who wants to be the first
to sit on Santy's lap?

327
00:31:19,285 --> 00:31:21,810
Me, me Over here

328
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:26,314
I'm so glad you came

329
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,330
I almost didn't believe any more,

330
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,730
but now

331
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:35,485
Everything's OK So

332
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:40,057
I want my own one-of-a-kind,
carbon fibre, torque rod,

333
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:42,610
snappy flex,
tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail,

334
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,371
twin-directional snowboard
Please

335
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:51,714
Dad?

336
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,730
You tricked me How could you?

337
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:03,914
Santy's got a problem with one
of his elves, but he'll be back

338
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:18,010
Gosh, Maxie I'm real sorry

339
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:22,090
I was just trying
to make those kids happy

340
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:28,371
Remember my tradition of eating one
of Santy's cookies before bedtime?

341
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:29,570
What's the point?

342
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:35,650
Remember how we always open
one present on Christmas Eve?

343
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:46,050
Hiya, Maxie

344
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:49,490
Lookee here,
it's your old stuffed bear

345
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,650
- Remember what you named him?
- Old Stuffed Bear

346
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,942
- Remember who gave him to ya?
- Yeah Santa

347
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,028
But that's when I was little

348
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:11,628
No, he's not

349
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,314
Trust me, Max
You just gotta believe

350
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,570
- Santy's real
- No, he's not

351
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,330
- Yes, he is
- No, he's not

352
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,890
I promise

353
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:33,770
Then prove it

354
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:38,685
When Santy shows up,
we'll be here to greet him

355
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,828
I'll snap a picture of him

356
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,970
so you'll have
photographic evidence

357
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:47,628
Yeah You'll fall off the roof first

358
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,828
I won't fall off the roof
You just watch

359
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:56,820
Santy Claus is coming to town

360
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,770
Bright

361
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,714
Told you you'd fall off the roof

362
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:17,360
I didn't fall off the roof

363
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,770
Where's Santy?
I didn't miss him, did l?

364
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:22,828
Nope

365
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,628
Then where is he?

366
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,970
I don't know about you,
but I'm cold and tired,

367
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:34,914
and Santa Claus is not coming

368
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,050
Why doesn't he just grow up
and face the facts?

369
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,628
"Don't forget

370
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:46,771
Max"'

371
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:48,290
Oh, Dad

372
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:55,542
Max, wake up. Look, son.

373
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,850
It's him, it really is

374
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:01,171
Do you see him, Maxie? Do ya?

375
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,530
Over here

376
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,514
- Almost forgot Smile, Santy
- Dad, the lens cap

377
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,050
I'll get it right this time

378
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,650
Come down with your hands up
We have you surrounded

379
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,685
What in the name of Pete is going on,
for Pete's sake?

380
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,500
Maybe he's running a little late

381
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:43,200
Dad

382
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:46,730
Are you OK?

383
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,560
You were right about everything
I even fell off the roof

384
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:03,114
Hey, Dad, it's OK
Santa didn't show. No biggie

385
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:07,570
Well, since he's not coming,

386
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,120
at least we can eat
all his cookies

387
00:37:10,714 --> 00:37:12,085
Not hungry

388
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,530
Hey, Dad,
here's one from me. Open it up.

389
00:37:19,142 --> 00:37:20,514
Maybe later

390
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,930
Max?

391
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,657
Burglars

392
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,730
Santy

393
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,640
Merry Christmas

394
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,028
Santy, I'm so happy you came

395
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:13,800
Gosh I thought you'd be taller

396
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,800
And you look trimmer
than your pictures

397
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:20,530
Well, you know

398
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,850
camera adds 50 pounds

399
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,914
You have to meet Maxie

400
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,330
Yeah, love to,
but gotta get going

401
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,800
Two billion kids, 823 a second

402
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,314
Very tight schedule

403
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,410
Wait, Santy,
he's around somewheres

404
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:42,450
Wait Santy

405
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:44,228
Santy

406
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,057
- Maxie?
- Hi, Dad

407
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,250
What are you doing
dressed up like Santy Claus?

408
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,342
I just wanted to make you happy,
like you did for our neighbors

409
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:07,010
Maxie, I might have let you down,
but you sure didn't let me down

410
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:18,342
Could it be? Do you think?

411
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,570
Gosh It sure looks like

412
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,610
Santa Claus

413
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,970
I believe it is

414
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,810
Wow, my own one-of-a-kind,

415
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,330
carbon fibre, torque rod,
snappy flexed, tip-to-tail,

416
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,730
rail-to-rail, wood core,
twin-directional snowboard

417
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,085
- Thanks, Santa
- What's all the commotion?

418
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:48,942
If it's another robber,
I'm gonna get him

419
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:53,285
Santa?

420
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:58,885
Well, hey, Santa,
I believed in ya all along

421
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:02,542
For real and for true
So, where are my presents?

422
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:11,890
Merry Christmas

423
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:16,942
But what about my squirty gun
and my yo-yo?

424
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:19,450
I know you can hear me

425
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,560
Santa didn't forget your gift,
did he?

426
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:25,857
Every year, I ask for the same gift,

427
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:27,800
and every year I get it

428
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:29,028
What's that?

429
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,010
Your happiness

430
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,290
What is it, son?

431
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:36,330
Got you the same thing

432
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:38,857
Merry Christmas, Dad

433
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:40,942
Merry Christmas, Max

434
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:42,530
Where are you going?

435
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:46,130
To share my present
with little Jimmy next door

436
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:48,828
That's my boy

437
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,170
So, Christmas is found
in the way we live,

438
00:40:57,485 --> 00:41:00,880
Not what we receive,
but what we can give

439
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:08,210
Our Iast present may seem small,
Not fancy, flashy or special at all

440
00:41:08,742 --> 00:41:12,440
But this gift can be given
by the rich or the poor,

441
00:41:12,942 --> 00:41:16,890
It's a gift of the heart,
and it means so much more

442
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,890
Thanks, Joe Merry Christmas

443
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:35,428
Merry Christmas, George
You working?

444
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:38,010
Not tonight It's Christmas Eve

445
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:07,090
There it is, Pluto

446
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:10,650
The perfect gift
to go with Minnie's watch

447
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:13,920
My Minnie

448
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,130
They close at five
I'm a little short now,

449
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,290
but you and I are gonna make
lots of tips today

450
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,970
- Aren't we, fella?
- Yeah

451
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:29,890
After work we'll pick it up
Let's get this tree to Minnie's

452
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,810
Figaro, there's nothing but bills

453
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,970
How am I going to afford
to get Mickey a present?

454
00:42:56,314 --> 00:42:57,650
Oh, Mickey

455
00:42:58,114 --> 00:43:01,714
When you play your harmonica,
my heart sings

456
00:43:03,371 --> 00:43:07,314
An instrument like that
deserves a special case

457
00:43:08,914 --> 00:43:11,450
Yeah Some day

458
00:43:12,942 --> 00:43:16,228
Come into the kitchen
Breakfast is almost ready

459
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,690
I'm not eating you
out of house and home?

460
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,290
Course not, silly I have plenty

461
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,690
For me?

462
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,200
Have you got the time, Minnie?

463
00:43:37,342 --> 00:43:41,610
- Let's see, it's
- Gosh, sure is a beautiful watch

464
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,130
My one heirloom

465
00:43:44,714 --> 00:43:48,970
It'd look nice with a gold chain
around your pretty neck

466
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,410
Oh, Mickey My goodness,
I've got to go to work

467
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,130
Madam Your sleigh awaits

468
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,257
Oh, how wonderful

469
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:08,057
Giddy up, Pluto

470
00:44:25,714 --> 00:44:27,200
See you tonight

471
00:44:27,942 --> 00:44:29,890
Fella, we got work to do

472
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,171
Welcome to Crazy Pete's tree lot

473
00:44:36,228 --> 00:44:39,285
Hurry, folks, only one more day
till Christmas

474
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:42,170
Easy credit No money down

475
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:53,290
This stuff works pretty good

476
00:44:53,628 --> 00:44:55,457
Merry Christmas

477
00:44:55,514 --> 00:45:00,057
I'll be merry when
I've sold all those ten-footers

478
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,970
Why are you standing there with
your face hanging out? Get to work

479
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,914
OK, fella You know what to do
Shake a leg

480
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,250
Quit slacking
There's a customer waiting

481
00:45:37,742 --> 00:45:40,210
Do be careful of the paint

482
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,440
- Yes, ma'am
- Such a nice young man

483
00:45:45,114 --> 00:45:47,457
Here's a little something for you

484
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:51,314
I don't expect anything
I'm just glad to help

485
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,857
Oh, boy

486
00:45:54,057 --> 00:45:56,040
Thank you, ma'am, thank you

487
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,930
Hot dog We'll be able
to get Minnie that watch chain

488
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,714
- We'd like to buy a tree
- You folks are looking for a tree?

489
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:11,314
Boy, oh, boy,
is this your lucky day

490
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:18,114
This here's what you folks need Ten
feet of towering Nova Scotia pine

491
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,410
Wow It's bigger than our house

492
00:46:23,885 --> 00:46:26,514
Well, it's a little more
than we need

493
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:29,314
Missus, I've got to be honest
with you,

494
00:46:29,457 --> 00:46:32,850
this is all
I've got left on the lot

495
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,730
The others have been reservated

496
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,657
You don't want these kids going
without a tree now, do you?

497
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,571
We are gonna get a tree,
aren't we, Daddy?

498
00:46:45,828 --> 00:46:46,885
This is all we have

499
00:46:47,028 --> 00:46:51,057
Well, that'll be just fine
for a down payment

500
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:56,170
I'll set you up with a nice
installment plan. Just sign here.

501
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:59,210
We're gonna get a tree

502
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:03,400
Foot off the brake,
the kids are waiting

503
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,520
Hey, how about this tree?

504
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,890
I found it out back

505
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:11,400
It hasn't been reservated

506
00:47:15,171 --> 00:47:16,690
It's beautiful

507
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:19,240
- Perfect
- We'll take it

508
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:24,885
Merry Christmas
Thank you again

509
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,810
Merry Christmas. So long!

510
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:29,770
Merry

511
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,914
Christmas

512
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:35,480
I had them on the hook
for a ten-foot tree

513
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:40,257
I'm taking what I would have made
from you

514
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,450
- But I...
- Now, get out of my lot

515
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,520
Chumps

516
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:57,971
Somebody's burning their ham

517
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,514
More than warm. It's hot!

518
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,490
Not my ten-footers

519
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,200
Attention, holiday shoppers. Don't forget
to bring your last-minute purchases

520
00:48:36,257 --> 00:48:38,057
to our gift-wrapping department

521
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:40,771
I've never seen it so busy

522
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,410
Who made you
Santa's number one helper?

523
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,885
I want to get Mickey
something special this year

524
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,090
Without that Christmas bonus,
I'm sunk

525
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,450
Hello. Okey-dokey. Bye.

526
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,885
Mr Mortimer wants to see you
in his office right away

527
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,840
My Christmas bonus

528
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,450
- Ginny
- That's Minnie

529
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:18,370
Right, I've been making a list
and checking it twice,

530
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,610
and I found that you have been

531
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,490
Santa's best little helper
this season

532
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,028
Your hard work
is about to be rewarded

533
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,400
Close your eyes
and hold out your hands

534
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:33,314
Mr Mortimer,
I can't thank you enough

535
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:35,890
Yes, I know Don't interrupt

536
00:49:36,342 --> 00:49:38,142
- Penny
- That's Minnie

537
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,342
Whatever On behalf of the store,
it gives me great pleasure

538
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:47,250
to present you
with your Christmas bonus

539
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,200
A fruitcake?

540
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,650
No need to thank me The expression
on your face is thanks enough

541
00:49:56,714 --> 00:50:00,828
Scoot along to the gift-wrapping
department where you belong

542
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:03,170
And, er, Winnie?

543
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,090
Merry Christmas

544
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:14,010
Oh, Mickey How am I ever
gonna get your present now?

545
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,314
There must be a way to get Minnie's
present by five o'clock

546
00:50:24,485 --> 00:50:26,500
You got any ideas, fella?

547
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,970
Don't worry We'll come up
with something, we just gotta

548
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,450
Do you think the band
will ever show up?

549
00:50:52,714 --> 00:50:56,828
I don't know They're putting out
a fire at Crazy Pete's

550
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:59,171
It went up like a Roman candle

551
00:51:00,942 --> 00:51:05,690
Chief, looks like the toy drive
is a big fat bust

552
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:12,890
Listen That music

553
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,028
Come on

554
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,250
Where are we going, fellas?

555
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,570
A concert in the park

556
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,085
Look, Bub, we're desperate

557
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:33,450
We need music for the toy drive
You're our only hope

558
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,085
I don't have time, Chief!
I gotta get a gift for my girl

559
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,850
Look, pal, don't do it for us,
do it for the kids

560
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,400
- But l
- Son, to these kids,

561
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,628
the only difference between
a broken heart and a smile is you

562
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,730
You're on Break a leg, pal

563
00:52:04,714 --> 00:52:07,828
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I can't stay

564
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:10,485
I got Christmas shopping to do and

565
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:17,800
Gosh

566
00:53:06,685 --> 00:53:10,330
- The band
- Must have been hot at Crazy Pete's

567
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,210
Guess I'll be showing up
at Minnie's empty-handed

568
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,971
Terrific Thanks to you,
this was our best toy drive ever

569
00:53:59,085 --> 00:54:02,171
You and that harmonica
make a great team

570
00:54:02,828 --> 00:54:05,450
She's worth her weight in gold

571
00:54:07,342 --> 00:54:09,450
Holy cow That's it

572
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:14,010
We've got two minutes to get
to the shop. Come on, Pluto.

573
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,314
- Thanks, fellas
- Goodbye

574
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,428
- Thanks
- Merry Christmas

575
00:54:44,742 --> 00:54:45,600
Sorry

576
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,690
Hey, what's going on?

577
00:55:06,171 --> 00:55:07,530
This is our stop

578
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,285
Look, there's the shop

579
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:35,330
Excuse me, sir I was just hoping to
trade this for a gift for my girl

580
00:55:39,742 --> 00:55:43,370
Sorry, that harmonica
isn't worth much

581
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,210
Well, merry Christmas

582
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,885
You're worth a lot to me,
old friend

583
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:22,170
Say, maybe that harmonica
is worth something after all

584
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:24,170
Come on in

585
00:56:39,142 --> 00:56:43,514
Can't wait to open your present?
I know how you feel

586
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:49,000
I love Christmas so much

587
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,330
Say, Mickey,
why don't you play some music?

588
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:57,250
Isn't it time
we were opening our presents,

589
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:01,085
and speaking of time,
what time is it?

590
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:05,690
Well, I think it's time
for you to open your gift.

591
00:57:14,257 --> 00:57:18,228
A case, for my harmonica

592
00:57:18,628 --> 00:57:24,400
A chain for my watch
Mickey, it's beautiful,

593
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,885
but I traded my watch
to get you that case

594
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:33,970
I traded my harmonica
to get you a watch chain

595
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,280
Oh, Mickey,

596
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,930
I can't believe you gave up what
means the most to you, for me

597
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,130
Minnie, you're all the music
I'll ever need

598
00:57:55,657 --> 00:57:58,970
- Merry Christmas, Mickey
- Merry Christmas, Minnie

599
00:58:01,942 --> 00:58:03,628
Want some fruitcake?

600
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,530
A gift from the heart
is cherished and true

601
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:14,000
A present is best
when love's given, too

602
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,290
So in the end, love is the reason

603
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,285
that Christmas is more
than a gift-giving season

604
00:58:22,485 --> 00:58:25,771
It's a time with our loved ones
to show that we care,

605
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:29,450
When families and neighbors
come together to share

606
00:58:29,971 --> 00:58:33,314
So, this Christmas season,
let us all do our parts

607
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:37,530
to keep Christmas spirit
alive in our hearts.
