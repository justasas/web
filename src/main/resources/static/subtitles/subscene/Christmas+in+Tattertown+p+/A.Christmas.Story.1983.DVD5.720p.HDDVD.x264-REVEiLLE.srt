1
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:57,252
<i>Ah, there it is. My house.</i>

2
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:01,557
<i>And good old Cleveland Street.
How could I ever forget it?</i>

3
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:05,127
<i>And there I am,
with that dumb round face and...</i>

4
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:07,027
<i>that stupid stocking cap.</i>

5
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:10,834
<i>But no matter. Christmas was on its way.</i>

6
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:13,933
<i>Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas...</i>

7
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:16,866
<i>around which the entire kid year revolved.</i>

8
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:44,498
<i>Downtown Hohman was prepared
for its yearly bacchanalia of...</i>

9
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:47,229
<i>peace on earth and good will to men.</i>

10
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:40,885
<i>Higbees' corner window
was traditionally a high-water mark...</i>

11
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,949
<i>of the pre-Christmas season.</i>

12
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:48,528
<i>First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff,
jostled in wonderment...</i>

13
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:52,433
<i>before a golden tinkling display...</i>

14
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,898
<i>of mechanized, electronic joy.</i>

15
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,281
<i>Wow, there it is.</i>

16
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:45,788
<i>The holy grail of Christmas gifts.</i>

17
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:48,757
<i>The Red Ryder 200-shot range model...</i>

18
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:49,986
<i>air rifle.</i>

19
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:52,863
<i>And there he is.</i>

20
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:54,854
<i>Red Ryder himself.</i>

21
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:59,599
<i>In his hand was the knurled stock
of as coolly deadly-looking...</i>

22
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,663
<i>a piece of weaponry
as ever I had laid eyes on.</i>

23
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:12,372
<i>For weeks, I had been scheming
to get my mitts on one of these...</i>

24
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:15,179
<i>fearsome blue-steel beauties.</i>

25
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:19,618
<i>My fevered brain seethed
with the effort of trying to come up with...</i>

26
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,558
<i>the infinitely subtle devices
necessary to implant...</i>

27
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:26,825
<i>the Red Ryder range model
air rifle indelibly...</i>

28
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,497
<i>into my parents' subconscious.</i>

29
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:30,734
Ralphie!

30
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:32,236
Randy!

31
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:34,234
Down here in two minutes!

32
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,607
And I mean two minutes!

33
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:39,142
Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!

34
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,781
Cut it out.

35
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:15,774
<i>My mother, grabbing for her copy
of Look magazine...</i>

36
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,480
<i>would find herself cleverly trapped
into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.</i>

37
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,721
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.

38
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:27,517
What's that?

39
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,823
Well, for Christ's sake,
the Sox traded Bullfrog...

40
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,022
the only player they've got,
for Shottenhoffer.

41
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:35,724
"Four Eyes" Shottenhoffer,
a utility infielder.

42
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,958
Got a whole goddamned team
of utility infielders.

43
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,435
That's nice.

44
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:42,504
Ralphie, on the double!

45
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,371
Did you hear about this guy
who swallowed a yo-yo?

46
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:49,139
- Swallowed a yo-yo?
- On a bet.

47
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:51,738
Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.

48
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,814
They write the silliest things
in the newspapers.

49
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,848
What do you mean, silly?
I mean that's real news.

50
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:01,049
That's not like that politics slop.

51
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:06,823
What is the name
of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

52
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:09,328
Victor. His name is Victor.

53
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:12,726
- How the hell did you know that?
- Everybody knows that.

54
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:17,033
That's another one of your silly puzzles?

55
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,573
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.

56
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:23,010
Could be worth $50,000.

57
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:25,911
What kind is it this time?

58
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,478
Name the great characters
in American literature.

59
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:33,712
Victor?
The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

60
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,223
<i>Meanwhile, I struggled
for exactly the right BB gun hint.</i>

61
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:38,727
<i>It had to be firm, but subtle.</i>

62
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:41,989
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears
near Pulaski's candy store.

63
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:51,739
<i>They looked at me as if
I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.</i>

64
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,576
<i>I could tell that I was in imminent danger
of over-playing my hand.</i>

65
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:59,315
<i>Casually, I switched tactics.</i>

66
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,076
Hey, Dad!

67
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:05,651
I'll bet you'll never guess
what I got you for Christmas.

68
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:08,522
A new furnace.

69
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,919
That's a good one, Dad.

70
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,561
<i>My old man was one
of the most feared furnace-fighters...</i>

71
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:18,397
<i>in northern Indiana.</i>

72
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,499
Hurry up,
you're going to be late for school.

73
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:24,172
Yeah. I'm running late already.

74
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:25,966
<i>Round one was over.</i>

75
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:27,970
<i>Parents, one.</i>

76
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:29,170
<i>Kids, zip.</i>

77
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:33,581
<i>I could feel the Christmas noose
beginning to tighten.</i>

78
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,887
<i>Maybe what happened next
was inevitable.</i>

79
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:39,548
Ralphie, what would you like
for Christmas?

80
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,885
<i>Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.</i>

81
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:46,019
I want an official Red Ryder carbine action
200-shot range model air rifle.

82
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,198
No. Shoot your eye out.

83
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:53,032
<i>Oh, no! It was
the classic mother-BB gun block.</i>

84
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:54,995
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out."</i>

85
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:58,868
<i>That deadly phrase uttered
many times before by hundreds...</i>

86
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,944
<i>of mothers was not surmountable...</i>

87
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,036
<i>by any means known to kid-dom.</i>

88
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:07,014
<i>But such was my mania,
my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...</i>

89
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:10,382
<i>that I immediately began
to rebuild the dike.</i>

90
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:14,583
I was just kidding.
Even though Flick is getting one.

91
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,692
I'd just like some Tinkertoys.

92
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,320
<i>I couldn't believe my own ears.
Tinkertoys?</i>

93
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:20,862
<i>She'd never buy it.</i>

94
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,129
BB guns are dangerous.

95
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,792
I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.

96
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:34,508
Randy, will you eat?
There are starving people in China.

97
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:46,616
<i>Mothers know nothing
about creeping marauders...</i>

98
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,781
<i>burrowing through the snow
toward the kitchen...</i>

99
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:52,386
<i>where only you, and you alone,
stand between your tiny...</i>

100
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:55,293
<i>huddled family and insensate evil.</i>

101
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:06,404
Save us, Ralphie!
I just knew those bad guys...

102
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,911
would be coming for us in the end!

103
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:13,044
Don't worry, Dad.
As long as I got Ol' Blue...

104
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,154
What've we got here, folks?

105
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:22,158
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.

106
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:24,790
Well, just me and my trusty old...

107
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:28,592
Red Ryder carbine-action
200-shot range model air rifle.

108
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,659
Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.

109
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:34,132
Well, I think I better have a look here.

110
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,245
Oh, no!

111
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,018
It's Ol' Blue!

112
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:53,722
Oh, no!

113
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,117
Cheese it, boys!

114
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:11,902
There's another one!
He's a dead-eye, ain't he?

115
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:20,674
Okay, Ralphie!

116
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:23,845
You win this time, but we'll be back!

117
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:30,258
<i>Adiós, Bart.</i>

118
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:34,624
But if you do come back,
you'll be pushing up daisies!

119
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,037
And don't you forget it!

120
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:42,663
<i>Well, son, you saved us!</i>

121
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,766
<i>We were goners for sure!
And you saved us!</i>

122
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:55,616
Oldsmobile!

123
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,544
A pile of junk!

124
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:00,984
That goddamned Olds is froze up again!

125
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:05,859
<i>Some men are Baptists, others Catholics.
My father was an Oldsmobile man.</i>

126
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:10,224
That son of a bitch would freeze up
in the middle of summer on the Equator!

127
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:13,263
- Little pitchers...
- Hold it!

128
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,174
It's a clinker!

129
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:32,114
That blasted, stupid furnace.

130
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:33,520
Dadgummit!

131
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:40,252
Damn skates!

132
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,362
For Christ's sake,
open up the damper, will you?

133
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:48,132
Who the hell turned it
all the way down again?

134
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:50,130
Blasted!

135
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:04,516
<i>In the heat of battle,
my father wove a tapestry of obscenity...</i>

136
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:09,124
<i>that as far as we know is still hanging
in space over Lake Michigan.</i>

137
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,937
<i>Preparing to go to school
was like getting ready...</i>

138
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:25,474
<i>for extended deep-sea diving.</i>

139
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:48,864
- Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!
- Just wait, Ralph!

140
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,660
<i>My kid brother looked like
a tick about to pop.</i>

141
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:53,532
What?

142
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:55,568
What is it?

143
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,201
What is it?

144
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,478
- What is it?
- I can't put my arms down!

145
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,620
Well, put your arms down
when you get to school.

146
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:51,083
Hey, Flick! Wait up.

147
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,456
Wait up!

148
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:54,221
So what are you doing?

149
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:56,898
What does it look like I'm doing?
Picking goobers?

150
00:13:57,134 --> 00:14:00,535
Hey, listen, smart ass.
I asked my old man about sticking...

151
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:03,004
your tongue to metal light poles
in winter...

152
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:06,474
and he says it will freeze right to the pole
just like I told you.

153
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,734
Baloney.

154
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,779
What would your old man know
about anything?

155
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,145
He knows because he once saw a guy
stick his tongue...

156
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:15,811
to a railroad track on a bet
and the fire department had to come...

157
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:19,754
to get the guy's tongue off the track
because he couldn't get it off.

158
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,586
Come on, guys, wait up!

159
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:23,148
Come on, guys!

160
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:25,857
Come on, guys, wait up!

161
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:32,500
I can't get up!

162
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,567
I can't get up!

163
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,571
Help!

164
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:40,272
I can't get out! Help me!

165
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:43,339
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.

166
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,244
I can't get up!

167
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:49,515
Come on.

168
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:51,918
Get up. Sit up. Come on.

169
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:55,190
You're okay. Come on, let's go.

170
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:56,590
Come on, you're all right!

171
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:06,803
Miss Shields!

172
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:08,862
All right, everyone...

173
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,600
take your seats, please.

174
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,446
Good morning, class.

175
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:23,850
Good morning, Miss Shields.

176
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,089
Open your books to Page 32.

177
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:04,025
And as you'll remember, Silas Marner...

178
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:17,132
You're full of beans and so's your old man.

179
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,538
- Says who?
- Says me.

180
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,510
Well, I double-dare you.

181
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,173
<i>The exact exchange and nuance...</i>

182
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:28,773
<i>of phrase in this ritual is very important.</i>

183
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,579
Are you kidding?
Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?

184
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:32,655
That's dumb.

185
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:34,691
That's 'cause you know it will stick!

186
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,383
You're full of it.

187
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:39,054
Well, I double dog-dare you!

188
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:42,827
<i>Now it was serious. A double dog-dare.</i>

189
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,494
<i>What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?</i>

190
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:48,127
<i>And finally,
the coup de grâce of all dares...</i>

191
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,605
<i>the sinister triple dog-dare!</i>

192
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,768
I triple dog-dare you!

193
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,246
<i>Schwartz created
a slight breach of etiquette...</i>

194
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:00,976
<i>by skipping the triple-dare
and going right for the throat.</i>

195
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,382
All right, all right.

196
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:15,428
- Go on, smart ass, and do it!
- I'm going!

197
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,160
<i>Flick's spine stiffened,
his lips curled in a defiant sneer.</i>

198
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,672
<i>There was no going back now.</i>

199
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,301
This is nothing.

200
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,308
Stuck? Stuck!

201
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,476
Stuck! Stuck!

202
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:42,483
Jeez!

203
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,059
It really works!

204
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:45,560
Look at him!

205
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,305
Ralphie, come back!

206
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:00,775
- Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!
- But the bell rang!

207
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:04,403
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know! The bell rang!

208
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:15,853
Where's Flick?

209
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:18,925
Has anyone seen Flick?

210
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:20,825
<i>Flick? Flick who?</i>

211
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:23,024
He was at recess, wasn't he?

212
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,159
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?

213
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,210
I said has anyone seen Flick?

214
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,209
Yes, Esther Jane?

215
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:47,881
Oh, my God!

216
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,236
Holy cow, it's the fire department!

217
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:20,084
Wow, it's the cops!

218
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:16,603
Now, I know that some of you
put Flick up to this.

219
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:21,876
But, he has refused to say who.

220
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:27,115
But those who did it know their blame.

221
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:32,319
And I'm sure the guilt you feel...

222
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:36,521
is far worse than any punishment
you might receive.

223
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:42,964
Now, don't you feel terrible?

224
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:46,907
Don't you feel remorse
for what you have done?

225
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:52,076
That's all I'm going to say
about poor Flick.

226
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:58,576
<i>Adults love to say things like that.
But kids know better.</i>

227
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:02,489
<i>We knew darn well
it was always better not to get caught.</i>

228
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:05,857
Now, boys and girls,
I'm going to give you an assignment.

229
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:08,758
I want you to write...

230
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,027
a theme.

231
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,936
"What I want for Christmas."

232
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:19,798
<i>The clouds lifted.</i>

233
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:22,743
And I want it handed in
tomorrow morning...

234
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:25,906
<i>I saw a faint gleam of light
at the other end of...</i>

235
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:27,847
<i>the black cave of doom.</i>

236
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:31,944
<i>I knew that when Miss Shields
read my magnificent, eloquent theme...</i>

237
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:34,820
<i>that she would sympathize
with my plight...</i>

238
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:38,088
<i>and everything would work out, somehow.</i>

239
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:55,911
Boy, did you see how it stuck?

240
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:59,710
- Did it hurt, Flick?
- No. I never felt a thing.

241
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:01,410
It just caught me off-guard.

242
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:04,112
- You sure were bawling.
- I never bawled!

243
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:05,721
Baloney.

244
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,426
Scut Farkus!

245
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:24,632
<i>Scut Farkus! What a rotten name.
We were trapped.</i>

246
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,609
<i>There he stood, between us and the alley.</i>

247
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:30,737
<i>Scut Farkus, staring out at us
with his yellow eyes.</i>

248
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:34,312
<i>He had yellow eyes!
So help me God, yellow eyes.</i>

249
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,529
<i>Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady.</i>

250
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:54,092
<i>Mean. Rotten.</i>

251
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,570
<i>His lips curled over his green teeth.</i>

252
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:59,073
<i>Randy lay there like a slug.</i>

253
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:01,201
<i>It was his only defense.</i>

254
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:08,176
- Say "uncle."
- Uncle!

255
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,053
Louder!

256
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:21,897
<i>In our world, you were
either a bully, a toady...</i>

257
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,627
<i>or one of the nameless rabble of victims.</i>

258
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:25,894
All right.

259
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:27,660
Who's next?

260
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:54,825
<i>In the jungles of kid-dom,
the mind switches gears rapidly.</i>

261
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:57,725
<i>Weeks ago I had sent away
for my Little Orphan Annie...</i>

262
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,826
<i>secret society decoder pen.</i>

263
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,070
<i>Oh, skunked again.</i>

264
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:04,766
<i>No matter. Today I had serious work to do.</i>

265
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:07,569
"What I want for Christmas."

266
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:10,772
"What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun
with a compass in the stock...

267
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:12,712
"and this thing which tells time."

268
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:14,281
Wow, that's great.

269
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,376
"I think that everybody should have
a Red Ryder BB gun.

270
00:24:17,487 --> 00:24:19,352
"They're very good for Christmas.

271
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:23,483
"I don't think that a football's
a very good Christmas present."

272
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:27,786
<i>Oh, rarely had the words poured
from my penny pencil...</i>

273
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:29,661
<i>with such feverish fluidity.</i>

274
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,630
I've won! I've won!

275
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,079
<i>The Bumpus hounds.</i>

276
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:53,048
<i>Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses,
had at least...</i>

277
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:54,987
<i>785 smelly hound dogs.</i>

278
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:59,358
<i>And they ignored every other human being
on earth but my old man.</i>

279
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:03,629
I won!

280
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:06,028
I won!

281
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,297
- What?
- A major prize!

282
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:10,532
I won!

283
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:14,367
Hey, look at that. Look at that.
A Western Union telegram.

284
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:17,641
<i>Tonight, he's coming tonight.
Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!</i>

285
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:19,375
What does this mean here?

286
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:21,245
It means it's coming tonight!

287
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,251
I called Ernie McClosky
at the freight depot.

288
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,152
He said the telegram was late,
the prize was already there...

289
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:28,417
he was going to send it on tonight.

290
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,925
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me.
It's my gift.

291
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:37,296
You know, maybe it'll be one of those
Spanish adobe houses down in Coral...

292
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:44,038
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.

293
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,301
Or it could be a bowling alley.

294
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:49,071
A guy down in Terre Haute
won a bowling alley.

295
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:51,942
How are they going to deliver
a bowling alley here tonight?

296
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:55,782
They could send the deed,
for cripesake. I mean...

297
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:59,419
I didn't expect they were going
to send the whole damn bowling alley.

298
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:02,322
Yeah, well. How about eating?
I'm starving to death.

299
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:05,322
Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.

300
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:15,397
<i>Every family has a kid who won't eat.</i>

301
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:19,799
<i>My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily
in over three years.</i>

302
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:25,012
Oh, Randy, don't play
with your food, eat it!

303
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:30,249
Starving people would be happy
to have that.

304
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,349
Can I have some more red cabbage?

305
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:42,492
Stop playing with your food,
or I'll give you something to cry about.

306
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:46,095
You better stop fooling around with it
and eat it or you'll be sorry.

307
00:26:51,474 --> 00:26:52,839
Can I please have some more?

308
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,436
<i>My mother had not had a hot meal
for herself in 15 years.</i>

309
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:01,641
Meatloaf, double beetloaf.

310
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:03,843
I hate meatloaf.

311
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:07,612
All right. I'll get that kid to eat.

312
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:09,787
Where's my screwdriver
and plumber's helper?

313
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:12,225
I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.

314
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:14,554
<i>My mother was more subtle.</i>

315
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:17,362
How do the little piggies go?

316
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:20,501
That's right. Oink, oink.

317
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:23,902
Now, show me how the piggies eat.
This is your trough.

318
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:26,974
Show me how the piggies eat.

319
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:30,210
Be a good boy.
Show Mommy how the piggies eat.

320
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:00,203
Oh, my.

321
00:28:00,677 --> 00:28:02,645
Mommy's little piggy.

322
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:24,397
It's here.

323
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:32,904
Are you Parker?

324
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:35,569
- All right, sign here.
- Yeah. Well, what is it?

325
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,906
I don't know.

326
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,638
What's in it?

327
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:40,580
Here. Bring it in.

328
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,050
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.
Move your tails.

329
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,611
Bring it right on in. Right here.
Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.

330
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:47,814
That's right.

331
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:50,083
Right.

332
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,957
Here, bring it right in, fellas.
That's it. Here we go.

333
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:55,155
A little more. Little more.

334
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,255
That's it.

335
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:00,730
Watch the lady.

336
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:11,140
Thanks a lot, guys.

337
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:12,545
Merry Christmas.

338
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:15,516
Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.
Go on.

339
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:19,111
"Fra-gi-ley."

340
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:22,655
- That must be Italian.
- I think that says "fragile."

341
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:24,484
Oh, yeah.

342
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,261
Here we go.

343
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:35,265
They did a job on this, you know?

344
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:43,842
No, here, Ralph, hold this.

345
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:53,313
There could be anything in there!

346
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:54,549
Jesus!

347
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,891
Maybe they forgot.

348
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:01,961
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.

349
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:11,104
- Would you look at that?
- What?

350
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:13,539
Would you look at that?

351
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:17,635
What is it?

352
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:19,746
It's a leg!

353
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:21,342
But what is it?

354
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,685
Well, it's a leg.

355
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,419
You know, like in a statue.

356
00:30:25,988 --> 00:30:27,979
- Statue?
- Yeah, statue!

357
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:30,319
Yeah, statue!

358
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,050
Ralphie!

359
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:36,431
<i>My mother was trying to insinuate herself
between us and the statue.</i>

360
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,691
Holy smoke, would you...

361
00:30:38,768 --> 00:30:40,736
Do you know what this is?

362
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:43,271
This is a lamp.

363
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:46,170
<i>It was indeed a lamp.</i>

364
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:49,109
Isn't that great? What a great lamp!

365
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:51,976
I don't know.

366
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:55,509
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.

367
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:58,284
<i>The old man's eyes boggled...</i>

368
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:01,012
<i>overcome by art.</i>

369
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:03,057
I know just the place for it.

370
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,117
Right in the middle
of our front room window!

371
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:26,778
Jesus, God.

372
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,050
- Honey?
- No. It's all right.

373
00:31:34,924 --> 00:31:36,391
Let's see...

374
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:41,129
This goes to the radio
and this goes to the...

375
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:44,722
Well, it's just one too many.

376
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:49,693
Well, let's see.

377
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:53,003
<i>The snap of a few sparks,
a quick whiff of ozone...</i>

378
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:56,533
<i>and the lamp blazed forth
in unparalleled glory.</i>

379
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:59,270
Look at that! Will you look at that?

380
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,643
Isn't that glorious?

381
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,180
It's indescribably beautiful.
It reminds me of the Fourth of July!

382
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:08,991
Turn off all the lights.

383
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:10,992
I wanna see what it looks like
from the street.

384
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,858
- I'll go get the dining room.
- Couldn't we talk this over?

385
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:37,748
Move it a little bit to the right.
A little that way.

386
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:42,048
Just a little... More to the right.

387
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,116
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!

388
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,491
Right there. That's wonderful.

389
00:32:47,697 --> 00:32:49,255
Parker, what is that?

390
00:32:49,332 --> 00:32:51,232
Don't bother me now.
Can't you see I'm busy?

391
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,096
- Yeah, but what is that?
- It's a major award.

392
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:56,502
A major award?

393
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,100
Shucks, I wouldn't have known that.
It looks like a lamp.

394
00:33:00,176 --> 00:33:03,577
It is a lamp, you nincompoop.
But it's a major award.

395
00:33:03,646 --> 00:33:04,908
I won it.

396
00:33:05,114 --> 00:33:07,878
- Damn, hell, you say you won it?
- Yeah.

397
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,712
Mind power, Sweed, mind power.

398
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:13,551
<i>The entire neighborhood was turned on.</i>

399
00:33:13,656 --> 00:33:16,523
You should see what it looks like
from out here!

400
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:19,661
<i>It could be seen
up and down Cleveland Street.</i>

401
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:21,697
<i>The symbol of the old man's victory.</i>

402
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:23,992
Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.

403
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:27,558
Isn't it about time
for somebody's favorite radio program?

404
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:31,570
<i>Holy smokes, it was 6:45.</i>

405
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:33,868
<i>Only one thing that
could've dragged me away...</i>

406
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:37,936
<i>from the soft glow of electric sex
gleaming in the window.</i>

407
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,657
<i>Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.</i>

408
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:55,390
<i>Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.</i>

409
00:33:56,032 --> 00:33:57,329
<i>I could still taste it.</i>

410
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:00,865
Hey, you turned the light off!

411
00:34:17,553 --> 00:34:20,989
<i>I knew I was handing Miss Shields
a masterpiece.</i>

412
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:24,758
<i>Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy,
would excuse me from theme writing...</i>

413
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:27,387
<i>for the rest of my natural life.</i>

414
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:36,866
You call this a paragraph?

415
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:41,437
Margins! Margins! "F"!

416
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:45,176
My life's work down the drain.

417
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:47,980
A semicolon, you dolt!

418
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,142
A period.

419
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:50,214
"F"!

420
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:54,755
Oh, I should weep
if I have to read one more "F"!

421
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:57,950
Ralphie Parker.

422
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:16,237
The theme I've been waiting for all my life.

423
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,270
Listen to this sentence.

424
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:23,050
"A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass
in the stock...

425
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,016
"and this thing which tells time."

426
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,319
Poetry.

427
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:31,859
Sheer poetry.

428
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:35,425
Ralph, an "A+."

429
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:37,456
My Ralph!

430
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:40,702
Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.

431
00:35:42,638 --> 00:35:44,037
"A+"!

432
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:23,968
Is there something you want, Ralph?

433
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:27,275
I'm just turning in my theme.

434
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:31,113
Well, you can take your seat now.

435
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:35,350
Take your seat.

436
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:55,471
Come on, you guys.

437
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:03,183
Get in the car. Get in the car.

438
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:07,250
If we don't hurry
we're going to miss all the good trees!

439
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:12,885
<i>My mother was about to make
another brilliant maneuver...</i>

440
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:15,963
<i>in the legendary battle of the lamp.</i>

441
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:20,933
<i>The epic struggle which followed lives
in the folklore of Cleveland Street...</i>

442
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:22,333
<i>to this very day.</i>

443
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:25,202
Don't want to waste electricity.

444
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:27,136
"Don't want to waste electricity."

445
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:29,936
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.

446
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:37,643
You folks looking for a tree?
We got 300 trees.

447
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,985
This is the Christmas tree emporium
of the entire Midwest.

448
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:44,583
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree
than this here tree.

449
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:47,053
This here tree is built to last.

450
00:37:47,162 --> 00:37:48,959
Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.

451
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:54,362
Okay. Now here's a tree.

452
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:56,301
This here is a tree.

453
00:37:56,405 --> 00:38:00,774
- That's a little skimpy in the front.
- Well, you just put it in the corner.

454
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:04,572
- Haven't you got a big tree?
- Hell, this ain't no tree.

455
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:07,514
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.

456
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:12,780
- Wait'll the dogs see that one.
- Don't you think it's a little large?

457
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:16,154
Listen, Christmas only comes
once a year. Why not?

458
00:38:16,558 --> 00:38:18,423
- How much?
- I'll knock off $2...

459
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,620
because I can see you're a man
who knows his trees.

460
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:24,096
This isn't one of those trees
that all the needles falls off, is it?

461
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,894
No, that's them balsams.

462
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:28,697
<i>The old man loved bargaining
as much as an Arab trader...</i>

463
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:30,500
<i>and he was twice as shrewd.</i>

464
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:32,972
You know, Dew Lock just bought
one of those brand new...

465
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:35,270
green plastic trees.

466
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:38,906
Darn thing looks like it was made out of...

467
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:41,448
green pipe cleaners.

468
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:44,177
This is a very nice tree.

469
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:46,787
I'll throw in some rope
and tie it to your car for you.

470
00:38:46,855 --> 00:38:48,322
You got a deal.

471
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:49,354
Deal.

472
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:10,939
Damn it. Blow out!

473
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:20,946
Not again.

474
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:23,590
Four minutes!

475
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:25,183
Time me.

476
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:28,159
<i>Actually, my old man loved it.</i>

477
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:31,562
<i>He always saw himself in the pits
at the Indianapolis Speedway...</i>

478
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:32,656
<i>in the 500.</i>

479
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:40,641
<i>My old man's spare tires
were actually only tires...</i>

480
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:41,903
<i>in the academic sense.</i>

481
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:44,671
<i>They were round.
They had once been made of rubber.</i>

482
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:52,212
Ralphie, why don't you
go help your father?

483
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:54,281
- Really? Can I?
- Yes.

484
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,758
- Watch the traffic, there.
- Okay.

485
00:39:57,593 --> 00:40:00,118
<i>It was the first time that
it had been suggested that...</i>

486
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:02,561
<i>I go help my father with anything.</i>

487
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:09,465
- What are you doing here?
- Mom says I should help.

488
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:13,666
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.

489
00:40:14,543 --> 00:40:15,840
Yeah, that's it.

490
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:17,841
Here. Hold this.

491
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:25,009
No, not that way.
Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.

492
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:26,019
- How?
- Like this.

493
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:27,988
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.

494
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:31,048
There's four of them. And we got it!

495
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:34,894
There it is.

496
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,327
That son of a gun.
I'm gonna get that dirty...

497
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:39,564
There we go.

498
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:43,135
<i>For one brief moment
I saw all the bolts silhouetted...</i>

499
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:45,730
<i>against the lights of the traffic.
And then they were gone.</i>

500
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:52,605
Oh, fudge!

501
00:40:53,315 --> 00:40:55,215
<i>Only I didn't say "fudge."</i>

502
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,148
<i>I said the word.</i>

503
00:40:57,352 --> 00:41:00,583
<i>The big one.
The queen mother of dirty words.</i>

504
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:03,323
<i>The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.</i>

505
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:05,292
What did you say?

506
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,926
That's what I thought you said.

507
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:15,199
Get in the car.

508
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:19,130
Go on.

509
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:21,472
<i>It was all over. I was dead.</i>

510
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,338
<i>What would it be?
The guillotine? Hanging?</i>

511
00:41:24,413 --> 00:41:27,314
<i>The chair? The rack?
The Chinese water torture?</i>

512
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:31,809
<i>Mere child's play
compared to what surely awaited me.</i>

513
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:36,920
Everything go all right?

514
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,335
Eight minutes.

515
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:58,977
- Do you know what your son just said?
- No. What?

516
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:02,013
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!

517
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:06,415
Ralphie!

518
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:11,425
<i>Over the years,
I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.</i>

519
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:15,725
<i>My personal preference is for Lux,
but I found Palmolive had a nice...</i>

520
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:17,991
<i>piquant, after-dinner flavor.</i>

521
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:21,593
<i>Heady, but with just a touch
of mellow smoothness.</i>

522
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:27,407
<i>Lifebuoy, on the other hand...</i>

523
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:31,276
You ready to tell me?

524
00:42:35,984 --> 00:42:38,544
All right. Where did you hear that word?

525
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,622
<i>Now I had heard that word at least
10 times a day from my old man.</i>

526
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,089
<i>My father worked in profanity the way...</i>

527
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:47,627
<i>other artists might work in oils or clay.</i>

528
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:50,425
<i>It was his true medium. A master.</i>

529
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,899
<i>But I chickened out. And I blurted out...</i>

530
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:55,036
<i>the first name that came to mind.</i>

531
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,365
Schwartz!

532
00:42:58,073 --> 00:42:59,665
I see.

533
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:13,920
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.

534
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:17,914
Mrs. Schwartz,
do you know what Ralph just said?

535
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:20,695
No.

536
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:22,487
He said...

537
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:25,990
<i>Not that!</i>

538
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:27,463
Yes, that.

539
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:30,572
<i>- Do you know where he heard it?
- Probably from his father.</i>

540
00:43:30,672 --> 00:43:33,163
No! He heard it from your son!

541
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:34,230
<i>What?</i>

542
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:43,579
<i>What'd I do, Mom?</i>

543
00:43:44,353 --> 00:43:46,321
<i>Why? I didn't do nothing!</i>

544
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,023
<i>Another shot of mysterious,
inexorable, official justice.</i>

545
00:43:55,597 --> 00:44:00,364
Rinse out and go to bed.
Am I glad you finished your homework!

546
00:44:00,535 --> 00:44:03,470
Get right into bed,
and I don't want to see any lights on.

547
00:44:03,538 --> 00:44:06,507
You are being punished,
so no comic book reading!

548
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:08,599
I'll come in, and if any lights are on...

549
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,611
Don't you give me that look!
You're gonna get it!

550
00:44:33,368 --> 00:44:36,132
<i>Three blocks away,
Schwartz was getting his.</i>

551
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:40,173
<i>There has never been a kid
who didn't believe...</i>

552
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:44,243
<i>vaguely but insistently,
that he would be stricken blind...</i>

553
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:48,213
<i>before he reached 21.
And then they'd be sorry.</i>

554
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:00,791
Why, it's Ralph!

555
00:45:01,663 --> 00:45:04,894
Well, come on in, Ralph.
Where've you been?

556
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:11,236
Why, he's carrying a cane!

557
00:45:11,306 --> 00:45:12,796
What is it, Ralph? What happened?

558
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:14,739
Why, he's blind!

559
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,641
Blind? Oh, my God!

560
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:21,442
Ralph, is it something we did?

561
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,383
What brought you to this lonely state?

562
00:45:25,687 --> 00:45:28,622
Ralph, please tell us no matter
how it hurts. What did we do?

563
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:31,254
Look, I can't.

564
00:45:31,326 --> 00:45:33,226
Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.

565
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:35,362
What brought you to this?

566
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:47,034
Soap poisoning.

567
00:45:54,049 --> 00:45:56,244
Oh, how could we do it?

568
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:59,978
I'll manage to get along, somehow.

569
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:03,390
- I'll never forgive myself.
- Thanks, Mom.

570
00:46:03,558 --> 00:46:06,152
I told you not to use Lifebuoy.

571
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:09,026
I feel awful!

572
00:46:34,055 --> 00:46:34,919
Thank you, Heather.

573
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,787
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

574
00:46:37,592 --> 00:46:38,388
Thank you, Flick.

575
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,584
Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.

576
00:47:05,654 --> 00:47:08,680
I just thought that you'd be getting tired
of the same old stuff.

577
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,055
<i>Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.</i>

578
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:14,653
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.

579
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:21,898
Merry Christmas.

580
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:25,901
Happy New Year.

581
00:47:28,743 --> 00:47:30,802
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

582
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:57,462
<i>The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine,
in order to get...</i>

583
00:47:57,572 --> 00:48:01,008
<i>the Ovaltine inner seal to send off
for my Little Orphan Annie...</i>

584
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:04,603
<i>secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.</i>

585
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,076
I got it. "Master Ralph Parker."

586
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:09,878
My decoder pen!

587
00:48:14,256 --> 00:48:15,723
All right!

588
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:23,862
"Be it known to all
that Ralph Parker is hereby appointed...

589
00:48:23,932 --> 00:48:26,696
"a member of
the Little Orphan Annie secret circle and...

590
00:48:26,768 --> 00:48:29,669
"is entitled to all the honors
and benefits occurring thereto."

591
00:48:30,205 --> 00:48:32,332
<i>Signed, Little Orphan Annie.</i>

592
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:34,940
<i>Countersigned, Pierre Andre!</i>

593
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,607
<i>In ink!</i>

594
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:40,339
<i>Honors and benefits.
Already at the age of nine.</i>

595
00:48:46,187 --> 00:48:47,518
<i>Come on. Let's get on with it.</i>

596
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:50,558
<i>I don't need all that jazz
about smugglers and pirates.</i>

597
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:54,153
<i>Listen tomorrow night
for the concluding adventure of...</i>

598
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:57,254
<i>The Black Pirate Ship. Now it's time...</i>

599
00:48:57,399 --> 00:49:01,460
<i>for Annie's secret message
for you members of the secret circle.</i>

600
00:49:02,237 --> 00:49:04,330
<i>Remember, kids, only members of...</i>

601
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:08,467
<i>Annie's secret circle
can decode Annie's secret message.</i>

602
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:11,771
<i>Remember, Annie is depending on you.</i>

603
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:14,875
<i>Set your pins to B-2.</i>

604
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,377
<i>Here is the message.</i>

605
00:49:17,652 --> 00:49:19,017
<i>12. 11. 2...</i>

606
00:49:19,087 --> 00:49:21,555
<i>I am in my first secret meeting.</i>

607
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:24,387
<i>...25. 14. 11. 18.</i>

608
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,222
<i>16. 23...</i>

609
00:49:26,294 --> 00:49:27,989
<i>Pierre was in great voice tonight.</i>

610
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:31,829
<i>I could tell that tonight's message
was really important.</i>

611
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:33,291
<i>...3. 25.</i>

612
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:37,565
<i>That's a message from Annie herself.
Remember, don't tell anyone.</i>

613
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:44,345
<i>Ninety seconds later
I'm in the only room in the house...</i>

614
00:49:44,412 --> 00:49:47,711
<i>where a boy of nine can sit in privacy
and decode.</i>

615
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:52,778
<i>Ah! "B." I went to the next.</i>

616
00:49:53,788 --> 00:49:56,416
<i>"E." The first word is "be"!</i>

617
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:59,985
<i>"S." It was coming easier now. "U."</i>

618
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:04,390
Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.

619
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:06,795
I'll be right down, Ma.

620
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:08,300
Gee whiz.

621
00:50:10,805 --> 00:50:12,898
"T.O."

622
00:50:13,942 --> 00:50:16,342
<i>"Be sure to." Be sure to what?</i>

623
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:19,174
<i>What was Little Orphan Annie
trying to say? Be sure to what?</i>

624
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:22,373
Ralphie! Randy has got to go!
Will you please come out?

625
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,180
All right, Ma! I'll be right out!

626
00:50:25,553 --> 00:50:27,020
<i>I was getting closer now.</i>

627
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:30,091
<i>The tension was terrible. What was it?</i>

628
00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:32,388
<i>The fate of the planet
may hang in the balance.</i>

629
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:34,986
Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!

630
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,558
I'll be right out, for crying out loud!

631
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:41,663
<i>Almost there! My fingers flew.</i>

632
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,431
<i>My mind was a steel trap.</i>

633
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:44,937
<i>Every pore vibrated.</i>

634
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,001
<i>It was almost clear.</i>

635
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:48,199
<i>Yes!</i>

636
00:50:55,383 --> 00:50:56,611
Ovaltine?

637
00:51:00,355 --> 00:51:02,084
A crummy commercial?

638
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:06,250
Son of a bitch!

639
00:51:08,496 --> 00:51:10,987
<i>I went out to face the world again.</i>

640
00:51:11,132 --> 00:51:12,565
<i>Wiser.</i>

641
00:51:25,513 --> 00:51:26,980
Red cabbage?

642
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:30,017
No, that's for tomorrow night.
You love red cabbage, Ralphie.

643
00:51:31,953 --> 00:51:33,921
You filthy system!

644
00:51:33,988 --> 00:51:35,649
I hate it!

645
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:38,452
Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!

646
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:51,537
<i>What happened next
was a family controversy for years.</i>

647
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:09,582
What was that? What happened?

648
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:15,261
What happened?

649
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,520
What broke?

650
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:19,562
I don't know what happened.

651
00:52:19,634 --> 00:52:21,898
I was watering my plant and...

652
00:52:23,204 --> 00:52:24,967
I broke your lamp.

653
00:52:40,155 --> 00:52:41,816
Don't you touch that!

654
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:44,951
You were always jealous of this lamp.

655
00:52:45,693 --> 00:52:47,160
Jealous of a plastic leg?

656
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:48,422
Jealous!

657
00:52:48,596 --> 00:52:50,826
Jealous because I won.

658
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:54,224
That's ridiculous! Jealous?

659
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:55,495
Jealous of what?

660
00:52:56,738 --> 00:52:58,035
That is...

661
00:52:58,106 --> 00:53:02,065
the ugliest lamp
I have ever seen in my entire life!

662
00:53:02,443 --> 00:53:04,001
<i>Now it was out.</i>

663
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:05,709
Get the glue.

664
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:08,545
We're out of glue.

665
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:15,186
You used up all the glue on purpose!

666
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:19,425
<i>The old man stood quivering with fury...</i>

667
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:21,961
<i>stammering as he tried
to come up with a real crusher.</i>

668
00:53:22,363 --> 00:53:23,625
<i>All he got out was:</i>

669
00:53:23,698 --> 00:53:24,995
Not a finger!

670
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,970
<i>With as much dignity as he could muster...</i>

671
00:54:08,076 --> 00:54:10,636
<i>the old man gathered up the sad remains...</i>

672
00:54:10,745 --> 00:54:13,270
<i>of his shattered major award.</i>

673
00:54:14,148 --> 00:54:16,946
<i>Later that night, alone in the backyard...</i>

674
00:54:17,352 --> 00:54:19,183
<i>he buried it next to the garage.</i>

675
00:54:19,787 --> 00:54:21,448
<i>Now I could never be sure...</i>

676
00:54:21,923 --> 00:54:25,518
<i>but I thought that I heard
the sound of taps being played...</i>

677
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:27,089
<i>gently.</i>

678
00:54:27,495 --> 00:54:29,224
Know what I'm getting my old man
for Christmas?

679
00:54:29,297 --> 00:54:31,094
- What?
- A rose that squirts.

680
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:33,224
People come to smell it, it squirts them.

681
00:54:33,401 --> 00:54:36,928
- I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.
- A Flit gun?

682
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:41,435
Stop right there!

683
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:45,579
<i>Ordinarily, if Dill so much as
said "hi" to you, you felt great...</i>

684
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,607
<i>warm inside.
But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.</i>

685
00:54:49,884 --> 00:54:52,546
I can't now, Grover.
I've gotta go see Miss Shields.

686
00:54:52,887 --> 00:54:55,788
Hey, come here! Get over here!

687
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:58,158
Come on, you! Hey, come here!

688
00:54:59,661 --> 00:55:00,593
You! Come here!

689
00:55:00,828 --> 00:55:01,556
Who, me?

690
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:04,697
- No, your Aunt Tilly.
- Yeah, you. Get over here!

691
00:55:04,899 --> 00:55:07,891
<i>I left Flick to certain annihilation.</i>

692
00:55:08,936 --> 00:55:11,427
<i>But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.</i>

693
00:55:11,906 --> 00:55:13,874
Uncle! Uncle!

694
00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:19,870
All right, class.

695
00:55:20,315 --> 00:55:22,909
I have your Christmas themes for you.

696
00:55:23,951 --> 00:55:25,316
I'm pleased.

697
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,115
In general, you did very well.

698
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:34,819
However, I was disappointed
in the margins.

699
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:39,057
<i>This is it.</i>

700
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:42,630
<i>"C+"? No, it can't be.</i>

701
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:44,470
C+?

702
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,664
C+!

703
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:55,677
<i>Oh, no!</i>

704
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:58,512
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out"?</i>

705
00:56:00,855 --> 00:56:02,823
<i>My mother
must have gotten to Miss Shields.</i>

706
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,582
<i>There could be no other explanation.</i>

707
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:08,989
You'll shoot your eye out.
You'll shoot your eye out.

708
00:56:11,566 --> 00:56:15,297
<i>Was there no end to this conspiracy
of irrational prejudice...</i>

709
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,668
<i>against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?</i>

710
00:56:17,872 --> 00:56:22,070
These multiplication questions
were most missed in our last math test.

711
00:56:22,176 --> 00:56:23,734
Would you answer in unison, please?

712
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:26,946
<i>I was surrounded by happier kids
who were all going to get...</i>

713
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:28,606
<i>what they wanted for Christmas.</i>

714
00:56:28,983 --> 00:56:30,211
...fifty-six.

715
00:57:00,882 --> 00:57:02,406
Hey, four-eyes!

716
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:05,043
How'd you like your snowball sandwich?

717
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,711
Maybe you'd like another one!

718
00:57:13,261 --> 00:57:14,250
Listen, jerk.

719
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,794
When I tell you to come, you better come!

720
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,468
What? Are you going to cry now?

721
00:57:21,669 --> 00:57:25,435
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.

722
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:27,297
Cry!

723
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:29,239
<i>Deep in the recesses of my brain...</i>

724
00:57:29,377 --> 00:57:32,744
<i>a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.</i>

725
00:57:46,494 --> 00:57:47,620
<i>Something had happened.</i>

726
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:51,788
<i>A fuse blew
and I had gone out of my skull.</i>

727
00:58:00,908 --> 00:58:03,342
I'm telling my dad!

728
00:58:04,745 --> 00:58:06,838
Hey, Ralphie!

729
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:15,815
Beat him up! Beat him up!

730
00:58:30,304 --> 00:58:32,568
Did you hear what he said?

731
00:58:37,178 --> 00:58:39,612
<i>I have since heard of people under...</i>

732
00:58:39,714 --> 00:58:43,377
<i>extreme duress speaking
in strange tongues.</i>

733
00:58:43,684 --> 00:58:47,142
<i>I became conscious
that a steady torrent of obscenities...</i>

734
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:51,621
<i>and swearing of all kinds
was pouring out of me as I screamed.</i>

735
00:59:00,468 --> 00:59:02,026
Ralphie!

736
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,785
We're going home. Come on.

737
00:59:39,907 --> 00:59:42,876
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.

738
00:59:47,381 --> 00:59:48,814
Put your head down in here.

739
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,411
Come on, get down in here.

740
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,078
Settle down.

741
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:00,121
I want you to go in there
and lie down in your room for a while.

742
01:00:01,228 --> 01:00:03,355
Ralphie, just settle down.

743
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:08,831
Here, dry off.

744
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,038
All right, calm down.

745
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,606
All right. Now go lie down.

746
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:35,921
<i>The light was getting purple
and soft outside.</i>

747
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:38,896
<i>Almost time for my father
to come home from work.</i>

748
01:00:59,286 --> 01:01:00,878
What's the matter? What you crying for?

749
01:01:01,856 --> 01:01:04,290
Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.

750
01:01:04,892 --> 01:01:06,359
No, he's not.

751
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:07,859
Yes, he is, too.

752
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:09,520
No, he's not.

753
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:13,828
I promise you
Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.

754
01:01:14,702 --> 01:01:16,226
Why don't you come on out of there?

755
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:20,967
Would you like some milk?

756
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:24,572
You would?

757
01:01:31,218 --> 01:01:32,412
Here you go.

758
01:01:33,754 --> 01:01:34,778
All right?

759
01:01:35,489 --> 01:01:38,219
I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.

760
01:01:50,538 --> 01:01:54,201
<i>I heard the car roar up the driveway,
and a wave of terror broke over me.</i>

761
01:01:54,442 --> 01:01:57,468
<i>He'll know what I said,
the awful things that I said.</i>

762
01:01:57,712 --> 01:01:59,509
Get out of here!

763
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:03,446
Go on home, you mangy mutts.
Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...

764
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:04,446
Hey, Bumpus!

765
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:06,986
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!

766
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:11,149
Hey, come on, what's for dinner?
I'm starving to death.

767
01:02:31,045 --> 01:02:33,673
Well, what happened today?

768
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:35,712
Where's your glasses?

769
01:02:37,151 --> 01:02:38,812
Did you lose your glasses again?

770
01:02:39,186 --> 01:02:40,118
Ralphie.

771
01:02:40,454 --> 01:02:43,548
Remember, you left these
on the radio again.

772
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:46,624
Now try not to do that anymore.

773
01:02:47,661 --> 01:02:49,219
So what else happened today?

774
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:52,130
Nothing much.

775
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,664
Ralphie had a fight.

776
01:02:54,468 --> 01:02:55,230
A fight?

777
01:02:55,436 --> 01:02:56,767
What kind of a fight?

778
01:02:59,206 --> 01:03:01,265
You know how boys are.

779
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,810
I gave him a talking to.

780
01:03:06,213 --> 01:03:09,580
I see that the Bears
are playing Green Bay on Sunday.

781
01:03:11,452 --> 01:03:12,214
Oh, yeah.

782
01:03:12,386 --> 01:03:14,411
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.

783
01:03:14,722 --> 01:03:16,622
He'll freeze his keister off out there.

784
01:03:19,693 --> 01:03:23,185
<i>I slowly began to realize
I was not about to be destroyed.</i>

785
01:03:23,564 --> 01:03:25,031
The Chicago Bears.

786
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:27,123
The terror of the midway.

787
01:03:28,102 --> 01:03:31,594
<i>From then on, things were different
between me and my mother.</i>

788
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:36,934
More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.

789
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:38,237
But Bears, never.

790
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:41,203
<i>Strange.</i>

791
01:03:41,482 --> 01:03:45,213
<i>Even something as monumental
as "The Scut Farkus Affair"...</i>

792
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:46,976
<i>as it came to be known...</i>

793
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:49,748
<i>was pushed out of my mind
as I struggled for a way out...</i>

794
01:03:49,824 --> 01:03:52,657
<i>of the impenetrable BB gun web...</i>

795
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:54,785
<i>in which my mother had me trapped.</i>

796
01:03:55,129 --> 01:03:56,221
Santa!

797
01:03:56,931 --> 01:03:58,660
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.

798
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:01,027
<i>Of course! Santa.</i>

799
01:04:01,335 --> 01:04:03,394
<i>The big man. The head honcho.</i>

800
01:04:03,637 --> 01:04:04,865
<i>The connection.</i>

801
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:07,733
<i>My mother had slipped up this time.</i>

802
01:04:29,897 --> 01:04:31,524
Mickey!

803
01:04:48,582 --> 01:04:51,142
The store's going to close soon
and Santa will be gone.

804
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:55,245
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.
Just be still!

805
01:05:04,899 --> 01:05:07,333
Mom, this is just
the same old dumb parade as last year.

806
01:05:07,434 --> 01:05:10,631
- Ralphie, will you please calm down.
- Mom--

807
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:12,665
- Hush!
- Shut up, Ralphie!

808
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:23,079
There he is!

809
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:25,311
Santa!

810
01:05:32,626 --> 01:05:35,117
Have you been a good boy? Have you?

811
01:05:35,262 --> 01:05:38,095
- Can we go now? Can we go?
- Yes, we can go now.

812
01:05:38,232 --> 01:05:40,427
Come on, Ralphie.

813
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,172
Merry Christmas!

814
01:05:56,884 --> 01:05:59,250
Come on, Randy, hurry up.

815
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:14,561
Ralphie, look over there.

816
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:17,661
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.

817
01:06:17,738 --> 01:06:20,605
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him.
We'll see you later, okay?

818
01:06:20,674 --> 01:06:23,837
Stay together, you hear?
And don't get lost.

819
01:06:27,414 --> 01:06:28,506
Come on.

820
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:30,116
Let's go.

821
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,647
Young man.

822
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:35,948
Hey, kid.

823
01:06:36,323 --> 01:06:39,884
- Just where do you think you're going?
- We're going up to see Santa.

824
01:06:40,728 --> 01:06:43,526
The line ends here. It begins there.

825
01:06:43,964 --> 01:06:45,659
Merry Christmas!

826
01:06:45,866 --> 01:06:48,960
Come on, come up, boys and girls.
Hurry up.

827
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:56,308
Come on.

828
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:05,015
<i>The line waiting to see Santa stretched
all the way back to Terre Haute!</i>

829
01:07:05,652 --> 01:07:07,552
<i>And I was at the end of it.</i>

830
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,949
I like Santa.

831
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:18,525
<i>Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers.</i>

832
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:23,627
<i>Moments before zero hour,
it did not pay to take chances.</i>

833
01:07:24,571 --> 01:07:28,701
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.

834
01:07:30,444 --> 01:07:32,002
My pretty...

835
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:34,373
What a tasty little boy.

836
01:07:35,649 --> 01:07:38,550
Don't bother me. I'm thinking.

837
01:07:42,956 --> 01:07:45,083
<i>I like The Wizard of Oz.</i>

838
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:50,296
I like the Tin Man.

839
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:58,597
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute
past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.

840
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,299
Come on up on Santa's lap.

841
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:06,846
There's a wet one.
And what's your name, little boy?

842
01:08:07,047 --> 01:08:08,036
Billy.

843
01:08:08,115 --> 01:08:09,309
Come on, Randy.

844
01:08:10,884 --> 01:08:14,081
And what do you want for Christmas,
Billy? A toy truck?

845
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:16,122
Get him off my lap.

846
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:18,053
Quick, get me a towel.

847
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:27,892
I hate the smell of tapioca.

848
01:08:29,436 --> 01:08:32,872
<i>Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00
and our store is closing.</i>

849
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:36,208
<i>9:00! Great Scott!
The store is gonna close!</i>

850
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:39,838
Santa can't wait all night.

851
01:08:40,414 --> 01:08:42,507
Come on up on Santa's lap.

852
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:53,418
Get moving, kid.

853
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:56,456
Quit dragging your feet.

854
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:11,134
Get him out of here.

855
01:09:21,855 --> 01:09:23,618
Come on, kid.

856
01:09:29,696 --> 01:09:32,187
Come on up.

857
01:09:42,543 --> 01:09:46,035
And what's your name, little boy?

858
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,616
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!

859
01:09:52,653 --> 01:09:57,317
Listen, little boy, we got
a lot of people waiting here, so get going!

860
01:09:59,526 --> 01:10:02,495
What do you want for Christmas,
little boy?

861
01:10:02,863 --> 01:10:04,956
<i>My mind had gone blank.</i>

862
01:10:05,098 --> 01:10:07,328
<i>Frantically I tried to remember
what it was I wanted.</i>

863
01:10:07,401 --> 01:10:08,959
<i>I was blowing it, blowing it.</i>

864
01:10:12,005 --> 01:10:15,065
How about a nice football?

865
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:18,201
<i>Football. What's a football?</i>

866
01:10:18,912 --> 01:10:21,039
<i>Without conscious will,
my voice squeaked out:</i>

867
01:10:21,148 --> 01:10:22,376
Football.

868
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,508
Okay, get him out of here.

869
01:10:25,052 --> 01:10:28,385
<i>A football! Oh, no. What was I doing?</i>

870
01:10:28,455 --> 01:10:30,821
<i>Wake up, stupid, wake up!</i>

871
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:41,726
I want an official Red Ryder
carbine-action 200-shot...

872
01:10:41,835 --> 01:10:42,893
range model air rifle.

873
01:10:44,972 --> 01:10:46,667
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

874
01:10:48,408 --> 01:10:50,205
Merry Christmas.

875
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:07,723
I'll see you in Oz, folks.

876
01:11:16,303 --> 01:11:18,271
Well, did you see Santa Claus?

877
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:21,273
Did you tell him
what you wanted for Christmas?

878
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:25,106
Did he ask you if you'd been
a good boy all year?

879
01:11:25,512 --> 01:11:26,240
No.

880
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,207
Don't worry, he knows.

881
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:31,440
He always knows.

882
01:11:34,221 --> 01:11:36,849
Merry Christmas.

883
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:40,123
Okay, down you go.

884
01:11:40,394 --> 01:11:41,554
Bye, Chris.

885
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:54,203
That's fine.

886
01:11:55,008 --> 01:11:57,568
Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!

887
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:01,106
Well, the green string is out.

888
01:12:01,214 --> 01:12:03,478
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.

889
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,843
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.

890
01:12:05,952 --> 01:12:07,112
I'm not color blind.

891
01:12:07,888 --> 01:12:09,378
I'm not color blind, either.

892
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:14,550
There, see, I told you it was green.

893
01:12:17,064 --> 01:12:19,191
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

894
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,066
Hold it right there!

895
01:12:22,703 --> 01:12:24,466
A fuse is out.

896
01:12:24,971 --> 01:12:28,668
<i>The old man could replace fuses
quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.</i>

897
01:12:28,742 --> 01:12:30,369
<i>He bought them by the gross.</i>

898
01:12:36,283 --> 01:12:38,012
Oh, Ralph.

899
01:12:38,318 --> 01:12:40,684
My, isn't that pretty?

900
01:12:40,854 --> 01:12:42,151
That son of a gun.

901
01:12:44,124 --> 01:12:45,318
Yeah. No.

902
01:12:45,459 --> 01:12:47,120
That star is crooked.

903
01:12:47,394 --> 01:12:49,328
That star is perfectly straight.

904
01:12:51,832 --> 01:12:53,925
- Oh, you've got to be careful.
- I am.

905
01:12:56,636 --> 01:12:59,764
It's just... Let me get it fixed.
That's all right.

906
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:07,370
Perfect.

907
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,081
Oh, goodness, look at the time.

908
01:13:12,152 --> 01:13:14,143
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up
this house...

909
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:17,247
just because some boys
weren't in bed when he came by.

910
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:19,985
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells...

911
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,585
a little while ago,
going up the other side of the street.

912
01:13:23,663 --> 01:13:24,994
All right, you two, upstairs.

913
01:13:26,133 --> 01:13:28,158
Go on the double, on the double.

914
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:40,771
Okay, let's get them.

915
01:14:44,144 --> 01:14:46,203
Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!

916
01:14:56,923 --> 01:14:59,016
<i>Santa Claus had come!</i>

917
01:15:02,596 --> 01:15:04,791
Wow! A truck! That's mine!

918
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:07,595
Wow, look over here! That's mine!

919
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:09,157
What's in here?

920
01:15:09,503 --> 01:15:10,527
It's hard.

921
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:13,931
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!

922
01:15:23,016 --> 01:15:24,313
Does this raise?

923
01:15:39,499 --> 01:15:40,727
Merry Christmas.

924
01:15:42,202 --> 01:15:44,534
Merry Christmas, you two.

925
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:48,034
Randy, no.
Wait for Christmas to start, honey.

926
01:15:48,475 --> 01:15:51,535
- I want to play Santa!
- Well, wait a minute, Randy.

927
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:53,511
He played Santa last year, didn't he?

928
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,007
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.

929
01:15:56,283 --> 01:15:58,217
- Come on, Ralphie.
- Who should I start with?

930
01:15:58,518 --> 01:16:00,816
Well, give Randy a present.

931
01:16:00,921 --> 01:16:05,085
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you
right over there.

932
01:16:05,191 --> 01:16:07,625
She always sends you
such wonderful presents.

933
01:16:07,994 --> 01:16:10,690
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.

934
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:32,075
<i>Christmas had come. Officially.
We plunged into the cornucopia...</i>

935
01:16:32,152 --> 01:16:36,020
<i>quivering with desire
and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.</i>

936
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:37,589
Didn't I get a tie this year?

937
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:48,030
- A zeppelin!
- A can of Simonize.

938
01:16:48,835 --> 01:16:51,998
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?
Show everybody.

939
01:16:57,177 --> 01:16:58,041
I don't want to.

940
01:16:58,645 --> 01:17:01,079
Ralphie, show everybody
what Aunt Clara gave you.

941
01:17:02,015 --> 01:17:04,848
<i>Aunt Clara had for years labored
under the delusion that...</i>

942
01:17:04,918 --> 01:17:09,446
<i>I was not only perpetually four years old,
but also a girl.</i>

943
01:17:09,956 --> 01:17:13,824
She just always gives you
the nicest things, Ralphie.

944
01:17:18,331 --> 01:17:21,129
Oh, isn't that sweet?

945
01:17:21,568 --> 01:17:24,366
- Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you--
- I don't want to!

946
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:26,871
Go upstairs right now
and try on that present!

947
01:17:26,973 --> 01:17:30,340
She went to all that trouble to make it!
Now go on.

948
01:17:38,018 --> 01:17:42,182
While Ralphie is changing,
I'm going to play Santa Claus.

949
01:17:42,255 --> 01:17:43,882
Now, let me see what can I find.

950
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:47,651
I see something! Randy.

951
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:49,657
This is for you, honey.

952
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:52,464
And this is for Daddy.

953
01:17:55,402 --> 01:17:56,096
Here.

954
01:17:56,169 --> 01:17:58,034
From me to you.

955
01:18:00,306 --> 01:18:02,137
Thanks a lot.

956
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:04,772
I wonder what it could be?

957
01:18:05,779 --> 01:18:08,771
Only one way to find out, isn't there?

958
01:18:09,049 --> 01:18:11,244
Well, it's a blue ball!

959
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:14,682
It's a bowling ball.

960
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:16,951
Thank you, darling.

961
01:18:17,057 --> 01:18:20,185
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much. Very much.

962
01:18:20,894 --> 01:18:21,792
Ralphie.

963
01:18:21,995 --> 01:18:24,020
We're waiting.

964
01:18:24,197 --> 01:18:25,755
Oh, come on, Mom.

965
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:27,860
Right now!

966
01:18:37,944 --> 01:18:41,573
<i>Immediately my feet began to sweat
as those two fluffy little bunnies...</i>

967
01:18:41,648 --> 01:18:45,015
<i>with the blue button eyes
stared sappily up at me.</i>

968
01:18:45,752 --> 01:18:48,448
Come down here so I can see you better.

969
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:51,086
<i>I just hoped Flick would never spot them...</i>

970
01:18:51,224 --> 01:18:54,523
<i>as the word of this humiliation
could easily make life...</i>

971
01:18:54,594 --> 01:18:57,427
<i>at Warren G. Harding School
a veritable hell.</i>

972
01:18:59,866 --> 01:19:00,855
Isn't that cute?

973
01:19:01,534 --> 01:19:05,163
That is the most precious thing
I've ever seen in my life.

974
01:19:05,972 --> 01:19:06,870
Shut up, Randy.

975
01:19:07,874 --> 01:19:09,967
He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.

976
01:19:12,178 --> 01:19:13,873
- He does not!
- He does, too.

977
01:19:13,947 --> 01:19:15,642
He looks like a pink nightmare.

978
01:19:16,316 --> 01:19:18,307
Are you happy wearing that?

979
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:19,640
Do you want to take it off?

980
01:19:19,853 --> 01:19:21,081
You tell the kid to take it off.

981
01:19:21,154 --> 01:19:24,123
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
Go on and take it off.

982
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,851
Take it off!

983
01:19:29,462 --> 01:19:31,362
My God, will you look at that mess?

984
01:19:31,765 --> 01:19:34,199
- Who's going to clean the papers up?
- Not me.

985
01:19:35,602 --> 01:19:37,934
- Randy did it last year.
- Well, he can do it again.

986
01:19:40,507 --> 01:19:43,408
You know, this wine is not bad.
It's not good either, but...

987
01:19:43,476 --> 01:19:46,036
- You want a sip?
- No, you don't.

988
01:19:47,514 --> 01:19:48,606
Did you have a nice Christmas?

989
01:19:49,349 --> 01:19:50,316
Yeah, pretty nice.

990
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:51,883
Did you get everything you wanted?

991
01:19:52,852 --> 01:19:55,514
- Well, almost.
- Almost?

992
01:19:55,622 --> 01:19:57,249
Well, that's life.

993
01:19:57,924 --> 01:19:59,619
Well, there's always next Christmas.

994
01:20:02,862 --> 01:20:04,227
That's funny.

995
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:06,928
What's that over there behind the desk?

996
01:20:07,967 --> 01:20:08,899
Where?

997
01:20:08,968 --> 01:20:10,799
Behind the desk,
against the wall over there.

998
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,971
Why don't you go check it out?

999
01:20:31,658 --> 01:20:32,955
What did we put over there, honey?

1000
01:20:34,427 --> 01:20:36,520
Santa Claus probably put it.

1001
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:17,233
<i>Oh, it was beautiful.
I could hardly wait to try it out.</i>

1002
01:21:18,004 --> 01:21:19,665
Do you know how to load it?

1003
01:21:23,109 --> 01:21:24,371
That's right.

1004
01:21:32,051 --> 01:21:32,949
Be careful.

1005
01:21:33,419 --> 01:21:34,852
Don't. They run all over.

1006
01:21:41,694 --> 01:21:42,956
Close her up. Close it up.

1007
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:46,726
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?

1008
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:48,300
- Sure.
- Okay.

1009
01:21:48,768 --> 01:21:49,894
But outside.

1010
01:21:50,003 --> 01:21:51,868
I still say those things are dangerous.

1011
01:21:53,373 --> 01:21:55,967
Put on your galoshes and your coat.
It's cold out.

1012
01:21:59,412 --> 01:22:02,347
I had one when I was eight years old.

1013
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:05,474
What if he hurts himself?
Ralphie, your coat!

1014
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:10,688
- Don't shoot any animals or birds!
- Except the Bumpuses' dogs!

1015
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:14,283
Be careful, Ralphie!

1016
01:22:14,961 --> 01:22:18,055
<i>Now it is well known throughout
the Midwest that the old man...</i>

1017
01:22:18,131 --> 01:22:19,996
<i>is a turkey junkie.</i>

1018
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:25,167
<i>A bona fide garley turkicanus freak.
A few days before Christmas...</i>

1019
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:29,401
<i>his eyes would begin to gleam
with a wild and ravenous light.</i>

1020
01:22:33,379 --> 01:22:37,679
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.

1021
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:53,598
<i>Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!</i>

1022
01:22:53,766 --> 01:22:55,324
<i>You'll shoot your eye out, kid.</i>

1023
01:22:55,802 --> 01:23:00,068
<i>You'll shoot your eye out,
you'll shoot your eye out!</i>

1024
01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:04,204
Ralphie, you be careful out there.
Don't shoot your eye out!

1025
01:23:04,277 --> 01:23:06,336
<i>She hadn't seen! She didn't know!</i>

1026
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:09,574
<i>My eye's all right.
The BB must've hit my glasses.</i>

1027
01:23:10,984 --> 01:23:12,679
<i>My glasses! Oh, no!</i>

1028
01:23:12,752 --> 01:23:14,413
<i>Where are my glasses?</i>

1029
01:23:16,055 --> 01:23:18,819
<i>Few things brought such swift
and terrible retribution...</i>

1030
01:23:18,925 --> 01:23:21,894
<i>on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!</i>

1031
01:23:26,232 --> 01:23:27,494
Stop!

1032
01:23:39,712 --> 01:23:41,179
Oh, no!

1033
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:45,913
<i>Oh, no! Pulverized.</i>

1034
01:23:57,797 --> 01:24:01,961
<i>For a moment I thought, I'll fake it.
They'll never know the lens is gone!</i>

1035
01:24:04,637 --> 01:24:07,470
<i>Randomly, my mind evolved
a spectacular plot.</i>

1036
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:09,834
<i>Let's see, an icicle!</i>

1037
01:24:10,176 --> 01:24:12,542
<i>Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!</i>

1038
01:24:12,879 --> 01:24:17,077
<i>It would work. It had to work.
Quickly, I whipped up some tears.</i>

1039
01:24:23,356 --> 01:24:26,120
What's the matter, honey?
What happened?

1040
01:24:26,192 --> 01:24:27,420
What happened? Let me see that.

1041
01:24:27,493 --> 01:24:31,259
There was this icicle
and it fell off the garage and it hit me.

1042
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:38,866
- What is it?
- No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.

1043
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:44,532
Wake up, Randy.

1044
01:24:49,315 --> 01:24:50,646
Oh, God.

1045
01:24:50,817 --> 01:24:53,877
It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.

1046
01:24:54,387 --> 01:24:58,084
And I tried to get out of the way, but I...

1047
01:25:00,026 --> 01:25:03,928
There, see, it's just a little bump.

1048
01:25:04,297 --> 01:25:05,958
You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.

1049
01:25:06,032 --> 01:25:08,159
Those icicles have been known
to kill people.

1050
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:17,808
- What's going on up there?
- Nothing. We'll be right down.

1051
01:25:18,111 --> 01:25:20,773
You stay away from that turkey!
It's got an hour to cook.

1052
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,040
You'll get worms!

1053
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,710
But what about my glasses?

1054
01:25:29,288 --> 01:25:31,620
You can wear the old ones
with the crack in them...

1055
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:33,522
until we get you some new ones.

1056
01:25:36,362 --> 01:25:38,262
<i>I had pulled it off!</i>

1057
01:25:39,665 --> 01:25:41,530
But I left my gun outside.

1058
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:45,702
When you get dressed
you can go out and get your gun.

1059
01:25:45,905 --> 01:25:47,270
Hold that on there.

1060
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:49,365
<i>Life is like that.</i>

1061
01:25:49,842 --> 01:25:54,779
<i>Sometimes at the height of our reveries,
when our joy is at its zenith...</i>

1062
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:57,782
<i>when all is most right with the world...</i>

1063
01:25:57,917 --> 01:26:01,250
<i>the most unthinkable disasters
descend upon us.</i>

1064
01:26:16,702 --> 01:26:18,260
Oh, turkey!

1065
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:36,316
Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!

1066
01:26:51,537 --> 01:26:55,132
<i>The heavenly aroma still hung heavy
in the house. But it was gone.</i>

1067
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:58,300
<i>All gone. No turkey.
No turkey sandwiches.</i>

1068
01:26:58,377 --> 01:27:02,404
<i>No turkey salad. No turkey gravy,
turkey hash, turkey à la king...</i>

1069
01:27:02,515 --> 01:27:03,812
<i>or gallons of turkey soup.</i>

1070
01:27:03,883 --> 01:27:04,611
<i>Gone.</i>

1071
01:27:04,684 --> 01:27:05,946
<i>All gone.</i>

1072
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:11,579
All right.

1073
01:27:12,058 --> 01:27:12,956
Everybody upstairs.

1074
01:27:13,192 --> 01:27:14,489
Get dressed.

1075
01:27:16,662 --> 01:27:18,152
We are going out to eat.

1076
01:27:42,455 --> 01:27:46,915
No! Not, "ra ra ra ra ra." "La la la la la."

1077
01:27:47,326 --> 01:27:48,122
Sing like this:

1078
01:27:56,569 --> 01:27:58,059
Try again.

1079
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,274
Stop!

1080
01:28:10,049 --> 01:28:11,812
Sing something else.

1081
01:28:25,398 --> 01:28:26,456
No!

1082
01:28:26,532 --> 01:28:27,624
Stop!

1083
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:30,765
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.

1084
01:28:39,912 --> 01:28:41,243
Oh, I'm sorry.

1085
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,744
It's a beautiful duck.

1086
01:28:46,152 --> 01:28:47,813
It really is.

1087
01:28:48,621 --> 01:28:50,248
But you see...

1088
01:28:52,758 --> 01:28:53,554
What?

1089
01:28:53,626 --> 01:28:55,594
It's smiling at me.

1090
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:02,259
Okay?

1091
01:29:03,669 --> 01:29:05,102
Beautiful!

1092
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:10,666
<i>That Christmas would live
in our memories...</i>

1093
01:29:10,776 --> 01:29:14,212
<i>as the Christmas when
we were introduced to Chinese turkey.</i>

1094
01:29:15,648 --> 01:29:17,639
<i>All was right with the world.</i>

1095
01:29:38,604 --> 01:29:40,902
Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.

1096
01:29:41,741 --> 01:29:43,709
Is that beautiful!

1097
01:30:29,655 --> 01:30:33,921
<i>Next to me in the blackness
lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.</i>

1098
01:30:34,693 --> 01:30:37,025
<i>The greatest Christmas gift
I had ever received...</i>

1099
01:30:37,129 --> 01:30:38,562
<i>or would ever receive.</i>

1100
01:30:39,732 --> 01:30:43,395
<i>Gradually, I drifted off to sleep,
pranging ducks on the wing...</i>

1101
01:30:43,469 --> 01:30:45,994
<i>and getting off spectacular hip shots.</i>
